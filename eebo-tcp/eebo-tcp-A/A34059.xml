         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All things are contracted into orders, acts &amp; paragraphs, reduced under three
heads, and this small volume into three parts.</p>
            <p>The first concerning particular actions at law depending between English
men and the Subjects of other nations in forraign Courts of Iustice.</p>
            <p>The second concerning Treaties of common Alliances, and Commerce
between Soveraign Princes and States.</p>
            <p>The third concerning improvement of the trade and navigation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to great Britaign and the Dominions thereof.</p>
            <p>So that every man may take his choice at vacant hours to look into what place his
fancy and disposition leads him to. In the second part there are some Speculations and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
intermixt upon divers select Articles of Peace and common Amity, that
recriminate the actings of some persons, and demonstrate the forgetfullness of others.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had regained his lands and Cities taken from
his Predecessors by the conquests of <hi>Christianus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi>
It was mutually agreed in a publique Treaty that all the Prints and sculptures of
triumphs and trophies, which the <hi>Danes</hi> had in their houses of the former victories
against the <hi>Sweeds</hi> should be brought forth and burnt before the Ratification of
the peace in the open Market-place, under great penalties for any concealments,
that the very thoughts of the <hi>Danish</hi> victories and Triumphs might be razed out
of the peoples remembrance. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have been so unkind towards the
<hi>English</hi> (which so often assisted them) that I cannot omit in this Preface to let
you know how they have published severall books in <hi>Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi>
(yet publickly sold) with impressions of copper Plates and sculptures, many whereof
are sent into all parts of the World, presuming thereby to intail both reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
upon the <hi>English</hi> Nation for ever. <hi>Hornius</hi> the Historian Professor of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
in his Book intituled <hi>Orbis Politicus</hi> written in the year 1668. speaking of
the forces of <hi>England,</hi> saith: <hi>De navali Anglorum Potentia nullum esse du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,

Another <hi>Dutch</hi> Author in his Treatise <hi>de causis Belli Angliae, primi &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi,</hi>

Kingdom.</p>
            <p>A third who hath written an Apendix to <hi>Cluverii Historia Mundi</hi> is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Calumnies upon particular persons and the Nation in Generall.</p>
            <p>A fourth that writes in <hi>French, Le discription Exacte des guerres d' Angliterre</hi>
often Characterizeth the <hi>English</hi> for thievs and Cowards, and mentions a brave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

               </hi> part of <hi>Christendom?</hi> the other 3 (viz) <hi>Germany
France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> allways had due respects for that little world incompassed with the
main Ocean, in regard God and nature had from the beginning designed <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign</hi>
for the soveraignity of the sea. The <hi>seven united Provinces</hi> were not then
in Consideration <hi>(whose Land in the Extent, exceeds not Yorkshire, and
Kent)</hi> that now boast so much over us, Since they have Magnified themselvs by
lessening others, and violating the Laws of Common humanity and gratitude.</p>
            <p>Yet these are the good people, that at all times, when they are pincht, and brought
under any necessity, or interrupted in their trade, call upon the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for help, and cry out to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to stand up for their Religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
against the Enemies of the <hi>Dutch</hi> protestant reformed Church and State: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
at the same time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are in strict leagues and confederacies with
the popish Princes of <hi>Austria and Spain,</hi> and in Combination with the <hi>Jews</hi> and
Pagans to undermine the King of <hi>great Britain</hi> and his Subjects in their trade and
plantations in all quarters of the Earth.</p>
            <p>The old war with <hi>Spain</hi> for Religion is forgotten, interest now Governs the world; and since
trade is become the religion of <hi>Holland,</hi> and money their God, no reason or Conscience
can take place against them in civilactions, where their interest is concerned; and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State the <hi>French</hi> league with <hi>England</hi> against those <hi>Israelites</hi> was cryed down for
a <hi>papisticall design.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the last part with the Observations upon it, there follows the Authors Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisment
and Protest in plain <hi>English</hi> for his dammages, costs and interest; who doubts not
but to find Friends in <hi>England,</hi> that will be friends to Iustice for Iustice sake, and as last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
themselvs that have been so long deceived by others.</p>
            <p>Contracts lawfully made, cannot lawfully be broken; but if a covenant be broken in a
contract, the parties injured are left at liberty, And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are as well obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their treaties with Princes, as they are prompt to break their Covenants with their
Subjects.</p>

his Brother, and <hi>John Moncy</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant, their Brother in
Law, traded in Company to most parts of the world, with a joynt stock,
for the space of 25 years and upwards. In which trade and stock,
<hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> had one half part, and each of the other two a
fourth. Whereupon they took up many great summs of money at interest,
in the city of <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, in his <hi>Majesties Kingdoms,</hi> which
moneys were continued in the hands of the said Partners during their
Lives, as the proper debts of the said Company, which are not paid or

            <p>The cheifest part of the said trade, consisting in Hollands, Dyapers,
Damwsks, and forraign silk Manufactures, there required always
a great stock of moneys and goods to be abroad in the hands of workmen and others, for which
purpose <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Peter Courten</hi> setled himself at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> to correspond with all the Factors,

Courten</hi> and the said <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> were nominated Executors, wherein was also mentioned to be

some years before his death in Expeditions to the Barbados, which he first discovered, fortified, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at his own proper Costs and Charges, and then was taken from him, and his Planters, by force and

another good enterprise with Capt. <hi>John Weddall,</hi> Capt. <hi>Nathanael Montney, Endimion Porter, Thomas

            <p>

upon him the Execution of his Fathers will, notwithstanding the great debts resting upon the Companies

<hi>England</hi> to assist and advise <hi>Mr. Courten</hi> in his affairs, or to intreague him into some actions and accounts
to his own prejudice. Whereupon he lent him the summ of 2111. pounds 18. ss. out of the moneys

which are enjoyed by the Sons and Heyrs of the said <hi>Peter Boudaen.</hi> Notwithstanding the debts
of the Company are yet standing out, and the accounts of the Company still standing open.</p>
            <p>In the said year 1637. <hi>Iohn White</hi> that was a Cashier to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> addressed himself in

was given as aforesaid, as also the like Legacy unto <hi>Susanna her Sister,</hi> whose Estate was gotten into the
hands of the said <hi>Peter Boudaen.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Iohn White</hi> demanding of some Friends, how he should
come by the portion, in case he should marry with the said <hi>Hester; David Goubard,</hi> who was Witness to
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Moncys Will,</hi> and had been a Bookkeeper to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Peter Courten,</hi> advised <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> White</hi> to make a shew of
questioning the said <hi>Will,</hi> and the inventory of <hi>Moncys</hi> Estate, which he did accordingly: then <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daen</hi>
used all means possible to break off the Match, which he could not do: so an Expedient was found
out to pay that Legacy with interest: then the dispute rested <hi>(pro tempore)</hi> without further prosecution.</p>
            <p>

in the said will: but <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> refused to pay the same, pretending that he had none of <hi>Moncys</hi>
Estate in his hands, nor had intermedled with the same as Executor or Administrator, and so not
liable by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to the said Legacy, where the Will was exhibited, and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Courten</hi>
disclaiming the same, affirmed that <hi>Boudaen</hi> was a great debitor to the generall stock and to the Creditors
of the Company, and therefore liable to the debts and Legacies of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Peter Courten</hi> and <hi>Iohn Moncy.</hi>

the said Citation, and insinuation made known unto the said <hi>Boudaen. And Whereas</hi> we are
willing to comply with your Honours desire, so farr as from good Magistrates and Officers may
be required: We accordingly first sent for the said <hi>Peter Boudaen,</hi> who appeared before us, and
we understood from him, in brief, that the said <hi>Moncy</hi> made his last Will &amp; Testament accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the custome of these Countreys, which was confirmed by his death. And that he had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
&amp; appointed in the said Testament <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> &amp; the said <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> to be
his Executors; and that afterwards on the 26. of Iuly 1632. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of the said Will, in the Prerogative-Court, as Executor, and had an Act of Court to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Estate of the said <hi>John Moncy</hi> accordingly: And the said <hi>Boudaen</hi> further declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he never administred, in any manner, the Estate of <hi>John Moncy</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> And for
as much as we do find that this true information given to us doth much impeach the proceedings,
whereupon your Honours Citation &amp; Letters Requisatory, are grounded: <hi>And considering</hi> that
Reason and the Law of Nations expresly dictates, that no Person may or ought to be impleaded,
but before the Iustice to whom he belongs, and under whose jurisdiction he remains; And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
further Inconveniences that might arise, to the disreputation, or prejudice, of either Courts
of Iustice, because <hi>James Boevé</hi> hath a Process before us to the same effect; And to shew that
we esteem nothing better, then to avoid all kind of unlawfulness; <hi>Therefore</hi> we thought fit to
give your Honour notice of our considerations; To the end your Honour might be pleased, to
call back your Letters Requisatory, or to consider the same as void, and to order the said <hi>Hester</hi>
to bring her Action before us, where she ought to do. And we do promise to return the same
Equity to your Honour upon any such or other reasonable demand, as good Friends &amp; Courts of
Iudicature so qualified, ought to do.</p>

by Strangers; who formerly complained to the <hi>Emperour Charles</hi> the

City: whereupon the <hi>Emperour</hi> made an Edict (which is observed to this

born in <hi>Zealand,</hi> who were to make choyce of the Magistrates &amp; Schepens: And that there
should be an Extraordinary Roll, or Out-Land-Vierschare for Strangers onely; Where they
might exhibite their Process, &amp; be heard two days in a week, upon paying double fees, &amp; be dispatcht
in their affairs before Sworn Burgers themselvs, upon the ordinary Roll.</p>
                        <p>This institution at first, was very good, but since corrupted.</p>

and so had such an influence upon the Magistrates and Burgers, that no Execution of
Iustice could be done against him, as by severall presidents hereafter appears.</p>
                        <p>The advantages of <hi>Burgers</hi> are; that they canot be arrested at the first instance; nor sued in
any other Citie of the United Provinces, but before their owne competent Iudges at home; Yet
Strangers lose the Priviledge of <hi>Englishmen</hi> when they become Subjects to another <hi>State;</hi> They put
themselvs out of the protection of their own <hi>Prince</hi> immediately when they swear Allegiance to
another <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> saith, no man can serve two Masters. And the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> never had worse Enemies, then Some of those that left the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to be Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

                        <p>Truth and Justice ought to be prosecuted to the end, in all causes, where any men

               <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> having sent the pretended Will into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nota.</note> to be duely registred, he concluded himself,
and there was afterwards no other Competent Iudge in the world, to determine the validity of that Will
and Testament of <hi>John Moncy,</hi> then the judge of the <hi>Prerogative-Court,</hi> for the time being. The Supream
<hi>Court</hi> of Iudicature at the <hi>Hague</hi> intermedled with that, which was <hi>Coram non judice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The issue was whether <hi>Hester White,</hi> was lawfull Administratrix or not, <hi>Boudaen</hi> was Legally
cited, and after such contempts against a Iudicature in <hi>England,</hi> where he had so long Lived as a <hi>Free

                  </gap>n,</hi> and afterwards during his trade to <hi>England,</hi> injoyed the benefit thereof at the Custom house
and other places, aggravates the offence beyond Measure. And such a president as this is an Earnest of all
<hi>Englishmens</hi> fortunes and Estates, that fall into the hands of the Inhabitants or Burgers of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
&amp; <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> or any other Cities in <hi>Holland</hi> &amp; <hi>Zealand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Process of <hi>Hester White,</hi> was to have an account of the Company stated in the first place, which
ought to have been done for satisfaction of all Persons concerned, <hi>(Englishmen Especially)</hi> many Creditors
of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> and his son cannot find their proper remedy before the accounts of the Company
shall be stated, and for want of that, they are without Relief to this day.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:31298:11"/>
Here <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> is made an Heir to <hi>John Moncy,</hi> which is repugnant to the Law of nature, and
then decreed, that out of the Capitall of his Mother, as her Heir he shall satisfie all Pretenders against
the Estate of <hi>John Moncy;</hi> which is very irrationall: For it is notoriousl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> known, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">rs.</hi> Moncy:</hi>
was a Woman of very small Means, her Former Husband, <hi>Matthias Boudaen</hi> dying insolvent at <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam.</hi>
And <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> had always abandoned his Mothers Estate, untill the Wolf was hunted so
close that he could not make any further Escape. Yet rather then he would prove the Will by Witnesses,
and account or adjust the books of the Company, he procured this impertinent Sentence from the High
Court of Iudicature at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and so would keep the whole Stock of the Company, and other mens
Goods &amp; Moneys in his hands, and let the accounts of the Company stand open, and the debts remain
for ever unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>It is most lamentable, to consider the miserable Conditions, of many Men Women and Children,
that <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> hath occasioned, by his wicked practises. <hi>Sr. Peter Courtens</hi> last Will and Testament
was made at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> on the 8. of <hi>January</hi> 1630. who died the next day following, lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his sole Executor: <hi>John Moncys</hi> last Will &amp; Testament was made on the 16. of <hi>October</hi> 1631. who died
the next day after, and was Buried in the Choor-church at <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> in the vault with <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Peter
Courten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Law &amp; Custom in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> grounded upon good reason and foresight, that
the last Will and Testament of any person, that is not made twenty days before their death, shall be
held null and voyd, which prevents the designs of preists, Fryers &amp; others from great Legacies a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> no Will or Testament is held good, when the party that makes it, hath not strength and

Muddy Air, any intelligible man may conjecture, Especially since <hi>Peter
Boudaen</hi> would not prove <hi>Moncys</hi> Will by Witnesses, there being onely a
mark set in stead of his name to it, who did in his perfect health and sences write
as good and Legible a hand as any man in Europe. But it was his fate to die of
a Lethargie in <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> who was a very active and healthy man in <hi>England,

            <p>It is convenient to shew the Ballance of the Companies books kept in <hi>England,</hi> for the trade in
Company drawing to a Period in the year 1632. There being no more goods after that time sent upon
the Companies account into <hi>England.</hi> The goods formerley sent were not all sold, nor Moneys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received
for them untill the year 1637. When the Ballance of profit and loss was also sent to <hi>Peter Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daen,</hi>
who would not be brought unto any account, (for moving reasons.) <hi>Wherefore in the next following

               <hi>SR. William Courten,</hi> after the death of his partners, was unwilling to commence any
suits at Law against <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> concerning the accounts, and Stock gotten into his
hands. <hi>First,</hi> in regard he would not impeach the credit of the Company, which traded
upon other mens Capitalls. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for that he was incumbred at Court, and in
his new Undertakings to the East-Indies. <hi>Thirdly</hi> and lastly, for that <hi>Peter
Boudaen</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Moncy</hi> his Mother had always made fair promises that the
books in <hi>Zealand</hi> should be liquidated, and repartitions made of the Stock when the
Companies debts should be paid, which are not yet done: But left to the <hi>Six</hi> Sons and
Daughters of <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> unto whom the Land-Pyrate, at his death, left an Estate
in Moneys, Goods, and Lands, to the value of 90000. pounds Sterling <hi>viz</hi> unto
<hi>Peter Boudaen, John, Walter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry, Constantia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Katharine Boudaen</hi>
proportionably unto Each 15000. pounds, before the accounts of the said Company were
stated. Notwithstanding old <hi>Boudaen,</hi> knew that all the visible Estate both Reall
and Personall of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Courten,</hi> and his Son in <hi>England,</hi> was transferred
and sold away towards payment of their own and the Companies debts. <hi>Nevertheless
the remainder of both (amounting to the summ of 146000. pounds Sterling, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Money) continues yet unsatisfied, to the great shame &amp; scandall of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of</hi> Courtens <hi>&amp;</hi> Boudaens, <hi>and dishonour to the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> England <hi>in suffering

            <p>Yet the Hollanders and zealanders are so abominably vitious to report, when any Englishman comes over to call them
to account, that they are <hi>seditious Persons, Desturbers of the peace, Enemies to the Welfare of their Countrey, and Men of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

            <p>It is not onely a vast loss and prejudice to many particular Families in <hi>England,</hi> (to be thus kept out of their Estates) that
have laboured all their lives to get something for their Children, whose bread is eaten by Strangers, but also a loss to the
Kingdom in Generall, that so much of the money and stock of the Nation should be drawn out of the Realm to be improved
against the Crown by a people, that are the worst Enemies thereof.</p>
            <p>But above all these sad circumstances, the grand Concern and Interest, the Honour and reputation of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
will be irrepairably lost if the <hi>Boudaens</hi> and <hi>Pergens</hi> should not be compelled to come to account in this and other Actions,

his heyrs upon account of the Companies stock; as appears in the two foregoing pages; wherein the said debt was to be
discounted; it being the proper Money of the Company that <hi>Boudaen</hi> had gotten into his hands, and so would not
be seen to repay it upon the account of the stock; but got <hi>Pergens</hi> to procure <hi>M. Courten</hi> to give a bond to him as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
debt, which must be discounted when the books are ballanced. Although in stricktnes of Law, that debt should
come in concurrence with other creditors of <hi>M. Courtens</hi> proper account. And the stock of the Company should be
onely applied towards payment of the Companies debts. Noe repartition being to be made before the debts of the

and the <hi>Henry Bonadventura,</hi> and her goods also taken into their possession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Courten,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1647. and 1648.</note> as is pretended, by subsequent bills of sale, assigns his Interest and all the Stock, &amp;c,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to <hi>Jacob Pergens,</hi> who makes Composition for the same in the year 1649. for 85000. gilders.</p>
            <q>The Question propounded is, whether this assignment to <hi>Pergens</hi> be valid, and the
Composition made by him be good or no, or whether the grant to <hi>Littleton,</hi> or
by him and <hi>William Courten</hi> to <hi>Pyndar</hi> be good or no?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>WE</hi> Conceive that both Questions fall into one: For if <hi>Littletons</hi> or <hi>Pyndars</hi> grant be valid,
<hi>Pergens</hi> grant &amp; Composition is void against <hi>Pyndar</hi> &amp; <hi>Littleton,</hi> &amp; so <hi>á converso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Conceive that by the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> there can no doubt be made, but that the
Interest &amp; Property of the ships and Merchandizes in them, are really and effectually conveyed, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
first unto <hi>Sr. Edward Littleton,</hi> and then unto <hi>Sr. Paul Pyndar.</hi> And although it be so done under
certain Conditions or Provisoes and agreements, yet till performance of such Proviso by <hi>Courten</hi> in <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
Case, the Interest remained in <hi>Littleton,</hi> and when that Condition was not performed (as to this day
it is not) the grant became an absolute grant. And <hi>Courten</hi> or his Assignee can never avoid it. And as for
<hi>Pyndars</hi> grant, it is absolutely good, but the person of <hi>Pyndar</hi> is subject after satisfaction made to him of
his debt, to give an Account, and make satisfaction to <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton.</hi> But that power of drawing
<hi>Pyndar</hi> to account no way lessens <hi>Pyndars</hi> right and property; he is perfectly <hi>proprietarius</hi> by the Common
Law of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being a Contract made in <hi>England</hi> by subjects of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and touching their
own Interest, we see not how it can be otherwise interpreted.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Courten</hi> grants his Interest to <hi>Littleton,</hi> it hath no Condition, but that if <hi>Courten</hi> pay the debts
within the time limited, when that time is expired and no payment made, the legall Interest is absolutely
out of <hi>Courten,</hi> and becomes <hi>Pyndars,</hi> not as Assignee of <hi>Courten,</hi> but as Assignee of <hi>Littleton.</hi> Yet 'tis
true that <hi>Pyndar</hi> after satisfaction to him of his debts, was to make satisfaction of the surplusage, but not at
all till such satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Courtens</hi> Assignee can have no more or greater Interest then himself had, nor could transferr any
property to <hi>Pergens,</hi> because he himself had no property in the thing, but onely a possibility and a power to call
<hi>Pyndar</hi> to account for the surplusage after satisfaction of <hi>Pyndars</hi> debt, and not before.</p>
            <p>A Merchant of <hi>London</hi> may sell his goods in his Factors hands at <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> the possession, by the Law
of <hi>England,</hi> goeth with the property. And where the right and property is, there by the Law of <hi>England</hi>
is the possession, unless some other person obtains the actuall possession as a trespasser.</p>

sent into the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> of which the first was confiscated, and the Goods of the other driven
upon the Island <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and part of them saved by the Officers of the Company from whence these
questions doe arise:
<list>
                  <item>1. Whether the Company, notwithstanding the said Contract of the <hi>19<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1642. or insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
protestations &amp; Arrests, might not transact with the said <hi>Courten,</hi> or his Agent <hi>Pergens</hi> for the
summ of 85000. gilders on the <hi>18<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1649. as was actually done?</item>
                  <item>2. Whether the said <hi>Pyndar,</hi> or now his Administrator is not bound to stand to the said agreement made
between the Company and <hi>Jacob Pergens, Courtens</hi> Assignee?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We affirm (under Correction of better judgements) upon the said question, that the Directors of the
said <hi>Company</hi> were free to agree with <hi>Courten</hi> or his Procurator, as by the transaction of the 18<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of
<hi>September</hi> 1649. notwithstanding the insinuation and protestation of the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and the arrest
of the first of <hi>October</hi> aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:31298:15"/>
And consequently that the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> or now his Administrator is bound to acquiesce in the said
agreement made respectively between the said <hi>Pergens,</hi> and the <hi>East-India Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For these reasons, that although the said contract of 19. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1642. was to the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> under
the title of a Bargain and Sale, yet it appears not that there was any delivery of possession given by the
said <hi>Courten</hi> or <hi>Littleton,</hi> to transferr the property of the said Ships and Merchandizes to <hi>Pyndar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, the very expressions of <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton</hi> are, that they are pledged under
a Condition, that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> at the return of the said Ship <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> with the lading should
be paid 3000. <abbr>L</abbr>. And of the said Ship <hi>Bonadventure</hi> 2500. <abbr>L</abbr> Sterling, one half at one Moneth and
the other half at two Moneths after the return and unlading of the said Ships at <hi>London</hi> or elsewhere;
and these payments being made, it shouldbe lawfull for the said <hi>Littleton</hi> to have, hold, and enjoy
all the rest of the said goods in his own possession to the intention which in the said contract is more at
large expressed.</p>
            <p>And it was expresly agreed and declared even between the said parties, (notwithstanding that
they had granted, bargained and sold the said Ships to the said <hi>Pyndar)</hi> that he the said <hi>Pyndar</hi>
should not any ways bear or suffer any loss or Dammage which should happen by reason of Shipwrack
or otherwise. But that these Dammages (if any shall happen) (as the case fell out) were onely to be
born and sustained by the said <hi>Courten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was there granted to <hi>Pyndar</hi> any authority to receive or sell any Merchandize, returns or
lading whereby he might pay the debts he had owing before the said time of payment was expired:
And the said <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton</hi> had not satisfied the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> the said respective summs, and
in case of satisfaction he is bound to render to <hi>Littleton</hi> the surplus and what shall be remaining: And in
case of Ship wrack or any other such like misfortune for the security of the Moneys, the Instruments
or Policies of Assurance were delivered even upon the pretended title of buying (notwithstanding that
in the said Ships were secured 1100. pounds more by the said Policies then they owed <hi>Pyndar:</hi> which
more fully appears by the said Contract.</p>
            <p>That those Obligations and other securities (even amongst those bonds of <hi>Samuel Bonnell,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the said Contract to <hi>Pyndar)</hi> (notwithstanding the pretended Bargain and Sale of the said
Ships &amp; Goods &amp; Merchandize therein mentioned &amp; Policies of Assurances) remained &amp; were detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, for that about the end of the said Contract <hi>Pyndar</hi> covenanted with them in case he should
be satisfied the said debt, that he would deliver the said Bonds and Assurances to <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which things it appears, that although the words of the said Contract say, that <hi>Courten</hi> &amp;
<hi>Littleton</hi> had granted bargained and sold to the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> the said Ships, Merchandize, Proceeds, and
Effects, Policies &amp;c. yet in truth there is nothing else treated of or ingaged by the said Contract then
security to the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> for his great credit given to <hi>Courten:</hi> For even the meaning and intention of
a Contract is more lookt upon then the words:<note place="margin">A l. Iusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam D. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>A: vid &amp; Bald B.</hi> thence ariseth an Argument from the
nature of the Act: For to whom the nature of the Act, to him also the species thereof is granted: It is
the same concerning buying and selling, as in a perfect Contract, the hazard is in the buyer: and
knowing not the species of any Contract, the Grants therein ought to be more lookt after then the bare
words: <hi>A Mantica</hi> teacheth by many examples and illustrates it.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS now the Propriety, Possession, and Administration of the said Ships, Goods and
Merchandize remain in his hands to which before they did belong, and consequently by the Contract
he ought to sustain the Dammage of Shipwrack and other misfortunes, whereupon it was thought
most just that he should have liberty to trade with those. <hi>And because by his Agent he dealt with the said
Company upon more profitable terms then if he should bring his Action against the said Company for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and should receive the Money secured to the value of 5500. <abbr>L</abbr> Sterling:</hi> Whereupon if <hi>Pyndars</hi>
Administrator upon no foundation making composition with the said Company, a Question may arise
especially because the Lords Directors in respect of the Society have and can acknowledge no other as
Owner of the said Ships and Burthen thereof then him who is publiquely so acknowledged to be,
being much recommended by severall Letters, as well from the <hi>Parliament</hi> as the <hi>King of England,</hi>
dated the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1645/6. and the <hi>Ninth</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1647. And that some considerable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first Insinuation from <hi>Ionas Abeels</hi> in his said quality made the 25<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1648. were in
transaction.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As also the Administrator of <hi>Pyndar</hi> now hath so much the less foundation to expound or question the first
agreement, for that the said <hi>Abeels</hi> did not protest by his said Insinuation against the said agreement of
<hi>Courten</hi> or his Agent, but onely against the payment of the Money to any other then to his Master
<hi>S<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. Paul Pyndar.</hi>

take care to detain in the hands of the Directors all that which they (by the very words of the said
arrest) by Liquidation or agreement with the said <hi>Courten</hi> by reason of the said two Ships ought to pay:

action and transport from the said <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton,</hi> did renew the said arrest in the hands

               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>Fourthly</hi> because by the second Insinuation and protest of the <hi>11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> November</hi> 1649. and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
after the transaction made with <hi>Jacob Pergens, Jonas Abeels</hi> again renewed the first Arrests

               <item>5. <hi>Fifthly</hi> (which is greater and beyond all contradiction) because the said <hi>Abeels</hi> in Court instituted his
Process on the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>May</hi> against the said Lords Directors again in his said quality as Agent for

the Directors should acknowledge ordeny <hi>(Bona fide)</hi> the said tripartite Indenture of the <hi>19<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
1642.</hi> And by Consequence that the said Defendants should be condemned according to the
said Insinuations and arrests to pay to him the said Demandant in his said quality and by provision to
deposite 85000. gilders, which they had undertaken to pay for the Dammages and pretences which
<hi>William Courten</hi> and others pretended for the said Ships with interest from the day of the agreement
to the effectuall payment thereof, as more largely appears by the said Instrument, which cause was offered
or brought into judgement on the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1650. in the said quality of <hi>Abeels</hi> against the
Company and left <hi>in Statu.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And the <hi>Lords Directors</hi> at the same time exhibited a petition to be indempnified against the said
<hi>Pergens</hi> in the same Cause: And the same Cause on the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1651. as before was again
brought into judgement, and afterwards brought into the same State as by the said Instruments it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth:
All which things cannot be reputed to be again controverted <hi>as to the said agreement on the
behalf of the said</hi> Pyndar, <hi>and because the Administrator of his Goods by the last agreement made between
the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> England <hi>and these</hi> Provnices <hi>is to be satisfied,</hi> for all whereby the process was freed, (which is
and can be understood concerning the difference before the Judges of the City of <hi>Amsterdam)</hi> by
<hi>Ionas Abeels,</hi> in the name of <hi>Pyndar</hi> to be prosecuted against the Company, so that we find no
cause wherefore or how the Administrator could now bring into question against the Company
the transaction or Agreement made with <hi>Pergens</hi> as the Procurator of <hi>Courten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover that the said <hi>Courten</hi> remained in full possession of the said Ships and Goods laden in
the same. And consequently it appears from them that the altering of the Property and right of the
said Ships was nothing else but a pledge and security for the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> which is put into the Catalogue
of pretences which the pretended set forth <hi>pag.</hi> 2. That <hi>Courten</hi> by his Freinds and Correspondents of
the Company requested the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> that they would Command the Governour of the <hi>Isle
Mauritius</hi> to restore the goods which were saved out of the Ship <hi>Bonadventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for that which is said that another Ship was taken away by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and there forfeited to
the Dammage of <hi>Courten,</hi> and <hi>page</hi> 8. for the accompt of the said <hi>Courten</hi> in the Ship <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi>
that it was laden with <hi>Indian</hi> Merchandize there above expressed to the value of above 5000. <abbr>L</abbr>. Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and because at the time of the Contract made, the Ships were long before sent into the <hi>Indies,</hi>
therefore it cannot be that the possessions of such Merchandize should pass by the said Contract from
<hi>Courten</hi> to <hi>Pyndar:</hi> But he ought to be of the same judgement that the hazard and Dammage which
fell out ought to be charged on <hi>Pyndar,</hi> it agreeing with this Maxime <hi>Quaeque suo Domino pereat,</hi>
whereas it is contrary to the words of the Contract (because as aforesaid) all Dammages and losses
ought to redound onely to <hi>Courten,</hi> wherefore according to the said Rule that every man that sends out,
ought onely to be understood accordingly, which plainly appears in the beginning of the Contract,
where it is said that <hi>Pyndar</hi> was not content with the security of <hi>Bonnell,</hi> and that <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
were well inclined to give him such further security for the payment of the Debt, and although
they say that they did Grant, Bargain and sell the Ships with their Burthen and proceeding, yet (as we
are informed) the Ships did not belong to <hi>Courten</hi> or <hi>Littleton.</hi> And that the Burthen, Wares and
Merchandizes and Policies of Insurance, were of greater value then the debt of <hi>Pyndar</hi> did amount
unto: Also that the Merchandizes at that time could not be valued: And that <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Littleton</hi>
after satisfaction to <hi>Pyndar</hi> out of the Issues of the Ships should receive unto themselvs <hi>Pyndars</hi> Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he kept to be delivered upon payment, being that he was not to be damnified, but that the
Dammage and profit did onely concern <hi>Courten:</hi> Also that the trading in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> was acted
onely in the name of <hi>Courten;</hi> and the name of <hi>Pyndar</hi> (as in fact we are informed) was never therein
known as the Owner of the Ships, so that it is most certain that the said <hi>Pyndar</hi> could not in the said
Contract gain the Right of Propriety to the said Ships and Goods in question: Wherefore it is an abuse
to say that <hi>Pyndar</hi> hath got the reall right for the Sale of the Ships and Goods, which at the time of the
Contract were in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and upon the Isle of <hi>Mauritius</hi> or <hi>Goa</hi> respectively, and afterwards taken
and drove ashore. But allthough this is not to be believed but the contrary hereof may be on urgent
occasions shewed out of the Statutes, and by the Doctors learned in the <hi>English</hi> Laws <hi>A:</hi>

transportation of moveable goods without delivery they give the
reall right in them, yet that cannot be understood of Ships &amp; Goods
out of <hi>England</hi> which cannot be accepted by the Buyer or his Agent,
but remain by voluntary consent in Custody of the first Owner,
because of the necessity of Commerce for the security of Contracts
and avoyding of inevitable and innumerable disputes there is a rule
made amongst many Nations, for moveables have no consequences
<hi>Mobilia non habere sequelam, and that the Customs which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

of Commerce with other Nations: and although an</hi> English-man <hi>doth

said <hi>Courten</hi> should be forfeited to his Creditors (that is nothing to
the purpose) <hi>first</hi> because (as we are informed) the Declaration
where it appears he was Banckrupt was not made before the year
1650: And consequently after the Procuration and Transports; And
that the said Declarations by the Commissioners upon the Statutes
against Banckrupts afterwards made cannot infringe upon that

               <hi>Secondly</hi> because by the said Letters as well of the said <hi>Parliament</hi> as the <hi>King of England,</hi> it appears,
that the said <hi>Courten</hi> at the time aforesaid or thereabouts was acknowledged for the Owner (with whom
the said Company compounded) &amp; for that end recommended the cause of the said <hi>Courten</hi> to the

            <p>All <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> that have perused this Patent (printed in severall Languages) upon Mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
have held the clauses &amp; limitations therein, to be as generous as just, and ought to be a president in
such cases to all future ages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>larendon,</hi> late Lord High <hi>Chancelor</hi> of <hi>England</hi> controverted those two Especiall clauses for continuance in
the patent, severall Months before he gave his <hi>Fiat</hi> &amp; <hi>recepi</hi> for the great Seal. <hi>Sir Robert Wyseman, Sir William Turner,
Sir Ieffery Palmer,</hi> and others of the <hi>Kings</hi> councell learned in the Laws, sufficiently satisfied his Lord PP, that it was
both reasonable and just (in this <hi>Especiall</hi> Case) that the <hi>Patent</hi> should have those <hi>Especiall grants,</hi> to be in full force and
Effect, both in times of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Warr,</hi> untill the parties injured and interessed should be fully satisfied and repaired
their debt and Dammages.</p>
            <p>It is most certain that those grants &amp; Contracts, which are made repugnant to Law and reason, have a Nullity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
as inconsistent to the very being of common right and property (and many times such things have hapned in Treaties
of Alliances between Princes &amp; States.)</p>
            <p>But when any difference &amp; dispute, (concerning <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum)</hi> have passed the Examination of the High Court of
<hi>Admiralty,</hi> Committees of <hi>Paliament, Councell Table,</hi> publique Ministers abroad, and all other Offices of the greatest
trust in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> at home, and even at last reduced to that certainty for satisfaction, by a sacred and judiciall act under
the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> how such a grant can be dissanulled without satisfaction, is a paradox and such a president that
cannot be found in any other age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Especiall Reprisalls</hi> are no breach of peace, being usually granted in times of the Strictest Alliance &amp; Amity between <hi>Princes</hi>
&amp; <hi>States.</hi> Wherefore it was lawfull for the <hi>King</hi> of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to establish such a Grant to his Subjects (in this case) that
should continue untill satisfaction shall be recovered for a Spoil and injury done to his Subjects in times of peace by the
East-India Company of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who confessed the fact, and had by two of their own <hi>Directors</hi> &amp; <hi>Participants</hi>
(Emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssadors in <hi>England)</hi> in the year 1662. concluded and agreed in a publique Treaty of <hi>Alliance</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> that repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
should be forthwith made for the same; But afterwards upon their delays and denyall in the performance of that and
other things, the Lords and Commons in <hi>Parliament</hi> voted to assist his <hi>Majesty</hi> with their lives and fortunes, for generall
<hi>Reprisalls</hi> against the United <hi>Netherlands,</hi> whereupon this Patent for <hi>Especiall Reprisall</hi> followed: Which is such a publique
grant (taken notice of by the contrary parties) that can onely be vacated by a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> when the debt shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
or satisfied by Composition or force, otherwise there would be no security in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless</hi> the <hi>States Generall</hi> do pretend, they having subdued the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> &amp; <hi>Commons</hi> (a
they say) during the treaty at <hi>Breda;</hi> That they are Freed, &amp; acquitted thereby, leaving the debt &amp;
Dammages incumbent upon the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to give satisfaction to the Persons interessed

            <p>Herein appears the greaetst Act of injustice that ever was offered to any Stranger in the like
Case. Although it is well known to all persons that understand the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws of

might arise to delay the Process did pass an act of <hi>Caution</hi> for Costs who was not onely an Inhabitant
of the <hi>Citie</hi> but a <hi>Burger</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> that had his own dwelling house there wherein he was seised in
see to him and his Heirs. Besides <hi>Boudaen</hi> had many thousand pounds of his in Custody at the same time,
and more over <hi>Boudaen</hi> was known by many of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> to be indebted to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">•.</hi> William Courten</hi> for
vast summs of Money, yet they ordered <hi>Boevé</hi> to find other security that were Burgers of the <hi>Citie</hi> that
had fast Goods there: Knowing that <hi>Boudaen</hi> being a <hi>Kiesheer</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (that is one that choseth

We make of those indirect dealings, more especially since it reflects upon our Honour

their Ships (the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry Bonadventure)</hi> were in a trading <hi>Voyage,</hi>
between <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Maccao</hi> violently seized, by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> The loss and Dammages of
which Ships and their lading, and the Consequences thereof to their severall Factories,
and Plantations settled in <hi>China, India,</hi> &amp; <hi>Japan,</hi> by Disappointment of Supplies and
loss of Trade, amounting to one hundred fifty one thousand six hundred &amp; twelve pounds
Sterling; as it appears ratified, and reduced by your <hi>Majesty</hi> under your great Seal of
<hi>England,</hi> in the year 1665. whereby it was granted, and declared, that the said Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
should be reprised in all times of Peace, or Warr, untill the same Debt should be
satisfied, or a Composure made between the said <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Courten</hi> his Assigns, and
all Persons interested and concerned with him and the <hi>East-India Company</hi> of the
<hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee further humbly represent unto your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that in all Treaties &amp; Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of times, the Dammages aforesaid were particularly insisted on for satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> further humbly represent unto your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that in the same Order of <hi>Council,</hi>
there is also referred unto us the Consideration of <hi>Nicholas Warren, Richard West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi>
and <hi>George Torriano</hi> Merchants, who were Owners of the Ship and Goods,
<hi>Ann</hi> &amp; <hi>Margaret,</hi> of which <hi>Charles Saunders</hi> was Master; which in the year 1658.
were laden with Hydes, Bees Wax, and severall other Goods and Merchandizes, and
in her Passage between <hi>Tunis</hi> &amp; <hi>Leghorne</hi> whither she was bound, was set upon by a
Dutch Ship called the <hi>Gelderland, John Jacobson</hi> Commander, severall of her Men
wounded, the Master killed, and the Ship and lading taken and carried away: Which
said Ship and lading, with the loss of her Voyage and Dammages susteined was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Admiralty at thirteen thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> further also humbly represent to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that by the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi>
Anno 1667. all Reparations are extinguished and cut off: Yet since that time the <hi>States
Generall</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have not onely been refractory in the performance of any
Agreement concluded on, but also have committed many violences and Depredations,
whereby they have wholly cancelled the Obligations of all past Treaties &amp; Agreements,
and left your <hi>Majesty</hi> and your Subjects as free in all Iustice, and Equity, as if they never

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was generally observed in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that
her Majestie in all transactions at home and abroad, gave it in
Charge to her Councill, that they should have a care of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
In all Leagues or Treaties of Alliance and Commerce, the
benefits of either side should be reciprocall: but no Nation in the
World have been so industrious of late to undo themselvs as the
English; VVhose Lands &amp; rents are reduced, their staple Goods
and Manufactures undervalued, their Gold and Silver wasted
their trade &amp; Commerce undermined, their Laws &amp; Customs contemned &amp; Violated.
And being Cheated of their Moneys &amp; Merchandizes by their Neighbours in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
traffick, many of his Majesties good Subjects, are made contemptible &amp; pore in the
midst of peace and plenty.</p>
            <p>In all regulations of trade, and Treaties Marine, both parties should have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Considerations of advantage; Yet certainly many mistakes have been committed
in severall ages and revolutions of State in publique Contracts upon the English account,
wherein the Honour and interest of the King and Kingdom were mutually concerned,
which might be regained, most gloriously upon good opertunities. If all <hi>English-men</hi>
had publick spirits, and none would, be so treacherous under a trust, to preferr their own
particular profit, before any nationall concernments.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders upon all occasions of difference and dispute with <hi>England,</hi> doe fly
for refuge to the treaty made between King <hi>Henry the VII.</hi> and <hi>Philip Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
in the Year 1495. long before <hi>Scotland</hi> was united to the Crown, or that the
people of the seven <hi>united Provinces,</hi> had fallen from their naturall <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Houses</hi>
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Austria,</hi> into a Common wealth by incouragments of others. And during
the late war in the Year 1673. the States in all their Declarations and Manifestoes
appealed to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as Umpires between them and the King: one
clause I cannot omit, in regard I find it published in print in their Netherland Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
(viz) <q>VVe the States Generall do hereby in the uprightness of our hearts, and
confidence of our integrity, submit our defence to the Iudgement of the English Nation
in generall, and more especially to the High and Hono<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> 
                  <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> (as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the whole body of the Nation) whom we are not onely willing to make full
Arbitrators of the unhappy differences between the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and us, but should
also account it for the speediest way to a most happy accommadation, if they would take
the pains to make a right distinction between the true interests of the Nation (whom
they represent) and the crafty pretences of evill minded men.</q> Now to meet them again
in their own way cannot be denied us, without prejudice and partiallity.</p>
            <p>VVherefore I have recollected severall Articles out of diverse Treaties of State, upon
which I have briefly discoursed, and made some speculations thereupon, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the third Part, which concerns the improvement of Trade and English
Manufactures, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VVhich if they find a good reception in <hi>England,</hi> I shall make a further progres
in the next Year, to gratifie some Friends at the generall Treaty, where the English
(although they are neither Principalls nor Parties) yet as Lookers on may see how to
hit a blot, or take a point sooner then the Gamesters that plays.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a common saying in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
have gon beyond all other Nations, in trading, treating
and accounting. And that there are three men in the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> all whose names begin with <hi>B.</hi> (viz.) <hi>Beverning, Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen</hi>
and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> that have overreached the seaven Kings
of Europe (viz.) <hi>England, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden,
Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi> There is no generall rule but may have an
Exception, which I doubt not but you will meet in some of the select Articles follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that concern onely Navigation and Commerce. As to other Leagues and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies
(those matters and reasons of State) I meddle not withall; The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are
best able to calculate the Expences of those chargeable offensive and defensive <hi>Alliances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its an <hi>Aphorism</hi> of a very learned Authour, that there be many things usefull to
wise men, which were impossible for any man but a fool to invent, the same fortune
I hope modestly to obtain from my Countreymen that ponder well the observations in
the following treatise. It is possible that Monsr. <hi>Beverning</hi> who is at present the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Plenipotentiarie at <hi>Nimwegen,</hi> and Monsr. <hi>Beuningen</hi> the States Extraordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in <hi>England,</hi> and Monsr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> the Principall Secretary to the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> may understand the interest of their own Countrey with the intreagues of
trade and Exchange, better then many other ministers of State, that have not had so
much Leisure, from their pleasures and recreations to fathom the depth of those
mysteries.</p>

            <p>There is one advantage more that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have above all other Soveraign

of State, who are likewise incorporated as the chiefest in the States Generall. Yel
there may be three good acts &amp; ordinances of Parliament which would shake all those
seaven Principalls, without any stroaks or blows, especially if the two grand Enemies of

The King appeared, so highly for a Soveraign remedy and satisfaction
beyond all other cases whatsoever; that when the States Embassadours Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs
<hi>van Hoorn</hi> and <hi>van Gogh</hi> desired their Credentialls to be gon <hi>re infecta</hi>
in the Moneth of <hi>August</hi> 1662. unless his Majesty would Mortifie and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
the injuries Losses offences and Dammages concerning the said
two Ships <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Bona Adventura. His Majesty</hi> presently
ordered Sr. <hi>William Morice</hi> to prepare the Letters Credentiall for his Royall
Signiture, which was done and signed accordingly, whereupon the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours</hi> desired another conference with the Kings Commissioners, pretending their Masters
had given them further instructions by the last post, to accommodate the difference by an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:
Which was a clause sent by <hi>Iohn de Witt</hi> in Latin to follow after the Mortification of all
other injuries and offences &amp;c. in these Words: <hi>Hoc excepto quod scilicet qui se jacturam passos dicunt in
duabus navibus (viz) bona Esperanza &amp; Bona Adventura, Poterunt Litem inceptam Prosequi.</hi> Which
was a very slight Expedient to be accepted after 15. Moneths vigorous prosecution by memorialls in
the Kings Name for such an injury and offence committed against the Laws of Common Amity.
Whereby the trading voyages of <hi>Courten</hi> and Company to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan</hi> were spoiled; A foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
laid by Patent for an Indian Navigation beyond all enterprizes that ever were undertaken by
one <hi>English</hi> men before Sr. <hi>Wil. Courten</hi> and Company.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being so concluded at <hi>London;</hi> The Kings Ministers both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>
pressed on for an accommodation of that affair according to his <hi>Majesties</hi> intention, but the <hi>East-India
Company of the Netherlands</hi> would not come to any account for spoils <hi>(pro consequentia)</hi> having
for some reasons not onely killed and wounded many of his Majesties Subjects in the <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi>
but disapointed the factories by taking away their goods and embeazling all their books and writings.</p>
            <p>It is provided in the 15. Article that the Commissioners should not meddle with any Dammages or
offences to come after the Treaty was concluded, and also that the progress of all things brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Commissioners and Arbitrators should be carried on in the same manner as it was in the year
1654. who concluded nothing (but <hi>Amboyna)</hi> of the great list of Dammages, so that the <hi>Dutch</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
nothing as they reported at the <hi>Hague</hi> but to outwit the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings Ministers nor any of the persons interessed and injured could get no other answer from
the <hi>States</hi> or the <hi>East-India Company,</hi> but that those <hi>qui se passos dicunt</hi> (although the fact was confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>Poterunt Litem inceptam prosequi</hi> onely for the money; due upon Sr. <hi>Paul Pyndars</hi> assignation
as if there wanted a Treaty of State to impower any <hi>Englishmen</hi> to prosecute the <hi>East-India Company</hi>
at Law in the ordinary course of Justice upon any pretence whatsoever. Then the Creditors and
Proprietors resolved unanimously together that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should not find them Children but
men, and <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that would not be contemned and derided by any Nation in the world, and
would as soon lose their lives as their livelyhoods, Honours or reputations: Wherefore they applyed
themselvs again to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and also complained in <hi>Parliament,</hi> who voted to assist the King in
requiring satisfaction accordingly; afterwards the <hi>Lord Chancelour</hi> desired a conference with some
of the persons interessed to understand the merits of the case. Then <hi>Francis</hi> late <hi>Earl of Shrewsbury</hi>
appeared personally before his Lordship and protested that 2500 <abbr>L</abbr> Sterling all the money left

those Debts of the Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> which have been on the part of <hi>Denmark</hi> confiscated;
but in this sense, That whatever Debts of this kind unto the Tenth Day of <hi>May</hi> Old Stile, and Twentieth New Stile, by
vertue of Confiscation or Reprisals have been by Subjects paid and received, do remain utterly abolished and satisfied;
and that it be not lawful for the Creditors of such Debts for the future to pretend any thing upon this account, much less
to urge payment of such for any reason, or under any pretence whatsoever. But of such Debts, as on the said day have
not been paid and received, it shall be lawful for the Creditors, Subjects of King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to demand
and prosecute the Payment, by the ordinary way of Justice. Excepting nevertheless 120000. Rixdollars, more or
less, (namely accruing from a certain Controversie, which arose between <hi>Christian</hi> the Fourth of most glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,

in most significant words, That no Pretension shall be at any time made, by reason of Ships and Goods so seized, and Debt
or Money lent, in such manner as aforesaid abolished and confiscated; but that all shall on both sides by a Solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
be for ever accounted as null and void: Yet so, that Lands and immoveable Goods be not comprehended in

            <p>And all actions, Suits, and pretences whatsoever, mentioned in the fourth and fifth Articles of the Treaty,
proceeded from the said Injuries, Offences, Dammaget and Losses, and were to be prosecuted in the Kings Name, as
<hi>(Crimen Laesae Majestatis)</hi> Capital Crimes against the Publick Peace.</p>
            <p>But under the notion of those Injuries, Offences, Dammages and Losses for spoils and depredations, cannot be comprehended
any private or particular dealings between Man and Man, nor any Covenants, Obligations, Contracts, or Merchants Accounts
yet the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> would have them applicable to the Generall Words of <hi>all Actions, Suits, and Pretences

            </p>
            <p>It iss against the rules of Iustice and Equity, and all Morall principles to hinder any man the ordinary course of Law in Civill

Iustice and Equity to his party, which remains in his own power to do; when he is convinced, that he hath don him

thereunto by others, for any thing in that great list of Dammages against them mentioned in the 15. <hi>Article of the Treaty</hi> 1662.</p>
            <p>Now as to the 8. Articles, <hi>John de Wit</hi> wanted words to mortifie that speciall action, which remain upon record: Yet he saith,
it ought to be reckoned and comprehended under the Generall Notification and extinguishment, (words never found out before

Charge, nor Council, Tutorship, Curatorship, Receivers or Treasurers, although they be of Customes
and Millions, or other Services which concern our Royal Treasury; and much less they may demand of you any
Loans or Donations, or take from you any Rights, or your Rents, Horses, or Slaves: And to do you the
more favour or grace according to that which is agreed by the said Peace, we do will and promise that you shall and
may deal and trade freely, and sell your Merchandise and Fruits, and buy those of my Realms, and carry them
forth, observing that which is ordained and commanded by the Laws and Statutes which make mention thereof,
and paying to our Royal Treasury the Duties or Customs which ought to be paid; prohibiting, as we do prohibit
and command, not to take from you by force any Merchandises, Wheat, or Barley, although it be for the making
ready or furnishing our Armies, Fleets or Gallions, nor for Purveyors or Stewards; and the Priviledges are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31298:33"/>
to be concerning the Wheat and Barley according to the Tun; and concerning the other things and Merchandises,
as you shal conclude and agree: but they may not take them out of your Possession until they have paid for them,
unless for the same there be leave given / that they do not molest and trouble you. And forasmuch
as many of you do treat to bring into the Ports of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> the City of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and other places, great quantity
of <hi>New Foundland-Fish,</hi> and other sorts of dry and salted Fish, because they are Dictuals which are very necessary;
and that you have been and are put to great Charges, and are much troubled, We do will and command to be kept
the Ordinance of the City of <hi>Sivil,</hi> whereby it is ordained, that those which come in with dry or salted Fish, there
shal not be any Price or Rate set upon them, but they shall be permitted to sell at such a Price as they shall think
good; and it shall not be necessary to manifest them any more then unto our Officers which receive our Royal
Rents: and if the Ships wherein the said Fish is brought be great Ships, that they cannot go up the River, and
that the same be put into Barques or Lighters, the Iudge of the Admiralty nor any other person may not put any
Waiters or Keepers into the Barques or Lighters at the charge of the Owners of them.</p>
            <p>And we do also command, That if the said Fish shall appear to be rotten, and that it cannot be spent, that it be
burnt, or thrown into the Sea; and that for this cause there shall not be any Cause or Action commenced against
the Owners thereof, or persons which shall sell it, nor they shall not be imprisoned, nor informed against. And
forasmuch as the officers of the Customs, and others of divers duties which are received for the Fruits and
Merchandises, do use when any person doth inform, to have the defendant imprisoned which sheweth himself to be
party, whereby happeneth to men of Trade great discrepit, charges and vexations; Our will is, and we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
That in the said Information there shall be onely proceeded against the Merchandises, and not against the
persons; but they shall be permitted (as we do permit them) to make; and they shall make their defences in the said
Vexration. And forasmuch also, as according to an Articles of the said Peace, which maketh mention of matters
in Religion, notwithstanding that in some Suits they should declare whether they be Roman Catholiques or not,
excusing themselvs to give faith to others which they take as parties or as witnesses.</p>
            <p>We do also command, That concerning this matter there he not done, nor there shall not be done, any thing
with those which are born in the said Realm, but onely that the said Condition be kept and accomplished, and that
no such questions be put unto them, giving unto the oaths which they shall take in Iudgement Court, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
the same faith and credit which should be given in case they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and herein you shall not receive any
trouble or molestation nor there shall no grievance be done unto you: And whereas for the justification of some causes,
the Iudges and Iustices do pretend that the Merchants of the said Nation should exhibit Books of their contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or dealings; we do will and command, that the Books of the Merchants of the said Merchants of the said Nation shall not be taken
out of their hands for any cause whatsoever, but they shall keep and shew them in their houses, to take out the part
which shall be appointed, and others shall not be demanded of them, nor there shall not be any other Papers taken
from them, upon penalty that he which shall do here against shall be punished according to Law.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as the Merchants do dispatch the Merchandise from the Custom house of the said City of <hi>Sivil</hi> of
all Duties, and because there are many which do make up a sheet, which is Subscribed and Signed by all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and remaineth in the hand of the <hi>Alcayde</hi> of the Custom-house; for that by vertue thereof, the Merchandises
are permitted go to forth, which are in Fardels, Packs, Trunks and Cases; and afterwards when they have taken
them forth, and put them into their Houses and Warehouses, the chief Keeper of the Customhouse, and the Officers
of the half <hi>per Cent,</hi> do visit the House and Goods, troubling and molesting them, demanding of them the dispatches,
it seeming unto them, that they may detain them, because they left the dispatch in the hands of the said <hi>Alcayde</hi> of the
Custom-house; we do prohibit and command, that the houses of the said Merchants shall not be visited, nor the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
shall not nor may not be demanded of them, in regard they have them not in their hands; and this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and is understood of houses which are within the Walls of the said City; and to the end it may be known to
you, which are of the English Nation, there is to be delivered unto you copies of the said Priviledges and Exemptions
with do concern you, and which were granted unto you; as well by the Articles of Peace, as by any other manner.
And for execution and accomplishment of all Premisses, we do command those of our Council, and those of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,

of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and chief <hi>Alcaldes</hi> of the Precincts thereof, and all the <hi>Corrigidors,</hi> Assistants and Governours chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,

accomplish, and cause the same to be observed, accomplished, and executed, in and for all things as therein is
contained, and they shall not in all nor in part put upon you any impediments, nor any other difficulties or doubts,
nor do any thing against the tenor and form thereof, nor consent or give way that it be interpreted, limited or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended

thereof, in the place which shall concern every one, they shall give order, and ordain to deliver unto you
those which shall be necessary: and for more firmness and validity of the favour and grace which by this our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
we do grant you, and that at all times this favour may be certain and sure unto you, you are to keep or have

unto whom we are to give sufficient Commission for keeping and accomplishing the said Priviledges, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Exemptions, who shall constrain and compell all and whatsoever persons, of what sort or quality they

be Plaintiffs; although the persons which shall accuse them, and which shall be accused by them, have private
Iudges, as well by consent as agreement which they may have made by preeminence or priviledge which they hold,
to the end the said Iudge Conservator may onely take knowledge privately of the said Courts, and not any other
Iudge or Tribunal, although it be by way of excess or notorious Iustice, or in any other matter or form; which

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31298:34"/>
the same to the conclusion, and they shall be referred unto him to be determined: and of that which he shall determine,
the Appeal is to be made to our Council, and not to any other Court.</p>

                  <hi>SOveraign Princes</hi> cannot study greater improvements for their Subjects, than to provide good Rules and Contracts, in Publick

Ships in their passage to <hi>Antwerp:</hi> Which place the <hi>States Generall</hi> might have taken, as also <hi>Gant</hi> by their forces at Land, but
it was not their business to take those Cities, but their trade, and to lessen the <hi>English</hi> Navigation <hi>(by improving their own)</hi>

            <head>Some further Speculations concerning the said
Treaties, with severall Animadversions thereupon.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all the Articles of the <hi>Bourgondian</hi> Treaty there is no mention made of striking
the Flagg to the <hi>Kings</hi> ships, in regard it was such an <hi>Ancient right and Custome</hi> adherent
to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> that it was needless to Express such a <hi>Prerogative</hi> that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
was implyed, however the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made it a <hi>Moot point</hi> with <hi>Cromwell;</hi>
The <hi>States</hi> having refused to strike unto the long <hi>Parliament</hi> their younger Brothers. Yet
Nevertheless it was agreed in <hi>Cromwells</hi> Treaty, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships of warr and
Merchants should strike to the <hi>English</hi> Men of warr; inferring from thence, that
they were to give honor to the Nation, from the old Dictate, <hi>quatuor Maria Vindico.</hi> And
the words in <hi>Cromwels</hi> Treaty were, that the <hi>States General</hi> and their Subjects should
strike in such Manner as was used in any former times whatsoever.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Queen Elisabeth,</hi> when any one of her <hi>Majesties</hi> Small Ships arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> bearing the Standard of <hi>England,</hi> all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships struck their Flags in the Harbour and Lowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Topp-Sails, although there was no Article to that purpose in the Treaty and League between the
<hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>States;</hi> but those ancient rights were observed out of respect and honour due to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> for
keeping the seas free from Pyrates and Rovers, when the <hi>Bourgundians</hi> had not a man of warr to resist them from drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
away the Ships out of their Sandy and dangerous wads and Harbours, and for sheltring them in hard and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Weather in havens upon the <hi>English</hi> Coasts. But because the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were so unmannerly and forgetfull in
late days of their duty and gratitude, this following Article was agreed upon in the Treaty concluded at London 9 of
February 1673. <hi>old Stile.</hi>

the year 1675 Says it is an insolency in the English Nation to insist upon the</hi> Flagg <hi>and</hi> Jack.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged and agreed by all Kingdoms and Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> that the <hi>King of Great Britain</hi> is the most
absolute <hi>Soveraign</hi> in his Dominions, in regard his government is not divided by any supremacy of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Yet
I do not find that there is any provision made in Treaties with the United <hi>States of the Seven Provinces,</hi> that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Divines of <hi>England</hi> shall be permitted to preach and pray in the English Congregations in <hi>Holland</hi> according to
the rights and Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but on the contrary, the <hi>English Congregations</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with Non-conformists, who are also bound up by the Magistrates to the Presbiterian Forms and Doctrine,
which renders the <hi>King</hi> and Reverend Clergie so much despised and forgotten, as if there were no such thing as a <hi>Church
of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the reflection is so much the greater, in regard the <hi>Roman Catholicks, the Jews, Lutherans &amp;c.</hi> are allowed to
use their proper Forms of Worship in their Synagogues and Churches at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and other Cities in <hi>Holland,</hi>
then as in <hi>England</hi> the Dutch Ministers are not barred from their Presbiterian forms; being without any prohibition
of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in their respective Dioceses, wherein the <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations do assemble (viz.) <hi>at London, Norwich,
Colchester, Sandwich &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore in Iustice, Equity and Honour, the same Rights, Priviledges and liberties
ought to be granted to the English in the <hi>United Provinces</hi> as are given or granted to <hi>Dutchmen in England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it's objected by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> in <hi>London &amp;c.</hi> Do pay their own Ministers, and purchase
their own Churches; and on the Contrary, the States do pay the English Ministers at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> with allowance
of Churches gratis, and repairs, therefore both Ministers and people are subject to their Orders, and pray for the <hi>States</hi>
as their Lawfull Soveraigns before the <hi>King of England,</hi> whom they do rather hate then love, many of them having
married into <hi>Dutch</hi> Families, whose interest they study more then the welfare of <hi>Great Britaign:</hi> and yet can be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
to expect protection from the <hi>King</hi> in times of trouble whom they will not obey in times of peace.</p>
            <p>It might be answered, that if the <hi>King</hi> did send able Divines into <hi>Holland</hi> and Maintain them out of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Crown, it would answer the Costs and Charges of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> in many respects, which might
be insensibly raised out of the paper-bill hereafter proposed to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Then there would be a distinction made

omit the mentioning of one affront offered to the English congregation in <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (that once had a Church in
the Chief street when the Merchants adventurers held their Court <hi>in Zealand)</hi> Where the Magistrates have taken
half the House belonging to the Idiots and Mad men and given it to the English Congregation to assemble in, and
converted the old English Church to an Hospitall.</p>
            <p>It is no digression from the Matter of Trade to add one Paragraph concerning the Iudicature of <hi>Holland</hi> upon ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
actions and differences of <hi>Meum et tuum</hi> between man and man, whereof there is no provision made for Expedition
in the Cases of strangers, as is practised in many other nations; The want whereof hath occasioned divers losses and

            </p>
            <p>Many hundred instances may be given, wherein severall Englishmen have quitted just Claims and pretences,
rather then they would enter into process with Burgers of <hi>Amsterdam &amp;c,</hi> for that Burgers by the priviledge of
their <hi>Cities</hi> cannot be arrested. 2 when they are summoned and the Cause put upon the Ordinary roll it is Usually 36
months before it comes to a triall. 3 after a Sentence, its commonly carried away to the <hi>Provinciall Court</hi> by a Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
4 after that, they for further vexation to strangers will appeal to the <hi>Supream Court</hi> of Iudicature at the <hi>Hague,</hi>

one half of his demands, let the cause and Dammage be what it will. Wherefore to avoyd all delays, vexations and

should respectively in Each Countrey have a summary way of proceeding before <hi>Comissioners</hi> of neutrall persons for

Treatie concluded at <hi>Breda</hi> in the Year 1667 had another aspect and was then finally Ended. In such sort as by the said

            </p>
            <p>In the year 1643. the <hi>East-India Company</hi> of the Netherlands took both the said Ships and their
Lading into their possession and converted them to their own use, without any process at Law.</p>
            <p>In the year 1647. Sr. <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> by <hi>Ionas Abeels</hi> demanded the said 5500 pounds of the <hi>East-India
Company,</hi> unto whom he insinuated his right of Assignation.</p>
            <p>In the year 1648. <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> takes a subsequent deed of assignment of the said Ships and Lading from the said <hi>William
Courten</hi> upon pretence of a debt of 1000. pounds due to him from Sr. <hi>William Courten</hi> upon an obligation dated in the year
1634. and covenanted to account for the surplus to such persons as had right to demand the same from <hi>Courten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1649. <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> made an agreement with the <hi>East-India Company</hi> for 85000. gilders, and gave caution to
save the Company harmless against <hi>Pyndar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, <hi>George Carew</hi> Administrator of Sr. <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> assigned the said 5500. pounds with interest unto <hi>Marke
Fletcher,</hi> in consideration of severall Bills of Exchange accepted and other payments to be made upon obligations; who
brought his action for the said money against <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> before the Magistrates of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> in the moneth of August 1676. waved the jurisdiction of the ordinary Justice in <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
upon pretence of a Treaty made in the year 1667. at <hi>Breda,</hi> and applied himself to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> to stop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
at Law; who sent their order dated 10. Septemb. 1676. to interdict the Magistrates of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> The Provinciall
Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Supream Court of judicature at the <hi>Hague</hi> prohibiting them respectively from doing any justice
therein.</p>
            <p>It being alledged in the said order, that all injuries, offences, dammages and losses that the subjects of <hi>England</hi> had at
any time suffered by the <hi>East-India Company</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> before that Treaty, were extinguished and discharged.</p>
            <p>And moreover that all actions, suits and pretentions whatsoever for the same that were any ways restrained, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
defined or reserved in any former Treaty whatsoever, especially in the 15. Article of the Treaty concluded in the
year 1662. were also renounced by the <hi>King,</hi> and therefore it was a violation of the Treaty to prosecute <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> for the
said money.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Marke Fletcher</hi> in the moneth of Decemb. last exhibited his request to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> setting-forth the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes

Law, as a particular action, no ways relating to the said Treaties.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding the <hi>King</hi> had formerly written to the States Generall in the moneth of January 1671. expressly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

unadministred ought to be prosecuted at Law. The Copies of all which were annexed to the said request to the States

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>French King,</hi> having granted Licence to a Company of Merchants of <hi>Diep,</hi> to trade to the
<hi>East-Indies,</hi> did set forth the Ship called <hi>d' Esperance</hi> bound for <hi>Bantam,</hi> where having bought
her Lading of Pepper, the Dutch <hi>East-India</hi>-Company sent some Ships, &amp; fired the said Ship,
which was burnt with all her Lading; whereupon those of <hi>Diep</hi> demanded satisfaction by their
Procurator <hi>laques Iacob.</hi> A Sentence was pronunced at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> on the 20 of June 1625.
whereby the <hi>East-India</hi>-Company were onely condemned to pay for a third part of the Pepper
laden and burnt with the Ship, each bale of Pepper valued at 4. pieces of eight, as also one
third part of the Customs &amp; charges paid in Lading them for their transportation, from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
wherewith, the Merchants being unsatisfied, the Matter was left <hi>in statu quo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In the Year 1648. by the generall Treaty concluded at <hi>Munster,</hi> It was agreed, between

for a certain time in the <hi>Spanish Dominions,</hi> and then the like time in the <hi>States Dominions,</hi> which was executed for a while,
but afterwards came to nothing; interest and passion overruling, they decided very few disputes. <hi>The Hollanders would have
all things interpreted to their own sence: Presuming that the strongest party could make the best construction of dubious Matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In the Year 1660. the Admiralty Court of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> confiscated a Ship belonging to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> upon pretence of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
contraband Goods to <hi>Portugal,</hi> notwithstanding the Master made it appear that he was bound for <hi>Galitia</hi> &amp; not <hi>Portugall;</hi>
and the Owners having obtained a review of the cause, All the seaven Delegates adjuncts, which were all of them Eminent
old Experienced Advocates and Lawyers, declared joyntly, that the Sentence was Erroneous: yet those of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
persisted and maintained the Sentence against the opinion of the Adjuncts. <hi>A true Example of Passion and Interest: vide

1659. the good Ship called the <hi>Golden Sun</hi> of <hi>Nantes, Capt. Nicolas la Breton,</hi> being at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> was fraighted by <hi>Mr.

return again to <hi>Lisbon</hi> with sugar, Hides, Tobacco and wood; being all of them free goods of the growth of that Country;
and notwithstanding there was a Provisionall <hi>Treaty of Marine</hi> agreed between the <hi>French King</hi> and the <hi>States Generall,</hi> in
the Month of June 1657. Art. 3. <hi>(viz.)</hi> that a free Ship should free all the Goods laden within her, though they belonged to the
Enemies of Each other; Provided they were not contraband, nor bound to any place besieged &amp; blocked up: Yet this Ship
was seized at sea by 4 Zealand private men of warr, and sent to <hi>Flushing,</hi> and the whole Lading confiscated. But Monsr.
<hi>de Thou</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> complaining thereof to the <hi>States Generall,</hi> declared that the King his
Master would give reprisalls against them, if they repaired it not, whereupon the Ship and all the Goods, properly belonging
to the Captain and Marriners, were restored, and his Fraight paid, but all the best of the whole Lading, whereof a great part
belonged to the English Merchants, and Factors, remained confiscated without satisfaction.</p>
            <p>5. In like manner the said <hi>Zealanders</hi> viz Capt. <hi>Philip Ras Toussein le sage, Matthew Quaerts</hi> and <hi>Alberf Iansen,</hi> Capers in
company against <hi>Portugal</hi> seized the <hi>Golden Sun St. Malo, Experience,</hi> and the <hi>Golden Falcon</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1660. all

Article, after that time.</p>
            <p>7. In the Year 1674. A peace being concluded on the 9. of February, between <hi>the King of great Britaign</hi> and the <hi>States
Generall,</hi> It was agreed that all Acts of Hostility should cease at the Expiration of 12. days after the Publication (which was
the 6. of March following from the Ness in <hi>Norway,</hi> to the Soundings of the <hi>English Channell</hi> westward, and from thence to

<hi>Willam Iones</hi> was Master (coming from <hi>Virginia</hi> &amp; bound for <hi>Bristol)</hi> within the Soundings; which said Ship with her lading
of Tobacco they carried to <hi>Flushing</hi> aforesaid, and obtained an order of the Admiralty Court to sell both Ships and goods,
without hearing the Master or Claimors of the said goods, contrary to the 16 Article of the Treaty of Commerce and Peace;
And some moneths afterwards confiscated the Ship &amp; goods, to the dammage of the Master and Owners 6000 pound sterling
&amp; upwards; although they gave in evidence &amp; clear Proofs that the Ship was taken within the Soundings; whereupon the
Claimers obtained an order for a review of the Sentence, which review by agreement in the last Treaty of Marine, Article 12.

yet the Lords Magistrates of <hi>Flushing</hi> (some of which are Owners of the Capers) will not submit thereunto: pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they consented not to any such Article in the said Treaty: so the Case remains in <hi>statu,</hi> as it appears at large by a

8. In the Year 1662, by a solemn Treaty it was positively agreed, that the Island <hi>Poleron</hi> was to be delivered upon demand;
And that satisfaction should be made by Amicable conferences for the two Ships <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona adventura;</hi>
but neither of them was performed. Whereupon Speciall Reprisals were granted under the great Seal of England concerning
those Ships; &amp; in the Year 1667. by the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> the <hi>English</hi> were to be at liberty to depart with their Families and
goods out of <hi>Surinam</hi> but were obstructed contrary to the Treaty; <hi>Hollanders</hi> being of <hi>Machiavells</hi> opinion, that Treaties of
Common Alliance bind no longer then the Convenience of either party obligeth to observe the conditions. <hi>Forbearance is
no Payment. And there is nothing can be restaurative or healing to the subjects of</hi> England <hi>in many cases, but a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign

            </p>
            <p>9. In the last Treaty of Peace concluded at <hi>London,</hi> 1674. It was positively agreed by the 9. Article that there should be
a regulation of Commerce and Navigation in all parts of the world, Especially in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> Which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> say
is implicitly done &amp; provided for by the 5. Article in the Treaty Marine concluded in the same Year: And that they have a
declaration apart from his <hi>Majesty</hi> or <hi>his Ministers of State</hi> that It is Satisfactory concerning the 8 &amp; 9. Articles of that last Peace
made &amp; ratified between <hi>the King of Great Britaign</hi> and the <hi>States Generall,</hi> which mentions nothing of the spice trade where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>English Company</hi> had a third part by Covenant, nor of any tribute for fishing upon the <hi>British Coast,</hi> (which the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> say was suspended upon the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> his account) onely It is directly declared by the words of the 5 Article
that the subjects of <hi>England</hi> may with all Freedom and safety Sail through all Navigable rivers unto any Harbours or Ports of
<hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> in Amity or Neutrality with <hi>England</hi> or the <hi>States Generall</hi> whereof the <hi>Flemish</hi> Ports cannot be Exempted,
or the Navigable Rivers to them be stopt up, without an apparent breach of the peace. <hi>More clear or larger Expressions could
not be uttered to open the Scheld, than is demonstrated in the 5. Article of that Treaty Marine.</hi>

<hi>(Judges</hi> of the common Law) being appointed, they craved a nullity of the Sentence against them with Costs for
vexation, more Especially for that it being repugnant to law and reason that third persons should suffer for personall
injuries when the offenders (if they were guily) had given good caution to answer the Dammage upon the arrest; all
which depends in <hi>Statu</hi> for the <hi>Judges</hi> resolution upon the Process. <hi>This case is only added to shew what Favors <hi>Flemmings</hi>

and relinquish his right and Soveragnity in those <hi>Provinces</hi> on the same
day that the <hi>King of Great Britaign</hi> was maliciously cut off from his

understanding. Pardon me that I begin with an <hi>Allegory</hi> to tell
you, that Trade the fair mistress of the world hath been courted by
diverse <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the greatest Kingdoms &amp; Empires
that are now antiquated, or through their own neglects forsaken.
<hi>Old Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> disputed the quarrell a long time for the
favour of that fair Empress untill one of them fell by the sword. <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> was the Mart
of the East, before the <hi>Portugals</hi> found out a more Easie way for the conduct of her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
than by Caravans. The Ancient State of <hi>Venice,</hi> that conquered three Kingdoms
in their flourishing time of trade was first lessned by <hi>Lisbon;</hi> Afterwards <hi>Brugis</hi> and
<hi>Antwerp</hi> were the chief Magazins for goods and Merchandizes of all sorts, untill <hi>Holland</hi>
blockt up those Flemmish ports from the English Navigation by <hi>Sluys</hi> and <hi>Lillo.</hi> Yet this Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Lady will not be forced, she is as subject to change as the various habits &amp; dispositions of
men are subject to alter. Wherefore of late, she resolved to remove her station from <hi>Holland</hi>
into a better climate amongst people of good tempers &amp; constitutions, and at last was inclined to
settle her self in <hi>England:</hi> knowing that <hi>Great Brittain</hi> was best able to vindicate her honour
and reputation in all quarters of the Earth, if they would not fall into factions, prejudice and
passion at home, but court her like true <hi>Englishmen</hi> that are both Soldjers, Gentlemen &amp;
Merchants. Now to leave the Allegory, &amp; come to the substance, there is a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to lessen the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by keeping down <hi>Amsterdam</hi> with a rising blow. It is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>England</hi> can subsist of it self better then any other Kingdom whatsoever: And if
the <hi>Ambition, Avarice</hi> and <hi>Envie</hi> of other Nations had not prompted <hi>Englishmen</hi> to defend
themselvs by force of Arms and Navall power, the lofty trees might have remained still as
Ornaments in the Groves and fields, and the Earth had not been so often ript open for Lead &amp;
Iron to pierce the bowells of poor Mortalls.</p>
            <p>But since the Laws of Nature teach all men to preserve themselvs, and by provision to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any others that might invade their interests and properties, I have made bold to hint
some things in these following Advertisments concerning the better improvement of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and <hi>English</hi> Manufactures, that may be very usefull towards the more Honourable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Crown and Government, the increase of the publique weal, and the diminution
of those Powers that have been both your Enemies already, and are likely to be so again upon
any occasion they can find for advantages to break with the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> There is an
old By-word in <hi>Spain,</hi> when they would afrighten or quiet their infants, <hi>Beware-Drake</hi> and
in <hi>France</hi> for that purpose they say, <hi>Beware-Talbot;</hi> but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> dread nothing more
then an union of the three Estates of <hi>England</hi> in Compliance with the <hi>King,</hi> which <hi>God</hi>
grant may continue for the accomplishment of those Acts, which will Eternize the Glory
&amp; memory of this Parliament to all future ages.</p>

            <p>The great incouragement for the setting up the Wollen Manufactures in <hi>England</hi> proceeded from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Workmen, and their wives and Children that fled out of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Whereupon all the Flemish

pretending that other Cloysters do more then get their bread, although they are of the best families in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi>

            <p>A particular Merchant shall never raise the price of <hi>Colchester</hi> Bayes again, that a Company in a short time

these things may be well observed as follow:</p>

               </gap> Merchants in late years, have come by overtrading and cloying the Markets at home, and abroad;
which mischief extended to all men that had any dependency upon trade. But there I meet with another objecion that
the poor must be kept at work or else they will be unveriable or perish for hunger: as to this I shall also give an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

of all poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is granted that by the old rule in Manufactures, a quantity of Wool that cost at the first hand an English

this will also meet with a materiall objection as to the diminishing of the <hi>Kings Customs,</hi> the best supporter in the

            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the fine threed and Linen (whereof there is a great consumption in <hi>England)</hi> make a greater
augmentation by the art and labour of the workmen then the <hi>English</hi> do in any kind of Woollen Cloaths, or Stufs;
nevertheless the Dutch will have their money remitted six or eight moneths before hand to pay the Weavers,
Sleachers, Upmakers, &amp;c. so that there is a vast disproportion between the Dutch Linen trade, and the English
Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llen trade. The Hollanders set their poor at work with English stock, and the English goods are sold for time
upon long payments in many places, which beggers both the Cloathier and Merchant. Besides the advantages given
thereby to forraign Nations, that having so much of the English stock in their hands, oftentimes make the <hi>King</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eild to dishonorable conditions in treaties of peace to preserve his Subjects goods and monies from confiscation.</p>
            <p>Spice and Pickled Herrings (those two Dutch Mineralls) would support the <hi>Hollanders</hi> if they had no other trade
or Navigation to subsist upon: therefore Englishmen that are so indulgent to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do not rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the case, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon and Mace, (which are all forcibly ingrossed by the Dutch) take one
with another, cost the <hi>East-India</hi> Company 5 stivers a pound, and are sold for 55 stivers ready money in <hi>Banck:</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:31298:41"/>
and <hi>Communibus annis</hi> the spice brings in 300000 pounds into the Countrey by Cash from all Nations, which
must buy so much in Banck-money for the Company. The Callicoes and other Indian Manufactures, Druggs,
Saltpeter, Tin and Copper &amp;c. this year imported in 15 Ships amounted to more then a million of Sterling money
besides: as appears by the generall Cargo of the Ships and their Lading hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>I have observed in <hi>Mazeland-Sluys, Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is the same regulation in the Sale of their Fish, as is observed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> at the
arrivall of the Ships out of <hi>Spain</hi> for the Plate. First, an inquiry is made by the Generall in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> what
goods are brought; then such a price and value is set upon them according to the quantity of Silver that is gotten
that year out of the Mines. If it prove a plentifull year for Silver, then there is a good price for the Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and other Merchandizes: if not, it is otherwise.</p>
            <p>The Herrings and Salt Codd when the Fishermen come home must be presently sold, and the Magistrates of the
respective towns set the prizes according to the quantities that are taken, and they are all sold in a day or two, if
there were fifty Ships lading and upwards at a sayl; in regard the money must be distributed amongst so many
hundred people in every place; as to <hi>Brewers, Bakers, Coupers, Smiths, Ship-Carpenters, Net-makers, Tanners,
Ropemakers, &amp;c.</hi> besides the poor Fishermen for their wages, according to their hire or adventures of their labour,
being both Seamen and Fishermen. And it's free at those generall sales for any man to buy that hath ready money
or credit in Banck. Then the Merchants compute what quantity will serve for the consumption of their own
Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> which are set apart; the rest stored up in Pack-houses, and against Lent-Markets they are
sent into <hi>France, Germany, East-Countrey, Spanish Netherlands, &amp;c.</hi> This last year the Fishermen made bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Voyages; the Shurks that hanted after the Herrings did so spoil their Nets and devour their fish. From
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> great quantities of Salt, Salmon and Herings are transported with diverse Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and other stayle goods of those Countries unto <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Camp-Veer:</hi> Although the Chief consumptions
for those goods are in <hi>Flanders, Brabant,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Spanish Nertherlands</hi> and confines of <hi>Germany.</hi> Then
considering the severall tolls upon them in passing through the States territories, beside customes, inwards, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and also into the <hi>Spanish</hi> ports afterwards, and all other petty charges, 10 per cent is lost out of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
at the first which might be all saved if the goods went directly to <hi>Brugis</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> under a regulation and
find ready money at the Market price for their lading.</p>
            <p>Whereas now the goods being left in the hands of <hi>Hollanders</hi> for sail, 6 per cent is presently allowed for money-advance
to buy <hi>Dutch</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when accounts are made up at the next voyage, which the poor <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> are obliged to make unto the
same ports (or lose their effects left there) they find so many bad debts and other defalcations; that upon the matter,
with all their Merchandise and Commerce they do but toil and work onely for the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> ought to be the Magazin for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in regard the Crown of <hi>England</hi> defends them both
at Sea, and can furnish them both with all forraign goods much cheaper then they shall fetch them from <hi>Holland;</hi>
where many times they are frozen up 3 or 4 moneths in the year, and have spent all their money they got in the
sommer with their thin-sided Ships of <hi>Sardam</hi> whose tender Ribbs are often broken with the Ice in the Southern
Sea. The <hi>Scotch</hi> having liberty to fail in forraign-built Ships will never build any good Vessels at home or set
their own people at work upon any materialls that are usefull for <hi>Navigation.</hi> The <hi>Irish</hi> are as bad, and have the same
qualities in destroying the <hi>English Navigation</hi> by naturalizing Dutch Ships. As to my knowledge, a Magistrate
of <hi>Limbrick</hi> being at <hi>Flushing</hi> in the year 1675. gave 13. <hi>pasports</hi> under his hand and seal of his office to severall <hi>Zealan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
for their Ships to pass free as Vessels belonging to that <hi>Irish Port.</hi> But as for the <hi>Scotch,</hi> they are so dextrous
in that art, that severall hundred <hi>pasports</hi> have been given out at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Campheer</hi> in one year with blanks
for the names of the Masters. A <hi>French</hi> Privateer in the space of one moneth met with seven and twenty Ships
bound to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> all from <hi>Kercady</hi> a Port in <hi>Scotland;</hi> although 3 parts of the Seamen were Dutchmen,
pet a <hi>Scotch Master</hi> hired from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> colours both Ship and goods. Wherefore if there be not acts of <hi>Parliament</hi>
made in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as well as in <hi>England</hi> for the better regulation concerning their <hi>Navigations</hi> where all their
Ships and Pynaces ought to be registred in every Port, and all Seamen and Fishermen from the age of ten years to
seaventy, duly entred with severe penalties and punishments upon all persons that should transgress against those
rules and ordinances there prescribed, then <hi>Forraigners</hi> will still plough with <hi>English, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> heifers.</p>
            <p>Now to the great shame of such <hi>Englishmen</hi> be it spoken who at home and abroad have used all their endeavours
possible to spoil the <hi>English Navigation:</hi> Amongst many hundred examples, I will demonstrat one, whereby the Reader
may take his measures concerning the rest, and see how <hi>English men</hi> that should have taken opportunity of the
times to inrich themselvs and their own Countrey, have given the advantage to Strangers. I am unwilling to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in this place severall very considerable Merchants in <hi>London</hi> who have hired out their names at <hi>Rotterdam,
Dunkirk, Oast-End,</hi> and severall other Ports where Strangers goods have been shipt under their coverts, and
even the Vessels owned for <hi>English</hi> that never were in any <hi>English</hi> Port; yet they have passed courant oftentimes for
free Ships and free goods.</p>

interdicting the <hi>Directors</hi> at their Chamber in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> from any transaction with the said <hi>Pergens,</hi> protesting

that such a <hi>solemn grant</hi> could be mortified and extinguished by general words at <hi>Breda,</hi> without other satisfaction
then new aggravations, for which the land mourns.</p>
            <p>9. That in the year 1671. the Proprietors and Interessed in the <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura</hi> having
made new addresses to his <hi>Majesty</hi> in Council, the said Cause was revived by several orders, references, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
all signifying, that the <hi>King</hi> was obliged in Iustice and Honour to require satisfaction from the <hi>States General</hi>
and their Subjects for the said Ships according as it was setled in the said letters Patents. <hi>The States General</hi>
having cancelled all treaties by breach of Covenants.</p>
            <p>10. That in pursuance thereof, the Original Orders and Reports and His <hi>Majesties</hi> letters were sent express with
this Iusinuant and others, to the <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Cologne</hi> to insist upon satisfaction
accordingly, the <hi>King</hi> having intimated therein, that His care in this affair should be as much to protect his Subjects
in their Iust rights as to Assist them in the recovery thereof, all which came to the knowledge of the <hi>States General.</hi>
The <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> having taken away the said papers &amp; orders from this <hi>Insinuant,</hi> whom they detained a close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
at the <hi>Hague</hi> twenty moneths, where he and his servants were affronted contrary to the Laws of Nations
having Pasports from the <hi>States</hi> Commissioners at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> on the 5. of Iulij 1672.</p>
            <p>11. That to take away all differences and disputes concerning the said Ships and their lading, the <hi>States General</hi>
(as they do alledge) in the last Treaty at <hi>London</hi> agreed to pay 800000. Pattacons at 4. several payments, the
first being only made, whereof this Insinuant received fifty pounds from <hi>Alderman Backwell,</hi> by order of the Right
Honorable <hi>Thomas Lord Viscount Latimer,</hi> Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> and 150. pound from the <hi>States</hi> of
<hi>Holland,</hi> towards his extraordinary expences and incident disbursments during his Imprisonment.</p>
            <p>12. That the <hi>Insinuant</hi> upon his releasment (without any prejudice to his further right and demands against all
other persons,) assigned 5500. pound Sterling to <hi>Mr. Marke Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> which money was resting in,
the hands of <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> a trustee of <hi>Courten,</hi> (being particularly granted before to <hi>Sr. Paul Pyndar)</hi> in lessening of the
debt and dammages concerning the said Ships their fraights and lading, the payment whereof <hi>Pergens</hi> also obstructed
by extrajudiciall and impertinent orders of the <hi>States of Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. That although this <hi>Insinuant</hi> hath the greatest confidence in the Iustice and Honour of the <hi>King</hi> (who
can do no wrong) yet being obliged in this Case to use his diligence wherein so many Families of Orphans and
Widows are concerned, (whose bread is eaten by strangers) the <hi>Insinuant</hi> therefore hath not been wanting to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
his humble requests severally to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the <hi>States General</hi> concerning the same.</p>
            <p>14. That this <hi>Insinuant</hi> being further obliged, by the importunities of several Creditors claiming under his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
to put your Lordships of the common Councell of the several and respective Cities and Towns in
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> in remembrance, as also the Directors of the several and respective Chambers of the <hi>East</hi> and
<hi>West-India Companies</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that untill satisfaction and reparation be made according to the true

<hi>English</hi> bloud and treasure already spent in the vindication thereof.</p>
            <p>15. That the supream Court of Iudicature at the <hi>Hague</hi> having denied the <hi>Insinuant</hi> admittance in a cause of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
against <hi>Jacob Pergens</hi> upon a bond of 3000. pound, wherein <hi>Sr. Iacob Catts</hi> late Chancelor of <hi>Holland</hi>
stood bound unto <hi>Sr. William Courten;</hi> The <hi>Insinuant</hi> was renvoyed or removed to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
as Competent Iudges of <hi>Pergens,</hi> who had made his exception of Burger-right, where the <hi>Insinuant</hi> was ordred
to sue him; Nevertheless both parties having proceeded in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and brought the Cause into a state for sentence,
yet the <hi>Scheepens</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> refused to pronounce the same; Although the <hi>Insinuant</hi> constantly solicited the <hi>Lords</hi>
thereunto throughout the whole year 1676. Where at last they alleadged that the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> had interdicted
them from doing any Iustice therein, as by the deduction of the Case appears.</p>
            <p>16. That the <hi>Scheepens</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> and also the supream Court of <hi>Iudicature</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
delayed and denied this <hi>Insinuant</hi> and <hi>Mr. Iohn White</hi> and <hi>Mr. James Boeve,</hi> the due administration of Iustice
and Equity upon diverse Iudiciall Acts and decrees of the <hi>Prerogative Court</hi> of <hi>England</hi> whereby they were sufficiently
impowred to require an account of <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> Merchant deceased, and of his Sons and Heirs
for several vast summs of money drawn out of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Sr. Peter Courten</hi> in Company with <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi>
and <hi>Iohn Moncy</hi> upon their Linnen trade and other Merchandizes, whereupon the <hi>Kings</hi> Subjects were not only
defrauded, but the Iudicature of <hi>England</hi> wronged by those Sinister Practises, fomented by <hi>Iacob Pergens, Pieter Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daen</hi>
and his Sons. The <hi>Insinuant</hi> therefore on the 6. day of November, 1675. made an <hi>interdiction</hi> and <hi>protest</hi> at the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Chambers of the <hi>East</hi>- and <hi>West-India Companies</hi> in <hi>Middleburgh</hi> prohibiting the <hi>Directors</hi> in the said Chambers
to make any reparitions of monies <hi>(Pendente Lite)</hi> upon any Obligations or Actions unto <hi>Mr. Iohn Boudaen, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of <hi>Pieter Boudaen,</hi> or to transfer or aleniate any such Action or Obligation belonging to the said <hi>Boudaens</hi>
or either of them, for that it appeared upon record in <hi>England,</hi> (as a Capital offence for which <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi>
was committed to Prison) that several great quantities of gold (which <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi> had taken up at interest
<pb facs="tcp:31298:42"/>
of his Creditors) was transported to <hi>Sr. Peter Courten</hi> at <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> who had indirectly imployed the same in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing
of Original Actions in the <hi>East-</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi> Companies, and that since his death, the said <hi>Peter Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daen</hi>
and his Sons taking advantages of the Civill warrs in <hi>England</hi> and the Iniquities of these times, have wholy
refused to account for the summ of 122138. pounds Sterling gotten into their hands, as by the ballance of the Books
kept in <hi>England</hi> appears, and notwithstanding the said Insinuation, interdiction and protest was read up <hi>H. van

Merchants traded in Companie many years together in the linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturs,
and other Merchandizes, wherein <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi> had two
parts of the stock, and Each of the other a fourth part.</p>
            <p>That Sr. <hi>Peter Courten</hi> settled himself at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> where
he drew many vast summs of money out of <hi>England,</hi> which were taken up
at Interest in <hi>London,</hi> and dyed indebted to the stock of the Company,
the summ of 122138—10—6. Sterling, as by the ballance of the
Books kept in <hi>England</hi> hereunto annexed appears.</p>
            <p>That Sr. <hi>Peter Courten</hi> left <hi>Peter Boudaen</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> Merchant his Nephew sole Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
who possessed himself of all the Books of account kept in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and the Estate both reall
and personal of Sr. <hi>Peter Courten:</hi> and being afterwards questioned at Law by Mr. <hi>Iohn White,
Iames Boeve</hi> and <hi>George Carew</hi> severally concerning the said monies; The said <hi>Peter Boudane</hi> used
all manner of Sinister practises to avoid coming to any account, and took advantage of the late
times and troubles, to obstruct the ordinary Course of Justice during his life, as his Sons and Heyrs
have since done the same; Whereby the due administration of Justice hath been often denyed,
and the Judicial Acts and decrees of the Prerogative Court, and High Court of Chancery, slighted
and contemned in the Ordinary Courts of Judicature in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> to the great oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of your Petitioners and many Orphans and Widows, claiming the Effects of Sr. <hi>William
Courtens</hi> Estate, and his Sons, as also Mr. <hi>Iohn Mancies</hi> and Sr. <hi>Paul Pyndars</hi> gotten into the hands
of the said <hi>Boudaens, Iycob Pergens</hi> and other Inhabitans of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> as by the
deductions of the several Cases hereunto annexed appears.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as your Petitioners are left without all other remedy (the
<hi>King's</hi> recommendations to the <hi>States General</hi> for justice being also slighted
and contemned) and it being of most dangerous consequence to suffer the
Iudicature of <hi>England</hi> to be wronged, and the rights and properties of the
Subjects to be lost through the erronious practises in forraign Courts of Iustice
contrary to the Laws of Nations:</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners do therefore most humbly pray, that your Honours would take their
Grievances into your most serious considerations: And upon Examination
thereof to represent the same, by special address to His <hi>Majestie,</hi> that some speedy
and Effectual relief may be had therein, according to the Merits of the said Causes.</p>

               <signed>And your Petitioners shall every pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
