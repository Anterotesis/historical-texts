         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you may be satisfied that what I write proceeds not from any phantasing terrour of minde, but from a sober resolution of what concerns my self, and earnest desire to do you more good after my death, then mine Example (God of his mercy pardon the badness of it) in my life-time may do you harm. I will not speak ought of the vanity of this world; your own age and experience will save that labour: But there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing that goeth up and down the world, called <hi>Religion,</hi> dressed and pretended phantastically, and to purposes bad enough, which yet by such evil deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loseth not its being: The great good God hath not left it without a witness, more or less, sooner or later, in every mans bosom, to direct us in the pursuit of it, and for the avoiding of those inextricable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions and entanglements our own frail Reasons would perplex us withal. God in his infinite mercy hath given us his holy Word, in which as there are many things hard to be understood: so there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough plain and easie, to quiet our mindes, and direct us concerning our future being. I confess to God and you, I have been a great neglecter and (I fear) despiser of it: (God of his infinite mercy pardon me the dreadful fault.) But when I retired my self from the noise and deceitful vanity of the world, I found no true comfort in any other resolution, then what I had from thence: I commend from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my heart the same to your (I hope) happie use. Dear Sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> let us be more generous then to believe we die as the beasts that perish; but with a Christian, manly, brave resolution, look to what is eternal. I will not trouble you farther. The onely

               <head>DAN. HEINSIUS,</head>
               <p>A Master (as <hi>Selden</hi> expresseth it, <hi>tam severiorum quàm amoeniorum Literarum,</hi> History-professor of <hi>Leyden,</hi> Secretary and Bibliothecary of the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, and appointed Notary of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> said at last, Alas, as to humane Learning, I may use <hi>Solomon</hi>'s expressions, <hi>That which is crooked cannot be made strait.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may understand it several ways. First, all our Knowledge, by reason of mans corruption, is but a crooked, ragged, impedite Knowledge; and for that reason, a vexation to the minde: for Rectitude is full of beauty, and Crookedness of deformity. In mans Creation, his Understanding should have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the strait path of Truth, should have had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct view of Causes and Effects in their immediate successions: but now, sin hath mingled such Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with things, that the Minde is fain to take many crooked and vast compasses for a little uncertain knowledge. Secondly, the weakness of all natural knowledge is seen in this, that we cannot any way either prevent or correct the crookedness of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest things, much less to make a man solidly or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially happie. Thirdly, <hi>That which is crooked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made strait.</hi> It is impossible for a man, by the exactest knowledge of natural things, to make the nature of a man, which by sin is departed from its primitive rectitude, strait again; to repair that image of God, which is so much distorted: <hi>when they knew
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93665:8"/>
God, they glorified him not as God, they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkned:</hi> 'Tis the Apostle's speech of the wisest Heathen, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> the most rational Heathen man that the world knows of, in his Doctrine confesseth the disability of moral Knowledge to rectifie the intemperance of Nature; and made it good in his Practice: for he used a common Strumpet to satisfie his lust. <hi>Seneca</hi> likewise, the exactest Stoick that we meet with, then whom never any man writ more divinely for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, was the richest Usurer that ever we read of in ancient Stories; though that were a sin discovered and condemned by the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>A second ground of vexation from Knowledge, is the defects and imperfections of it: that which is wanting cannot be numbred. There are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Conclusions in Nature, which the inquisitive judgement is not able to pierce into, nor resolve into their just Principles: nay, the more a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the less discovery he maketh into the things he knoweth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in much wisdom is much grief; and <hi>he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.</hi> In Civil wisdom, the more able a man is, the more service is cast upon him: and the more business he runs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the less enjoyment he hath of time or liberty. His eminence loads him with envie, jealousie, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, suspicion; forceth him oftentimes upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome compliances, upon colours and inventions, to palliate unjust counsels, and stop the clamours of gainsaying Conscience; fills him with fears of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93665:8"/>
and disgrace, with projects of humour and plausibility, with restless thoughts how to discover, prevent, conceal, accommodate the adversaries or his own affairs: in one word, is very apt to make him a stranger to God and his own soul. In other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, let a man but consider, first, the confusion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, involvedness, perplexity of Causes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, by mans sin. Secondly, the pains of body, the travel of the minde, the sweat of the brain, and tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and plucking of the understanding, the very drudgery of the soul, to break thorow that confusion and her own difficulties. Thirdly, the many invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doubts and errours which will still blemish our brightest notions. Fourthly, the great charges which the very instruments and furniture of Learning puts men to. Fifthly, the general disrespect which (when all is done) it findes in the world; great men scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as Pedantry, ordinary men unable to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and great Scholars are fain to make up a Theatre amongst themselves. Sixthly, the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie thereof to make up what is amiss in our nature, the malignant property it hath to put sin into ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to contemn the simplicity and purity of Gods Word. And lastly, the neer approach thereof unto its own period; the same death that attendeth us, being ready also to bury all our Learning in the grave with us. These, and infinite the like consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, must needs mingle much sorrow with the choicest Learning.</p>
               <p>Methinks I could bid the world farewel, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure my self among my Books, and look forth no more, (were it a lawful course) but shut the doors

               <p>KEpt his wisdom: he pursued such manly and noble delights, as might not vitiate, but rather improve his intellectuals. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>I said

               </p>
               <p>Again, his wisdom was furnished with variety of subjects to enquire into: he had magnificence and provisions suitable to the greatness of his Royal minde: sumptuous and delicate Diet, under the name of <hi>wine,</hi> vers. 3. stately Edifices, vers. 4.

But if we look unto that which the loose and profane world is apt to account the greatest Gallantry, we shall finde it made up of such pitiful ingredients, which any skilful and rational minde will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to plead for, much less to mention them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with true goodness and unfeigned piety. For how easie is it to observe such who are accounted high and gallant spirits, to quarry upon such mean preys which onely tend to satisfie their brutish appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, or flesh Revenge with the bloud of such who have stood in the way of that airy title, <hi>Honour!</hi> or else they are so little apprehensive of the inward worth and excellencie of Humane nature, that they seem to envie the gallantry of Peacocks, and strive to outvie them in the gayety of their Plumes: such who are, as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Ad similitudinem parietum suorum extrinsecus culti</hi>; who imitate the walls of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the fairness of the outsides, but matter not the rubbish which is within: the utmost of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to attain <hi>enervatam foelicitatem quà permade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scunt animi,</hi> such a felicity as evigorates the soul by too long steeping: it being the nature of all terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial pleasures, that they do <gap reason="foreign">

Is there nothing more graceful and pleasing in the sweetness, candour, and ingenuity of a truly Christian temper and disposition, then in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful implacable spirit of such whose Honour lives and is fed by the bloud of their enemies? Is it not more truly honourable and glorious, to serve that God who commandeth the world, then to be a slave to those Passions and Lusts which put men upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual hard service, and torment them for it when they have done it? Were there nothing else to commend Religion to the mindes of men, besides that tranquillity and calmness of spirit, that serene and peaceable temper which follows a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wheresoever it dwells, it were enough to make men welcome that guest which brings such good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with it.

               <p>So that (as an excellent person saith) <q>if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for and against a God were equal, and it were an even Question whether there were one or not; yet the hazard and danger is so infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, that in point of prudence every man is bound to stick to the safest side of the Question, and make

               <head>A serious GENTLEMANS Discourse of being Religious.</head>
               <p>MEn generally stand upon the credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Understandings, and of all things hate to be accounted Fools, because Folly is so great a reproach to the Understanding of a man, and so high a reflection upon his Discretion: But I know no way for men to avoid this imputation, and to bring off the credit of their Understandings, but by being truly Religious, by fearing God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from evil: for certainly there is no such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Person as he that neglects God and his Soul, and is careless and slothful about his everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93665:25"/>
because this man acts contrary to his truest Reason, and best Interest: he neglects his own safety, and is active to procure his own ruine: he flies from Happiness, and runs away from it as fast as he can; but pursues Misery, and makes haste to be undone: Hence it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> does all along in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> give the title of <hi>Fool</hi> to a wicked man, as if it were his proper name, and the fittest character for him, because he is eminently such. There is no such fool as the sinning fool, who every time he sins ventures his Soul, and lays his everlasting interest at the stake; every time a man provokes God, he doth the greatest mischief to himself that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: A mad-man that cuts himself, and tears his own flesh, and dashes his head against the stones, does not act so unreasonably as a sinner, because he is not so sensible of what he does: Wickedness is a kind of voluntary Frenzie, and is a chosen Distraction; and every sinner does wilder and more extravagant things than any man can do, that is crazed, and beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and out of his wits; onely with this sad diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That he knows better what he does.</p>
               <p>Is that man wise, as to his Body and his Health, who onely clothes his hands, and leaves his whole Body naked? who provides onely against the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and neglects whole troops of mortal Diseases that are ready to rush in upon him? Just thus is he who takes care onely for this vile Body, but neglects his pretious and immortal Soul; who is very sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to prevent small and temporal inconveniencies, but takes no care to escape the Damnation of Hell.</p>
               <p>Is he a wise man as to his temporal Estate, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93665:25"/>
lays designs onely for a day, without any respect to, or provision for the remaining part of his Life? Just thus does he that provides for the short time of this Life, but takes no care at all for Eternity; which is to be wise for a moment, but a fool ever; and to act as untowardly and as crosly to the reason of things, as can be imagined; to regard Time as if it were Eternity, and to neglect Eternity as if it were but a short Time.</p>
               <p>Do you think him a wise man who is serious about Trifles, but trifles about the most serious Matters? Just so is he who pursues the World, and the petty Interests of it, with all his might, but minds Religion and the weighty concernments of Eternity, as if he minded them not.</p>
               <p>Do you count him prudent, who throws himself over-board, to save his Goods? Just so doth he who to secure any thing in this World, makes shipwrack of his Conscience, and casts away his Soul.</p>
               <p>Is he wise, who is wise in any thing but his proper Profession and Employment, wise for every body but himself; who is ingenious to contrive his own Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to do himself a mischief; but is dull and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as to the designing of any real advantage or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to himself? Just such is he who troubleth himself with other things, and neglecteth himself; who is wise to do evil, but to do good hath no understanding.</p>
               <p>Is he wise who neglects and disobligeth him who is his best Friend, and can be his shrewdest Enemy? Just so doth every wicked man who neglecteth and contemneth God, who can save and destroy him.</p>
               <p>Is he wise, who in matters of greatest moment and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93665:26"/>
concernment neglecteth opportunities never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived; who standing upon the shore, and seeing the tide making hast towards him a pace, and that he hath but a few minutes to save himself, yet will lay himself to sleep there, till the cruel Sea rush in upon him, and overwhelms him? Just so doth he who trifles away this day of Gods Grace and Patience, and foolishly adjourneth the work of Repentance, and the Business of Religion, to a dying hour.</p>
