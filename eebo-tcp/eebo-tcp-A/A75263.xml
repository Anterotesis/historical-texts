         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the Election of the CONVENTION of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Reaſons why the ſaid Convention ſhould Proclaim Their MAJESTIES of <hi>England, WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>MARY,</hi> KING and QUEEN of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOurs of the 28th paſt I receiv'd, and as your Account of the Affairs and Tranſactions of <hi>England</hi> is by ſeveral Hands (to our general ſatisfaction) here confirm'd, ſo I muſt be bold to tell you, you are very much deceiv'd and abus'd in your Intelligence concerning this Kingdom: For whereas in one Clauſe of your Letter you inſinuate your fears of a Rupture, or a Diſagreement at the meeting of our Grand Convention (which will certainly be the 14th. of this Inſtant. I aſſure you there is ſo little reaſon for your Doubts, that the general Belief of this Kingdom is, that they will in nothing differ from the proceedings of your Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the ſettlement of the CROWN, but in the time for having ſo good an Example and Preſident at hand, is thought there will be but little delay in their Reſolves; Beſides, the Country have in the Choice of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, been ſo free and unprejudic'd, that I dare affirm there never was a more juſt or leſtal Aſſembly than this will prove; many of them do here publickly already applaud and approve the Wiſdom and Choice of <hi>England;</hi> an Inſtance of which is this Paper therewith ſent you (written as is ſuppos'd by one of the Members) whereby you may gueſs at their Inclinations, though I cannot ſay we are wholly without Wicked, Diſaffected, Reſtleſs, and Turbulent Spirits in ſome parts, who would willingly Embroil us, if poſſible; but we doubt not but a happy Agreement of this <hi>Healing Convention,</hi> in a General Declaring for their preſent Majeſties of <hi>England,</hi> will confound all their Devices.</p>
            <p>THô it may be reaſonably expected that allitrue <hi>Scotſmen</hi> may by this time be fully Senſible of what may be moſt conducing for the <hi>Settling</hi> this <hi>Ancient Kingdom,</hi> yet conſidering that the time for meeting of the <hi>Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> draws near, and the Affair anent which they are to meet, is of ſo great Importance, I ſhall preſume to give this brief Advice,</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, I humbly conceive that we cannot pitch upon more feaſible means for the attaining a ſetled and laſting Peace, than that which our Elder Siſter <hi>England</hi> has already fixed upon, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That the late King <hi>James</hi> the Second, having endeavoured to Subvert the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People; And by Advice of Jeſuits and other Wicked Perſons, having Violated the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws; And having withdrawn himſelf out of his Kingdoms, has <hi>Abdicated</hi> the Government, and that the THRONE is thereby Vacant; For which Miſgovernment He has forfeited the Truſt of the Regal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Executive Power both in Himſelf and in his Heirs Lineal and Colateral; ſo that the ſame is devolved back to the People, who have alſo the Legiſlative Authority; &amp; conſequently may of Right give &amp; diſpoſe thereof by their Repreſentatives for their future Peace, Benefit, Security, and Government, according to their good Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And foraſmuch as it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Government be ſpeedily Settled on ſure and laſting Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and conſequently that ſuch Perſon or Perſons be immediately plac'd in the Throne, in whom the Nation has moſt Reaſon to repoſe an entire Confidence, and therefore have Proclaim'd the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And this will eaſily appear if we Conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. What great dangers the ſaid <hi>Neble Prince</hi> has expoſed himſelf to in reſcuing us from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> which otherwiſe would undoubtedly have overflown our <hi>Land:</hi> And therefore who can we imagine will be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Preſerve all things in their right Channel, as he that was at ſuch pains to reduce them thereto.</item>
                  <item>2. By this means we ſhall ſecure to our ſelves the beſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> ſuch too, as the whole World that we wat of, does not afford their Equals.</item>
                  <item>3. We ſhall in like manner deliver our ſelves from that Race of POPISH SUCCESSORS that would otherwiſe certainly be Obtruded upon us, ſhould King <hi>James</hi> be called home, to the no leſs prejudice of the <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> than the Deſtruction of our KIRK and STATE. For ſhould he be ſent for again, we could not Evite the Pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Succeeding him; and if he ſhould dye, the ſame Tricks would be uſed for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing another upon us, and what an ill Comb we ſhould bring to our own Heads by ſwae doing, we may eaſily imagine; And we are not fooliſhly to expect to be delivered from ſuch a Grievous <hi>Bondage</hi> as that would be, by extraordinary <hi>Miracles,</hi> eſpecially if we ſlight ſuch ſingular Mercies as <hi>GOD</hi> has now put into our Hands for the preventing our falling thereinto.</item>
                  <item>4. We may eaſily foreſee the grievous Inconveniencies that will follow upon the not taking the ſame Meaſures that <hi>England</hi> has taken; for then we can expect no leſs than to have our Land a ſeat of War, &amp; to be filled with Rapine &amp; Blood-ſhed; Let not the old Proverb that we frequently uſe, to wit, <hi>That Scots Folks are aye wiſe behind hand,</hi> now be verified of us. If we are not wilfully Blind, we have a freſh Inſtance before us of the Miſchiefs that ſhall befall us (if we ſuffer our ſelvesito be Impoſed upon by <hi>Papists</hi> and other Diſaffected' Perſons among us) in the Neighbouring Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is already ſo plundred, that in Seven Years it will not recover its Preſtine ſtate, and who knows what it may yet Suffer; <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. By this means both the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> will be preſerved, and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People ſufficiently vindicated: For the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> is the next <hi>Legitimate Succeſſor</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and her Father having Deſerted his <hi>Dominions,</hi> tle <hi>Rights</hi> of Succeeding devolves upon her, and in Swae far as ſhe cannot pretend a Right to Succeed during her jathers Life, She comes now to the <hi>Crown</hi> by <hi>Election,</hi> which does mightily Confirm the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the People that <hi>a ſome Caſe</hi> they have a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Elect</hi> a Governour, and this frees us from the Fears of having a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things conſider'd, I hope our good <hi>Patriots,</hi> who are to meet in the enſuing <hi>Convention,</hi> will follow the Pattern which the Engliſh Convention hath Caſt them, eſpecially ſeeing, beſides the infinite Advantages which will redound to us in this Ancient Kingdom: The whole <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> abroad, will be very much Supported thereby, which has Suffer'd ſo much in many Places for ſeveral Years, and the King and Queen We are to make Choice of, have always made it their Work to Defend that Intereſt to the utmoſt of their Power, and We ſhall enjoy a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that for ſeveral Years we have been wholly Strangers to.</p>
            <p>In the next place ſeeing the ſaid Illuſtrious Prince, has given you a Liberty to redreſs the manifold Grievances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which not long ago, you groan'd as under an <hi>Aegyptian Bondage:</hi> I hope you will take ſuch Methods for freeing your Selves therefrom, that not only the preſent Age, but even After Generations will have a grareful Remembrance of your Names, and ſo doing, you ſhall wipe off that Odium that hath been caſt upon our Nation, by the Cruel and Barbarous Acts that have been made by ſome-Self-ſeeking Court Paraſites that have crept into our Parliaments ſome years Ago. I ſhall ſay no more, but, <hi>Verbum Sapienti ſat.</hi>
