            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">HUMBLY OFFERED To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, now in Parliament aſſembled.</head>
            <p>THe late Cenſors of the Colledge of Phyſicians, Dr. <hi>Tho. Burwell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rich. Torleſs,</hi> Dr. <hi>William Dawes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tho. Gill,</hi> are now proſecuted at Law, for not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying themſelves, according to the Statute of 25 K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II.</p>
            <p>Now on behalf of the ſaid Cenſors it is humbly offered,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Cenſors are nominated and choſen by the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in purſuance of an Act of Parliament of the 14th and 15th of K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. to that employment, which they are obliged to perform under a penalty <add>without salary or profit,</add> and do not exerciſe it by virtue of any Letters Patents or Commiſſion immediately from the King.</item>
                  <item>2. That no one of the Cenſors ſince the ſaid Statute, of the 25th of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. ever took the ſaid Oaths, or ſubſcribed the ſaid Declarations, as Cenſors, or underſtood themſelves to be obliged ſo to do.</item>
                  <item>3. That all theſe four Cenſors are known Proteſtants, and upon other occaſions have taken the Oaths and ſubſcribed the ſaid Declarations, and did voluntarily ſign the Aſſociation, and have upon all occaſions teſtified their affection and zeal for his Majeſty's Service and Government, and had readily taken the ſaid Oaths, and ſubſcribed the ſaid Declarations upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo, if any former Cenſor had ſo done, or they had not been adviſed by their Councel, that the Cenſors were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the ſaid Statute.</item>
                  <item>4. That if the Cenſors be within the ſaid Statute, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral other Members of the ſaid College (as all ſuch who have been Preſidents, Elects, Cenſors, Treaſurers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters) are liable to proſecution.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it is humbly hoped, that the ſaid Cenſors, and other Members of the ſaid Colledge, that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the like omiſſion, ſhall be relieved in this caſe, in ſuch manner as your Lordſhips ſhall in your great Wiſdoms pleaſe to think fit.</p>
