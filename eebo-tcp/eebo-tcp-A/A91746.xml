            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>If I ſhut up Heaven that there be no Rain, or if I command the Locuſts to devour the Land, or if I ſend Peſtilence among my people:</p>
                  <p>If my people, which are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their Land.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words are a Gracious Promiſe made by the Lord unto <hi>Solomon</hi> after he had dedicated the Temple by faſting and prayer; for though there be no mention of <hi>Faſting,</hi> yet if we conſult the time, we ſhall find

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115571:4"/>
that it was in the <hi>ſeventh moneth, 2 Chron.</hi> 5. 3. and that the ſolemnity continued from the 8. to the 23. day of that moneth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9, 10. and the 10. day was by a Statute for ever appointed to be a day wherein to <hi>afflict their ſouls,</hi> Levit. 16. 29.</p>
            <p>The parts are three. 1. A Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Judgements,</hi> verſ. 13. where, by the enumeration of Three, any others may <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechdochically</hi> be underſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Direction unto <hi>Duties:</hi> wherein are <hi>two things</hi> to be taken notice of. 1. The <hi>Quality</hi> of the perſons who are to perform them, <hi>My people called by my Name.</hi> 2. A <hi>Specification</hi> of the Duties, which are <hi>theſe four, Humiliation, Supplication, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Gracious <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are very remarkable four ſignal Returns of Grace in conformity to their Duties. 1. They <hi>Humble</hi> themſelves under Gods Holy hand, and he <hi>humbleth</hi> himſelf to look down <hi>from Heaven.</hi> 2. They <hi>pray,</hi> and God <hi>hears</hi> their prayer. 3. They <hi>ſeek</hi> the favour and the <hi>face</hi> of God, and God <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi> their ſin, and is reconciled unto them. 4. They <hi>Turn</hi> from their wicked wayes, and God <hi>Heals</hi> thoſe evils which thoſe wicked wayes had brought upon

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115571:4"/>
the Land; no duty undertaken in vain, but a ſutable and correſpondent Mercy promiſed to encourage them thereunto.</p>
            <p>It may here not impertinently be asked, why theſe three Judgements of <hi>ſhutting up Heaven,</hi> ſending <hi>Locuſts</hi> and <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> are rather mentioned than any other, ſince doubtleſs the Promiſe doth extend it ſelf further? I take the reaſon to be, 1. Becauſe theſe are <hi>irreſiſtable,</hi> no Counſel, no Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no Strength can prevent them. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are inflicted <hi>by God alone,</hi> no ſecond cauſes immixed in them, if I ſhut up Heaven, if I command the Locuſts, if I ſend Peſtilence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If an <hi>Enemy</hi> come, Counſel may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſtrength may vanquiſh, Treaſure may bribe, and divert him. Our own Polices and Proviſions may ſeem to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our help. But againſt an <hi>Army of Locuſts,</hi> no Policy, Wiſdome, Srength, Embaſſie can prevail. No power of man can open or ſhut the <hi>Clouds,</hi> No Gates or Barres can keep out a <hi>Famine,</hi> or a <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> from a place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If an <hi>Enemy</hi> come, we are apt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that to the <hi>malice of men,</hi> to look outward to ſecond cauſes, and not inward to our own ſins, or upward to the Juſtice of God, though it be certain, that there

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115571:5"/>
is no humane <hi>Hoſtility</hi> without a divine Commiſſion. Men are <hi>Gods Rod,</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Staffe, Pſal. 17. 13. Iſa. 10. 5, 6. Ezek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 21. 3, 5, 11. He by his ſecret and holy Providence edgeth the ſpirits of men againſt one another, (as he ſent an evil ſpirit between the men of <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech) Judg.</hi> 9. 23. And <hi>ſtirreth</hi> up Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries againſt thoſe that provoke him, as he did againſt <hi>Solomon, 1 Reg.</hi> 11. 14, 23 And when he pleaſeth to return in Mercy, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh the ſword, and breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpear in ſunder,</hi> Pſalm 46. 9. Iſa. 54. 17. Theſe things I ſay are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But we are too apt to bite the ſtone that hurts us, and not mind the hand that threw it. Whereas when wrath is from Heaven only, we are forced to ſee God, we have no ſecond cauſes to aſcribe it unto.</p>
            <p>So the meaning is; If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſend Judgments <hi>immediately</hi> from my ſelf, ſuch as no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Wiſdome</hi> can prevent, or <hi>Power</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, if then the people ſhall bethink themſelves, and return, and ſeek my face, they ſhall find that when Wiſdome, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Treaſures, Walls, Armour, Munition are nothing worth, Prayer and Repentance ſhall avail for healing.</p>
            <p>So here is a double <hi>Combate</hi> between God and Man. 1. Man provokes God with ſin,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115571:5"/>
and God overcomes ſin with Judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Man wreſtleth with Prayer and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and God yieldeth in Mercy and Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt General, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Judgements, and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make two obſervations.</p>
            <p n="I">I. Judgements light not on a people ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, or by chance, but by the over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and diſpoſing <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Command and Commiſſion of God. It hath not an earthly original; <hi>It growes not out of the duſt,</hi> Job 5. 6, 7. but it comes from Heaven, and is ſent from God to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſomething of his mind unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes indeed by way of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> and abſolute Power, He deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perfect and the wicked, he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the trial of the innocent, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 22, 23. Sometimes as a <hi>Preparation unto</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mercy,</hi> as men plow the ground which they mean to inrich with precious ſeed, and carve the ſtone which they mean to put in the top of the building. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Iron chain made way to his golden chain, and <hi>Davids</hi> troubles ſeaſon'd him for his Crown. As men put forth longeſt into wind and ſun that great Timber which muſt bear the greateſt burden and ſtreſs of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. No ſuch School to learn in as the

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115571:6"/>
               <hi>School of Affliction.</hi> But moſt uſually in a way of <hi>Justice, Becauſe thy ſins were increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have done theſe things unto thee,</hi> Jer. 30. 15. Thou haſt done right, we have done wickedly, <hi>Neh. 9. 33. I have not done without cauſe all that I have done,</hi> Ezek. 14. 23. <hi>Perſonal</hi> chaſtiſements may be for <hi>tryal</hi> and exerciſe of faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but <hi>general</hi> and publick Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ever in <hi>wrath</hi> and diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Such have been the dealings of God in this Nation; The cup of Affliction hath been given to <hi>All orders of men;</hi> we have ſeen <hi>Princes</hi> on Scaffolds, and in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Parliaments</hi> broken in pieces by their ſervants, <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Patriots</hi> deveſted of their Honours, and ſecluded from their Truſt; Diſhonours poured upon the <hi>City,</hi> Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the <hi>Countrey,</hi> Blood on the <hi>Land,</hi> Scorn on <hi>Miniſters,</hi> Threats on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation on <hi>Souldiers,</hi> there is not any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or degree of men, which have not been ſhaken with theſe Earth-quakes. O how deep is our ſtupidity, if we do not all of us analyze and reſolve our ſufferings into their proper principles, ours <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>Gods Diſpleaſure?</hi> If we have only howled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and ſee not Gods Providence in them, ordering the ſins of men unto our Humiliation? If we know them only <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>

            <p>The Duty extends to both. The whole body of a viſible Church are in Judgements to humble themſelves, and as to temporal deliverances the Lord doth reſpect the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of the worſer Members of the

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115571:10"/>
Church, as we ſee in the caſes of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam, 1 Reg. 21. 28, 29. 2 Chron.</hi> 12. 6, 7. But to do this ſo effectually as to attain all the annexed promiſes, is the work of the Iſrael of God by ſpiritual Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Now from this Qualification we gather theſe two uſeful Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="I">I. The ſins of <hi>Gods own people,</hi> who are in Covenant with him, may provoke and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Judgements; their Pride, and Security, Worldly Love, Conformity to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times, Coldneſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in Duty, Uneven and Unfaithfull walking, acting by divided Intereſts from the reſt of the Lords people, may provoke God ſeverely to puniſh a land, and we may juſtly fear hath done ſo amongſt us. A good man, though a Son may yet be <hi>ſilius ſub ira,</hi> under paternal diſpleaſure. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> do not by believing glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, they muſt both die in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 12. If <hi>David</hi> grow proud of victories, and number the people, God will ſend a plague which ſhall leſſen their number and his pride, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 15. If <hi>Solomon</hi> turn from God to Women, and to Idols, though he be a Son, he ſhall be chaſtized with the rods of men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. If <hi>Aſa</hi> grieve the Prophet, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115571:11"/>
the people, he ſhall be vexed with <hi>Warrs</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes, 2 Chron.</hi> 19. 9, 12. If <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> help the ungodly, his life ſhall be endangered, and his ſhips broken, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 20. God will have Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>begin at his own houſe, 1 Peter,</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>Their ſins have ſome <hi>Aggravations</hi> in them which other mens have not; theſe are committed <hi>againſt ſpecial light</hi> and more glorious convictions, as thoſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, After God had appeared unto him twice, 1 Reg.</hi> 11. 9.

Againſt ſpecial <hi>Hopes,</hi> and more ſpecial Promiſes which ſhould have! perſwaded them unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. 1 John.</hi> 3. 3. Againſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Peace</hi> and glorious Comforts, as <hi>David</hi> ſinned againſt the joy of Gods ſalvation, <hi>Pſalm 51. 12. Peter</hi> denied Chriſt after he had ſeen his <hi>Transfiguration.</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115571:11"/>And this may teach the holieſt of men; 1.

To be more carefull to <hi>stand in the breach</hi> againſt publick Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, having by their ſins contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the bringing of them upon the Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not our doing of Duty, but Gods being in Covenant with us, which is the ground of his Mercy to us. <hi>Property</hi> doth ſtir up Compaſſion, <hi>Though they have provoked me, yet I will ſpare them, becauſe they are</hi> mine, Malachy 3. 17. Whence we learn;</p>

            <p n="2">2. In what manner to do Duty. None can do Duty aright, but as <hi>one of His,</hi> and in Covenant with him.

            <p>And that we may have the better and fuller view of our ſelves, of our hearts and lives, let us look upon the holy Law of

            <p n="II">II. The next Duty is <hi>Prayer,</hi> without which Humiliation is but a <hi>ſinking</hi> under God, not a <hi>ſeeking</hi> unto him. The very Heathen betook themſelves unto this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in times of trouble, <hi>ut pacem Dei</hi>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:115571:20"/>1. By this we <hi>honour</hi> God in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the <hi>fountain</hi> of all our <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter</hi> of all <hi>Evill,</hi> the <hi>Avenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="2">2. By this we <hi>eaſe our ſelves,</hi> Prayer <hi>lightneth</hi> affliction where it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it. <hi>Nature</hi> is ſtrengthned to bear the <hi>pain, Conſcience</hi> is ſtrengthned to withſtand the <hi>Temptation</hi> and ſnare of it. The heart is <hi>meekned</hi> to accept the puniſhment of ſin, as <hi>Wool</hi> or <hi>Mud</hi> deads the force of a Bullet, ſo the heart meekned by prayer, doth obtund the edge of an Affliction, that it cannot get ſo deep into the heart to hurt it.</p>
            <p n="III">III. In Prayer we muſt <hi>ſeek the face of God;</hi> His <hi>Favour</hi> to comfort us, and his <hi>Counſell</hi> to direct us.</p>

In other griefs, Gods favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the ſoul, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23. 4. &amp; 94. 17, 19. But when Gods favour is withdrawn, the ſoul hath nothing elſe left to lean to, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can comfort when God frownes. Armour can protect againſt a ſword or a Bullet, but not againſt fire. When God is angry, no refuge but unto God.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

               </gap>, when he is angry with their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſhuts them out,</hi> Pſalm 80. 4. Lam. 3. 8. And on the other ſide, this is one of the moſt radiant and glorious Comforts of Gods people, that in all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they have a <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to, with a promiſe, <hi>You ſhall pray, and I will hearken,</hi> as a man doth to what he delighteth in: <hi>For the prayer of the Righteous is his delight,</hi> Jer. 29. 12. 13.

            <p n="3">3. A gracious <hi>promiſe of forgiveneſs,</hi> to ſerene his countenance, and lift up the light thereof upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for even when we do his Will, and when we are <hi>His People,</hi> we want <hi>pardoning Mercy.</hi> There is need of pardon not only for the <hi>ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> unto their <hi>Juſtification,</hi> but alſo for his own people and <hi>Children</hi> into a <hi>Reſtitution</hi> to paternal favour, the ſenſe and fruition whereof they may forfeit by their ſins. And this is <hi>Gods method</hi> in hearing prayers, <hi>to forgive ſin</hi> before he cures pain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. For indeed when <hi>ſin is pardoned,</hi> the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is cured at the root, for ſin is the <hi>ſting</hi> of every Affliction, as well as of death.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115571:22"/>4. A Promiſe of <hi>Healing,</hi> Healing of the <hi>Land,</hi> the Humiliations and Prayers of Gods peculiar people are beneficial to the whole Land; <hi>The innocent ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Iſland,</hi> Job 22. 30. A <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> an <hi>Eliah</hi> in Iſrael is the Chariots and Horſemen thereof. An <hi>Humbled,</hi> praying, converting people, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be an <hi>Healed people:</hi> And if ever we hope to be healed to purpoſe, this muſt be our Method to it.</p>
            <p>Now touching theſe Promiſes there is this worthy our obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when God <hi>comes down</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and looks from heaven, he doth it by no other way, then by the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of his Son, the efficacy of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> the operation of his <hi>Providence,</hi> or the Miniſtry of <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When he <hi>hears Prayers,</hi> It is only by the <hi>Interceſsion</hi> and mediation of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he <hi>forgives</hi> ſins, It is only by the Merits and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But when he <hi>heals</hi> a land, he often uſeth in that work the <hi>Miniſtry of men. Magiſtrates</hi> are Healers and Repairers, <hi>Iſa. 3. 7: Miniſterrs</hi> are Healers of the ſick, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:115571:23"/>And therefore I ſhall here in all <hi>humility</hi> implore of you, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> who are Inſtruments for <hi>Healing</hi> in the Lords hand unto theſe long and wofully ſick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that you would with all your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour call together all the graces of God, all the abilities of nature in you unto this moſt neceſſary work.

            <p>Your greateſt care therefore muſt be, 1. That the people of the Land be <hi>Gods people,</hi> that his <hi>Name</hi> be owned, his Truths, Worſhip, Intereſts preſerved pure and inviolate amongſt us.

Communion, to many errours and vain Janglings, to contempt of Magiſtracy, to affronting Authority, to violating publick Order and Peace, to ſuch an exceſs of Licentiouſneſs under the pretenſe of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that <hi>Religion</hi> ſcarce ever was more endangered under the ſtraights of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, than under the laſciviouſneſs and wantonneſs of an <hi>abuſed liberty.</hi> Though therefore there ought to be all tenderneſs to preſerve for Gods people the <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith the Lord hath made them free, God forbid any reſtraint or abridgement ſhould be upon that; yet ſince the ſame Lord hath commanded that we muſt not uſe our <hi>Liberty as a cloak</hi> of maliciouſneſs; It is neceſſary that great prudence be uſed to prevent the exorbitances of wanton minds, who make uſe of Liberty to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and aſſaulting of publique <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> to the <hi>kindling</hi> of <hi>Flames,</hi> anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the diſcontented peopleunto Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, enervating the Peace and concord of the people of the Land, by diſ-joynting them in that which is the main bond of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the <hi>Truths of Religion:</hi> wherein when they are once univerſally broken, who ſees not how wide a door is opened for <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Munſter,</hi> not only to enter in, butto be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115571:24"/>The Way therefore unto <hi>Healing,</hi> is to endeavour to bring us all home to be <hi>Gods people,</hi> and as his people to be <hi>compacted</hi> within our ſelves, to lay aſide all <hi>dividing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguiſhing, invidious Titles,</hi> &amp; with <hi>fraternal</hi> affections to coaleſce, as far as may be in Judgement, however throughly in <hi>affection,</hi> and ſo to keep our <hi>Difforing Opinions</hi> to our ſelves, as that the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of our brethren may not be grieved, nor the peace of the Church of Chriſt endangered thereby.</p>
            <p>I conclude all, with beſeeching you, that ſince the Lord hath taken it as one of his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to be called <hi>The Lord that healeth us, Exod.</hi> 15. 26. that <hi>without him,</hi> the Builder worketh, the Watchman keepeth, the Stateſman counſelleth, the Phyſician heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in vain, you would ever by prayer and attendance upon God for Counſel, <hi>ſo ſeek his face,</hi> and guidance in this weighty work, that when it is finiſhed, and the Head-ſtone of our ſettlement laid, we may ſay, <hi>It was the Lords doing, and marvelous in our eyes;</hi> and may with ſhoutings cry, <hi>Grace, Grace unto it.</hi>
