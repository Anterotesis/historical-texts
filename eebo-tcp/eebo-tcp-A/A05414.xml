            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had no sooner begun (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to take this taske in hand, but entring into a true and iudiciall consideration how weake &amp; slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my forces were to bring to any good perfection a work of so great moment and importance, I began immediately to faint &amp; fall vnder my burthen, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by perseuering therein, I should but set forth vnto the view of this captious age mine owne vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and euer liue obnoxious to the malicious tongs of such barking mastifes, as thinke the reproofe of other mens labors to be the greatest parcell of their owne praises, though then themselues none are more ignorant. Notwithstanding, being at last earnestly entreated to finish what I had begun, and the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finished, vehemently vrged to the publication thereof, by some friends of mine whome I am bound by dutie to obey, since of two euils wise men are wont to chuse the least, I thought it better to lay open to the world my follies, and discouer mine owne vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ignorance, then by curious and nice reiecting the aduised counsel, &amp; enforcing perswasions of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest &amp; nearest friends, to be touched or thought guilty
<pb facs="tcp:8983:4"/>
of that fowle and of all good men detested vice ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>But least any one looking in this booke for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of our English Academies, and finding them placed in the latter end, shold by a misconstruction of my well meaning intention lay vnto my charge either negligence, or ignorance, or both, for not giuing vnto these two noble nurseries of the artes (whose resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fame hath dilated it selfe to the vttermost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the earth) their due &amp; deserued places, I will for his satisfaction &amp; mine own excuse speake onely a word or two. I am not ignorant, that these vniuersities of our natiue country deserue for their degree &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse to be placed in the foremost ranke, and that in all <hi>Europe</hi> are not to be found more ancient, more magnificent, more plentifull, better accommodated, nor more in all kinds of learning flourishing vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But so great of late haue beene the controuersies, and so sharpe and bitter the contentions betweene the learned Doctors &amp; professors in either of these sacred, and most worthily renowned habitations of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: while they of eyther side with tooth and naile did labour to maintaine the prioritie of that place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had remained students, that I as one weakely armed, and fearing the encounter, not daring to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the listes, was once determined plainely to giue ouer the fielde: for with what face shoulde I by any meanes presume (my learning being little, and my skill in the arte of antiquaries lesse) to interpose my poore opinion, among the stifly maintained allegations of so many graue &amp; learned men? I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:8983:5"/>
was resolued rather to bee accused and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ignorance for leauing of them out, then by going about to giue superioritie vnto the one, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the displeasure of the other. But being againe aduised how great a maime &amp; blemish I should seeme to giue vnto this present treatise, if going about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate in one bodie the moderne vniuersities of our Christian world, I should cut off two of the most noble and principall limmes or members of the same: I haue at last (altering my first resolution) annexed them to the end thereof, in such manner, as neither of these vniuersities shall finde cause of discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the curious reader depart (as I hope) well satisfied.</p>
            <p>Concerning the antiquities, priuiledges, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of colledges in the one and the other, I write nothing of mine owne inuention, what I haue found in <hi>M. Camdens</hi> Chorographicall description of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> concerning <hi>Oxforde,</hi> and other Chronicles, that haue I gathered and set downe, to <hi>Cambridge</hi> some thinges haue I added not of my self, but extracted out of certaine papers, printed in Paules Churchyearde, in the yeare of our Lorde, one thousand fiue hundred, seauenty two, and written by a learned Maister of that Vniuersity.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore (curteous Reader) in good part what here thou findest offered to thy view, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me not with thy frowne in my first attempt: the faultes that are herein escaped, if they proceede from the authors vnskilfulnes, forgiue them, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he is one that hath more vsually beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

with the warlike sounde of martiall drums, then with the schooles and Lectures of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: if committed by the Printer, amend them gentlie with thy penne, so shall I euer rest.</p>

               <p>Concerning the first originall &amp; foundation of this cittie, the most learned antiquaries set nothing downe for certaine.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8983:13"/>
the mouth of the <hi>Rheine,</hi> searching the secrets of which riuer, they at last entred the <hi>Meine,</hi> and came vnto this place where they erected a Cittie; which from their God <hi>Herebus</hi> (to whome they there offered sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) they named <hi>Herebipolis:</hi> but this opinion <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> reiecteth, as vaine and fabulous. Whensoeuer therefore, or by whom soeuer this citie first was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this much we find for certaine, that it was then a cittie, when that holy and learned father <hi>S. Khilian,</hi> conuerted the <hi>Franconians</hi> to the Christian faith, <note place="margin">The antiquity thereof.</note> which was about the yeare 686. The antiquitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was made manifest by certaine images of idols dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the <hi>Meine,</hi> when the foundation of the new bridge was laide, which were cast into the riuer by the <hi>Franconians,</hi> when they first embraced the Christian religion. <note place="margin">Sundry opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the name thereof.</note>

               <p>Concerning the etimologie of the name thereof, there are sundry opinions. It was called of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inhabitantes <hi>Wirtsburge:</hi> which <hi>Iohannes Gallicus</hi> (in certaine Hymnes and Sonets of <hi>S. Khilian,</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe set forth about the yeare 1150.) desiring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert into a good Latine worde called <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> was deceiued (as it should seeme) by the equiuocation of the two Dutch wordes, <hi>Wirtes</hi> and <hi>Wurtes,</hi> the one of them signifying an hearbe or roote, the other muste or new wine, from which men thinke the cittie rather to haue taken his name, because the territorie of <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> yeeldeth wine in greater aboundance then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prouince of <hi>Germany Conradus Celtis</hi> a Poet of that country calleth it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>S. <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Ments,</hi> erected in this citie a Bishops sea, wherein hee placed <hi>Burcharde</hi> an <note place="margin">The Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke erected.</note> Englishman, and descended of a noble family, vpon whom <hi>Charles</hi> the great, or (as others say) king <hi>Pipine</hi> bestowed the Dukedome of <hi>Franconia,</hi> which before belonged to <hi>Gozbertus,</hi> by whose concubine <hi>Kisila,</hi> (or as some write, <hi>Geilana)</hi> S. <hi>Khilian</hi> was martired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he perswaded the Duke to forsake his incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life with her, which before had beene his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife.</p>

artes. In this Vniuersity are many goodly colledges deputed onely for the vse of such studentes, as are of poore and meane abilitie.</p>
               <p>Three principall causes are alleadged, why this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie <note place="margin">Three causes why Padua hath so long flourished.</note> adorned with so many priuiledges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues hath obtained so great splendor and celebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The first is the opportune, sweet and fruitfull situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the place, which ministreth to the studentes <note place="margin">The 1. cause.</note> great aboundance of all things necessarie. <hi>Constantinus Paleologus</hi> (as writeth <hi>Rhodogine)</hi> was wont to say, that were it not for the testimonie of the holy and learned fathers, which affirme, that Paradise was in the East: he verilie would belieue it no where could be found, but in the amene and fruitfull fieldes of <hi>Padua.</hi> The bread of that countrey is more pure and white then in any other place of <hi>Italie,</hi> and the wine <hi>Plinie</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be of the best and noblest sort.</p>
               <p>The second cause why it hath so long flourished, is <note place="margin">The 2. cause.</note> because it alwaies hath beene found faithfull, firme &amp; constant to the commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and euen in their greatest calamities, and most pernurious warres hath assisted them with men, money, and muuition: wherefore the <hi>Romaines</hi> a people euer thankful to their friends, &amp; of singular faith &amp; constancie to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, omitted nothing that might serue to further &amp; promote the glorie &amp; emolument of the Paduans.</p>
               <p>Finally, the third and last cause of the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their happie estate, is because the Paduans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <note place="margin">The 3. cause.</note> all other haue euer beene full of humanitie and curtesie, whereby they did often winne the heartes of all men, and moued great Princes and Potentates to

fauour them, and become their benefactors. Chastity was of them euer held in so great esteeme, that it grew into a prouerbe, As chaste as one of <hi>Padua:</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Martiall</hi> in these verses alludeth.</p>

               <p>Many learned professors and teachers haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this fruitfull vineyard.

                  <hi>Caietanus</hi> a learned Diuine, a profound Philosopher &amp; most excellent Phisition, long flourished in this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie. <hi>Thomas Penketh</hi> an Englishman, for his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red learning and eloquence, was with much follicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and entreatie called out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to gouerne and direct in <hi>Padua</hi> their scholasticall discipline. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Thomas Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman sent for to Padua.</note> writeth, how the students of <hi>Padua</hi> vnderstanding that <hi>Iohn Campegius</hi> (a personage for his grauity and great learning much in those dayes admired and esteemed) was in person approched neere their towne, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> Rulers and Maysters of the Vniuersitie, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The honour that was wont by the Padu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to learned men.</note> with the Magistrate of the Citie, with pompe went out to meete him on the way (which thing they onely are accustomed to do to high &amp; mightie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) &amp; going on foot before him, they conducted him into their towne. Whereby of all men easily may bee perceiued, the dignitie, honour, &amp; respect, they beare vnto worthy professors of learned sciences.
