         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For who can comprehend the depth of Gods councell, or render any particular reason of it? why God, who had amongst all the nations of the earth elected and selected the Iewes to be his onely pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and beloued people, with whom he made such a singular couenant of mercy and saluation, to whom appertained the <hi>adoption,</hi>

For before Christ his incarnation, they often misused,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. ver. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 16.</note> derided, persecuted, &amp; slew Gods prophets, &amp; since they refused &amp; murdered the Lord of glory, they forbad his Apostles to preach to vs Gentiles, they persecuted and killed them, and from that time to this present houre, cease not to blaspheme &amp; spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> out their venim against Christ his church, his gospel and his seruants. And yet, (notwithstanding all this) is it not a mistery to bee wondred at and adored, that God hath in all ages of the Church, chosen &amp; reserued to himself, and called to Christ a remnant of them, which is vndoubtedly, a fore-runner and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their generall conuersion not far off. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it is a maruelous worke of God, &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his mistery, that the Iewes (howsoeuer wandring and dispersed in al countries almost,) should stil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue such a distinct and vnconfounded nation, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable in multitude, and so constant in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obseruing of (as much as they possible may) their ancient lawes, rites, and ceremonies. Thirdly they haue bin in the times of greatest persecutions, when the tirants of the world sought to extinguish, and root out the scriptures (and still are) the faithfull keepers &amp; preseruers of the old testament: &amp; all this may put vs in some good hope of their future calling and conuersion. Lastly God hath (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proueth,) made an euident promise of their plenary calling &amp; saluation, when the full number of
<pb facs="tcp:17258:3"/>
vs Gentiles, is (successiuely) come into the church.</p>
            <p>Thus seeing their miserable state for the time past, and also at this present, and that a remnant is alway remayning, &amp; the conuersion of the nation of them is dayly expected; we must not passe by so memorable a worke of God without vse &amp; application. By their fall and apostacy wee must not only iustifie, but also tremble &amp; stand in awe of Gods iudgments, feare to offend the diuine Maiesty, and beware least through vnbeleife, contempt of the gospel and profaine secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we at length attract &amp; draw the like iudgments vpon our selues. Secondly, in that so great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them shalbe againe ingrafted into Christ and beleiue the gospell, we must be so farre from despise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or scandalizing them by our ill life and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, &amp; from despairing of their saluation, that we must heartily pray for them, and by our zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and holy life and conuersation study &amp; striue, through the working of the holy Ghost, to reduce them into the right way.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Christian Monarches &amp; Magistrates must not only by enacting and execution of seuere lawes, represse their vile and intolerable vsuries, whereby they plague &amp; oppresse many poore Christians, and punish with al sharpnesse their horrible blasphemies against Christ and his gospell, but cause them being vnder their authority &amp; subiection to be by degrees instructed in Christian religion, and for the sooner effecting of it, to compell them to heare the gospell. Then shall the miserable and seduced Iewes bee brought home, the world reuiued, the hearts of Gods people replenished with vnspeakeable ioy, all nations shal glorifie God in Christ, and we shal al in short time be fully &amp; finally, perfected and glorified.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is Gods couenant made with his people, by mens vnfaithfulnesse euer abolished and dissolued?</p>
            <p>A. No, for it is grounded onely in GOD who is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and not in man, who is a lyar, lighter then vanitie it selfe and therefore not to be trusted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods couenant is an euerlasting couenant,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17258:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his mercy extendeth vnto a thousand generations, therefore wee must not for the vnbeliefe of some, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all, but rather hope well of all, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether doth Gods fore-knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, euer make a difference and distinction betweene the Elect and the Reprobate?</p>
            <p>A. Yes many times, as in this and other places of holy Scripture, where Gods knowledge and fore-knowledge is taken for the good pleasure of his will, for election and his speciall loue and approbation, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was it a sinne in the idolatrous Iewes, to demolish and pull downe altars, seeing that they were set vp and seated in places where they ought not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, for their minde and intention was wicked; for they did not destroy and ouerthrow the Altars, because they were not set vp onely in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where they ought to be by Gods expresse commandement; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not haue sacrifice done to God (onely.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether that the true Church of God in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of predestination and other points of faith, may not erre and be deceiued in iudgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for first, if that notable. Prophet of the Lord <hi>Elias</hi> erred in iudgment of the Church,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. v. 6. &amp; 7.</note> and <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet was deceiued in the choise of <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i</hi> his sonnes; yea and the Apostles themselues for a time were ignorant of the Article of the resurrection of Christ and of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yea and <hi>Peter</hi> after that the holy Ghost in the day of Penticost had descended vpon him,<note place="margin">Act. 10. v. 13.14.15.</note> knew not that the Iudaicall differences of meates were already abrogated, &amp; thought the Gentiles were not capable of the Gospel, except withall they should admit of and receiue the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of <hi>Moses</hi> his law, if these Prophets &amp; Pillars of the church were ignorant and did erre euen in matter of faith, why may not much more other both Pastors and people erre that haue not, nor neuer in this world shall haue any such extraordinary calling, gifts and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17258:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly the Church and the principall members of it, sinne alwaies and are ignorant, yea, and many times erre in the right interpretation of the Scripture, <hi>ergo,</hi> they may erre in faith. But herein lyeth the difference, first the true Church buildeth her faith onely vpon the Canonicall Scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles, secondly shee neuer stiffely and obstinately (as heretikes doe) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth any error against the maine principles and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of true religion.</p>

               <p>And in the 1. of Kings 19.10. he saith that he hath <hi>beene iealous for the Lord of Hosts</hi> (all tending to one purpose) from which place I obserue and gather. That the Pastors &amp; Preachers of Gods word especially must be enfired and inflamed with an holy zeale of Gods glory, &amp; with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indignation against sin and idolatry, then principally when with <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; others, they see most grieuous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the people, when they see <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, viz. Iesuites and Seminaries, Popish Emisaries to be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and high reputation; and themselues and the true Prophets and ministers of the Lord reuiled and reiected, yea wringed and wronged, yea killed and slaughtered, when they see Christ to bee vilified and Antichrist to be deified, and when they see the Gospell troden vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot &amp; impiety &amp; superstition aduanced.

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> The reason in regard of the holy monuments of Gods seruice is, because they are profaine and wicked and regard them not; and as for the good ministers of God, they like the King of <hi>Aram</hi> against <hi>Ahab</hi> (though indeed a most wicked King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) fight against none (in comparison) but against them, for they seeme stumbling blockes and hubbes in their way who by their ministerie and zealous example vexe them. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. ver. 10.</p>

                  <hi>An.</hi> No, for albeit many times and in many places the church ceaseth to be visible, conspicuous and glorious; yet the true Catholicke and inuisible Church, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth onely of the number of the Predestinate and Elect, euer was, is, and shall be; and shall alwayes remaine in the world in one place or other For first, it neuer failed when it was brought to the greatest extremities, but (at length) it hath alwayes lifted and put forth her head out of the darkenesse where-with it was oppressed. Secondly Christ his kingdome is eternall,<note place="margin">Luke 1. v. 33. Dan. 7. v. 14.</note> and shall neuer end, but shall last and indure for euer, when other kingdomes shall bee ouerthrowne, destroyed and extinct. Thirdly, Gods couenant made with the Iewes and Gentiles, <hi>viz. that hee will be their God, and the God of their seed,</hi> is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting and vnchangeable, therefore there must needs be some, in whom the couenant must bee ratified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. Lastly, Gods promises cannot lye, and his power can doe althings, and God doth nourish and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the church by his word and prouidence, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie and idolatry euery where preuaileth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Que.</hi> Had God any church and people in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the darkenesse of Poperie, when tyrants and false Teachers laboured, vtterly to roote it out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Yes, as may especially appeare, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.16. where the woman the Church <hi>flying into the wildernesse. i.</hi> to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnknowne, to the aduersaries, <hi>had a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreeh and three score dayes. i.</hi> they were nourished by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12 v. 7.</note> by hearing some true things of their owne Teachers, and partly by learning true faith and doctrine of other better teachers, partly by reading the holy scriptures, and by meditating and musing of it by themselues, and by conferring with others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Papists had some things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the true Church, as Baptisme (albeit not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether purely administred) the Scriptures, the Apostles Creede, the Commandements, the Lords prayer, and a certaine ministerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17258:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, in the ruinous state, darkenesse and Apostacie of a Church, the very reading and repeating of the word, yea, the very sound and report of it is (by Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary working) sufficient and effectuall to saue all those whom God will haue saued. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 20. &amp; 21. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.28.29.40.41 42. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 18.</p>
               <p>Lastly, God hath his Church and seed, euen in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> (albeit in faith and affection separated and disioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from her) <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.7. and these the Dragon maketh warre with; Likewise <hi>Apoc;</hi> 18.4. where Gods people are exhorted to come out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ergo,</hi> there were some elect, and some of Gods people there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Therefore may not we perswade our selues that many of our Ancestors and fore-fathers were saued in the middest of Poperie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Yes doubtlesse, as well as in the corrupt and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall time of <hi>Elias,</hi> for nothing hath in the Papacie befallen the Church which hath not befallen vnto it in times past.</p>
               <p>Secondly (besides the reasons expressed in the answer to the former question) many of them kept and held the principles and foundations of faith, and so rightly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their children, seruants, and families therein, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there haue beene some that haue alwayes and openly, by preaching, writing, and disputation, opposed and set themselues against the corruption of error, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.3.4.5.6.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.<note place="margin">Illyricus.</note> and this is also manifest by <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his catalogue of the witnesses of the truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, many thousand children Baptised (and so holy) dyed in their infancie and child-hood, before they could be infected and poysoned with the pestilence of error,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. v 14.</note> and so were saued.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, God pardoneth many faults and infirmities in his children, whose hearts and mindes are right with him. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Lastly, many of our Ancesto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> (albeit transported with

the common invndation of error) did before the end of this life, repent of their sin, and vtterly renounce and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their owne merites and all confidence in them, and relied vpon Christ onelie by true faith and so were saued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth God sometimes suffer his Church to bee brought into such affliction, darkenes &amp; extremities that the outward face of it cannot be seene and discerned?</p>
               <p>A. For two causes, first, because the world &amp; the wicked is,<note place="margin">Heb 11.38. Math. 21. vers. 41. and 43</note> 
                  <hi>altogither vnworthy</hi> of the fellowship of Gods Saints and the ministery of the word, and therefore God hath most iustly depriued them of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God for the preseruation of the Church will haue it sometimes to bee secret and vnknowne, for otherwise the world seeing it, would inuade and destroy it. Apoc. 12.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not lawfull, yea and sometimes expedient for a true and sound Christian, for the auoding of offence and the preseruation of his life, to dissemble his religion, and to goe to Masse and Idoll seruice?</p>
               <p>A. No, for first it is not sufficient for vs, to keepe our mindes free from assent vnto, and from approbation of idolatry, but wee must keepe our bodies vndefiled also 2. Cor. 7.1.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. v. 19 and 20</note> Secondly God created and Christ redeemed both soule and body, &amp; therefore wilbe serued with both.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God requireth not only the beliefe of the heart, but also the confession of the mouth yea and the outward gesture and action also; Rom. 10.9. Luk. 9.26. otherwise wee play the Hypocrites and God will discouer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vs.</p>
               <p>Forthly, the offence that Idolaters conceiue, is by them taken and not by vs giuen, and therefore we are not in this regard to respect them at all. Math. 15.12.13.14. And if we should communicate with them in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship we should both harden them in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and destroy, or (at least) weaken the faith of others; &amp; touching preuention of danger, we must vse no vnlawful means to diuert it, but commit our selues and cause vnto

               <p>Lastly in respect of maintenance of Gods glory our liues, yea, (if neede should require) our saluation should not be deare and pretious vnto vs. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11. and it is giuen vnto the true members of the Church (as a speciall priuiledge) not onely <hi>to beleeue in Christ but also to suffer for him.</hi>

               <p>The Scriptures are most plaine and pregnant for the demonstration of this principle. <hi>Romanes</hi> 9.11. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 1.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p>Further reasons to backe and fortifie this assertion are these, first all disposion of mans will followeth predes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, (as doth likewise faith and workes) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot possibly be any cause of it.</p>

               <p>More-ouer if Gods predestination were caused by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene faith and workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. v. 20.</note> then might an euident reason be giuen of it, which <hi>Paul</hi> vtterly denieth, and if workes could merit ought by their owne worthinesse, then grace should be destroyed, Gods glory empaired, and all the workes of our redemption obscured.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. v. 5 Rom. 19. v 23</note> Lastly, God hath chosen vs from <hi>euerlasting in himselfe, in Christ to the praise of his glorious grace,</hi> and hath made vs vessels of <hi>mercy, of gold and siluer, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 20 Therefore in the worke of our predestination and redemption, Gods mercy and goodnesse is all in all, and hath not any respect to any thing that is without, and not partaker of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and essence.</p>
               <p>It serueth to beate downe all pride and humane glory, and all confidence in any of our owne workes, because all the workes and glory of our saluation is from Gods grace and mercy onely, and not from our selues, or any thing in vs,<note place="margin">Math. 11.26</note>

               <p>Thirdly, the more meanes either of instruction, and mercy, or of threatnings and iudgements, GOD offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to soften and ouer-come their hardnesse, the more, they, by with-standing and resisting them, are harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirme the habite of their nature, and so growe <hi>worse and worse.</hi> And thus with <hi>Pharao</hi> they more harden their owne hearts, so that the sinne and fault resideth in themselues, and is not to bee imputed to God:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> In what respects doth God harden?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As it is an action, and iudgment, and a worke of iustice, and in respect of the end and euent, so God doth it, and is the author of it: As it is an action or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is good, for wee all haue our beeing and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from God, but the corruption and defect of the action, proceedeth from mans corrupt minde and will;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17258:19"/>
as it is a iudgment God is the author of it, thus hee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <hi>Pharoes</hi> heart, and doth by the ministerie of his word instrumentally harden the wicked. Lastly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the end and euent, which is his owne glory: and thus God in the hardening, blinding, and obstinacie of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tooke occasion to call and shew mercy to vs Gentiles, and thus hee turneth their hearts whether so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer pleaseth him, and doth mooue them to execute his owne iudgements; and thus God directed Sathans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, the Scribes and Pharisies enuie, <hi>Iudas</hi> his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and <hi>Pilate</hi> his iniustice, in killing the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the redemption of mankind, the instruments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no such matter, <hi>Isay.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> How doth God harden, and in what forme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Not by infusing malice, or instilling sinne into the delinquent, for he is iust, holy, and purity it selfe, and therefore he cannot but hate and punish it; but he doth it first, either by not imparting grace, or by with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his spirit from them, for God is not bound either to conferre grace vpon them which they want, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that they haue receiued. Hee is an absolute Lord, and a most free agent,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> hee hardeneth whom hee will, and sheweth mercie vpon whom hee will shew mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hardneth them by an outward action, that is, indirectly and accidentally, by casting and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting certaine outward things to their eyes, eares, and outward senses, whereby they might bee enlightned, mollified and saued. Of this kinde are <hi>preaching, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, miracles, benefites, warnings, threatnings, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> all these through their owne fault and want of faith, become hurtfull and dangerous vnto them: euen as good and strong wine,<note place="margin">A similitude.</note> is most vnholesome and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to a sicke man. Thus the gospell is the sauour of death to them, yea and a killing letter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God reiecteth and putteth into their minds and heartes good thoughts, principles and motions, which they peruert and turne to their owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thus God put into <hi>Caiphas</hi> his minde, <hi>That it was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17258:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
necessary that one should dye for the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. v. 50. &amp; 52</note> and to gather all the sonnes of God into one, and not that all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should perish.

                  <hi>I finde no harme in the man,</hi> was good and of God; but <hi>I will chastice him, &amp;c.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence but a bad conclusion, of himselfe and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euill. Now the cause why God offereth these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obiects vnto, and doth put these inward motions into men, whom hee knoweth will abuse them; is that his iustice might bee seene and acknowledged by their iniustice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by giuing successe to their endeuours, and by letting them prosper in sinne. Thus hee bad the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell goe and seduce <hi>Ahabs</hi> 400. false Prophets and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and thus <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pharao</hi> prospered in their wicked designes, but herein Gods end and scope, and their end and scope much differed. <hi>Isay.</hi> 10. v. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How can God bee said to blind the reprobate, seeing that many times, and in many places, hee offereth the light and brightnesse of his glorious gospell vnto them,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. v. 4.</note> which is a meane and instrument to informe and enlighten them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> First, they are blind by nature, and vncapable of the sauing trueth, and God is not indebted nor bound vnto them, who, albeit hee putteth blindnesse into no man, yet hee leaueth them therein, and doth not infuse light into them; so that the more meanes are vsed for their instruction and illumination, the more they are hardened and blinded; for euen as the Owle by the brightnesse of the Sunne is blinded,<note place="margin">Similitudes.</note> albeit all other birds are enlightned by it, and as the Claye is harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the same Sunne by which the waxe is softned and melted: so by the same holy Scripture and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gospell, whereby the Elect are enlightened and conuerted, the reprobate are blinded and hardened, and that onely through their owne default and impotency,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17258:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not through the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in his iustice (now euery action of iustice hath in it the nature and respect of God) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the punishment of sinne, doth by further blindnesse and hardenesse of heart, punish their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and stubborne rebellion, which they haue and doe most greedily drinke in, and draw vpon themselues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so much that they winke with their eyes purposely, and will not see and acknowledge the trueth shining forth vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> In <hi>Isay</hi> the Lord fore-telleth but a particuler iudgement, and why is it here generally applyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First, the rule of iustice and equitie, is one and the same with God in euery age, and therefore hee may according to the proportion and number of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses, as well punish many of the Iewes in <hi>Pauls</hi> time and sithence, as some particulers in <hi>Isaiahs</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their sinne and contumacie since Christ his comming hath beene more generall and grieuous, then the sinnes of all their ancestors, therefore it is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to bee punished.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the punishments of particuler men in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, serue for generall lessonings and warnings vnto vs, that except wee repent and beleeue, wee are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like iudgements, and so looke to drinke of the same cup.</p>

               <p>Secondly, they are counteruailed, yea infinitely excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with sinnes both of commission and omission: but true righteousnesse and happinesse is onely to be sought and found in Christ Iesus, as hee is reuealed and set forth vnto vs in holy writ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 47.</p>

               <p>Secondly, when they did wish eternall destruction to the enemies of God, they did not (to speake properly) pray against their persons, but against the kingdome of sinne and satan in them, which cannot bee altogither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied, but by the confusion of the members and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:17258:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly their praiers and imprecations proceeded only from pure zeale of Gods glory and iustice, and not from any priuate distemper, or mixture of humane passion, for they considered them not as their owne enemies but as the enemies and blasphemours of God.</p>

               <p>Secondly, when we pray that the kingdome of God may come, we, (by consequence) pray that sinne Satan and all his members may be destroied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee are to pray that Gods iustice may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and magnified in the plagues, punishments and ruine of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Fourthly we must loue God aboue al men whatsoeuer, and if we sincerely loue God, we cannot choose but hate his enemies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First we must pray against Gods enemies in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for there are, and will alwaies be many such, whom God will neuer saue.</p>
               <p>Secondly against their wicked counsailes, plots and purposes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.31.</note> and thus <hi>Dauid</hi> praied that God would turne the counsaile of <hi>Ahitophell</hi> into foolishnesse and thus

the Apostles praied against the counsailes of the Scribes and Pharasies,<note place="margin">Act. 4. v. 29 &amp; 30.</note> that charged them with threatnings that they should not preach in the name of Iesus but we must not pray against these persons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we must pray conditionally, against them, that if they be reprobates and so incurable, they may be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and iustly condemned, but if they be elect, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent curable, they may bee fatherly corrected and so conuerted and saued.</p>

               <p>Wee, here from <hi>Pauls</hi> practice and paines in the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this ministery, learne, wherein the dignitie,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17258:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ornament and true honor of the ministery doth consist, not so much in titles, pompe, prebends, multiplication of benefices, glorious apparrell, eminencie and superiority of place; (albeit there is and needes must bee an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and difference of order and degrees, in the ministers for composing of controuersies and auoyding of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) as in diligence of teaching, in aduancing true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, doctrine and life, and in winning many to Christ. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>The reasons hereof are these. First God hath ordained them and their calling to this end <hi>Act.</hi> 26. and if they execute it not their sinne is greeuous and their iudgment most fearefull. Secondly hereby Gods name is magnified amongst men; and the sweet oyntment and smell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his gospell is dispersed farre and wide. Thirdly they confirme their ministery and comfort their soules here, and gaine addition of glory in the life to come. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The vse hereof is first to taxe and condemne the couetous, idle, worldly, vitious, vnteaching, dumbe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and negligent ministers, who because either they do not Gods worke at all (especially in preaching, or els<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their functions very negligently, are subiect and lie open to Gods curse, and are to answere for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of so many soules as perish through their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, <hi>Hier.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. and 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>26.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Vse.</hi> Secondly ministers neglecting all other by-matters that nothing concerne them, and the hunting and hauking after worldly goods and glory must striue with all diligence to performe their duties, and to make this their onely scope and marke to spread Christ his gospell farre and neere, and so to conuert and saue soules. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 18.</p>

               <p>This sympathy and indulgent affection appeared most notably in Christ Iesus in weeping ouer the Cittie Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and bewayling the aproching ruine of it, it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly also discouered it selfe towards <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, whom hee so much respected and had such a prouident care of,<note place="margin">Act. 9. v. 21.22.23.</note> and here it (as in other places) appeared most eminently in <hi>Paul, who with the often hazard of his owne life, labored the Iewes conuersion.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Two sorts. First, those that be ingrafted into the Church by the tenor and authoritie of the Generall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant onely, whereby God promiseth that hee will be their God, and the God of their seede,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.28. &amp; 29.</note> but yet are not elected, for euery one that is <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonne according to the flesh, is not a sonne of promise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they that indeed receiue the seede of the word [as many reprobates doe] but they mixe it not with faith, and it hath no roote in them, neither are they renued and inwardly changed by it. The word in these may be, and soone is either vtterly lost, or else choaked and peruerted, and so they may be cut off, and fall away finally and wholy.</p>
               <p>And (to conclude all in a word,) they are only &amp; alone cut and broken off, that are <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonnes according to the flesh onely [as the body of the Iewes generally were in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and sithence] but the sonnes of promise, or <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonnes by faith neuer are, nor euer can bee broken off, bee their number neuer so small, nor their temptations neuer so great and permanent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Quest.</hi> How are men ingrafted into the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First, by an outward calling, and by an outward profession and approbation of the word and sacraments. Secondly by Baptisme, as a seale of our adoption and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or matriculation into the Church. Thirdly, by the testimony and in the opinion of the Church, and so may a reprobate or hypocrite be ingrafted. Fourthly, in Gods

secret counsell and by the spirrit of faith and seale of Gods holy and spirit. hereby men with a prepared and sanctified hart receiue Gods word and keepe it, these alone Christ draweth vnto him and inwardly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and transnatureth them vntill hee perfect them and bring them to the end of their hope, that is, the saluation of their soules. and thus are the Elect onely ingrafted and therefore can neuer perish.</p>

               <p>The reason hereof is, for that the anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God goeth with it, and temporall plagues and punishments (which are but forerunners of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting iudgement otherwise) surprize and ceaze vppon vs.<note place="margin">Math. 23.23.</note>

               <p>Secondly all our faith and profession without works and fruites is not sincere and sound before God, but cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and counterfeyt.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can predestination bee eternall and certaine, seeing that it dependeth vpon mans beleefe or vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Our beliefe or vnbeliefe dependeth vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, for they that are elected to eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. and they that are eternall refused, cannot beleeue nor obey the Gospell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore predestination dependeth not on it, for the second causes hang on the first, that is the decree of God and not the first on the second.</p>
               <p>Secondly our engrafting into the Church dependeth not vpon our owne power and free-will, but onely vpon the power of God and his mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee must distinguish of the times. The Iewes that liue in one time or age, may bee generally reiected, but not so in another, (especially) when their fulnesse shall (as wee daily expect and pray for) come into the Church, and they bee by faith <hi>Abahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apostle speaketh not of euery perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular but of the people and nation in generall. Lastly, their duetie is shewed vs that they ought not to please themselues in their ignorance and vnbeleife, but

               <p>The reason herof is, first because God is almighty, and therefore nothing is or can bee done in the world, but by his decree and knowledge, effectual working, or (at least) by his effectual permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: secondly God sitteth not idle in heauen, (as Epicures &amp; others vainly imagin) but alwaies worketh &amp; doth care for and order the things of men, preparing and propounding rewards to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reseruing and prouiding punishments for the wicked. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. &amp; 13.3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 4, 1.20.21.22.23.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In all probability it is like to follow the burning and destruction of Rome, for then the stumbling blocks y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Papists offer them, by their imagery, inuocation of Saints, Latine seruice, and abhominable and most sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse transubstantiation, shalbe remoued &amp; taken away.</p>
               <p>Secondly (as it apeareth in the 18. and 20. cap. of <hi>Iohns</hi> Apocalips, (there shalbe some reasonable distance of time betweene the burning of Rome and the end of the worlde, in which it is most consonant to truth that the Iewes shalbe called, for their conuersion in the last generall signe &amp; fore-runner of Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming so far forth as the scripture reuealeth vnto vs.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17258:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Countries in which they dwell, and into which they are dispersed or shall then be found inhabiting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They are likely neuer to recouer it, for they haue no such promise, neither haue they any possiblity of meanes to compasse it. Secondly Christes comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them shall not be <hi>visible but spirituall,</hi> not from the Earthly <hi>Sion,</hi> which long sithence hath bene made deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but from his spirituall <hi>Sion</hi> of his Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>Lastly it is most probable and likely that they shal bee conuerted in those countries into which they are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in which they haue their residence.</p>
               <p>For first we haue some smal beginnings (here &amp; there) of it. Secondly they shall better and sooner by by their <hi>zeale and example reuiue</hi> the faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It cannot be vnderstood of an vniuersall inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the whole world at the time of the Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion:<note place="margin">Act. 1.8. Colos. 1.6.

               <p>But that the Gospell should now the second time bee divulged and published ouer the whole world, wee haue neither reason, Scripture, nor commission, for it. For first Apostolicall callings and gifts (which are necessary for so great a worke) are many hundred yeares sithence ceased. Secondly at Christs comming there shall bee <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no faith</hi> that is sound Doctrine and zeale left vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earth,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> and yet Christs comming will follow soone after the calling of the Iewes. Thirdly it may be, that the Gospell may bee reulued in many kingdomes

and countries where it was planted long before, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in and nearer the places wherein the Iewes haue and shall haue there residence and habitation at there generall calling, but it shall not be generall, much lesse vniuersall. They therefore that looke for an vniuersall preaching, many sooner behold Christ comming in the clouds, then haue their expectation satisfied.</p>

               <p>From this sampling,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> and paralleling of both places and members together this doctrine naturally ariseth. In the order of saluation the Iewes and Gentiles are like and equall, and by nature children of wrath, and enemies to God, but they by grace and mercy onely, and not any merit of their owne, are called, conuerted and saued. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>For first, God in sauing and conuerting all, is one and the same, without change and alteration, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of his law for conuincement and direction, and the Gospell for faith and conuersion is alwayes one, and the same.

                  </note>In the matter of our iustification, vocation, saluation, Gods mercie is onely seene, and neither Iewe nor Gentile are saued otherwise then by his fauour and mercie. <hi>Titus,</hi> 3. v. 4.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. v. 3.4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. v. 20.8.7.24.12.</p>
               <p>The reason hereof is, first, because Iewes and Gentiles are alike guilty before Gods iudgement seate, as it hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is bound and beholding to none, for who hath giuen him any thing, but it shall be recompenced? And therfore al whom he saueth, he saueth by his meere mercy and grace, and not for any matter or merit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could find in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Vse.</hi> Here is condemned the grosse and palpable error of those which thinke that (in the processe of time) all shal be saued, <hi>yea</hi> the very diuels, as <hi>Origine</hi> dotingly dreamed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fewest are elected, called, iustified, and none shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but they, and this will the last iudgement make manifest to all the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Vse.</hi> It serueth also to ouerthrow &amp; refute the fond &amp; false opinion of al mans merits, for we receiue all things from Gods meer mercy, and there is no place for mens deserts and merites.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vse.</hi> Thirdly, wee must not abuse and peruert GODS mercies, to the lust and libertie of the flesh, for his mercie is proper and reserued for them that feare him and are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased in them-selues for their sins, &amp; not for such lewd and presumptious minded Libertines that haue no feare of God before their eyes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though with the Saints of God in Scripture wee sometimes (through Satans suggestion and our owne frailtie and negligence) fall into many great and grieuous sins, yet we must neuer dispaire of Gods mercies, but repent whiles we haue time, and by faith apply them to our selues. For they are bottomelesse, most plentious, and neuer faile them that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent and beleeue.</p>

               <p>Gods waies and iudgements in this place are taken for his secret will, which hee reserueth to him-selfe, and which no man is to inquire into, for it is bottomelesse gulfe, and will drowne them, and a flame that may not be come vnto but wil burne them, it is the Arke that may not be looked into. But for his reuealed will which he hath manifested in Scripture, all sorts of people are commanded to search, learne and know: prouided that they keepe them within the boundes of sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and do not measure misticall and supernaturall things by the scantling and shallownesse and humaine reason.</p>

               <head>The wisdome and knowledge of God.</head>
               <p>The doctrine, that we learne hence is that God being most wise, and knowing all things doth not onely see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template them, as they are, or may be, but doth contriue them with singular reason and counsell, and dispose them in most goodly forme, waight, number and measure, so that nothing in his workes may seeme to be wanting or disordered, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing superfluous or ouer much, but all in an excellent temper and symetry. And hence God is sayd, to be wise in heart. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.4. nay only wise. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. For he alone by himselfe is infinitely wise, needing no mans instruction or information. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Iob.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi>

                  </gap>3. &amp;c. Now this wisdome of God shineth forth chiefely in the principall workes of God, namely in the creation, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and gouernment of the world, in the gouerning &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of man-kinde. <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.15. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.28.

               <p>The first reason hereof is, for that the infinite wisdome and glory of God appeareth in this, that his iudgements and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, (especially in matters of predestination and reprobation, and of particular euents and of the moments and times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) are conceiled and kept from vs.<note place="margin">2 Ch. 32. v. 21</note> God will not (as <hi>Ezechias</hi> foolishly and vainely did shew all his riches and treasures to the Babilonish ambassadours) God I say wil not in this world impart and communicate his in-most counsailes to any but by the euent only.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, because God in dispensing of matters, hath hidden contraries as it were vnder contraries. <hi>viz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ends vnder contrarie means, life vnder death, glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shame, riches vnder pouerty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.9.10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.25.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> God in the decreeing and disposing al things, and in procuring mans saluation needeth no counsail, vseth no mans aduice, but doth all thinges according to his owne good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp; after the counsaile of his owne wil, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115 v. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. v. 5.9.</p>
               <p>The reason hereof is, because he is omnipotent, most wise, and God all sufficient vndependent of any other, and of whom all persons, and thinges, haue their beeing and dependance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, GOD doth act and put in execution nothing in time but that which hee purposed and decreed before all times,<note place="margin">Pro. 8.</note> for otherwise he could not be wisdome it selfe, neither could the Sonne of God, his wisdome be, begotten before the Creation of the world.</p>

               <p>God is debter and beholding vnto no man, and no man can alledge any seruice worke or study whereby he bindeth God to himselfe,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 8.4.</note>Reason hereof. No man can ad any thing to God, for all that we haue, we receiue it onely from Gods mercy, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon his goodnesse for it <hi>Psa.</hi> 16.2.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reason: Gods power, will and decree, is free and absolute and hath no respect or relation to any thing from without his essence whatsoeuer. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Vse.</hi> If God should (for our correction or triall) depriue &amp; bereaue vs of wife, children, health, liuelihood, goods, houses (as he did his good seruant <hi>Iob</hi>) we must stay and comfort our selues herein,<note place="margin">Math<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.15.</note> for all these thinges are Gods, they were giuen vs by him, and therefore they are not ours, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may iustly doe with his owne what seemeth good to his diuine will and pleasure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vse.</hi> Here all humaine merits and fore-seene workes in the patriarkes and fore-fathers and their posterity, are debarred from any mouing or procuring cause of GODS fauour and mercy, declared vnto Iew or Gentile: for of them-selues men can doe nothing that is good, and therefore all proceedeth from Gods meere mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly in matter of reprobation none hath cause to be offended with God or to complaine of his proceedings, for his power and authority is free, and absolute, and he supreme of al creatures, and he may dispose of them as best seemeth good vnto his heauenly wisdome, and he is not to render any reason of his doings to any.</p>
               <p>Lastly the very Reprobates are ordained in Gods decree &amp; (touching the euent) to shew forth GODS glory as well as others,<note place="margin">Rom: 9.22.</note> for the glory of his Iustice shalbe manifested in and vpon them.</p>

               <p>He is our Shepheard how then can we want any thing? He hath Heauen and Earth at commaund and how then can his be destitute of that which is good for them? he was perfect and complet in him-selfe before the creation, and therefore his workes ad nothing to his owne nature and essence: and (to conclude) he worketh all things both in wordly and spirituall matters according to the pleasure of his owne will only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or restraint.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore in no danger, temptation and necessty be daunted and discouraged,<note place="margin">Psal. 23.1.</note> for our God whom we serue is able to saue and deliuer vs, he knoweth how to proceed, and he is a most faithfull creator and an indulgent father vnto vs, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let vs betrust him with the ordering of our affaires, and commend and betake our selues, liues maintenance and affaires vnto his gratious disposition, and he will neuer faile, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs.</p>
