            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE NOBLE
CAVALIER
CARACTERISED,
AND A REBELLIOUS
CAVILLER
CAUTERISED.</head>
            <byline>By JOHN TAYLOR.</byline>
            <p>TO begin roundly, soundly, and profoundly, The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
is a Gentleman, a Commander on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe;
The <hi>Caviller</hi> is a Rascall, whether he swim,
go, or ride; the <hi>Cavalier</hi> dares fight and be valiant,
obey Law, and serve for his Soveraigne, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
for the true Religion established, for the
Lawes, for the Subjects Liberty, for the Rights and Priviledges of
Parliaments, and for the peace, conservation and tranquillity of all
these he will send his best blood, and life too, and thinke them well
spent; the <hi>Caviller</hi> dares quarrell, but not fight, he dares rebell and
not <hi>obey,</hi> he transformes his obedience into refractory contempt,
his <hi>love</hi> into loathing of Loyalty; his Religion into false hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Faction, the service of his King he translates into Treason, his
service to his Countrey is his Countries ruine, his seeming to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Lawes, is on purpose to be lawlesse, the Subjects Right
and Liberty he metamorphiseth into oppression, slavery and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments he destroyes with
defending, and against the peace of all these he will plot, contrive,
invent, contemplate, meditate, slander, lye, write, raile, libell, and
do or say any thing but what is just, true, and honest.</p>
            <p>All which Villanies are so contrary to a <hi>cavalier,</hi> that a greater
disparity is not betwixt Light and Darknesse, or between <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Belial</hi>; and although the blacke mouth'd, venom'd tooth'd <hi>Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
doth dayly seek to sully and blast the name of a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
on them the sweet stinking Epithites and Titles of <hi>Damme,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51372:2"/>
renounce, consume, confound, sinke, and the like execrable Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which indeed are inexcusable, and inevitably damnable; yet I
must be so plain with the <hi>Caviller,</hi> as to tell him that <hi>Lot's</hi> Incest was
no excuse for <hi>Achan's</hi> Theft, <hi>Cain's</hi> committing Murder was no
warrant for <hi>Achitophel</hi> to give treacherous Counsell, nor was <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheka's</hi>
blasphemy any president for the lying hypocrisie of <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi>; no more are the detestable and damnable Oathes with
which the <hi>Caviller</hi> doth charge and scandall the <hi>Cavalier,</hi> any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
to move or maintain lying, dissimulation, cheating, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can I believe the saint seeming <hi>Caviller,</hi> that the <hi>Cavalier</hi>
hath taken all the prophane swearing from him, for if he will but
call his seared, cauterized Conscience to a strict examination, it will
tell him, that he hath sworne an Oath of Allegiance to be loyall to
his King, which Oath is recorded in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the breach of it is
to be punished in <hi>Hell,</hi> of the violation of which Oath the <hi>Cavalier</hi>
is guiltlesse, and the <hi>Caviller</hi> most damnably guilty.</p>
            <p>We must with humble thankfulnesse confesse the great blessings
which the Almighty hath been graciously pleased to multiply upon
the learned and pious paines taking of our Preachers, for they do
preach and exhort to the amendment of life and manners; they do
pray to the God of peace for the peace of God, and they do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
and invocate the Throne of Grace, for the Conversion of
all cavilling contentious Preachers, and all the rest of malicious and
ignorant seduced <hi>Cavillers,</hi> that (seeing their errouts) they may
heartily and unfeignedly repent for their Rebellions and Treasons,
<hi>against the Lord and against his Anointed.</hi> Those Preachers have so
prevailed in their good endeavours, that they have and daily do beat
down swearing, and wound the Consciences of the swearers with
the Sword of the Spirit, so that the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> can afford the <hi>Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
and their holy Armies all their Oathes, and their Drunkennesse
too, although it is manifestly known that you have been alwayes
provided, by the helpe of your Grand Signiour of the Lower blacke
House, to furnish all the Armies in Christendome with those accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
conditions.</p>
            <p>It was never known that all <hi>Souldiers</hi> should be found to be All
<hi>Saints,</hi> or that a whole Army consisted of none but godly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons, some may be drawn (out of blinde zeale) by opinion
and imagined good intents; also there are great numbers that beare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51372:2"/>
Armes more for company than conscience, more for spoile and
plunder than for the Cause which they seem to stand for; some
plunged deep in Debts run to the Warres for Acquittances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
pay their Creditours with cutting their throats; some servants
and Apprentices turne raw Souldiers, to free themselves from their
Master's command; some Fellons, Ravishers, Man slayers and
Murderers, run to the Warres to escape the Hangman; and of all
these virtuous sorts of Vermin is the <hi>Cavillers</hi> whole Force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted,
whose Leaders and Abetters are ambitious, pernicious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitious,
malicious, seditious, not caring how long these miserable
calamities of Warre endure, so that by their Trickes, Sleights,
Votes, Excises, Plunderings, Robberies, and extorting Taxations,
they make <hi>England</hi> like a Mill, and themselves (like thievish Millers)
may imperiously and securely take trible Toll of the Goods and
Estates of all the English Protestants, and loyallest Subjects in the
Kingdome, or of as much as their usurping Power can lay hold on.
But their zealous Pulpit men have so rooted them in the rudiments
of Rebellion, that they are perswaded that their Cause is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
their being beaten is victorious, and if they be killed, their
deaths are <hi>glorious</hi>; but if they understood, that he that desperately
runnes himselfe into forbidden wickednesse (as Rebellion and
Treason is) doth precipitate himselfe into needlesse dangers, and if
he catch his death in the action, (for ought I know) he is so farre
from a reward of future glory, as any of the Devils Martyrs are
from eternall happinesse.</p>
            <p>Moreover the <hi>Cavalier</hi> hath a naturall and earnest desire to better
his condition, he hath that discretion as not to wish himselfe worse
to day than he was yesterday, &amp; desires to be better to morrow than
he is to day; whilest the <hi>Caviller</hi> followes the Devil's rule, that as
he hath been bad, so it is his safest way to be worse, and that to be
worst of all is his securest defence, his surest Guard being to
defend old wickednesses with new villanies, and former trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
with quotidian iniquities, for many do go to the Warres,
not to lose their old faults but to gain fresh and new ones; and as the
<hi>Caviller</hi> holds himselfe to be a Subject out of curtesie not consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
so the <hi>Cavalier</hi> doth know himselfe bound to be a true Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to his King, not out of curtesie but conscience. The <hi>caviller</hi>
amplifies the casuall slips and frailties of other men, and selfe-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly
extenuates his own grosse enormities, he is quicke-sighted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51372:3"/>
to spy a mote, but purblinde in discerning a beame, he will out-face
a man that the smallest <hi>Geneva</hi> Print are the greatest Capital Letters,
and that the roaring voyce of <hi>sientor,</hi> is but the squeling of a <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>;
the <hi>Cavalier</hi> knowes his own faults to be greatest, and could
be as contented to be quiet honourably, as to fight valiantly, he hath
honest and unstained reputation besides a life to lose; whilest the
<hi>Cavillers</hi> and their memorable Members of infamous and impious
remembrances may bravely persist in Rebellion, for they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to lose that is good, except the stolne Goods of the King and
Kingdomes; they cannot lose Honour, for that is lost already, and
forfeited by Rebellion and most horrid Treason; they cannot lose a
Gentleman, for their Gentility is gone hand in hand with the lost
Honour; they cannot lose a Protestant, for they have none of that
Religion to be killed, except they murder them; nor can they lose
a good Subject, for there is not one in their Armies: they may lose
Traitours, Rebells, Thieves, Anabaptists, Brownists, Libertines,
Hypocrites, Schismatickes, Separatists, Cheaters, and Cuckolds,
but for them to lose an honest man is as impossible as to paint an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>
or make the <hi>Moon</hi> a new Coat.</p>
            <p>So that in this case the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> are at an exceeding great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
to fight with those unkinde kinde of Creatures, for they
adventure <hi>Pearles</hi> against <hi>Pebles,</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> to <hi>Dirt,</hi> a thousand
pound to a nut-shell, and a large Kingdome to a small Mole-hill.</p>
            <p>Indeed the inveterate hatred and malice of the <hi>Cavillers</hi> is no
longer than they live, but (in their own life time) it extends towards
the dead, for they have barbarously entred into Churches, (which
are dedicated to the Service of God, and consecrated onely for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Divine Services) and there they have not onely torne and
broken down all Ornaments of Order and comely Decency, but
also they have rased Tombes, Sepulchres, Statues, Monuments,
Bones, Eschucheons, Armes, Hatchments, and any thing that was
either erected, engraven, carved, or insculped as most reverend
Memories of the dead, the least part of which irreligious inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
would never have entred into the thought of the most savage
Heathens, Pagans, Infidels, Cannibals, Atheists, <hi>Anthropophagi</hi> or
Devils.</p>
            <p>But note, and with horrour and trembling consider, how the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance hath suddenly confounded some of those malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or mislead Wretches, a few of which fearfull Examples I will
truly relate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51372:3"/>It is not long since, that a sincere senselesse Church-warden at the
Town of <hi>Teuxbury</hi> (in the yeare of his Reigne) caused a stone-Crosse in the
Church-yard to be pulled down, and in the upper part of it, wherein was
graven or carved the Figures of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> remembrance <hi>Crucified,</hi>
with the Formes of two persons weeping at the foot of the Crosse, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the extreme greifes and dolours which then afflicted the blessed
Virgin, and Evangelist Saint <hi>John</hi>; which part of the Crosse M. Church-warden
caused to be hewen by a Mason into a Hog-trough, (he being of
the race of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> and loved his <hi>Swine</hi> better than any memory of his
<hi>Redeemer</hi>) but within two or three dayes all his Hogges and hoggish Beasts
were strucken dead, his Wife ran mad, his Children, one was drowned,
and himselfe strook with a miserable languishing Disease, and died a
wretched spectacle, or admirable miracle of misery.</p>
            <p>Another that boldly adventured to climbe up to pull down the <hi>Crosse</hi> in
<hi>Cheap-side,</hi> but he slipped his hold-fast, and fell with his ribbes upon the
iron pikes or grate which encompast the Crosse, so that he was wounded
to death with the fall.</p>
            <p>Also, at <hi>Worcester,</hi> a fellow would take upon him to teare down the
<hi>Organs,</hi> and he fell from the top of them down upon the pavement of
the Church, and brake his bones, that he presently died.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the Rebelis were there 1642. they most
insolently marched through the Streets, and impiously one of their Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones
shot at the Figures of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and
with the shot beat and battered off the heads and faces of the harmelesse
Figures, but he presently fell from his Horse, to the great endangering of
a neck-breaking.</p>
            <p>Another, the same time shot at the Similitude of <hi>Christ,</hi> over the Gate
of <hi>All-Soule: Colledge,</hi> and his Piece brake and split and shivered his hand
in pieces.</p>
            <p>Also at <hi>Merton Colledge,</hi> another impudent Varlet did the like, but his
powder-bagge being open, a sparke of his Match fell into it, which set
fire on his Powder, and blew out both his eyes. And but for two of these
three Villanies, I would not have mentioned any of them, but that I knew
one Master <hi>Thomas Rogers</hi> a Chirurgian (deceased) in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had them
in Cure, and he whose hand was torne was cured (though maimed) the
other had one of his eyes recovered: and these Examples are sufficient to
deterre and hold mens hands from impious Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>Moreover (to seasen all the rest) I must not omit the zeale of a devout
Brother, whose name is <hi>Francis Beale,</hi> (dwelling in the <hi>Axe-yard</hi> in <hi>Kings</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51372:4"/>
               <hi>Street, Westminster.</hi>) this <hi>Beale</hi> was sometimes an Ale-house-keeper and
Tobacco-man, that with pot and pipe, nicke, froath, puffe, and whiffe,
gat a devillish deale of money, by punishing, cheating, and beggering of
Drunkards; then he gave over that kinde of life, and was a Porter to the
Lady <hi>Kincleavin,</hi> since when he is turned Gentleman, and contributary
bountifull Rebell; this <hi>Beale</hi> hath a son at mans estate, (a proper honest
man) who left father, mother, Sectarisme and Rebellion, and hath long
served in His Majesties Army, (which his father and mother hold to be
Apostasie) and she good old Gentlewoman, with griefe and sorrow that
her son was so undutifull as to be a Protestant, and a good Subject, she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Bill to be written to have him prayed for in the Church, which Bill
was delivered in <hi>Martin's</hi> Church neare <hi>Chearing-Crosse,</hi> to the famous
Master <hi>Case,</hi> the Lecturer there on <hi>Thursdayes</hi>; the Forme of the Bill was
as followeth. <hi>These are to desire you to take into your Christian considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the griefe and sorrow of one Mistris</hi> Beale <hi>of</hi> Westminster, <hi>whose son</hi>
Francis Beale <hi>is fallen away from grace, and serves the King in his Warres.
Wherefore she most humbly beseecheth the prayers of this Congregation, that
he may returne and be converted.</hi> But this kinde Gentlewoman was not so
fixed to <hi>Brownisme, Anabaptisme,</hi> or <hi>Round-headisme,</hi> but that within
these few yeares she was in hope that her hypocriticall going to heare
Masse at the Queenes Chappell at <hi>Denmarke</hi> House, would have been the
meanes to have made her either a Nurse, a Rocker, or a necessary Chaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
to the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> but though she failed of her Office, there
was an old Knight, with a great feather, no haire, and so much wit that he
entertained her all night (for her better edification in the Catholique
Cause) in imitation of the Signe where she dwelt, [An Axe cutting of a
Feather] by this you may perceive how constant the Creature is in any
Religion. I have read that <hi>George,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> King of
<hi>Hungaria,</hi> were at deadly Warre for Religion, and after much blood shed,
the Kings having each of them a Foole or a Jester, they agreed that their
Fooles should have a single Combate at Buffets, and which of them wan
the Victory at Cuffes, that both the Kings should be of the same Religion
with the Conquerour; and such as this was the zeale of Mistris <hi>Beale</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands more shallow-brain'd, malicious, ignorant, and seduced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are Rebells for Religion, when as (God knowes) there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for Rebellion, nor can they shew any Reason why or wherefore
they are thus mad against all obedience, order, and loyalty to God and their
Soveraigne.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>But as poore silly Sheep run all together,</l>
               <l>And in confusion send they know not whether;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51372:4"/>So those mad People, pray, disburse, and fight,</l>
               <l>Not knowing truths from lyes, or wrong from right:</l>
               <l>The Multitude like Dogges with open jawes,</l>
               <l>One bawles cause t'other barkes, yet knowes no cause:</l>
               <l>Aske Rebells what's the reason they rebell,</l>
               <l>And aske Dogges why they barke, They cannot tell.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thus with the deluding and threatenings of lying Lecturers, and princ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lyes, the Gates of <hi>London</hi> are shut and guarded so strongly, that Truth
or Honesty can get no entrance, for it is a most dangerous thing for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
or a true subject to live there; they may be perhaps perswaded to
have a King, but they would have that King to have no Kingdome, they
might be brought to call Him their Soveraigne Lord, but withall that he
shall be without any Dominion, and they may be entreated to be called his
subjects, provided that he will be subject to them; but I advise them,
that as they have made bold to call themselves a Parliament, and been
bolder to make a counterfeit Great Seale, so they may fill up the measure
of their iniquities, and (by Master <hi>Prinnes</hi> Law) by as good right make a
fresh and new counterfeit King; or if no man will be so impudent or inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to accept it, take a suit of <hi>John Pym's</hi> cloathes well brush'd, pick'd,
and lowsed, and stuffe it with straw, which being placed in the Throne
will be a suitable Soveraigne to support the power of your Seale, Orders,
Votes, and pretended Soveraigne Power of your Vtopian Parliament.
If rebellious and bewitched <hi>London</hi> would with her many headed, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
Beasts, but examine themselves truly of two things, they would then
perceive what falsities the grand <hi>Cavillers</hi> have blinded them withall,
and to what misery their cavilling hath brought them, and (if God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
not) will bring them into irremediable destruction. The first thing
I wish them to call their consciences to an account of, is, <hi>why they were
Rebells at all?</hi> The second is, <hi>wherefore they do obstinately and execrably
continue in Rebellion?</hi> If every <hi>Caviller</hi> would catechise himselfe, they
would finde that <hi>they have wandred in vanity, and followed after Lyes.</hi>
They would hang down their heads with shame, and acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
worthy to be hanged for their treacherous disobedience, and open
hostile Treasons against so good and gracious a Soveraigne, they would
then consider to what a ruinous Desolation they have brought this famous
flourishing Kingdome, whose Government was admired and honoured
through the whole world; till now of late a multitude of mis-begotten
and worse bred Rebells have done their best and worst to bring all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
For which wicked purposes they have made bold to make <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51372:5"/>
their counterfeit poste, poste-horse and pack-horse, who under the
names of <hi>Civicus, Britannicus, Scoutes, Scottish Pigeons,</hi> and other pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ill-contrived, sweet, filthy, sophisticated Titles and Epithites, hath
beswarmed all the Christian world over with English Lyes, written by as
very Villaines as could be spew'd from the bottomlesse Pit, disperst by as
arrant Rogues as ever dropped into the Hangmans budget, and believed
and countenanced by none but malicious Traitours, superstitious, nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Schismatickes, or ignorant logger-heads, the fruits, and damnable
events that have been produced from these Diabolicall practices. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
the <hi>Cavalier</hi> knowing his cause just, applies himselfe onely to Truth,
both in fighting and writing, they have used three sorts of Christian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
to the <hi>Cavillers,</hi> in a charitable desire to conforme them. First,
they have given them kinde admonitions, wherein they have told them
truly, that the <hi>Publique Faith</hi> in which they have too much confided is no
Faith either to be saved by, or to be made savers; they have further adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
them to beware of Sects, and believing seditious Counsels, because
they were motives to <hi>Rebellion, which is as the sin of Witchcraft,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
15. 23. Secondly, when <hi>Admonition</hi> would do no good with these <hi>Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> did take a little stiffer course, and from <hi>exhortation</hi> they
fell to <hi>reprehension,</hi> telling them roundly that they were seduced and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by feares, flatteries and jealousies out of their earthly estates and lives,
and extremely hazarding the losse of a better life to come. But when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde <hi>Admonition,</hi> or wholesome <hi>Reprehension</hi> would worke upon
their perfidious and benummed consciences, then were the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
(for their own safety) to take defensive Armes, and to use the
meanes to save the <hi>Cavillers</hi> soules, by beating them Northerly, Westerly,
and most brotherly both in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England</hi>; and by those wayes to bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
them out of their bad conditions into better manners: to this end and
purpose, the <hi>Cavalier</hi> party have not onely used the Spirituall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Swords, but also they have with their pennes so banged and basted
their libellous and rebellious forgeries, and ridiculous fopperies, that their Ballad-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
and Pamphletteers are defunct, the bright lustre of Truth hath eclipsed them and
gulleries, so that like rotten Sheep they would be glad to sculke under a hedge for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and it is manifest that the Pen of a true Writer will cut keener than a Sword,
when a lying, scandalous Knave cuts his own throat with his own Goose Quill.</p>
            <p>Of the which scribling number, the nine times thrice valiant, conquering, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Captain <hi>George Withers</hi> hath written a pretty, foolish, witty, loyall, traiterous
Book called <hi>Campo Musae,</hi> composed of the two most delicate Simples, Flattery and
