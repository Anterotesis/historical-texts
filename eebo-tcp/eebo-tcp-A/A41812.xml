            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR Right or Wrong, ſo we Call all. Not that we Believe they will be ſo, but becauſe we would have them ſo. For when a Man hath been at no ſmall Pains (at leaſt as he thinks) for the Benefit of Others, he is very prone to expect, as his due, a Return of Kindneſs or Candour: But on the otber Hand, He, who is at the trouble to Peruſe, takes it to be his Privilege to Judge; and ſo far he judgeth rigbt, if he proceed not further, thinking he cannot be a Judge, unleſs he be malicious; And that the Buſineſs of Reading a Book is to find or make more Faults then there is, not to make an honeſt Advantage of what may be found uſeful. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Score, he that Adventures on the Preſs, brings Himſelf like a Bear to a Stake, where though he may Fancy he Creates Others great Diverſion, yet He himſelf is ſure to be the Sufferer, and becomes liable to be Baited at every ones pleaſure. But be it as it will, I have wrote my Thoughts freely, and I Envy no Man the ſame freedom of ſpeaking his: Only I could wiſh all Men would Conſider, That ſometimes Men run down-Hill faſter, then is for their own Convenience, and that Liberty loſeth its Nature, when it degenerates into Licentiouſneſs, or becomes a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs: I will not waſte time in fruitleſs A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If this little thing ſhould be any whit taken Notice of in the World, I know it will be bitterly Objected, That I ſeem inclineable to the Exerciſe of a more ſevere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, then hath (at leaſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For by woful Experience we find, that they can as powerfully In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them to ill Actions, as good But at the ſame time they forget to tell us, that they Joyn all their Forces, and make all poſſible Intereſt, that we may be Tied up from the Exerciſe of the moſt juſt and neceſſary Diſcipline, and that purely in fear, leſt a Diſcipline as primitive as our Doctrine joyned together, ſhould get Ground ſo faſt in the World, that in time they might become Aſhamed, or grow weary of their Trade.</p>
            <p>What is here wrote is only a <hi>Preparatory</hi> to my <hi>principal Deſign,</hi> which was to ſhew, That notwithſtanding all the High and Specious <hi>Pretences</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> when Matters are thoroughly Examined, the only true Reaſon of their difference with us would be found to be Intereſt, and that ſuch an intereſt, as (to ſay no worſe) is very unbecoming the <hi>Profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> This alone was firſt in my thoughts, and the rather, becauſe I obſerved that many had touched upon it in their Way, but no Man (ſo far as I know) had ever yet made it his Buſineſs. But upon ſecond Thoughts, though I did not depart from my firſt Deſign, yet I thought fit to Enla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge it; not only becauſe ſome would think that alone would look more like a Libel, then a juſt <hi>Plea;</hi> but becauſe I my ſelf did think, that to Common Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions it would leave things in the dark, and not be very profitable to any, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſome hurtful; For as ſome vain Mindes are Apt to take Occaſion from our Diſſentions to Burleſque all Religions, ſo ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> Addicted to the Reading of Controverſies, have Learned Skill enough to Condemn others, but not to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they can tell you what they are not, but not what they are. Now a purely Negative Religion at beſt is next to no Religion, if it be any at all. Now though this be not the fault of thoſe Authors, who are bound to follow their Adverſaries Steps, but of thoſe Men who will only Buſie themſelves in ſuch Authors; yet wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Matter was wholly at my own Choice, and in my own power, I could not think my ſelf excuſeable, if I ſhould procced only in a deſtructive way; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reference to the <hi>Parts</hi> which are to follow, I did propound to my ſelf to ſtate the Caſe between us in each particular, to ſet down poſitively what we do Hold or can Allow; And then to Enquire into the Reaſons of the Controverſie, both pretended and real; for that Method I take to be beſt, which leaves Men not at a Loſs for Right, whileſt it ſortifies them againſt the Wrong.</p>
            <p>But my Comfort under my afflictions is this, that my Share is inconſiderable in reſpect of my Great Maſter's, or his true Follower <hi>St Paul,</hi> who underwent the full Trial of all thoſe things, whereby he Teacheth us to Approve our Selves Miniſters of God, amongſt which I think I have ſome peculiar Intereſt in theſe, <hi>i. e.

               <hi>true. (2</hi> Cor. <hi>6. 8.)</hi> I never thought that Contreverſies were to be written for Controverſies ſake, but rather what in us lay to put an End to them; And I ſhould not think my ſelf unfortunate under all the Caluinnies and Sufferings in the World, if I could be in the leaſt Inſtrumental to Advance the Sincerity of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Promote the Peace of Gods Church:</hi> But if I may not be Capable of Endeavouring it to any purpoſe, I will never ceaſe to pray for it; And therein I doubt not to have the Concurrence of all good Men, whatſoever otherwiſe may be their Perſwaſions; And thus Proteſting my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity before God, and freely leaving my ſelf to the Cenſure of all Men. <hi>I am</hi>

            </head>
            <p n="1">I. SO Vehement and Implacable have been the Diviſions amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Managed not only with Tongue-ſhot, Diſputations, and all manner of Calumnies and Reproaches, but even with baſe Arts, moſt bloody Wars, and barbarous and inhumane Cruelties, that it might move an Enemy of our Religion, yea, perhaps an inconſiderate Perſon amongſt our ſelves, to think, that that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>I Come not to ſend Peace, but a Sword,</hi> (Mat. 10. 34.) was not deſigned to forewarn his true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Perſecutions they are to expect from the wickedneſs of others, but rather to inſtruct and animate them in Quarrels, and to live as Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats amongſt one another; And whatever are their Pretences, yet by daily Experience we ſee, That this is too much the Practice of many, who are ſo devoted to their Factions, that they ſtartle at the Name of Peace; And we have been told of ſome, whoſe Furious Raptures have Inſpired them with ſuch a blaſphemous Impudence, as to affront God with their impious Prayers, <hi>That he would Heighten and Increaſe the Diviſions of the Church.</hi> Theſe and other ſuch like Extravagancies have moved Me in the firſt place to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Obligations to Unity Chriſtians Lye under, for if they Lye under no ſuch Obligations, it is moſt certain, That the Name of Schiſm can hardly be ſo much as a Theological Scare-crow; And they who keep ſuch a Goil for Peace, will be found the greateſt Violaters of it, as attempting to bring all Men to that which they are nothing bound to; But on the contrary, if there be ſuch Obligations, then it is as certain, That all dividing and unquiet. Perſons do incur a Guilt proportionable to the Meaſure of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the ſtrength of thoſe Obligations; And if it further Appear, That the Chriſtian Religion doth lay the ſtrongeſt Obligations to Unity upon all the Profeſſors of it, Threatens the breach of it with the higheſt Penalties, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Obſervation of it with the utmoſt Advantages, and Affords the beſt Means and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lps to preſerve it, then all that Own the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt confeſs themſelves to be indiſpenſeably and eternally bound to the Peace, ſo as to continue in it, and procure it upon any termes but that of Sin, with which no Peace is to be had; But though I propound this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular with this very deſign, That the General Concernment and Obligations of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64154:6"/>
Chriſtianity might make Men bethink themſelves, and abate their over-eager Propenſions, and obſtinate Adherence to their particular Parties; yet I ſhall be very brief, becauſe (unleſs it be ſome Religious Madmen, whoſe Brains are Heated with Enthuſiaſm beyond any Hope of Cure) even thoſe, who are too Active and too Guilty in promoting Diviſion, do yet upon any ſober Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe freely Acknowledge, That it is not only a good and a pleaſant thing for Brethren to dwell together in Unity, but alſo that it is a duty incumbent upon every Chriſtian in his Station, by all honeſt means to promote it, not only amongſt his own party, but with all Others, who have Given up their Names to Chriſt; And I wiſh they were as ſerious in their Practice, as they are free in their Acknow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edgments, and would not amongſt themſelves Teach ſome private Tenets to Enſure their Partizans, whileſt they diſcourſe at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Rate with thoſe, whom they are too apt to Eſteem their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And in the firſt place, If we Conſider the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, what can be more evident, then that all its Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as they are moſt inſeparably Knit together, and ſubſervient to each other, ſo they tend to Effect and Confirm the ſtrongeſt Unity amongſt the Profeſſors of it. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> beſeeching the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>Endeavor to Keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> preſſeth them more particularly with this very Argument, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Eph</hi> 4. 4. <hi>&amp;c.) one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are Called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all;</hi> And in this Profeſſion we have all Engaged our ſelves to be the faithful Servants of God and of Chriſt, and therefore ought joyntly to Serve the Intereſt, and Maintain the Honour of our Gracious and common Maſter: Nay, we not only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become Servants, but have the Honour of being Friends of Chriſt, Adopted Sons of God, and are taken into the ſame Family and Houſhold; And of how heinors and inſufferable a Crime they are Guilty, who are troubleſome in this Family, and make Factions in this Houſhold, we may Learn from that Saying of our Saviour, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 3. 25.) <hi>If a Houſe be divided againſt it ſelf, that Houſe cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. But poſſibly it may deſerve our particular Conſideration, That the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of all Chriſtians as being incorporated into one Body, and that in ſuch a manner, that the Hopes of our common Salvation depends upon our being Members of that one Body. Hence in relation to our firſt Admiſſion or Infition, we are ſaid to be <hi>all Baptized into one Body,</hi> and that <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free,</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 13.) Hence alſo our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Growth in Chriſtianity, is Attributed to that Nouriſhment, which as Members is Communicated to us by this Body, the Body it ſelf being Fitly Framed and Joyned together, by all parts drawing it from Chriſt the Head,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64154:6"/>
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19.) Hence the Church of God is ſaid <hi>to be his Body, (Col.</hi> 1. 24.) and this Church not to be many Bodies, but one, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 4.) and that we might underſtand, That Salvation is not to be acquired, but by being Members of this Body; We are Taught, <hi>That Chriſt Works our Salvation by Reconciling us into one Body,</hi> (Eph. 2. 16.) And for this Reaſon the Apoſtle calls Him <hi>The Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the Body,</hi> (Eph. 5. 23.) from theſe and many other places of Scripture of the like Nature hath aroſe that common Axiom, <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt Salus,</hi> Which the Ancient Fathers have upon occaſion Excellently Explicated, preſſed and proved againſt Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; But I have no mind to make a Flouriſh with Citations in a matter ſo well known, though I wiſh it were better Heeded; Only before I paſs away, I ſhall take the boldneſs to leave theſe Remarks. 1. <hi>That all particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Members of the ſame Body, are Reciprocally bound to each other, not only in the Common Offices of Juſtice, but even of Love, Kindneſs and Chriſtian Succours; So that if the Man live in</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Armenia, <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Geneva, <hi>in the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey or our own, if he be a Chriſtian, I ought to wiſh and pray for his good, and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be offered in no caſe to decline the Promoting the good of his Soul; And if Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will permit, of his Body and Eſtate alſo. Secondly, That Chriſts Church and his Body, being terms convertible, it muſt conſiſt not only of the Preſent, but of the paſt Ages, even of all that either have or expect Salvation by Chriſt; So that no Perſon, by any Endeavors whatſoever can in the ordinary way duely hope for Salvation, as being a Member uf this or that particular Church, otherwiſe then as that particular Church by a Succeſſion of Doctrine and Worſhip, and conſequently of Lawful Paſtors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, (without whom ſuch Worſhip cannot be duly Performed) is united to, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied with the Catholick Church of God: for even the preſent Church diffuſed over the Face of the whole Earth, though it may be ſaid to be Catholick in reſpect of particular Churches, and of its Authority, as to the preſent living Perſons, yet in it ſelf it is not Catholick, otherwiſe then as deriving from, and united to the Church of the foregoing Ages, running up unto Chriſt their Head: Neither can any that comes after be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Catholick but as an acceſſion to the former; And this if well Weighed might be a means to make Men very cautious how they gathered ſeparate Bodies without extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good Grounds. Thirdly, that though every Schiſmatick do affront and injure the whole Church of God, yet the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt' detriment is to himſelf. The Church may loſe an unprofitable Member, but he loſeth himſelf; For if Chriſt be only the Saviour of the Body, none can divide from it, without apparent hazard of their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Salvation. So dangerous a thing is the Sin of Schiſm, though ſo lightly eſteemed in our dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV, But here ſome, who are ready to catch at every Twig, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſt drowning and loſt, if they muſt be bound to live peaceably and to be wiſe only to Sobriety, will Object, That ſuch are the various apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, inclinations, intereſts, education and prejudices of Mankind, That this Doctrine, as meeting with inſuperable Difficulties, cannot be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

very great Abatements and Allowances? To theſe I might juſtly Anſwer, That in this Caſe I am not concerned for their Prejudices, Intereſt, or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch Matters; And it were much better, if they were leſs concerned for 'um themſelves; for that Man that will be a Chriſtian, muſt not follow his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inclinations and Intereſts, much leſs his Humours and Whimſeys, or any thing of like Nature; but muſt abide by, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g into Captivity every thought to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> (2 Cor. 10. 5.) But becauſe I had rather Untie the Knot then cut it, I further Anſwer, That Opinions inconſiſtent with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, of a good Life, and a juſt Church Government and Diſcipline are never to be allowed; for theſe directly tend to the deſtruction of the Church, or our ſelves, or rather of both; but in things of remote conſequence, or private and leſs Concernment, there <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nio Voluntatum, non Opinionnm</hi> is ſufficient; we may ſeverally opine as we ſee cauſe, provided that we ſeverally reſolve not to tranſgreſs the bounds of Charity; In this Caſe the Apoſtles Advice is, <hi>To forbear one another in Love,</hi> (Eph 4. 2.) and that the <hi>ſtrong ſhould not deſpiſe the weak, nor the weak judge the ſtrong,</hi> (Rom. 14. 3.) and to this purpoſe it is obſervable, That no Religion or Perſuaſion in the World ever Canonized Humility and Self-denial for Vertues; but the Chriſtian, thereby taking care at once both to moderate the Judgement and the Practice; The One Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe) <hi>in lowlineſs of Mind to Eſteem others better then our ſelves; the other not to ſeek our own, but every Man anothers Wealth;</hi> And by this means Men would not only be Reſtrained from Running to the utmoſt Bounds of what may ſeem lawful, but be careful to learn and do what is moſt expedient, whereby the Peace of the Church, and mutual love and kindneſs amongſt its Members would be conſtantly preſerved; Nor need our Men of Intereſt fear, that this Doctrine will undo them; For he, who like <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> hath his Hand againſt every Man, will moſt certainly have every Mans Hand againſt him; ſo that there is odds in the Match, that one time or other he will come by the worſt on't; But he, who by Chriſtian Condeſcenſion in a Reaſonable Cauſe denies himſelf, obligeth many others to do him the ſame kindneſs on the like occaſion, whereby one favour to another procures many to himſelf; And were this principle duely practiſed, a man would not only be out of danger in all places, but ſhould never want that Comfort, Succour and Aſſiſtance, which an honeſt Cauſe and Chriſtian Deportment can expect. But ſuppoſe, (as indeed it is more then a Suppoſal) that others will not do their duty herein; yet he that Aims at an Heavenly Inheritance, muſt not take the Meaſures of his Proceedings from thoſe, who value nothing above their worldly Inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt; Nor ought he to think much to Meet with ſome Rubs in his way, when the Crown of Glory he purſues, exceeds all that he can

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppoſed that can be, ſuch a Man obligeth all that are good or grateful: He enjoys the preſent ſatisfaction of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and is ſo much before others in a more certain Hope of his future Bliſs, as he is more true to his duty; whileſt thoſe that caſt off all care of this duty, whatever they may have of the Name, have nothing of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Chriſtians, and conſequently are not to expect the Reward.</p>
            <p n="5">V. This Argument hath engaged me longer then I intended, and therefore what others I ſhall take Notice of, I ſhall little more then mention, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Man who underſtands and values his Religion, will be concerned for the Honour of it, which is by nothing more blaſted (if not as to ſome wholly ruined then by Contentions and Diviſions: It is Reported of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> that he particularly gave God Thanks for three Things, <hi>Viz. That He was a Man, and not ſome other Creature, That he was born in</hi> Greece, <hi>the then moſt Civiliz'd Part of the World, And that he had his Education in</hi> Athens, <hi>the then moſt famous School of Philoſophy in the World;</hi> How much greater Cauſe have we with daily Thanks and Praiſes to Celebrate Gods Holy Name, by whoſe Bleſſing we are Chriſtians, whereby we have not only an unerring Rule to walk by, but alſo from the Revelations and Promiſes of the God of Truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But can we think to perſwade others of the truth of this, by living unſpeakably worſe then they, who could pretend to no ſuch advantages? Or if this be true, then do not we by our Diviſions raiſe a great Scandal and Prejudice againſt ſuch glorious Truth: We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aſt, That Ours is the beſt Religion in the World; Nay more, and that truly, That Ours is the only true Religion in the World. for there is Salvation in no Other, nor any other Name Given under Heaven whereby we muſt be faved, but that of the bleſſed Jeſus, <hi>(Acts</hi> 4. 12.) And I can ſtill remember, That when I was a Youth, I have heard plauſible Harangues in Sermons, and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Petitions in Prayers, about them who ſate in darkneſs, and in the Regions of the Shadow of Death; And doubtleſs, as the Caſe of the one was Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo the Zeal of the other was ſo far Commendable; But when I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that thoſe Men had deſtroyed the Mother that bore them, and thought the Goſpel was no further Advanced then their Schiſm was propagated; I cannot but wonder, with what Confidence a parcel of Seditious Rebellious Schiſmaticks could think themſelves the only Fit Men to bear the Light, to Conduct thoſe that lay in darkneſs into the bright Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut as I have heard little of their Endeavors, ſo leſs of their Succeſs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any in reaſon to hope for much better, who are ſtudious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Diviſions; For ſuppoſe a diſcreet Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it ſelf to be in the right, and as peremptorily condemns all others to be in the wrong, and what Multitudes of Diviſions there are amongſt us, would not this be a ſtrong temptation to Him to be of that Religion, which they could not agree in themſelves? But when he ſhould further ſee the open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and unuſual Miſchiefs which the Diviſions in all places produce, he would ſurely Reſolve with himſelf, of all others to Fly that Religion; for when all's done, let us ſay what we can, Men will believe what we do. Mens Words and Actions are often too far aſunder; But they generally Act what they really think, and therefore moſt perſons think it ſafer (where they can) to judge of Men by their Actions rather then their Sayings, as being ſurer Indices of their Minds, and having a cloſer Correſpondence with their Hearts and Deſignes, ſo that if they ſee Chriſtians to be of a froward perverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they will judge no better of their Religion; So great Reaſon we may ſee had the Apoſtle to give us in Charge, <hi>to Walk in Wiſdom towards them that are without,</hi> (Col. 4. 5.) The Reſult of this Conſideration briefly amounts to thus much, That Diviſions not only produce many foul Irregularities, and inexcuſable Enormities amongſt our ſelves; but alſo miſrepreſent and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize our Religion, ſo as rather to affright others from it, then allure them to it; by which means the Practice of Chriſtians is debauched, the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel hindered, the Truth as unjuſtly as highly diſhonoured, and the whole deſign of Chriſtianity in a manner fruſtrated. And if any Man be ſo in love with Schiſm, as to think this a ſmall Crime, or ſo blind as not to ſee it; I ſcarce know what I can do more for him, except to pray to God to open his Eyes, and turn his Heart.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And yet there is ſtill ſomething further, and very conſiderable, to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in this Caſe; for nothing is more directly binding then a Precept, and nothing more ſtrongly binding then a Precept from him, who hath the whole Propriety in us, and abſolute Sovereignty over us. So that if the God of all Power, who hath Created us, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom he hath Given all Power, have expreſsly required this Unity, then the indiſpenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the duty on our part can be no longer a diſpute, nor can this be a doubt to any, who have but lightly peruſed the Holy Scriptures; for though it may be enough to any Conſiderate Perſon, That the whole Current of Scripture bears againſt all Diſorderlineſs, Unrulineſs and Unquietneſs; yet that our Mouths might be for ever ſtopped, the thing it ſelf is Commanded in as plain and expreſs terms, as can be deſired. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.) <hi>Be of one Mind, live in Pence.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (1 Pet. 3. 8.) <hi>Be ye all of one Mind.</hi> And that we might know, that this Unity muſt be as well in Practice as in Judgement, we are Commanded as well to walk by the ſame Rule, as to Mind the ſame thing, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3. 16.) And St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes not a little pains to explain the neceſſary duty of every Member of Chriſt, in walking orderly in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64154:8"/>
their ſeveral ſtations, to this end, That there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25,) I could heap up many more Teſtimonies, but I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for any one ought to be enough to him, who owns the Holy Scriptures to be ſtampt with the Authority of Heaven, and to contain what is the Will of God, that we ſhould believe and do: And if a Word, a Nod, a Beck from a Maſter, ſhall command or direct a Servant at his pleaſure, can we think not only to neglect, but to bid open Defiance to the Commands of the Almighty, and be guiltleſs or 'ſcape Scot-free? The Sin in violating any Command is always ſo much the greater, by how much the greater is the Authority of the Perſon Commanding; from whence we may learn how great a Sin is the Violation of that Chriſtian Unity, which is Commanded by the Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. But ſtill we are further informed, of how great Moment this duty is from the rewards and puniſhments, that attend the performance or violation of it; The Breach of Unity is it ſelf no ſmall puniſhment, for Diviſions na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally create Diſturbances, increaſe troubles, and tend towards deſtruction. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us this Caution, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 5. 15.) <hi>If ye Bite and devour one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, take heed that ye be not Conſumed one of another.</hi> So that the Advantages which flow from Unity, and the Miſchiefs which ariſe from the contrary, are ſufficient Motives to any Man, who minds his own good, to follow thoſe things which make for Peace. But leaſt this ſhould not be enough, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l that further can affright us from evil, is added; And no leſs then eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is made the portion of Tranſgreſſors in this kind; For St. <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us what are the Works of the Fleſh, which they that do ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; Amongſt them reckons theſe, <hi>Hatred, Variance, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That if any Man did but ſeem to be Contentious, they had no ſuch Cuſtom, neither the Churches of God,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 16.) By which he ſeems to me to intimate, That ſuch Perſons do caſt themſelves out of the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exclude themſelves from the Hopes of Salvation; But that we may not Complain of being Affrighted into Goodneſs, and terrified to our Duty, the puniſhment of the Violation of this Duty is not ſo great, but the Reward of its due performance is every way equal; And beſides thoſe Comforts that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re naturally contained in it, and flow from it, there is no leſs then eternal Happineſs entailed on it. Chriſt himſelf hath declared, <hi>That Bleſſed are the Peace-Makers, for they ſhall be Called the Children of God,</hi> (Mat. 5. 9) And if ſo, then certainly they ſhall have a portion and inheritance with the reſt of his Children, and be fellow-Heires with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Now if all theſe Conſiderations were put together and well weighed, methinks no difficulties whatſoever ſhould be able to deterr or remove us from our duties, or to hinder us from ſtanding faſt in one Spirit, with one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64154:9"/>
Mind, ſtriving together for the Faith of the Goſpel; For to Him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Himſelf a Chriſtian, and believes what he profeſſeth, what can all the Allurements and Temptations, all the Joyes, Troubles or Torments of this tranſitory Life Work, when ſet againſt the pains of Hell on the one Hand, and the Joyes of Heaven on the other? and yet even this pretence is taken away; And that we may not with any Shew of Reaſon plead any diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we are aſſured that God will ſupply us with Strength and Succours in our faithful Endeavours, that ſo far as concerns us, we ſhall be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties, and diſcharge our Duties; And the difference is not much, whether there be no difficulties, or the difficulties be Conquerable; an idle fluggiſh Perſon perhaps would deſire the former, but he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take pains for Heaven, and had rather exerciſe and Varniſh his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then ſuffer them through diſuſe to be ſullied and weakned, poſſibly will think the latter more expedient for him. I do not ſay, that we ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with abilities to reduce all others, but that unleſs by our own default we ſhall not want Aſſiſtance to ſecure our ſelves; And then whatever the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties may really be or appear, we can have no juſt cauſe of Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; And I know not what greater Comfort or Encouragement to this Duty could be given us, then what St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, (2 Cor. 13. 11.) <hi>Be of one Mind, live in Peace, and the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with you.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. THis Unity is a Thing that ſounds bravely in the Eares of all Perſons, and Meets with a General Applauſe and high Commendation in all Places; And indeed it cannot Receive more Praiſes then it deſerves; but when we come ſeriouſly and cloſely to conſider what it is, and wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; When we think to graſp it, it Vaniſheth, and wo fall foully together by the Eares about the Unity we joyntly Extol, and make it ſelf the occaſion of our loſing it; the great Reaſon of which is apparently this, That when Men have fallen in love with ſome ſingular way, and ſet up their Reſt in ſome dividing Principles, they do not fetch the Nature of Unity from the full Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, which beſt Teach it, and the Practice of the Primitive Church which beſt Explains it, but Catching ſome Shreds of Scripture for pretence, they frame ſuch a Notion of Unity as may ſuit with their own Scheme, and rather then quit any of their darling Errours, they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Waſh a Blackmore white, I mean, to find out ſuch a Unity as ſhall be conſiſtent with Diviſion and Separation; But it is pity to fall out about
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64154:9"/>
Unity, and therefore leaving ſuch to their vain Imaginations, I ſhall diſcover my own Apprehenſions, wherein I think it Conſiſts: And if I fall in any part, I'ſhall be highly obliged to that perſon, who ſhall bring Me to a clearer and fuller Underſtanding of its Nature; for certainly did we better underſtand what it was, we ſhould come nearer together, and better concur in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Practice of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But before I can proceed, I muſt for my own Security, enter a <hi>Caveat</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pretences of extraordinary Caſes; And therefore do tell my Reader, that I ſhall limit my Diſcourſe to Gods ordinary Way and ſtanding Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, to which all Perſons ought to have Regard. I will not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf upon what terms he may ſtand, who is faſt Lock'd in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or caſt upon an uninhabited Coaſt, or made a Slave amongſt Infidels, or Lies Concealed in a Cave for fear of his Life, or any of the like Nature; I make no doubt, but that for extraordinary Caſes God hath extraordinary Mercies; but then this is not Applicable to what is common or ordinary: There can be nothing more perverſe and unnatural, then to judge of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſe of Things by the Exceptions from it; Or to Confound the common Condition of Mankind with that, which is rarely and only at ſome times the ſad Misfortune of ſome few; And it is not poſſible to Gueſs, whither thoſe Mens Errours will lead them, who in ſtead of obſerving what are the Exceptions from a General Rule, do frame to themſelves a General Rule from exempt Caſes, and ſo overthrow the common Standard; And I muſt Confeſs, that I have not been a little ſcandalize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to find this very thing done in a great Meaſure, by Men otherwiſe of Eminence, Learning and Piety.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Now though this Chriſtian Unity be a Harmony of many parts, many of which muſt concur to make it true, and all ought to meet to make it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; The firſt Bond in this Common Tye, or that from whence it takes its firſt Riſe and Beginning, is <hi>that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> And he that doth unfeignedly embrace it, is ſo far forth united both to all thoſe, whoever heretofore received it; And all thoſe, who now live in Profeſſion of it; but yet we muſt go a great way further, or elſe we ſhall come ſhort Home.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For though this Unity principally relates to the Catholick Church of God, Comprehending all Ages and places, which is that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Saviour, and to whom the great and precious Promiſes are primarily made; yet if we would ſpeak rather oſ fully then magniſicently, we are not ſo much to Conſider in this Caſe the Church we are united to, as the means whereby we are united to it, and therefore as Men on Earth we are to conſider our ſelves <hi>in ſtatu viatorum,</hi> as Men that are not only bound to believe, but to profeſs the Faith of Chriſt Crucified, (for our Bleſſed Saviour hath told us, <hi>That if we be Aſhamed of Him and his Words, He will be Aſhamed of us, when He</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64154:10"/>
               <hi>cometh into the Glory of his Father,</hi> Mark 8. 38.) as Men ſo indiſpenſeably bound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that Profeſſion, that they muſt not only hazard, but even Actually loſe all that is near and dear to them, rather then depart from it, (for the ſame Chriſt hath told us, <hi>That if a Man come to him, and hate not Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciple,</hi> Luke 24. 26.) as Men, who are bound to embody in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fraternity and Society, that they may joyntly as well as openly make this Profeſſion, <hi>not forſaking the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> (as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.) In a word, ſeeing we here live in expectation of the Promiſes, we muſt ſubmit to all the termes and conditions of the Covenant, upon which God hath made their Performance to depend; And being the whole tenure of the Goſpel, doth oblige us on Earth to joyn in a viſible Fraternity, to a viſible Profeſſion, to particular duties to viſible Profeſſors, and to a real not imaginary Obedience to them, who Rule over us and Watch for our Souls; I ſee not how we can Challenge the Name of Chriſtians, whileſt we caſt off all Care of theſe Duties. And hence it is Apparent, That we cannot be United to that great Catholick, Myſtical and Inviſible Church of God, but by becoming Members of his viſible Church on Earth, as being that part of his Church, wherein he hath placed, and to which the greateſt part of our Duties do particularly Relate. To Arrive to the ſtate of Glorified Saints and Angels, that Church without Spot or Wrinkle is our Hope and Endeavour; But whileſt we are on Earth, we are only on our Way towards it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are particularly of that part of Gods Church, wherein grow Tares as well as Wheat, to be diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated in Gods good time: And by our faithful ſincere Obedience in this, we do through Chriſt Jeſus Require and Preſerve a Right and Title in time, to be made the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Members of the other.</p>
            <p n="5">V. This being our preſent ſtate and condition, our Unity ought certainly to be agreeable and ſuitable to it, and therefore muſt be viſible amongſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Profeſſours of the Goſpel; and what that is, or wherein it conſiſts, is my preſent Buſineſs to deſcribe: But firſt from the foregoing Premiſſes I would make this Inference, That a Believer at large is only a Chriſtian in <hi>Fieri,</hi> his Faith alone without the other Duties and Accompliſhments, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preſcribes to all Chriſtians, is not ſufficient to give him the full Title of a Chriſtian; 'Tis true he hath laid a good Foundation, but unleſs he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to build thereon, he can no more be ſaid to be a Chriſtian, then an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer can be ſaid to have Erected a fair Houſe, when he hath only laid the Ground-Work; And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe Faith in its own Nature doth not only incline, but oblige to Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence; And I therefore not only more chearfully Obey Gods Commands, becauſe I believe Him faithful who hath promiſed, but I muſt condemn my ſelf as utterly inexcuſable, if I diſobey
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64154:10"/>
Him at the ſame time, that I pretend to believe in Him. Hence it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That the word Faith taken Objectively, is often in Scripture-phraſe uſed to Signifie not only Revealed Truths, but Precepts of Life, even the whole Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, or the Law of Faith; And where it ſpeaks diſtinctly of it, yet it will have the other to follow it, Commanding us <hi>to add to our Faith Vertue,</hi> (2 Pet. 1. 5.) <hi>And to Shew our Faith by our Works</hi> (Jam. 2. 8.) And accordingly the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity, upon their Owning the Faith, thought themſelves Obliged to go on to what the Law of Faith Required. Thus the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unuch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen Convinced by <hi>Philip,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, doth not Acquieſce in that Faith, but proceeds as far as his preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would permit, and of his own Accord beſpeaks <hi>Philip, See, here is Water, what doth hinder me to be Baptized?</hi> (Acts 8. 36.) And conſonantly, hereto it is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, That the primitive Church did Vouchſafe the Title of <hi>Fideles</hi> to no Adult Perſons, but ſuch as were in full Communion; And did Men perſwade themſelves that their Faith did ſo indiſpenſeably oblige them to all Chriſtian Duties, that without their ſincere Endeavour even Faith it ſelf became defective, it would make a fair Advance towards Unity; And till they do ſo, I ſee no Reaſon to hope for it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But now to Return to the thing in Hand, As we are Men on Earth, and Probationers for Heaven, our Unity muſt be ſuch as is Required by this our ſtate, and conſequently muſt conſiſt in ſuch matters as Unites all the viſible Profeſſors of the Goſpel into ſuch a Body or Society, which God hath inſtituted and deſigned for his Worſhip on Earth; But then we are to Conſider, That as we are United to the Catholick inviſible Church of God, by being United to his viſible Catholick Church on Earth, ſo we are United to this viſible Catholick Church, by being United to ſome true part of it, or by becoming Members of ſome particular Church; for no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can be United to the Body all over, or to the whole immediately, but is United to the Body by being United to it in ſome part, <hi>For the Body is not one Member, but many,</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 14.) And as theſe fitly Framed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make the whole, ſo by Vertue of this Union each Member hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Whole. and is both capacitated to diſcharge his Duty to the Whole, and to Receive Supplies from, and claim an Intereſt in the Whole.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Now, being that our Belief in the Son of God, and that he is the Head of the Body his Church, (if conſidered Antecedently to, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from other Chriſtian Duties) doth rather capacitate us to become Chriſtians, then denominate us ſo, it will follow, That to have the benefit of our Belief, we muſt take care to be Admitted into that Body, which it qualifies us to be Members of. Now in all manner of Societies, of what Nature ſoever, Members are Admitted by ſome Signal Ceremony, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64154:11"/>
known Form of Proceedings, that thereby they may be known to Others to be Members of that Society, and may undiſturbedly do the Exerciſes and enjoy the Priviledges of that Society. Now this Formal Way of Admiſſion into the Chriſtian Body or Society, is by the Sacrament of Baptiſm; And that even by our Saviours own Command and Inſtitution; for when they are ſo well Inſtructed as to believe, he will have them Received by being Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized; <hi>Go ye,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) <hi>Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name, &amp;c.</hi> And though Unbelief alone be ſufficient to put a Man into a ſtate of Condemnation; yet Belief alone without Baptiſm doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily put a Man into the ſtate of Salvation. This is our Saviours own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>(Mark</hi> 16. 16.) <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; And he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And the Reaſon is plain; for though Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as rejecting the Covenant of Grace, and its Author, is alone able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us from all benefit of it; yet Belief, though it lay hold on the Covenant, is not able alone to ſecure to us the benefits of it, if conſidered abſtractedly and ſeparately from the other neceſſary Conditions of it; for he that expects the benefit of a part, muſt obſerve not one, but all the neceſſary termes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it; from hence it may appear, how neceſſary it is, that we be all Partakers of that one Baptiſm; And this Conſideration ought to Alarm thoſe Perſons to examine well the Grounds whereon they proceed, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all other Chriſtians, making it the ſingular part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to deny Baptiſm, even to the Children of Chriſtian Parents, for though God is not bound up to withhold his Mercy, where the default is not in the Perſons themſelves; yet we have no certain Rule to aſſure us, that he will afford ſuch Mercy out of the way, that he hath preſcribed; but it is purely in his good pleaſure; And if Baptiſm be ordinarily the Way of Admiſſion and Entrance into that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Saviour; then ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by denying them Baptiſm, do what in them lies to damn them, which doubtleſs is a very unchriſtian part. And though it be true in relation to Perſons out of the Covenant, that they muſt firſt be qualified not only with an actual but a profeſſed Faith, without which they are not capable of Admiſſion; yet in reference to Perſons in Covenant the Caſe is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the Covenant is not to them alone, but to their Seed; And the Children being ſanctified in their Parents do follow their condition, and are born to Priviledges in the Church, which thoſe without cannot claim; And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>refore ought not particularly to be denied this, without which they are not by the ordinary Laws of the Covenant, Entitled to the Reſt. But I will proſecute this no further, my buſineſs being rather with Adult Perſons then Children. For though their Salvation is by being of the Body, yet they have ſmall Influence on Chriſtian Communion; and until they loſe that Name are ſcarce able to diſturb or break the Unity of the Church, which is the thing I am to Explain.</p>

VIII. The Parts of our Chriſtian Unity are ſo cloſe Knit together, that they ſeem to Lead Us by the Hand from the one to the other; ſo that it may ſeem ſomewhat a wonder how Perſons ſhould for the Generality be ſo wofully miſtaken about them; For having thus laid the Foundation of Faith, and being Actually Admitted by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, it will (I ſuppoſe) be eaſily Agreed on all Hands, That Perſons are not only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Priviledges and Benefits of the Society, but come under an Obligation to obſerve the Laws and do the Duties of the Society; for no Society whatſoever, whether Sacred or Civil, ever admitted any to their Priviledges, without Tying them up to their Rules; 'Tis true, that in ſome Societies there are certain Honorary or Titular Members; but it is indeed only a Title: For where they are excepted from duty, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from benefit: But this is peculiar to the Chriſt an Religion, that it admits none ſuch; but whoever doth become a Member profeſſing it, muſt fall under an Obligation to perform the Duties it requires; And by this we may perceive what further Progreſs our Chriſtian Unity muſt make; for we muſt be United in the Conſent, Profeſſion and Practice of all thoſe things, which according to our ſeveral ſtations in that Society the Laws of Chriſtianity do require from us. Now theſe may have relation either to particular Chriſtians, or to them as embodied in particular Societies, or to them conſidered under the Notion of Subjects and Governours; Or laſtly, to the Duty and Behaviour of Governours towards each other.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Every particular Chriſtian is bound to the Sincere and conſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Exerciſe of all thoſe Chriſtian Duties, which the Goſpel requires of every one in their ſingle Capacities, as Humility, Sobriety, Temperance, Patience, and the like; And their Concurrence in, and due Obſervance of theſe things, is not only very profitable and Comfortable to Themſelves, but very Honourable to their Society; But above all we are Commanded <hi>to Put on Charity,</hi> (Col. 3. 14.) and that not only for this Reaſon, that it Virtually conteins, and in its own Nature directs and provokes to the Practice of all other Chriſtian Duties, on which Account the Apoſtle in the following words ſtiles it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but alſo becauſe our Saviour himſelf hath made it the Character and Badge of his Followers. For (ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 13. 35.) <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. But here it is to be Conſidered, that theſe Vertues of particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have been, and may be ſo fairly Copied out, and handſomely Exerciſed by Heath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns and Unbelievers, that to outward Appearance the one cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the other; And though the Vertues of Chriſtians are really diſtinguiſhable from the like in Heathens from their Principles and Ends, yet theſe Principles and Ends are things in themſelves not ſeen; And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64154:12"/>
therefore that thoſe Vertues may appear to proceed from ſuch Chriſtian Principles and Ends, they muſt be practiſed in Conjunction with ſuch other Duties, as do apparently Teſtifie what Principles we own; And that Charity it ſelf may be a Mark of Chriſts Diſciples, it muſt carry them on to thoſe Exerciſes, which he hath Commanded his Worſhippers to joyn in. Now this cannot be done only by ſeparate well living, but by joyning in that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Chriſtian Communion, which the Laws of Chriſt, and the Nature of that Church or Society he hath Inſtituted, doth Require; And in theſe we do moſt clearly own and profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, and viſibly unite in the Body; And from hence it will follow, that all Chriſtians, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of excluding themſelves from this Body, are bound to joyn in all the publick Offices of the Church, and to bear their part in all Acts and Duties of Chriſtian Communion, and therefore Attendance to Ordinances is not only the benefit, but the neceſſary duty of every Chriſtian; And as Members of the Society they muſt do their parts, joyning in the publick Prayers, Praiſes. Thankſgivings, Confeſſions, and the like; And eſpecially ought to be careful to be duely partakers of the Lords Supper, as being that Act whereby of all others, we are moſt ſtrongly, firmly and cloſely united both to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r Head, and to each other. Hence it is by way of Eminence, ſometimes called, <hi>The Communion;</hi> And hence it is, That amongſt the primitive Chriſtians, though a Man had openly profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith. had been admitted by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, was not only an Auditor, but does Communicate in the Prayers of the Church, yet they did not Account him compIeatly a Chriſtian, till he did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords Table; And there is the ſame Reaſon for this ſtill, and perhaps greater Reaſon now then ever to urge it, when the moſt weighty Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are moſt neglected, and People are ſo apt to ſet up their Reſt far ſhort of what our bleſſed Saviour hath made their Duties.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That this Communion is maintained by Communicating with that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtian Church, being neither Heretical nor Schiſmatical, where every Chriſtian lives, ſeems to me out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oubt; For if he do not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate there, it is not poſſible he ſhould actually Communicate any where elſe, and therefore whatſoever Preparations of Mind may be pretended, the wilful or careleſs neglect of this, ſeems to Amount to no leſs then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation or Under valuing of all Communion, which ſtrikes at the very Heart of the Chriſtian Religion. But yet for all this our Communion in that particular Church is Communion with the whole, whereof that is a part, by which we are United to the whole, in which we expreſs our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the whole, and by which we draw Supplies from the whole; For our Communion in particular Churches Ariſes from the Neceſſity of our Natures, and the Condition of Humane Beings, which are not capable of Communicating with the whole altogether, but only by parts: And

though particular Churches in reſpect of particular Chriſtians, and the Offices and Authority therein Exerciſed are truly called Churches, yet in reſpect of the Catholick Church they are but Members, whereby we are United to the whole, and Communicate with the whole; Both the Name and Benefit of Chriſtianity comes to us from joyning in Communion with that Church, which is Chriſts Body: And that is the Catholick Church, and it is to that we deſire to be United, and in that to Communicate by joyning with ſome true part of it, which is all our Natures allow us to do, and in Act can Compaſs; But if any Man Unite himſelf to, or joyn in Communion with any particular Church, either in oppoſition to all others, or without any relation or obligation to any other Church; As to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, he muſt ſuppoſe that particular Church to be that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head and Saviour, or elſe he cannot Hope for Salvation in it and then (unleſs he have the Impudence to affirm, that there is no other true Church of God) he muſt make Chriſt have more Bodies then one, and in the immediate conſequence overthrow an Article of our Creed, which acknowledgeth but One Catholick Church. Our Communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in a particular, yet by means thereof is both in and with the Catholick Church; And hence it is, that the Members of particular Churches, have an equal Right all the World over to Communion in all other Chriſtian Churches; And when they come to other Churches, are then actually bound to Communicate with them; Upon this Ground it was, that the primitive Chriſtians proceeded; for though they did debarr Strangers from Communion, till they did produce their Communicatory Letters or Credentials, whereby it might appear, that they lived in ſome particular Church of Catholick Communion, (that they might not be impoſed upon by Hereticks and Schiſmaticks) yet when the Church they came to was ſatisfied in that particular, they were not only acknowledged to have the ſame right with their own Members, but alſo to lie under the ſame Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; And if very ſatisfactory Reaſons were not given of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, if they did not then actually Communicate they were Treated as Schiſmaticks, ſo that that Schiſmatical Diſtinction of ſuch an Occaſional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as leaves Men at liberty where and when to Communicate, and that even in ſeparate and oppoſite Communions, was altogether unknown to the primitive Church, or if it had been ſtarted, would never have heen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>

In Reſpect to the latter he hath ſaid, <hi>I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World,</hi> (Matt 28. 20.) So that if not under the Law, much leſs under the Goſpel may any Man take this Honour to himſelf, but he that is Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theirs is indeed of a ſpiritual Nature; They have no power of Coercion, they cannot by force lay a Reſtraint upon any Mans Perſon; but yet their Authority is real, and in ſome ſenſe higher then theirs, who by Gods Commiſſion carry the Temporal Sword for the terrour of evil Doers, and Defence of thoſe who do well. For the ſame God who gave Authority to the Paſtors of his Church, hath Commanded the people to obey them, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) And doth interpret the diſobedience or neglect of them to be an Affront to Himſelf.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64154:13"/>
who ſo often warns his diſciples <hi>to Beware of the Leaven of the Phariſces,</hi> yet Commands them to obey the ſame Men, ſo far forth as they ſatt in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; And doubtleſs he doth not Require leſs Obſervance of thoſe who Sit in his own Chair; And though People are very apt to begin the Quarrel here, yet methinks they ſhould be more fearful of breaking Communion with their Paſtors, if they did Conſider, That this is the Door, by which always Schiſm enters; for it is not Conceiveable how they ſhould forſake Chriſtian Communion, but by deſerting their Paſtors in their Paſtoral Office. Hence the Fathers, (eſpecially St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> them whom no man better underſtood or wrote of this Caſe upon all Occaſions) as they uſually deſcribe a particular Church by the Union of the Flock to their Paſtor, ſo they define Schiſm by a Separation from the Biſhop; Not that they meant it is no more, but that that is the Act which makes the Schiſmatick, and that by leaving his proper Biſhop, he forſakes not only the Communion of that particular Church, but of all other Churches, of whoſe Communion that Biſhop is; And Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Communion of the Catholick Church, if he be truly a Catholick Biſhop; And hence I think it may Appear, that for Maintaining Chriſtian Communion in Chriſts Body, the People muſt be United to their Paſtors, and that not only with Reſoect to Preaching the Word, publick Prayers and the Uſe of the Sacraments, but alſo with Regard to Matters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government, without which Order and Regular Proceedings in the Church, it cannot be upheld. Upon this Score the primitive Chriſtians were ſo Obſervant of the Rules, Orders and Cenſures of their Biſhop, That if any Man fell under the Sentence of Excommunication, they for ſo much as Related to them, vigorouſly put it in Execution, and not only would not ſuffer ſuch a One to joyn in Communion, but would not ſo much as Eat, Drink, Couverſe, or ordinarily Traffick with Him; Which Practice ſeems to have had its Foundation from that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 Theſ. 3. 14.) <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, Note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be Aſhamed.</hi> As alſo from that, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.)) <hi>Now I have written unto you, not to keep Company, if any Man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an One, No, not to Eat.</hi>

            <p n="13">XIII. But that a Firm Chriſtian Unity may be in the Church of God, it is not ſufficient, that the Flock continue in a due Subjection to, and ſteddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with their Paſtor, unleſs the Paſtors themſelves Maintain a fair Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and keep due Order one amongſt another, <hi>For if the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall Prepare himſelf to the Battel?</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 8.) how is it poſſible, that an Army ſhould be Unanimous in it ſelf, or Employ its full force againſt the Enemy, if the Commanders Agree not, but give out contrary Orders? Nor is it poſſible, That the Unity of the

Church ſhould be preſerved, if the Paſtors Govern their Flocks, not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, but Oppoſition to each other, and ſet up ſuch termes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as other Churches cannot approve, but muſt withdraw from; It is indeed true, That every Biſhop in his particular Church, hath a kind of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority, and is to Govern his Flock <hi>Rationem Actûs, ſui Domino redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus,</hi> (as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> more then once phraſeth it,) Hence it is, That in ſome things a Chriſtian Man is bound to Obſerve the Orders of his own Church, and obey his own Biſhop, before any, if not all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian World; But then, this Authority muſt not be ſtretch'd beyond the Bounds of his own particular Church; And hence aroſe thoſe ſeveral different and often contrary Uſages and Cuſtomes in ſeveral Churches, which were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, becauſe they belonged to the Power of each particular Church, and conſiſted in ſuch things, That he that Communicated after the one Manner in one Church, might Lawfully Communicate after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in another. Of this Nature was that known different Uſage of old, between the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millan;</hi> In the former they Faſted on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays, in the latter not. And therefore St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was truly as ſtout a Biſhop as ever the Church had, though he ſtrictly Required. Obedience to the Orders of his own Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet at <hi>Rome</hi> was as Obſervant of theirs, and Adviſed St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Mother <hi>Monica</hi> to do the ſame. The Reaſon muſt be fetch'd from the Nature of the Things, which being indifferent in themſelves, might be Lawfully practiſed either Way, and therefore were in the Power of every Church to determine or not determine, as She found moſt for her good and Advantage; But when theſe Things are determined, Obedience put on the Nature of Duty, and Diſobedience of Sin: But though every Biſhop, in Reſpect of his particular Church or Flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath (according to the Old Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Language) his Throne, yet in Relation to the Catholick Church he is but a principal Member, who in Conjunction with Others of the fame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is to Share in care of the whole; And therefore in Matters which have an Influence on Catholick Communion, he is Accountable to his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues or Fellow Biſhops, and for any Miſdemeanour herein may by them be Suſpended, Depoſed or Cenſured, as they or a convenient part of them ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>udge Meet, for the prefervation of the Churches Peace. And in this Caſe the Biſhops of other Churches did not only Exhort, but Require both the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Clergy and the People to Refuſe Communion with their Biſhop, though in all other Caſes the ſeparating from the Communion of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Erecting another Altar, or ſetting up a Conventicle againſt him, was Accounted the peculiar Signature of Schiſm. And the Reaſon is plain, for though they could not hold Communion with the Church, but by Maintaining Communion with their Biſhop, yet they did Communicate in that Church as a part of the whole; And if he did break off from the whole,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64154:14"/>
or was Injurious to the whole, if they ſhould Adhere to him therein, they muſt follow his Fate; And therefore here they might deſert him, and cleave to ſome other ſound part, and joyn in Communion Approved by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops. The Reaſon of the Biſhops abſolute Power in one reſpect, and his Subjection in another, ſeems to be briefly Couched in that ſhort Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Cyprian, Epiſcopatus unus eſt, cujus à ſingulis in ſolidum pars tenetur. (do un)</hi> for though he held but part of that Epiſcopacy, by which the whole Church <hi>(Concordi multorum Epiſcoporum numeroſitate)</hi> was Governed; yet holding that <hi>Parte in ſolidum,</hi> he had the full Epiſcopal Authority, and was a Catholick Biſhop, and his Orders according to their Nature ought to be Heeded by all Biſhops: But then what he held <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> being but <hi>Pars Epiſcopatûs unius,</hi> he was Bound to Exerciſe his Office in Conjunction with them, who were equal Sharers with him; And herein was Anſwerable to his Fellow-Biſhops for any detriment or injury done by him to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Office and Common Charge. Hence a Biſhop was in ſome things Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, even to the delebility and loſs of his Character, (as <hi>Spalato</hi> hath proved againſt the fond device of the Schools <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) and was bound at his peril, not only to Preach the ſame Faith, but to Walk and Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cannons of the Church; And yet in other Things, his Act was ſufficient to Tye up all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian World; Both which Things are an invincible Evidence of the Senſe of Antiquity, of their Participation of the ſame Office, and of their Obligation to, and dependance upon each other in the diſcharge of it. Hence it was, that when a Biſhop was placed in any Vacant See, though he was never ſo Canonically Ordained yet he was bound to ſend abroad his Circular Epiſtles to other Biſhops, to Sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ifie his due Admiſſion to that great dignity, and withal to give in a Summary of his Faith, that they might Admit him to Catholick Communion, and upon occaſion might Communicate with him, and Aſſiſt him in the juſt diſcharge of his place: If he afterwards fell into Hereſie, or did any irregular Act, he was Tryable by his Peers, and might be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured according to his demerits. On the other Hand, what wholeſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he made for the good of his own particular Church, thoſe, who came from any other Church thither, were bound to obſerve them; And if he juſtly put any Perſon under the Sentence of Excommunication, upon his Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying thereof with the Cauſe, all other Biſhops and all other Churches were bound to take that Perſon for Excommunicate, wherever he came, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him from their Communion; For in Caſes of this Nature, every Regular Act of Authority in one Church, was Regarded as the Act of the whole Church; And thus in all things particular Churches Acted in Relation to, and Communion with the Catholick, and Maintained their Unity Firm and Inviolable.</p>

XIV. My Deſign hath been to Write a Chapter, not a Treatiſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Unity, and therefore I may be excuſeable, if I have not Hit every thing; though I perſwade my ſelf, that had we theſe, the reſt would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But my fear is, that my Accuſation will rather Lye on the other Hand, That I have Iaid the Platform of ſuch a Unity as in all its parts is no where on Earth to be found; And though the more is the pity, yet poſſibly it is too true: But then this Objection Amounts to no more (though that, God knows, is too much) then to ſhew the deplorable ſtate of the Church, and the woful degeneracy of Chriſtians; For the Religion we profeſs Requires ſuch an Unity; And <hi>de facto</hi> it has been had and practiſed in the Church; And till it be Reſtored, I ſee little Hopes that Matters can be brought to Rights, and that they are not, they muſt Anſwer who are the true Cauſe: If any enquire, What particular Perſons in this Caſe are to do? I Anſwer, that invincible Impediments may excuſe <hi>à tanto</hi> but not <hi>à toto,</hi> where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all we ſhould, yet we muſt do all we can: But more particularly, I think, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every Man ought to joyn in Communion with that Church wherein Gods Providence hath placed him, if he cannot juſtly Charge the termes of its Communion with Sin. Otherwiſe there will be no End of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and the Breach will daily grow wider, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Cenſures on thoſe from whom we depart, be moderated with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that we pick not Quarrels without a cauſe, nor Repreſent them worſe in Opinion or Practice then they are; for this exaſperates and alienates Mens Hrarts from Peace. Some Perſons have ſeemed to Me to have read their Adverſaries Books with a Deſign to miſtake them, which (alas!) is too eaſily done without giving our Minds to it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that in ſeparate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Propoſals might be made how far they can come up to each other, that it may be known how far they do agree, and that unquiet Spirits may not bear the Ignorant in Hand, that they agree in nothing, and then that the true Cauſes of the Difference may be ſett down, which would ſett generous Spirits on Work to Remove theſe ſtumbling-Blocks, and make up the Breaches; At leaſt, it would give opportunity to all Conſiderate Perſons to weigh the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to caſt off real Scandals, and to come nearer together as they ſaw cauſe. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That all Perſons be deſirous of true Chriſtian Union and Communion, that they heartily pray for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to their power in their ſeveral Capacities endeavor it; That we come ſhort of this Unity is our Unhappineſs, and no Honour to our Religion; But if any do not truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire it, I ſee not how they can be excuſed from Schiſm, or ſomewhat worſe; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Nature of Schiſm.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. OUR Religion is ſo Unchangeable, <hi>That if an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and teach any other, then what we have already Received, he ought to be Accurſed;</hi> And therefore the nearer we come to the firſt Settlement, the ſurer we are to be in the Right; But ſome Men ſo doat on their fond Devices, and are ſo bewitched with the pleaſure of Coyning New Notions, that not content to delude themſelves, they labour all they can to perſwade others, that every thing that is old is ugly and to be Abominated. Thus that ſweet Harmony of the primitive Chriſtians, whereby they preſerved their Body Sound, againſt the Malice of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, enjoyed free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in all Places, and were no where deſtitute of Comfortable Support and Aſſiſtance, whether Spiritual or Temporal, this (I ſay) has either been imputed to the folly of the firſt Converts, or the Tyranny of Hereticating Biſhops: But if there was any thing ill, and of Miſchievous conſequence to Religion, for this they became zealous Advocates, were ready to tell us, That the Devil is not ſo black as he is Painted, and ſo palliate the Matter, that at length they would draw it in to be uſeful. Amongſt Matters of this Nature nothing hath found more Patrons then Schiſm. Some have ſhuffled it to and fro, till they have loſt it; and ſome have Trick'd and Trimm'd, and Sett it out for ſuch a pretty harmleſs thing, as would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tempt One to be in love with it. But being I have ſaid enough in the firſt Chapter to prove Schiſm a Sin of a deep Dye, I ſhall forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt it, and Sett my Self rather to make a diſcovery of it, that the Rock appearing we may be the better able to avoid it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Schiſm in its general Notion ſignifies any Rent, Rupture, Diviſion, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Solution of Continuity: But in an Eccleſiaſtical Senſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Church, it denotes ſome Breach or Separation among the Members or parts of that Body, growing ſo high as to cauſe Bandying into Parties, and ſetting up diſtinct and oppoſite Communions, or the like: But becauſe all Separation is not Schiſm, and that which is, is not always ſinful, therefore it may be convenient to enquire, by what means Separations are made, what Separation is Schiſm, and what Schiſm is ſinful.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thoſe Perſons who are ſo far from any Communion in the Church, that they never did or would receive and embrace the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, are really ſeparated and excluded from his Body the Church; But
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64154:16"/>
then in this they cannot properly be ſaid to depart from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or make any Schiſm in it, becauſe they were never of it, nor any way Related to it. And therefore their Crime is not ſtiled Schiſm, but Infidelity; And the Perſons Infidels or Heathens, not Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Some Perſons have Profeſſed the Faith, and Lived in the Communion of the Church, but through the powerful Inſtigations of the Devil, the ſtrong temptations of Worldly Advantages, Senſe of Torments, dreadful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Danger, or the like ill Motives, have Renounced not only the Communion of the Church, but the Faith of Chriſt; But theſe are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Schiſmaticks; for Schiſm doth import ſome Relation ſtill to the Church, though it ſuppoſe a diſorderly behaviour in it, and a Breach and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of its Peace and Unity: But theſe are wholly gone off, and their Crime is in it ſelf of a higher Nature, though many times not ſo Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous in its Effects; And it is commonly called Apoſtacy, and the Perſons Apoſtates, or in the Modern Language Renegado's,</p>
            <p n="5">V. There is a third Sort of Perſons who profeſs the Faith, and live in the Communion of the Church, but through Pride, Diſcontent, Wantonneſs, or the like Cauſes, are not careful to Attend to ſound Doctrine, but fall into Errours, and Entertain and deviſe Opinions prejudicial to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Salvation of Souls; But if theſe Men keep their Opinions to themſelves, whatever damage they may bring to their own Souls, they can make no Eccleſiaſtical Schiſm; but if they Broach or Propagate them, then Schiſm is uſually the Effect and Conſequence of ſuch doings; but their Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is from the particularity of their Crime, or obſtinacy in their ill Opinions, which is called Hereſy, and the Perſons Heret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſted but by ſuch Communion, therefore a departure or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from that Communion muſt be that which we call Schiſm. Hence <hi>Heſychius</hi> explains <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which Signifies a Seceſſion or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. And hence it appears, That every Heat, Quarrel or Brabble, (how faulty ſoever it may otherwiſe be,) doth not Amount to Schiſm, unleſs it ſo influence the Communion as to make a breach in that; And therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> nor that Conteſt between <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Anicetus,</hi> nor that Difference between <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and ſome who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64154:16"/>
had been his Auditors, nor that ſharp Conflict between the ſame <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nor that long debate between <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were any of them to be Accounted or brought under the Notion of Schiſm; becauſe the Communion of the Church was ſtill kept up and Maintained by all the Parties; But when this Communion is violated and broken, then it comes to a direct and open Schiſm; And this may be done ſeveral wayes, all of them I pretend not to reach, and thoſe I ſhall mention I ſhall not dwell on.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Some there are, who forſake the Communion of the Charch, but go not ſo far as to ſet up any oppoſite Communion, not that they have any honour for, or regard to Church-Communion, but that they think it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if not prejudiciaI. Theſe, though they ſeem not to Fly ſo high as others, in that they Vex not the Church with oppoſite Communions, yet they really overthrow all Communion, and deſtroy the whole publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, wherein his People are United for his glory and their own benefit; And therefore theſe are nothing ſuch harmleſs Creatures as ſome think them; Amongſt theſe we may Reckon thoſe Rank Enthuſiaſts, who have overgrown Ordinances, and account themſelves far above all ſuch weak Helps and beggerly Elements.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. I ſhall further propoſe it as a Queſtion, whether ſome Men by their particular Opinions or Declarations may not make themſelves Schiſmaticks, even whileſt they continue in the Communion of a Church that is truly of Catholick Communion? for though the Paſtor and Officers of the Church walk never ſo Canonically, and Perform all Services with relation to, and dependance upon the Catholick Church; yet if any Member ſhall ſo awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adhere to this particular Church, as to oppoſe it to all others, and condemn all others, and refuſe Communion with any other, he ſeems to Me to make himſelf a Schiſmatick; For though the Church be of Catholick Communion, yet he communicates in it upon Schiſmatical Principles, and makes it Schiſmatical to him. The Church indeed is in Communion with other Churches, but he communicates in it in oppoſition to other Churches; And this ſeems in ſome Meaſure to have been the Caſe of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were all Miniſters of the ſame Chriſt, great Maſter-Builders in his Church, and zealous Maintainers of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions; and yet ſeveral in the Communion of this Church, ſeems to have communicated upon narrower termes then the Conſtitution of it Required. For ſome were for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and they that were for one were againſt the other two, and againſt all others, who did not joyn with them in the ſame quarrel. I will not ſay but that it might go higher, and that there might be oppoſite Communions; That St. <hi>Paul</hi> there Planting the Goſpel, might leave ſo many Congregations in that Church as the Number of Converts required; That <hi>Apollos</hi> coming after upon the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64154:17"/>
increaſe of Converts, might leave them more Church-Officers, and increaſe the Number of their Congregations; And the firſt might ſtand ſtiffly for <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other for <hi>Apollos:</hi> However, the firſt is not improbable, and indeed both might be true ſucceſſively; They might firſt claſh in the ſame Communion, and then break into oppoſite Communions. But this I leave to the further Conſideration and Cenſure of Others.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Where there is ſuch a Renunciation of Communion, as to ſet up op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Communions, it may be Effected ſeveral Ways: Sometimes the Layety have forſaken their Paſtors, Congregated into Bodies, and of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Raiſed diſtinct Communions; I will not here diſpute whether they deſerve that Name; but certainly this is the Height of Preſumption and Madneſs; for though it be true, which <hi>Cerah</hi> ſaid, <hi>(Numb.</hi> 16. 3.) <hi>That all the Congregation are holy;</hi> yet the ſad Story that follows. aſſures us, That they are not therefore all Prieſts and Levites, and that they may not preſume to enter upon, and promiſcuouſly diſcharge that Sacred Office and Function. Sometimes Subject Presbyters, and other Church-Officers have forſaken their Biſhop, carried away many of the Members of his Church, and gathered Sheep from all Quarters out of the true Fold; And this is the more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, as carrying along with it ſome Shew of Authority. Sometimes Biſhops and their Churches have Rejected the Communion of other Biſhops and their Churches; Sometimes in like manner Metropolitans have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Metropolitans, National Churches National, and Patriarchal Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal. And the Schiſm is ever the more Miſchievous, according to the Conſiderableneſs of the Perſons concerned in it, or the Extent of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, or the Cauſe they divide upon. Too much of all this is in the preſent Diviſions of the Chriſtian World, which are managed with that Bitterneſs and Height, and have torn the Church ſo all-to pieces, that it is a Subject fitter for our Lamentation then Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And yet after all it muſt be Acknowledged, that all Separation is not ſinful; for then wherever there was a Separation, they would be faulty on both Sides, as well they that made, as they that ſuffer by the Separation; Nay, if that ſhould be granted, a Man might be neceſſitated to Sin, which he never is or can be. For if unſufferable Corruptions or ſinful Uſages be brought into a Church, whereof any Perſon is a Member, and ſet up as termes of Communion; He cannot Communicate without Sin, nor can he Depart without Sin, but unavoidably muſt Split upon one of theſe two Rocks, if all Separation be ſinful; And therefore to diſcover that Schiſm which is Sinful or Criminal, we maſt bring it not only a Phyſical but a Moral Conſideration. Such the Caſe may be, that the Separation may not only be lawful but neceſſary. It was Gods Command to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> concerning <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> (Jerem. 5. 45.) <hi>My People, Go ye out of thae midſt of her, and deliver ye</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64154:17"/>
               <hi>every Man his Soul from the fierce Anger of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul,</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Sort of ill Men, which in the latter times ſhould infeſt the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he gives this Charge to <hi>Tsmothy</hi> concerning them, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.) <hi>From ſuch turn away.</hi> Actual Separation therefore may ſometimes be a Duty, when it is a Departure from thoſe who have before departed from the Right, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Unity, and corrupted the Communion of the Church. But being there ought to be no Separation, but upon the ſcore of Avoiding Obligations to Sin, and no further then may ſecure us in that matter, there can be no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration but there will be Sin on the one ſide or the other; And being the bare Separation may not only be lawful but duty, the Sin of Schiſm muſt Lie, where the cauſe and evil is found, and they are the Schiſmaticks who unjuſtly cauſe the Breach. And indeed ſimple Separation doth not include the whole Nature of Schiſm in an Eccleſiaſtical Senſe. For though thoſe, who depart from any true Church of God, as it is a part of the Catholick Church, do break off from the Body; yet thoſe, who depart upon juſt and warrantable Grounds, though they depart from the Schiſmaticks, yet they do not forſake the Church of God, but continue in its Communion, and are Members of that Body; and therefore cannot be Schiſmaticks: But I need not Diſcourſe this any further, becauſe (I think) it is Agreed on all Hands, that the Sin of Schiſm follows the Cauſe. Now from all that hath been ſaid, this or the like Definition of Schiſm may be Gathered, That it is an unjuſt Violation, Breach or Solution of the Unity of the Church: Or (to expreſs it more plainly) a Cauſeleſs Separation from Eccleſiaſtical Communion.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. How far ſome more moderate Perſon in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may be willing to go along with Me in theſe Conſiderations, I cannot tell; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them I know go further; but that will not be the leaſt part of that Controverſie; However, here we muſt part. But becauſe I do profeſs my ſelf a Perſon, who doth deeply Mourn over that diſmal ſtate of the Church, to which thefe Diviſions have brought it, (and that God, who knows the Secrets of all Hearts, knows that I ſay true) and do wiſh an End of their Broils, and would Contribute the utmoſt of my Endeavors to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Breaches: And do moreover freely confeſs, That Schiſm is a Sin of a very dangerous Nature; it will therefore Concern Me to diſcharge my ſelf, from being either a Partner in, or an Abettor of that Miſchievous Evil, of which I Complain; And therefore now I ſhall endeavour to prove, not only that the Cauſe of the Schiſm between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lyes at the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s door; But further, that let them pretend what they will, that Schiſm was firſt made, and ſtill Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and Upheld for ſuch Reaſons as ought to be Strangers to the Chriſtian Religion, and do drive on and keep up ſuch an unwarrantable and fulſom Intereſt, as is not Conſiſtent with the true ſtate of Gods Church.

            <p n="2">II. Two Titles are ſet up the better to ſecure us; But the one is purely forged: and the other is crackt, weak and bad, and not able to ſupport the Claim which is Founded on it; It is hard to ſay, what Authority the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not Challenge under the Notion of Chriſts Vicar; His Flatterers will ſcarce allow any Bounds to be Set to it, and Examine his Actions, and you will find that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ets himſelf none, On this ſcore, not only we, but all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, which are not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, are ſtigmatized for Schiſmaticks: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I think, that there is no one thing that doth better Juſtify our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then the Challenge, and (what in him lies) Exerciſe of ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and boundleſs Authority over all the Churches of God. Upon this Account this Matter will fall under a particular Conſideration, as one of the principal Grounds and Reaſons of our Separation; And therefore at preſent I will leave this great Vicar-General, and try if we can come to any better termes with the Weſtern Patriarch.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This latter Title, as leſs liable to Exception, hath been inſiſted upon of late by ſome, who would ſeem to be of more moderate Principles, and more tender both of the Liberty and Authority of particular Churches: nor is it to be denied, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had a Patriarchate in the Weſtern part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but by what Authority he came by it, and how far it was extended, and whether he hath forfeited and juſtly fallen from it, and other Queſtions of the like Nature, will fall in of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Series of our Diſcourſe. In the mean time, I do think this Title to be ſet up at this time only as a Blind to Amuſe the more unwary and well Meaning Perſons, who are willing to ſubmit to Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, though they deteſt all unjuſt, much more all inſolent and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Uſurpations; for if by a Charter from Chriſt he be his only Vicar, over the Univerſal Church, it is not only a Leſſening of his Holineſs, but a direct Affront to our Saviour, to Cope up his Deputy within Bounds, and to Give Him a limited Juriſdiction by Eccleſiaſtical Authority, when he is Inveſted with all by Original Right, and needs not any which they can Give; And it would certainly be much greater Satisfaction to the Chriſtian World, to prove his Authority to be of God, rather then Men. Beſides, I would gladly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64154:19"/>
know, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> will Acquieſce here, and Reſt Contented with the Title and Authority of the Weſtern Patriarch? For Patriarchal Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity is by Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and was at firſt Suited to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Empire, and the Grandeur of ſome principal Cities in it; And by the ſame Authority it was Given may be taken away, or placed elſewhere, as ſhall be judged moſt uſeful and beneficial to the Church of God. Now though all this may be eaſily proved, yet being applied to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and according to the preſent ſtate of the Queſtion, it is as applicable to him as any other Patriarch) I fear the whole College of Cardinals <hi>Nemin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">IV. But be it as it will, without any regard to any ſuch ill Deſignes, which ſome Men may covertly Manage, let the Objection have its due force, and let us Examine, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Weſtern Patriarch, (ſo called in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to other Patriarchates in the Empire of another Site) had any peculiar and proper Juriſdiction over the <hi>Britannick</hi> Churches, or whether they were any part of his Dioceſs, as the word in its largeſt Acception ſignifies, A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion containing ſeveral Provinces? And this I think will be fully Anſwered: if I prove, That in Relation to the <hi>Britannick</hi> Church, either he had no ſuch Juriſdiction, or none by Right.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the Government of the Church was left in the Hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, I ſhall prove hereafter. But for the more convenient and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Management of the Churches Affairs, there began very early a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deference, Reſpect and Obſervance to be paid to the Biſhop of the principal City, where the Secular Governour had his Reſidence. He at firſt was called <hi>Epiſcopus primae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis,</hi> or <hi>Sedis;</hi> Afterwards, a Metropolitan. But ſome overgrown Cities, whoſe Numbers, Wealth and Intereſt enabled them to overtop and oppreſs Others, as it were, Naturally Infuſed into their Biſhops a Spirit of Ambition to extend their Juriſdiction and Power, Anſwerably to the Grandeur of their City. Theſe Mens Encroachments were for a long time ſtoutly oppoſed, but Power naturally following Strength, Wealth and Intereſt, and an Advantage being given them by the New Diviſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> they in the End prevail'd, and Graſp'd ſo large Juriſdiction as to have ſeveral Metropolitans under them, and obtained their firſt Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as our late Learned Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chs, afterwards Patriarchs, and ſometimes Primates. Of this new Booty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Biſhop of the moſt Renowned City in the World, and the Ancient Seat of the Empire, carried away no ſmall Share; for he was always of Kin to the Lion in the Fable, who, when the Prey came to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64154:19"/>
divided, made the Beaſts that Hunted with him, Content with a very ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if he was ſo gracious as to allow any thing: But yet this New Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Power did not ſwallow up the whole Church, but in many Places they ſtill Lived in their Ancient Liberty, Governed by their Biſhops and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, without being ſubject to any Pratriarch; of which the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Churches are a famous Inſtance in the Eaſt, and I can yet ſee nothing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to think otherwiſe of the <hi>Britannick</hi> in the Weſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Never any Succeſſion of Men have ſtood ſo conſtantly on their Guard, and have been ſo watchful, diligent and induſtrious upon all occaſions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs others and Exalt themſelves, as the Biſhops of the <hi>Roman</hi> See: All was Fiſh that ever come to their Net; If they could at any time ſteal into a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, though never ſo unjuſtly, they would never quit it, or not without ſtrong Tugging and eternal Claiming. And therefore Conſidering this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it were a fair Propoſal, that Setting aſide Flams and Impertinencies, they would produce any fair Footſteps of a proper Juriſdiction exerciſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the <hi>Britons,</hi> within the ſpace of a Hundred years after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> For when Men have always been ſo buſie in Acquiring, ſo tenacious in Keeping, ſo ſevere in Exerciſing Juriſdiction, and want no Records, (unleſs what themſelves have either falſifyed or abuſed); That theſe Men can produce no good Evidence for ſuch a Juriſdiction, to Me it ſeems a good Argument, that from the Beginning there was none. If bare Claims, (and thoſe coming after) were enough, no Man could live in Peace: And therefore he that will thruſt another out of poſſeſſion for his own benefit, muſt well and clearly prove his Title. Had theſe Iſlands belonged to the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch, there was no ſtrength in them to have kept out his Power, when it was back'd with the leaſt Shew of Right. If therefore it cannot be proved, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was in poſſeſſion of ſuch Juriſdiction, here, at or near the time that Patriarchates were ſetled, he may let his Suit fall; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have more Hopes from force or fraud, then Right; In this Cafe, if in any, that Common Rule, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe, &amp; non apparere,</hi> hold good; And the rather, becauſe the Canon that Confirms Patriarchates, ſuppoſeth the former Exerciſe of fuch Juriſdiction by Cuſtom. What by degrees he gained long after, may ſerve well enough to prove him an Uſurper, but can Create him no Right, as I ſhall prove Anon.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Now though it be all the Reaſon in the World, that if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will pretend a Title, they ſhould prove it; yet I will not barely inſiſt upon Poſſeſſion on our part, without giving ſome Reaſons that may manifeſt our Right to it. If the Patriarchate of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was Confined to the Suburbicary Churches, it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Britons</hi> lay too far off to be Hook'd in by that Title; What other Evidence can be brought for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bounds of his Patriarchate, I cannot tell; I have met with no better:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64154:20"/>
And this having been plainly Aſſigned to him, it will concern them to bring their Proofs, who will extend it further, and therefore I will not longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it. Yet this among other Reaſons moves me to think, that as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch he had no proper Juriſdiction either over the <hi>Gallican</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Churches, and divers others, otherwiſe then as he might ſometimes interpoſe as an Honourary Arbitrator, or at other times upon a nicking Opportunity with the diligence of a watchful Uſurper, invade their Rights. That the <hi>French</hi> Churches came not under his Authority in the ſame way and manner, that ſome Others did, the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches ſo ſtoutly Maintained to this very day, are an irrefragable Inſtance; And perhaps that is almoſt the only Church of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, which affords us any Hope, that the Cauſe may one day come to a more equal Hearing, and Matters be brought more to Rights in the Church of God. But as for our ſelves, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> never Exerciſed any ſuch Patriarchal Juriſdiction over the <hi>Britons,</hi> nor would they own or ſubmit to any ſuch (conſidering the low Eſtate of the One, and the Power, Arts and indefatigable Induſtry of the other) it will be a Convincing Argument to any unprejudiced Perſon, that he never had any ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction here; That he did Exerciſe any ſuch Juriſdiction, I deny; And it will Concern them to Convince Me by clear Inſtances of the contrary, who will Aſſert it; But if it were poſſible, that they could tell me Five Hundred Tales of Perſons ſent over hither by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall not Value it one Ruſh. For if wherever he ſends one of an Errand, he Requires the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the place, as he hath the Privilege which never Man had; ſo if he hath not been very negligent and falſe to his own Intereſt, he might long ſince have gained the Juriſdiction of the whole World, and that is certainly too much for a Patriarch, which is our preſent diſpute. But though I am not bound to prove the Negative, yet to ſhew that he could have no ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I ſhall produce two Arguments, the one taken from the different Rites and Uſages of the <hi>Britons</hi> from the <hi>Romans;</hi> The other from the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops downright diſclaiming ſuch Authority, and Aſſerting and Proving their Liberty.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Doubtleſs it doth more Concern us to be truly thankful, that God hath Vouchſafed us the Light of his Goſpel, and to be careful to live acccrd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, then ſcrupulouſly to enquire after the preciſe time, when the <hi>Britons</hi> Received the Chriſtian Faith. But if Enquiry ſhould be made, (which in our preſent Caſe may not only be allowable but uſeful) I am prone to think it would appear, That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches were ſo far from being the Slave, that they were the Elder Siſter of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> And if neither the Gift of Chriſt, nor the Canons of the Ancient Church have dealt her any hard Meaſure in this Matter, certainly the Prerogative of her Birth-right ought to inveſt Her with ſome Honour and Priviledge, at leaſt to Shield Her from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64154:20"/>
Truckling too much to the Power and Petulance of her younger Siſter: And the rather becauſe ſhe hath not been unfruitful, as having brought forth the firſt Chriſtian King, furniſhed the World with the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, afforded the firſt (call her as you pleaſe) Chriſtian Queen or Empreſs, and of all Others firſt ſo Received the Faith, that it was the publick, Allowed and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Religion of the place, in which Reſpect ſhe hath ſometimes been Honoured with the Title of <hi>Primogenita Eccleſia;</hi> But to paſs by theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourary Titles, it is generally Agreed, That the <hi>Britons,</hi> as in ſeveral other Matters, ſo eſpecially in the Obſervation of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> did differ from the <hi>Romans:</hi> And to find out the true Reaſon of this, I think the beſt Way will be to look ſtill higher, even to the firſt times of Chriſtianity. Our bleſſed Saviour was ſo far from ſeparating from the Jewiſh Church, that he made them his particular Care and Charge, and ſeems to have ſo deſigned all his Labours for their Conviction and Reformation, that all Nations might have been Aggregated to them in his Name; And therefore he was generally ſhy towards Others, and being Urged with Arguments in favour of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> plainly Anſwers, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 15. 24.) <hi>I am not ſent, but unto the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. This Honour towards the Jewiſh Church, (the only Church of God then on Earth) and Care that it might not be loſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at rather that the Wall of Separation being broken down, all Others might be let in to Her, continued with the Apoſtles and Difciples of Chriſt, after his Death and Reſurrection, for they remained ſtill at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> preaching to the Jews. And when the Cruelty of <hi>Herod,</hi> and Malice of the Jews followed them ſo cloſe, that they were many of them forced to Fly out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſave their Lives, yet their kindneſs to the Jews, and Hopes of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſtill ſtuck clofe to them, in ſo much that thoſe, who were ſcattered upon the Perſecution of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and went as far as <hi>Phenice, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Preached the Word to none but the Jews only,</hi> (Acts 11. 19.) And there was need of no leſs then a Miracle to perſwade <hi>Peter</hi> to go and inſtruct <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile in the Way oſ Truth, <hi>(Acts</hi> 10.) and though he did go upon ſuch unanſwerable Motives, yet he was called to an Account for it: The going in unto Men Uncircumciſed was thought a Crime not to be ſuffered, unleſs extraordinary Reaſon could be given for it. And perhaps this Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Jews might be no ſmall cauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> Judaizing at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now whileſt the Diſciples did Adhere ſo cloſe to the Jews, it is not only Reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they Uſed their Cuſtomes and Rites; But we have Scripture Teſtimony of ſome Inſtances, wherein they did ſo, as in the matter of the Sabbath, (though they kept alſo the Lords Day) and Circumciſion, and ſome other things. And therefore it is likely, that they did obſerve with them their other Faſts and Feaſts, eſpecially that which was Accounted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, the Paſſeover. For as they look'd upon theſe things as in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64154:21"/>
to be matters then indifferent, ſo tbey did hope to draw off the Jews by degrees, and to let the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> go off Honourably rather by Difuſe then Contempt. And this Practice continued for ſome time after the Converſion of divers of the Gentiles by the Diſciples, who were diſperſed by the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore I take that Plea of <hi>Polyerates</hi> for his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> from <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a Teſtimony of the very early Converſion of thoſe <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, and that they were of the Firſt fruits of Chriſtianity. But after that God, by beſtowing the Holy Ghoſt on the Gentiles, and other clear Signes and Indications of his Will, had Convinced all the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Word, that it was not only lawful, but their Duty to make known the Words of Eternal Life unto the Gentiles, and the Gentiles upon their Preaching in all places did plentifully Flock into the Church, then in thoſe Gentile Churches Chriſtian Liberty began in a greater Meaſure to be Maintained againſt the Moſaical Rites. And now <hi>Paul,</hi> who Circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> refuſed to Circumciſe <hi>Titus;</hi> yea, even the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> disburthen of all thoſe Matters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome few things, which the Neceſſity of the Times would not permit them to take off, unleſs they ſhould have utterly diſobliged the Jews, of whom they had ſome Hopes. And about this time it is probable began the ſtrict Obſervation of the Lords Day, with the Neglect of the Sabbath; And the Celebrating the Reſurrection, not on the preciſe time of the Jewiſh Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but on the firſt day of the Week, (Called the Lords Day, from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection on that day) next following the Fourteenth of the Moon. And yet though this was Allowed in the Gentiles, yet in Communion with the Chriſtian Jews, a greater Regard was had to the Law; And therefore when that great Aſſertor of the Gentiles Liberty St. <hi>Paul,</hi> came up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though the Diſciples Approved what he had done, yet they Adviſe Him to go purifie himſelf in the Temple, and do ſuch other Matters, that he might Appear according to the Opinion of the Jews, <hi>to Walk orderly and keep the Law,</hi> (Acts 21.) But when neither Pains, Patience nor Arguments could prevail, but the Jews became more obſtinate then ever in Adhering to the Moſaical Rites, and obtruded them upon all Others, with the Opinion of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity that they became a Scandal to the Goſpel, and made the Death of Chriſt in vain, and upon this Account were the Implacable Enemies of the Chriſtians in all Places; Then to Vindicate the Goſpel the Chriſtians were under a Neceſſity to depart from them; And thoſe, who before Complyed all that could be with them, now leſt they ſhould ſeem to Countenance the Opinion, <hi>That Salvation was by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>not by the Faith of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Fled as far as they could from them, and would not joyn with them in, or Practiſe any of the Rites peculiar to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> for the Matter was now come to that paſs, that they could not do it without betraying the

Chriſtian Religion; ſo that now ceaſed the Obligation to theſe Matters, which the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had formerly impoſed in favour of the Jews, and Hopes to Win them. And hence it is probable, many Churches too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Britons</hi> were not <hi>Quartodecimani,</hi> as ſome have ſuppoſed; for thoſe kept the Feaſt on the Fourteenth of the Moon, on what day of the Week ſoever it fell: but the <hi>Britons</hi> expected the Lords Day.

unreaſonable that thoſe, who had no Juriſdiction over them, ſhould impoſe an Alteration upon them, and ſtill worſe to raiſe irreconcileable fewds, and make Diviſions in Gods Church for ſuch a matter; As if a Man could not be a good Chriſtian, without being an exact Aſtronomer, and Critically cunning in the Cuſtomes of other Nations.</p>

This much troubled the good Pope, who by all Circumſtances ſeems to have Set his Heart on this Work; And he had the greater Reaſon for it, becauſe it was already half done to his Hands; And therefore he gently Reproves thoſe faint-hearted Souldiers, but takes greater pains to encourage them; And that they might want nothing to Fit them for the work, he Sends and Recommends them to <hi>Etherius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who furniſheth them with Interpreters <hi>de Gente Erancorum, (Bed.

The Grounds whereon the <hi>Britons</hi> proceeded ſeem to be Chiefely theſe, That they would not give up their Ancient Liberties and Cuſtomes, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Canons of the Church.

Firſt, That with a tender Care to expreſs their Communion with the Catholick Church, and their duty to all Chriſtians, they own no other Obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then as Chriſtians they owe to any other Foreign Biſhops and their Churches; And ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> owed as much to Them as they to Him. Secondly, That the Authority which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> demanded, and the Power of any Foreign Biſhop to place him over them, was a thing utterly unknown and unheard of to them; ſo little were they Acquainted with the Patriarchate, which is now ſo Confidently Aſſerted. Thirdly, that they were ſo ſubject to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> That they did not think him ſubject to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of any other particular Biſhop whatſoever, but that he was over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next under God. And accordingly we never hear of any Appeals from him to any Superiour See; But if any thing concerned them in Common, or was too weighty for him, it was Tranſacted Synodically. And it is Obſerveable, That though the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops and Clergy Flockt to this Synod with their main ſtrength, yet the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caerleon</hi> abſented himſelf, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood either in indignation at <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Claim, or leſt his Appearance ſhould ſeem any ways in the leaſt to Countenance that Superiority, which he Challenged over him. The Effects of this Synod were very unhappy, for the <hi>Britons</hi> went away ſo Enraged at <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Pride and Pretences, that they would not Afford the leaſt Aſſiſtance towards the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> Nay, when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

time, his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church were then all Pagans; If he ſpeak of what was in or after <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s time, it is nothing to the purpoſe; for no Body denies but that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brought in the <hi>Roman</hi> way; the Diſpute is concerning what was the Practice here before; And now <hi>F. Paerſons</hi> may take his Lye again, as being the true Father of it.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Upon this falſe Foundation he frames this Trifling Argument, which he ſeems to make great Account of: <hi>That the</hi> Britons <hi>can no more be ſaid to be of</hi> Eaſtern <hi>Converſion, then a Man could ſay the firſt Preachers to them were</hi> Pelagians, <hi>becauſe in</hi> Beda's <hi>time ſome Reliques of the</hi> Pelagian <hi>Hereſic might be found amongſt them.</hi> To which I Anſwer, That the Caſe is quite otherwiſe; And if in <hi>Beda</hi>'s, or any others time, the <hi>Britons</hi> had been found as unanimouſly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie as they were in the Paſchal Solemnity, and no Footſteps appearing that it had been otherwiſe, any Man would Conclude, That their firſt Preachers had been <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or Men infected with the ſame Hereſie, if they were not known by the ſame Name. And thus he ought to have laid his Argument to make the Parallel run true to the Reality of the Caſes: But he was more Crafty then ſo, for that had been to Confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Next, he triumphs over <hi>Fox,</hi> for ſaying, That <hi>Beda</hi> affirms this Cuſtom concerning <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to have been in <hi>Britain</hi> almoſt 1000 yeares after Chriſt; <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) Beda <hi>was a much older Author, and died in the Year</hi> 735. Well, but what if all this ſhould be done by Miracle? (without one I know not how it could) and <hi>Beda</hi> ſhould appear almoſt 300 yeares after his Death to ſome drowſie Monk, and tell him this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ale? <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> if it had made for him would have Hugg'd ſuch a Revelation: But after all, it is only a miſtake, if not, a wilful One; though <hi>Fox</hi>'s heedleſs way of Expreſſion gave too much Occaſion for it; for his meaning is this, That <hi>Beda</hi> affirmeth <hi>Eaſter</hi> to be ſo kept by the <hi>Britons</hi> in his time, and that the ſame Cuſtom continued after his time amongſt them ſo long, as to be Practiſed almoſt 1000 yeares after Chriſts time; And all this is very true, as ſhall appear Anon.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. To Revenge this Wrong (as he thinks) done to <hi>Beda,</hi> he falls foul upon the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> for making <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmoutb</hi> to live about 700 years after Chriſt. <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Teſtimony indeed Gauled him forely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was to be ſhuffled off by any means; Whether he hath done the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> Right in that thing, I neither know nor care. For their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as to the time of <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Life doth nothing invalidate his Teſtimony.

proved, and therefore the Teſtimony is more Conſiderable, and deſerves a better Anſwer after all the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> Account, may Refer to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Teſtimony, and Time when the thing was Tranſacted, not to <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Life; and then it will be too Modeſt and too favourable; To leſs purpoſe is his time ſpent in proving <hi>Jeoffery</hi> to be no Cardinal. I ſhould be prone to believe him, if I had no other Reaſon, but his Relating a Truth ſo prejudicial to the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> But if he was not a Cardinal, he might be as honeſt a Man; 'Tis certain he was a Biſhop, and as ſuch was a much better Man; eſpecially if the Pope would ſuffer them to be what Chriſt and his Apoſtles made them, and not Appropriate all that Authority to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, to a Share of which every Biſhop hath as good Right and Title as himſelf.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. At length, after a deal of Shuffling, Lying and Rayling, he comes to the Matter of <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Teſtimony; And that he Anſwers eaſily, and ſo may any Man, who takes no Care to ſpeak Truth, but only what may ſerve his Turn; He ſays, <hi>There is not a Word in it of not Acknowledging the Pope</hi>s <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</hi> I know not how there ſhould, for ſuch a Supremacy as is now Claimed, was not then Lick'd into form. He might have Remembred, that the Tranſactions there mentioned, relate to the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, then whom no Man wrote more fiercely againſt the Supremacy; Or, which is in effect the ſame thing, the ſetting up an Univerſal Biſhop; Or if he had bethought himſelf of what he elſewhere tells us, That the <hi>Britons</hi> would not Communicate with <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Converts, then Dogs; he might have made it a ſtrong Argument for their profeſſing Obedience, and Subjection to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> In fine, he will have their Anſwer Amount to no more but this, <hi>That only they would not Acknowledge</hi> Auguſtines <hi>Superiority over them, ſeeing be was ſent only to the</hi> Engliſh; <hi>And that the Authority of their own Arch biſhop was not taken away by his coming, for any thing they knew, but remained as before</hi> (3 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. cap. 2. ſect. 14.) What pity is it, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did not better inform them? it ſeem's they would have been a very obedient People, had they known the Pope's Orders, and been told the Truth of the Matter. But it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky thing, that when a Man with Working his Wits has deviſed an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that would do the Buſineſs, he ſhould not have the Privilege to make it paſs for Truth, unleſs it be ſo in it ſelf.

            <p n="23">XXIII. In the next place he is highly Offended with the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> for ſpeaking ſo irreverently of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt, and his Teſtimony, <hi>That all the Weſt Churches were Founded by</hi> St. Peter, <hi>on his Diſciples and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi> And it is no wonder if Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ſpoke out for himſelf, and it may go a great way, where they have not to do with ſuch Hereticks as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Proofs. If this be true, why has <hi>F.

To Help out this, he tells us of Two more Popes, <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the fourth, who wrote to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to reduce them from this Errour; But <hi>Honorius</hi> will do him ſmall ſervice, becauſe in that Account which <hi>Beda</hi> gives of his Letter, <hi>(Ecc.

The <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Uſage was in this Weſtern part of the World a great Singularity in thoſe days; Now if <hi>John</hi> had a Mind to draw them off from it, who can blame him from ſpeaking favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and repreſenting the Matter as inoffenſively as could be: The Way to Win Men is not to provoke them; and we ſometimes ſeem not to believe, that a Man is ſo bad as we know he is, becauſe we would not harden him with ſhame, but have a defire to make him better. But when Men purpoſely and deſignedly ſpeak ſparingly, their Words are not to be brought as an Evidence of the whole Matter. But the Truth is, they had little knowledge of our

the Rights of every Province, which Confirmed by old Cuſtom have been Held formerly, even from the Beginning, ſhall be preſerved pure and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable, and that every Metropolitan have free Liberty to take a Copy of their Tranſactions for his own Security. And here we have the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon not only Confirmed, but we are informed what are thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe Ancient Cuſtomes, which they would have take place. They were ſuch, which were not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, not only of ſome time back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but from the Beginning. And if theſe be they which muſt carry the Cauſe, I think the Churches of theſe Iſles are or ought to be as ſafe, as ever were the <hi>Cyprian.</hi> For theſe had not then ſo much as been Attempted, when the other were but a ſmall Matter from being quite Raviſhed, and had undoubtedly been ſwallowed up, had a General Councel been kept off but ſome few yeares longer. But that they might more effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Miſchiefs which Attend ſuch Encroachments, and the Detriment and Diſhonour done to Religion by them, the Holy Fathers give no leſs then three Reaſons for this their Conſtitution. Firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That the Canons of the Fathers may not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, it ſeems the Laws of the Church had been all along againſt it. But what of that? What are Canons to the Pope, who is ſubject to none. 'Tis pity he was not excepted: But the true Reaſon is, becauſe the Fathers thought he ought not. The <hi>Plenitudo Poteſtatis,</hi> now ſo much boaſted of, was not then thought of; Or if it was, durſt not appear abroad, leſt it ſhould have been Knock'd o'th' Head for a Monſter. Popes themſelves in thoſe days pleaded the Canons, and were iudged by them: And this Canon hath a peculiar evil Aſpect upon him; for it is directly contrary to his declared Opinion and Determination in behalf of the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> So that if the Popes now do not regard the Canons, it ſeems heretofore they as little regarded him. The ſecond Reaſon of the Canon is expreſſed thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That the Pride and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Secular Power may not enter the Church, under a pretence of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Miniſterial Function, which ſeems directly to point to that Saying of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 20 25. I Cite the Original, becauſe there is ſomething peculiar in the words, which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation could not eaſily reach,) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Surely if theſe Fathers had not a Grudge at the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had a foreſight of his Progreſs. For put together what the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> now Acts, and what, he Claims; And if that <hi>Typhus Seculi,</hi> which the Antients all along ſo feared and bitterly inveighed againſt, be not brought into the Church by him; I will be bold to ſay, that all their Feares were Follies, and that it neither it nor ever can be brought in whileſt the World ſtands. The third Reaſon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64154:31"/>
ought to Affect any Man, who calls Himſelf a Chriſtian. It is this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Leſt by degrees we loſe that Liberty, which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer of all Men hath purchaſed for us, (or beſtowed on us) with his Blood. If ſo, our Churches, in ſtead of being blamed, ought to be highly Commended for defending this Liberty: And as he, who ſhall invade it, ought at preſent to be diſcountenanced by all others, ſo it is to be feared, that he will have aſad Account to make up in the day of the Lord Jeſus, though he pretend to be his Vicar. Now if Reaſon could prevail, here is ſufficient; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe oftentimes Men will not be Ruled by Reaſon, therefore the Fathers yet take a further Care to Compel them by Law, and determine in the ſame Canon, That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. If any Man do Seize anothers Province, and ſubject it to Him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That He ſhall Reſtore it; And that they might take away all Pretences, they Conclude, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That if any Man ſhould produce a Conſtitution contrary to what is now determined, it ſhall be void, or of no Authority. Now if there be any Reverence for, or force in a Canon, ſo carefully penn'd, by ſo Venerable a Councel, then it is plain, That we have withdrawn no Obedience which the Pope could lawfully Claim, nor Caſt off any Authority that he was poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of in Right; For being there were then Churches in theſe Illes, ſetled under their Biſhops, according to the primitive Forme and Uſage, and Owed no Subjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> either as <hi>Metropolitan</hi> or <hi>Patriarch,</hi> as hath been proved; then whatever Pretences he can now make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or any Authority over us, are by the Councel determined to be void; And what Uſurpatiòns ſoever he hath made, are Adjudged to be Reſtored; So that if they have no better Arguments then the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority as Patriarch, that will do them no ſervice here; but it will rather Appear, That we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very Canonically in our Reformation</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. Thus much will clearly Appear, That as the Biſhops of thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and powerful Cities, <hi>Rome, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were ever and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non making Inroads upon other Mens Juriſdiction; So the Three Firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels were very careful to Fence the Liberties of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their and all others Encroachments. For as for the Second General Councel, which I have Omitted, any Man may be abundantly ſatisfied, who will take the pains to Read <hi>The Account of the Government of the Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> written by the Learned Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Oxford;</hi> Yet either Tyred with endleſs ſtrugling, or over-born with power, or out-witted by Cunning, or rather wrought on by all theſe means, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fourth General Councel did plainly Amplifie their Power. For after the Tranſlation of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64154:32"/>
Seat of the Empire to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Biſhop of that place by the favour of the Emperour, by the Power of the City, by the Aſſiſtance of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and by a lucky Opportunity offered from the New Diviſion of the Empire, ſuddenly ſtarts up from a mean Suffragan to be the Second, and perhaps moſt powerful Biſhop of the Empire. And now a Councel Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> juſt under his Noſe, and Conſiſting moſtly of Eaſtern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and many of them his Dependants, and where the Emperour ſome time Appeared in Perſon, and his Miniſters all along bore a great ſway. This he thought was the time, if ever, to get that done, which no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel before would hearken to; And to obtain a Confirmation of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Juriſdiction, which that Ravenous See had ſeized in few yeares ſpace. But in doing this, he is conſtrained to do Others Buſineſs, that he might do his own. And here firſt. we find one ſet over the Head of the Metropolitan, and an Appeal from Him Ratified by Canon; And thus the Biſhops of thoſe great Cities Mounted into Exarchs, afterwards called Patriarchs, and the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> got the beſt Share. There was doubtleſs no mean Artifice uſed in the Managery of this Matter; for it ſeems to be rather Slurr'd upon the Councel, then Acted by them: And the Foxes themſelves, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Legats were here caught, and all they could do was afterwards to Proteſt againſt Proceedings in this Matter. But when <hi>Leo</hi> heard of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> he fell a Roaring at no Rate, not that he had too little, but taht the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had too much; He was in a bodily fear of ſuch a dangerous Competitour, who on a ſudden had from almoſt Nothing Riſen to ſuch Greatneſs, that he was able to Cope with Him; And by the Grandeur of his City, his Intereſt in the Clergy, and favour of the Emperour, might in a ſhort time be able to over-top Him. It is not unlikely, that <hi>Leo</hi> might think, that he could have ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled well enough for Himſelf without the Help of any ſuch Canon, and might poſſibly look on it as a Confinement. But whatever he thought, his Plea is clear contrary, and that he might depreſs the Riſing Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, he is Tooth and Nail for the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, and the power of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, which by the Way is an Argument, that it was not then thought, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons Erected Patriarchates, as ſome ſince Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Iſſue of this Quarrel I am not concerned to purſue; But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be here made Patriarch, you ſee he doth not care to accept it: But ſuppoſe him to be <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="30">XXX. But now let us for once ſuppoſe, what can never be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Patriarchate of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was Legally and Canonically

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver theſe Iſles; yet what Feats will this do for him? even under Patriarchates, (for they did not obtain in all places of the Empire) the power of Metropolitans was ſtill Reſerved; they ſtill Ordained the Biſhops of their Provinces; they did Convene and hold Provincial Synods, and determined Matters as formerly; Only whereas the Metropolitan was before Ordained in his Province by his Suffragans, now he was to be Ordained by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, or at leaſt with his Conſent, and there lay an Appeal from him and his Synod. In ſhort, the Power of a Patriarch Conſiſted in certain known laſtances, but chiefly in Conjunction with the Biſhops of his Dioceſs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate. Now what a pitiful ſhrivel'd thing would the Pope think this, if it were offered him? How would he fret and ſtorm, if we ſhould thus Admit Him, and Tye his Hands behind Him? And yet as Patriarch this is all he can Claim; But to Claim that and ten times more, where he hath not ſo much as a Patriarchal Right, is ſuch a Piece of Impudence as none would be guilty of, but thoſe who can bluſh at nothing. And therefore it will be beſt not to truſt him, but hold our own as long as we can.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. Upon the ſame Suppoſition we may ſtill proceed further, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether a Patriarchal Power do Entitle a Man to all he can Graſp, or lay his Hands on? Are we ſo faſt bound, that there is no getting quit of Him, though he Command ſuch Matters as diſhonour God, diſturb the Church, miſlead Chriſtians out of the true Way, and does Actually Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ize over Mens Souls, Bodies and Eſtates? Patriaſchal Autherity was firſt Inſtituted for the good of the Church, that Order might be preſerved, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion ſecured, all Perſons contained in and held to their Duties, and Hereſies and Schiſms prevented. But now, if this Power be made uſe of againſt all theſe Ends, muſt the good of the Church give way to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of it to the good of the Church? That it has been and is abuſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to all theſe Ends, might be fully proved by an Induction of Particulars, but that would lead Me into too large a Field; And I ſhall therefore Omit here, becauſe it will be done hereafter, when I ſhall inſiſt on thoſe particular Heads, which prove the <hi>Romanaſts</hi> guilty of the Schiſm. Beſides, a Patriarch is only a Biſhop with an extended Juriſdiction; The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is the higheſt Order in Gods Church, the Patriarchate is only an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Gift or Inſtitution, whereby the Biſhop of a certain place is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the overſight of more Churches for the Enlarging Communion, and ſecuring Religion; Now if any Biſhop go againſt the Canons, or teach falſe doctrine, or encourage lewd Practices, and preach up ill Manners, his Flock might deſert Him, and joyn in Communion with ſuch as were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox: If a Metropolitan took ſuch Courſes, the Biſhops of his Province might caſt Him off, and Govern their Churches by themſelves independently of Him. And of a Patria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, who hath ſomewhat a greater truſt, ſhall at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64154:33"/>
the ſame Rate abuſe it, he ought the more ſpeedily to be Renounced, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the greater Miſchief and Detriment, which will otherwiſe befal the Church of God. Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions muſt give way to Divine, and when inſtead of ſerving them, they overthrow or fruſtrate them, they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void and null. Let us ſuppoſe, that a Perſon were Recommended to the Pope to be Conſecrated or Inſtituted Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaenterbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the tedious Waiting and large Feeing that muſt be in the Caſe, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs will have for Firſt-Fruits, 10000 Florens, and for the Pall 5000, (for theſe were the old Rates,) And beſides all this, to ſecure the New Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhep to be at his devotion at all times for the future, will force Him to take an Oath, not of Canonical Obedience, but of Fealty, (for that they have brought it to.) Now perhaps the King may not be willing, that ſuch great Summs of Money ſhould from time to time be dreyned out of the Nation; And as much more Averſe, that his Subjects ſhould Swear Allegiance to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Prince, as thinking it prejudicial to his abſolute Sovereignty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſafety and peace of his Kingdoms. What ſhall be the Iſſue of rhis? Either the Perſon Recommended and King too muſt yield, or we muſt have no Metropolitan, and the King ſhall be Excommunicated. And if he continue ſtubborn and obſtinate in the Right, perhaps the whole Kingdom ſhall be put under an Interdict; And ſo if your Purſes be not at the Popes ſervice, and your Perſons his Slaves, you ſhall not be ſuffered ſo much as to Worſhip God. Now is not this a fine Patriarch? And would it not be a great Sin to caſt Him off, and ſerve God whether he will or no? This Power the Pope has uſed, this Power he ſtill pretends to, and he that Claims an Authority againſt God and his Worſhip, who was only Entruſted for it, hath Forfeited his Truſt, and fallen from the Honour of it.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. I ſhall now only Advance one ſtep higher, and then leave this mighty Patriarch, till we Meet him again in another diſguiſe. Let us ſtill ſuppoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate to have extended over theſe Iſles; Nay more, be it ſuppoſed that the Pope is his Holineſs indeed, and that he could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of no ill Management; yet I doubt not but his Patriarchate hath of it ſelf in courſe failed ceaſed and become void, at leaſt ſo far as Relates to their Churches; And that too, by thoſe very Laws and Canons of the Ancient Church, which may ſeem to have Erected or Countenanced it. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Reaſons and Ends of a Law ought to be well Conſidered, becauſe It is not the Words and Phraſes, but the Senſe and Meaning which is the Law: And therefore we commonly ſay, That <hi>Ratio Legis Lex eſt.</hi> Now nothing can be more plain, then that the Bounds of Eccſeſiaſtical Juriſdiction were Framed on purpoſe, that they might not interfere with the Civil Power; And as hereby the Church manifeſted her Tenderneſs and Regard to it, and the Subjection of her Members, ſo She Reaped no ſmall Benefit by it. Hence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64154:33"/>
the Limits of Juriſdiction in the Church followed the Diviſions of the State: Where the Governour of the Province had his Reſidence, there of courſe the Metropolitical Authority placed it ſelf, and the Biſhop of that City was he, whom the Apoſtles Canons, <hi>(Can.</hi> 35.) call the Firſt, to whom all the other Biſhops of the Province are to have ſuch a peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that they are to Act nothing of Common Concern without his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. And ſo after the Diviſion of the Empire into Dioceſſes, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly roſe up that Rank of Men ſince called Patriarchs. But by the way we muſt obſerve, that this did not take in all places. For in ſome Cities where the Vicars of the Empire Reſided, were not of Strength, Intereſt and Power ſufficient to Mount their Biſhops into Patriarchs. Beſides, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Church were exceeding jealous of this new ſtart-up Power, as ſavouring more of Worldly Pride, then Epiſcopal Care, and therefore kept it out wherever they could: And the wary <hi>African</hi> Biſhops made a Decree againſt ſo much as the Uſe of the Name; And great Reaſon they had for it, for it would be no hard Matter to prove, that by this means crept in thoſe Abuſes and Corruptions into the Church, which are now Maintained with a Pretence of Authority, and therefore the more Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs. Moreover, as this new Honour was dangerous, ſo it was needleſs, for the Dioceſſes, though they ſeemed to ſwallow up, yet they did not deſtroy the Provinces; So that the Metropolitical Authority remained ſtill Suited to the Government of the State, and was much more ſafe and better Fitted to keep out Secular Pride, Vanity and Worldly Pomp out of the Church; And though it was thought requiſite, that the Eccleſiaſtical ſhould Comply with the Civil Government, ſo far as to be uſeful in the State, yet it was never thought needful to run out into all Diviſions of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, ſo as to be prejudicial to the Church. But however, if thoſe Laws of the Church, which Erected or Confirmed Metropolitical or Patriarchal Power, proceed upon this Grand Reaſon, That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church might be Agreeable to the State, then it is Apparent, that they never did immoveably Fix ſuch Authority to any particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for Alteratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s often happening in States that might be clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their deſignes; But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> End, Senſe and Meaning of thoſe Laws muſt be this, that the Governours of the Church ſhould always be careful, that the Limits of Church mens Juriſdiction ſhould be made to Comply with the Diviſions and Limits of the Civil Government, under which they live, that both may Sit eaſie, and be uſeful to each other. And doubtleſs, the God of Order never intended, that his Church ſhould Fill the World with Diſturbance and Confuſion; which will be unavoidable, if thoſe two Powers be always Claſhing; If then ſuch Civil Diviſions are aboliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64154:34"/>
or Patriarchal Power was Erected, then thoſe very Laws themſelves, which firſt Erected it, do in their profeſſed Deſign, Reaſon and Intention, not only diſannul it, but direct the Governours of the Church to eſtabliſh or procure the Eſtabliſhment of ſuch other Limits of Juriſdiction, as may be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the State, and beneficial to the Church. Indeed, all theſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent dignities, whereby one Biſhop was raiſed above another, were Erected either for he better Management of Affaires in the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or for the Grandeur of it; Or elſe ſprang up by degrees for the benefit of thoſe Cities, which were of greateſt Power and Intereſt, in which thing <hi>Rome</hi> had the moſt advantage, as being the Imperial City, and giving Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the whole Empire. But now that Empire being broken, and Reſolved into ſeveral abſolute and independent Principalities, other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ought to be taken, and for the ſame Reaſon, that ſuch Authority was ſet up, it ought now to be taken down, or Reſtrained; And the Limits of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction Confined within the Extent of the Civil Power, and Exerciſed for its Eaſe, Safety and Benefit. And it ſeems to Me to be a Matter not to be deſpiſed, that though the Holy Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were written under the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in the time of its greateſt Height and Glory; yet the word Emperour, (ſo far as I can Call to mind) is no where to be found there. Indeed there is a Precept Relating to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by Reaſon of a particular Queſtion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it to that Name, and the word <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which moſtly Anſwers it was thought too preſumptuous; However it is, the Security the New Teſtament gives them, is only by Commanding Obedience to the Higher Powers, or in the like Phraſes, never mentioning their diſtinct Title. But though the Name of Kings was odious to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet moſt of the Evangelical Precepts, which Require Obedience to the Civil Power, expreſsly direct it to Kings; ſo that they ſeem to be given not only with a Spirit of Propheſie, that that great unweldy Body ſhould fall in pieces, and be divided into ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but alſo with a ſpecial deſign to ſecure and oblige all Chriſtians to Obedience and Submiſſion to ſuch Kings. And if we further conſider, that our Bleſſed Saviour hath told us, <hi>That his Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> And that the Chriſtian Religion teacheth Self denial and Renunciation of the World, and Requires all Chriſtians, eſpecially the Governours of the Church, to be of a moſt Humble, peaceable and exemplary Behaviour.

This kind of Proceedings in its Covernment will ſeem moſt agreeable and natural to it; For the Buſineſs of Church-Governours is to promote the Intereſt and Power of the Goſpel, not pertinaciouſly to ſtrive for Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to its prejudice and diſhonour.

But the inſiſting upon Juriſdiction in another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes Dominion, is to take his Subjects from him; It ever cauſeth Diſturbances, Creates Jealouſies in Princes, and makes them think thoſe who ſhould be the beſt Chriſtians, to be the worſt Subjects; And for that cauſe to have the meaner opinion of Religion it ſelf; It would therefore certainly be beſt with the Church of God, and moſt conduce to its happy Government, if this Rule were obſerved in all Chriſtian Kingdoms, that the Juriſdictions of Biſhops ſhould Comply with, and Conform to the Diviſions &amp; Boundaries of the Civil Power. This was the true primitive Practice, and this the Biſhops have ever been inclinable to, when they have been able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that everlaſting Encroacher the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Of which take this one Inſtance, Immediately after the Synod at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie aroſe, to whoſe Dioceſs the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> then newly Converted to the Faith, ſhould belong. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (who never loſt any thing for want of demanding it) made ſtrong Claim by his Legats. Upon this Account there Meets before the Emperour in his Palace, <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> then newly Reſtored, the Vicars of the Eaſtern Patriarchs, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Legats of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Legats of the <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> But upon debate, in ſpite of all the Endeavours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legats, it is unanimouſly given to the <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan,</hi> and ſuch a Reaſon along with it, as might have ſatisfied any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, except Meſſengers from <hi>Rome,</hi> who are never to be ſatisfied with any thing, but with what ſhall be acceptable to their Maſters inſatiable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and boundleſs Ambition.

If therefore they cannot Wound our Reformation in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials, Chriſtian Charity would teach them to cover a multitude of ſmall faults, and Common Prudence would Adviſe them not to ſtrive to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The moſt Celebrated Theme upon this occaſion is Sacrilege; And here even thoſe, whoſe proſound Ignorance ſuffers them not to ſtir a ſtep further then their Guides Conduct them, (and yet with a blind Obedience follow whither ſoever they lead them,) can be not only Eloquent but bitter: But as for thoſe, who have the Reins in their Hands, and would fain be B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, if we proceed forward ſo far as to the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Perſons who had the greateſt Influence on thoſe Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions will be found Men of their own Perſuaſion; for except ſome few, whoſe Proceedings were more eaſily Anſwered with Fagots then Arguments, thofe on our part will not be very Conſiderable, throughout the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; Searce any two Perſons ſeem to be deeper dipt in Sacrilege, then the Vicar-General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> yet how profound Hypocrites ſoever they might live, our <hi>Oxford Church-Governour</hi> will have them both Roman-Catholicks at their Death; Others, if they think it worth their while, may Conteſt it with him; But for Me he may take them both, and make his beſt of them.

I did once Intend to have thoroughly Examined the Matter of the Reformation, but I find that it would oblige Me rather to Write a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume then a Chapter; And after all, perhaps, I ſhould be accuſed of needleſs pains, for it hath been often and ſufficiently done already; And all Anſwers contain only the <hi>Crambe centies cocta,</hi> or ſome bold Fictions or tedious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flings. Nor do I think that I can be Conſtrained to Anſwer for all that went before me: In this Church I was Born, Baptized and Bred; I had no Hand in the Making, Modelling or Altering it; Gods Providence caſt Me into it,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64154:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and I take it as I found it. And if as ſuch it be defenſible, I need concern my ſelf no further. And therefore without troubling my ſelf to Rake the Dead out of their Graves, I ſhall Conſider our Church under her preſent Conſtitution; for if that will not Hold, we are gone without more ado; But if that be good, it is not ten thouſand faults of Men, who are dead and rotten, that can overthrow it.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. I have already proved, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves made the Breach; And it may be more fully proved, if need Require. But two Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks may fall out, and both be in the wrong; And therefore that we may Appear to be in the right, ſomething muſt be ſaid to clear up the Juſtice of our own Cauſe; To this End I ſhall briefly Examine theſe two things, The Government and the Doctrine of our Church. Government will of courſe take in Diſcipline as the Fruits of it: And Doctrine will include Worſhip, becauſe there is no Abuſe or ill Practice in Worſhip, but it is Founded upon ſome Errour in Doctrine. Government ſeems to Me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to belong even to the Eſſence of every particular Conſtituted Church, becauſe without it Ordinances cannot be diſcharged, Sacraments Celebrated, nor thoſe things Performed, which they are obliged to do in joynt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and as a Body of Men. That this Government be lawful and warrantable, it is to be wiſhed that the Governours might be always good, but it is abſolutely neceſſary, that they have Lawful Authority, and are rightly empowered to do ſome things, which other Men may not do. He who ſaith otherwiſe muſt with <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company lay all in Common, which the moſt Heatheniſh and Bruitiſh Religions have ever abhorred to do; For this, perhaps, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not much quarrel Me; But if it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſwers; Firſt, That the Neglect or Overſight, (if any ſuch were) of ſome Circumſtances Required by Law, though it may make the Perſons obnoxious, yet it doth not invalidate the Ordination; Our Laws Allow Perſons to be Married only betwixt Eight and Twelve in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; Yet if it Happen, that they be Married at Ten at Night, the Marriage is

As for the other ſort of Objections which relate to the Validity of our Ordination, thoſe indeed would be fatal, if they were ſufficient. But before I Return my General Anſwer thereto, I deſire it may be obſerved, That there is more of Intereſt then Matter in theſe Objections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuch a Jealouſie of this ſmall Church, that they think not themſelves ſafe while it is in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is no New thing for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make quite contrary Determinations as to the ſelf-ſame thing, as their preſent Intereſt leads them. When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> firſt came to the Crown, and they wanted Help, then King <hi>Edwards</hi> Biſhops are to be Invited in, and Acknowledged with the ſlight <hi>Salvo</hi> of a Diſpenſation, that the Pope might ſeem to do ſomething; But when they were a little ſetled in the Saddle, and could Ride over all who ſtood in their way; Then none of his Biſhops were to be Acknowledged, who did not fully Comply with them; <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe who joyned with them were good Biſhops; thoſe who oppoſed them were no Biſhops; though the Orders of both ſtood upon the ſame Foundation, and were either valid or null for the ſame Reaſon.

               </gap>ation; And therefore to Return to Doctrine, it may be Conſidered either as Poſitive or Negative. It is true, that all Doctrine Reſolves it ſelf into poſitive Truth; That we Maintain any thing in the Negative is Accidental, and Ariſeth from the Difference and Quarrels amongſt Men; for when Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot Agree, if One Affirm, the Other of courſe denies: In this Caſe, the Matter in Controverſie being either Falſhood or Wrong, if any Man A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Ground of that Denial muſt be this or the like poſitive Aſſertion, That Divine Worſhip is Gods Propriety, and to Him only to be directed. And therefore that we Maintain ſome things in the Negative, is not our but their fault, in Aſſerting that which is either falſe or unlawful; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do ſo or not muſt be Tried by Particulars, which I ſhall come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ot to be denied that we have much Truth, but not enough as they think; And we are afraid of more, leſt it ſhould make us have leſs; for many Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they would thruſt upon us for Truth, are far remote from it; And ſhould we receive them, it were the way to corrupt the Truth we have; There was a time when ſome of their Prieſts ſet themſelves to Reconcile.

From our Book of Common Prayer might be Extracted a wholeſom Body of Divinity; And it ſhews to the World both what our Worſhip is, and how our Worſhip and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Agree; And if this may be Allowed of, methinks we ſhould not be Hereticks.

The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was the Keeper and Preſerver of the Canon of the Old Teſtament, as much as the Chriſtian is of the Old and New now: But they had none of thoſe Books in their Canon; And therefore if any Aſſert, that thoſe Books do belong to the Canon, the Conſequence will be, That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church did not preſerve the Canon of Scripture entire and true, and for the ſame Reaſon any one may ſuſpect the Chriſtian, and ſo render the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the whoſe dubious: So injurious are the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to the Faith it ſelf, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch like Cauſes; But above all, through the Perverſeneſs of evil Men and Seducers, it ſo falls out, That thoſe Scriptures which are of a certain Senſe, yea, plain in themſelves, are made obſcure to us; and we either become doubtful of their Meaning, or follow a wrong Meaning: For what is, or can there be ſo plain and eaſie, which ſome wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ked Men have not or cannot render intricate and perplexed, eſpecially to weak Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and faciIe Tempers? Now for the Diſcovery of the true Senſe of Scripture in this Caſe, true and genuine Tradition is poſſibly the beſt Help and ſureſt Refuge, and to Wreſt the Scriptures out of the Hands of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Reſtore the Rule to its true Force, right Uſe and proper Meaning, perhaps there is not a ſurer nor more effectual way; for our Bleſſed Saviour Himſelf Wrote nothing, or at leaſt nothing which he deſigned to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Standard and Rule to all his Followers; It is ſaid indeed, <hi>(John</hi> 8. 6.) <hi>That He Wrote with his Finger on the Ground:</hi> But what that was no Body can tell. <hi>Euſebius</hi> indeed Records an Epiſtle of his to <hi>Agbarus;</hi> but if the Story be true, (and I have no mind to derogate from the Reputation of ſo Learned and Induſtrious an Hiſtorian) yet it was to a particular Perſon, in Anſwer to a particular Requeſt; And the principal Contents are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That after his Death one of his Diſciples ſhould come, and both Cure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Him;</hi> Nor was it ever Accounted as any part of Canonical Scripture. The Apoſtles indeed being Led by the Spirit into all Truth, not only taught it to the then preſent Age, but Committed it to Writing for the benefit of Poſterity; But then they Wrote nothing contrary or diſagreeing with what they preach'd and taught, both before and after they wrote. And there is no doubt, but that thoſe Doctrines which they Comprized ſummarily in the Scripture, were expounded more fully in their daily Converſation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued diſcharge of their Miniſterial Function If therefore any doubt or Controverſie did Ariſe concerning the Meaning of Scripture, there could be no better way to determine it, then by enquiring in what Senſe thoſe Churches underſtood it, which the Apoſtles had planted, &amp; where upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions they at large Explained themſelves; for it is certain, That the Apoſtles beſt knew their own Meaning; And when they were no longer living to tell it, let witty or wicked Men make never ſuch a Buſtle or fair Shew, it will be very difficult to perſwade any ſober Men, but that thoſe muſt needs beſt know their Meaning, to whom the Apoſtles themſelves moſt amply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

it. Now it being the great Buſineſs of Hereticks to corrupt the Scriptures, and wreſt them to a wrong ſenſe, that they might ſeem to have a ſufficient Authority patronizing their Errours; When it ſo Hapned, the Ancient Church uſually declined the Nice Way of Cavilling and Captious Diſputes, and fell to enquire what was the Doctrine and Senſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Churches; for it could not be but that thoſe, to whom the Apoſtles had preached all their days, muſt better underſtand their Meaning, then any Upſtarts who followed their own Imaginations, and were fond of New and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtilent Notions; And by this means they not only Silenced Hereticks, but wrung the Scriptures and the Interpretations of Them out of their Hands, and then turned them againſt them, And whilſt Apoſtolical Men were living, this was a ſure Way; And ſo far as ſuch Tradition can be proved to have been preſerved genuine and true, it is ſtill a good Way: And when the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have endeavoured to bring the Cauſe to this Iſſue, I think they have had no great Cauſe to boaſt of their Gains, Witneſs (to avoid Naming many) the Controverſie Managed by Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ing.</hi> But then as to Tradition theſe Cautions would be obſerved. 1. That this is no prejudice to the Scriptures, being the only ſufficient Rule of Faith; for though the Apoſtles wrote and taught the ſame things, and ſo both were alike a Rule to the then living Perſons; yet when thoſe things were put in Writing, it was for this very Reaſon, <hi>That a Sure and Certain Rule might be Preſerved for Poſterity;</hi> For Tradition might in time be miſtaken, forgotten or corrupted; But the Scriptures would remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable. So that the Scriptures are the Rule to us, though there are many Helps to lead us to their true Meaning, of which perhaps genuine Tradition is none of the worſt. But this makes nothing againſt the perfection and ſufficiency of the Scriptures, which contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, though they do not find us Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear, nor Brains to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; though God doth all this, and all other Helps abundantly. All Arts and Sciences are ſuppoſed to be Complete in themſelves, and to contain Rules ſufficient to inſtruct a Man in them; And yet ſome of the Nobleſt of them can never be thoroughly Attained, unleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Man be firſt Inſtructed in the Rudiments of ſome other Arts or Sciences preliminary, and preparatory to them. But the Scriptures being the moſt perfect Rule, as proceeding from the All-wiſe God, and leading to the Nobleſt End, why ſhould not Others or rather all be ſubſervient to them? yet this is ſo far from making them leſs, that it argues their greater Perfection. Secondly, That nothing be Admitted as a Tradition, which hath not ſome Apparent Foundation in Scripture, for that being the undoubted Word of God, whatever is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereto, much more whatſoever is contrary to it, ought never to be admitted. But by Reaſon of our own Weakneſs, or Others Frowardneſs,

the Rule in ſome Caſes being not ſo clear, a true primitive Tradition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Matters contained in Scripture, may be very uſeful to lead us to the true Senſe, as in the Cafe of Infants Baptiſm, the Obſervation of the Lords Day, and ſome other Matters. For all the Churches of God from the firſt times, having Baptized Infants, and duely obſerved the Lords Day, it muſt be ſuppoſed, That the Apoſtles did unanimouſly ſo teach the firſt Churches, and conſequently that thoſe General Precepts concerning Baptiſm in Scripture, are incluſive of the Children of believing Parents; And that thoſe Scriptural Inſtances of the Obſervation of the Lords Day, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to direct our Practice: Nor let any Man think, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will be Gainers by this; for I will never deny any Truth for fear of giving Advantage to an Adverſary: Whatever they can prove from Scripture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by ſuch truly primitive Tradition, as ſhall be agreeable to the two foregoing and the following Cautions, I ſhall freely yield to them or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party. But if the Matter come to this Iſſue, they muſt loſe all the moſt Conſiderable things, for which they Contend with us. I know they make great Flouriſhes, and pretend Scripture back'd with Tradition, for Purgatory and ſome other Fopperies; But what can I or any Man help it, if they will uſe the beſt means for the worſt Ends? They know good Rules, but uſe them ill. For as for ſuch a Notion of Purgatory, which they have ſet up, and ſuch a Uſe for it as they have deviſed; as there is not any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of it in Scripture, ſo was it utterly unknown to the primitive Church; or if it could have been known, would have been Abominated. And if Men will have the Impudence to pretend without any colour for their Pretences, yet I will not forſake a good Courſe becauſe they abuſe it. Thirdly, that nothing be admitted as a genuine Tradition, but what was univerſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and wherein all the primitive Churches were agreed, according to that known Rule of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, Quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod ab oinnibus,</hi> or (as he otherwiſe phraſeth it) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitaetis &amp; Antiquitatis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſio.</hi> Nothing can be ſo plainly ſpoken, but the Weakneſs, the Heedleſsneſs or the Malice of ſome Perſons may miſtake or corrupt it. Thus the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenary Errour ſprang from <hi>Papias</hi> miſunderſtanding <hi>John</hi> the Elder; And his Authority again ſeems to have Influenced <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> But this Meeting with Oppoſition in the Church, and being in the End Exploded, it hath only the Reputation of a very early Miſtake, and ſerves well for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſhew how quickly Tradition may be Corrupted, unleſs the Churches of God be exceeding vigilant. What the Apoſtles taught for the Common Concern of our Salvation in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one Church, they taught the ſame in all; and therefore unleſs they all Agree, that there is a Miſtake is certain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Tradition, or where it lies is uncertain; and ſo at leaſt it is uſeleſs. But though here and there a Man might in ſome particular
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64154:44"/>
things miſtake the Apoſtles, and by their means Others might be deceived, yet that all Perſons of all Churches ſhould clearly miſtake the Apoſtles in any neceſſary matter, notwithſtanding they lived ſo long, and daily ſo La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the Word and Doctrine, is a thing incredible: And therefore wherein they unanimouſly Agree concerning the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, no doubt but it is the beſt Expoſition of the Doctrine in the Scriptures; the ſame things being written for our perpetual Inſtruction, which were at firſt preached for the benefit of the then living Generation. Fourthly, That Traditions be always deduced from the Firſt Ages of the Church; for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are received, not made; And if they proceeded not from Apoſtles and Apoſtolick Perſons, they can never become genuine Traditions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. What was delivered to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ſt Churches, though ſince neglected, loſt or forgotten, was a true and genuine Tradition; and is ſo ſtill, if it can be diſcovered; But if any thing be Vouched as a Tradition, though of a Thouſand yeares ſtanding and more; yet if it came not from the Firſt Churches, it is not a Tradition but an Impoſture; And ſuch are moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Traditions, much like thoſe of the Phariſees, of whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That they had made the Commandment of God of none effect by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> (Mat, 15. 6.) and yet they called them the Traditions of the Elders, <hi>(verſe</hi> 2.) and ſtood then up for their Antiquity as ſtoutly as the Other do now. But (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves, <hi>lib. de Praeſerip.) Veritas mendacio prior eſt.</hi> And therefore here we are to follow, not <hi>quod Antiquum,</hi> but <hi>quod Antiquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>num.</hi> Laſtly, that a Difference be obſerved as to Traditions, according to their Nature and Riſe; There are Traditions of particular Churches, ariſing moſtly from the Orders and Conſtitutions of ſome Venerable Apoſtolick Perſons, made and preſcribed to the Churches, which they reſpectively Governed; Theſe Claim a Reſpect, not only upon the Account of their ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to Order, but alſo in Honour of the Perſons from whom they came; but yet they oblige not other Churches. None indeed ought to contemn them, but they may lawfully either uſe or diſuſe them, as their preſent Churth-Governours ſhall think Fitting for the benefit of the preſent Churches. Some Traditions are more Univerſal, as proceeding from the Apoſtles themſelves; but if they be only concerning things in their own Nature indifferent, neither are theſe immutably binding. That ſome ſuch were is Apparent from that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 34.) <hi>The Reſt will I ſet in Order when I come.</hi> But if any Man can certainly tell Me what Orders he made, <hi>Erit mihi magnus</hi> Apollo: And perhaps the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle never Committed them to Writing, leſt an over-great Veneration to Apoſtolical Authority ſhould Run other Churches into an inconvenience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For thoſe very Orders, though moſt wiſely Fitted to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> might at the ſame time be inconvenient for other Churches, yea, for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64154:45"/>
very ſelf-ſame Church in following times. For though ſome indifferent things muſt of Neceſſity be determined, becauſe otherwiſe the Solemn Worſhip will unavoidably he diſorderly and indecent, yet ſuch Orders can never be ſo Fixed for all Churches, as to be of a perpetual, immutable and unalterable Nature; For Climates, Cuſtomes, Times, Perſons, do variouſly alter the ſtate of Matters; ſo that what is prudenrly Conſtituted in one Church, may be very inconveniently and indiſcreetly enjoyned in another; And therefore, though ſuch Apoſtolical Conſtitutions deſerve Veneration, as being unqueſtionably beſt Fitted to the then preſent Churches; yet it remains in the Power of Church-Governours to lay them aſide upon juſt Occaſion, and Conſtitute Others in their Room, as may be moſt for the good of the Churches. Again, ſome Traditions concern the Practice of the Univerſal Church, which obtained in all places, and theſe have their Ground and Warrant from Scripture; but their particular Determination from Church-Authority, which is ſtill preſerved to us by Tradition; Of this we have a clear Inſtance in the Faſts and Feaſts of the Church, as Gods Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercies require our Solemn Thankſgivings, ſo our own Sins, eſpecially the publick, Call on us openly to Humble our Souls before God, and to give manifeſt Teſtimony of our Repentance; Beſides, to tame our unruly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Fit us for the diſcharge of our Duty, Acts of Mortification are very requiſite; To this the Scriptures direct us, and thereof gives us many Inſtances: But when this ſhall be done, (I mean publickly, for as to private Thankſgiving or Mortification, relating to Mens private Concerns, they may uſe their Diſcretion, provided that they thwart not the Orders of the Church) is partly pointed out to us by the times, when ſuch Mercies were received, or Evil done; and partly determined by Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And this even Natural Reaſon it ſelf doth ſo fully teach, that there never were any Men of any Religion, how barbarous ſoever, but they had their Solemn Faſts and Feaſts. Upon this Account I was very ſorry to find a Relation in Mr. <hi>Ricaut (St. of Turk:)</hi> to this Effect, That certain Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Merchants of ours Reſiding at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and ſome other parts of the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, being obſerved to keep neither Faſt nor Feaſt, but to uſe every day alike, all Perſons preſently eſteemed them as Men of no Religion, and look'd on them as Perſons who thought they had no God, againſt whom they could offend, nor from whom they had, or might hope to receive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But though theſe Men were of our Countrey, they were not of our Communion; And we are not to Anſwer for their ill Examples, who have forſaken us chiefly for this Reaſon, that they might take their full ſwinge in Running a Whoring after their own Inventions. The moſt Ancient Feaſts and Faſts are Appointed by the Conſtitutions of our Church, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

it is becauſe they are Apparently of later date, and introduced by their own Authority, which obligeth not us; Beſides, we much doubt of the Popes Skill in diſcerning theſe later Saints, but more of his power to make them ſuch. If it be obſerved, that our own Faſts and Feaſts are ill obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; I grant it to be true, but I ſay it is not our fault; Ill Men and ill Times have been and ſtill are too hard for us; and not to Complain of the too many Obſtructions of Diſcipline, (without which no Church can long ſtand, much leſs flouriſh, which is the Reaſon that all Parties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have unanimouſly combined to hinder the Exerciſe of our Diſcipline, that by that means they might have opportunity, upon all Occaſions, to make their full blow at the Church it ſelf) though our Church hath had the Laws on her ſide, yet ſhe hath ever had the Lawyers (without whom the reſt could have done nothing) her Enemies, who have made even the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either inſignificant or hurtful to Her. I ſpeak not of the whole Body of them, for there are many Honeſt and Honourable Perſons amongſt them; But there want not enough, who are ſworn Enemies of Church Diſcipline, and all Eccleſiaſtical Authority; who lay Trains and Snares for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church if they execute it; And if any Man be Conſtrained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to leave Complaining, where we are like to have no Remedy, and return to our Matter: As to Traditions of Matters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f Practice, diſtinction muſt be made between the Matter of the Tradition and the Circumſtances of it; Tradition as to Circumſtances may differ in different places, and may be Altered by the Power of the Church. Thus as to the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> all Agreed in the Tradition, that it was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; But divers Churches diſagreed about the time of its Obſervation, ſo that whileſt ſome were Faſting, and had not Compleated their <hi>Lent,</hi> others had Entred upon the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> Here the Church interpoſed her Authority, and to prevent Diſorder and Confuſion, reduced the Obſervation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64154:46"/>
to a certain time, though it did not take place without a great deal of trouble, ſo tenacious are people of Ancient Uſages, and therefore ought Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ighty Reaſons. But then as for the Matter of ſuch Traditions, which are genuine and truly primitive, (as of the Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and the firſt day of the Week, commonly called, <hi>The Lords Day, &amp;c)</hi> I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that even the whole Church hatb Power to Alter or Abrogate them. What may be done <hi>in Plenitudine Poteſtatis,</hi> I will not diſpute, becauſe it is a thing I have no kindneſs for. For when Perſons will be judges of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their own Authority, they will be ſure to C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, other Traditions there may be which relate to Doctrine, but this could be nothing but what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught, and therefore muſt be fetch'd from thoſe they taught it to; And ſo muſt be derived from the firſt primitive Churches; If it ſtarted up after, it was an Innovation not a Tradition, though older then <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Ambroſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This and ſome other Reaſon I could give, make me ſuſpect, that the Tridentines in defining the Scriptures and Tradition to be Received <hi>Pari Pietatis affectu ac reverentiâ,</hi> had this in their Eye, that under the pretended Authority of Tradition they might foiſt in thoſe Corruptions, which they knew the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures would by no means patronize. But to leave this Matter, and draw a Concluſion from the Premiſſes, if according to our Conſtitutions, (for we are not to Anſwer for the Miſcarriages of any particular Perſons) both our Doctrine and Diſcipline, our Government and Worſhip are good and juſtifiable, then we cannot be Hereticks: If the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to theſe Iſles, then the Maintaining or Re-aſſuming our juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties cannot make us guilty of Schiſm, as to his Patriarchſhip, but

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64154:47"/>
that General Councels, or others, are of greateſt Uſe and Benefit to the Church of God, when lawfully called and duely managed, where ſerious, continued and unanimous Prayers are put up for Gods Aſſiſtance, where Matters are freely and fairly debated, and where not only the Intentions but Endeavours of the Parties, are wholly bent to diſcover the Truth of God, not to Gratifie any Party of Men. For if God have promiſed to be with two or three, who are Gathered together in his Name, Surely, he will not be wanting to the Governours of his People, and the wiſeſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt of Chriſtians, when Met together, to diſcover to the Chriſtian World the poiſon of Hereticks, and to ſerve the Neceſſities of his Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they take due Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And where Men are ſatisfied of the Regularity of their Proceedings, though they ſhould not be ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Determinations, yet the Authority of the Perſons, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionableneſs of their Proceedings, would be an Awe at leaſt upon all ſober and Rational perſons, and make them cautious o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth it ſeem to be without Encouragement and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that the primitive Chriſtians in difficult Caſes Fled to General Councels as their Sovereign Remedy. For the Apoſtles themſelves ſet them a Precedent, and the firſt Councel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (though ſmall, yet perhaps the moſt General that ever was) was a Pattern worthy Imitation. For though the Apoſtles had ſeverally the Holy Ghoſt, and were the Perſons pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely Choſen to make known to Mankind the extraordinary Revelations of Gods Will; and ſo might have determined any Queſtion concerning any ſuch Matter by their own Authority; yet the Quarrel ariſing between the Jews and Gentiles concerning Circumciſion, and in the Conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the whole Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though they knew that one great End of Chriſts Coming was to aboliſh it, to fulfil its Types, and ſet up a more ſpiritual Worſhip; yet the whole Church being divided by this means into two Parties, they would not determine the Matter till Met in Councel together; that a full debate, and their unanimous Conſent might give the greater ſatisfaction to all. And indeed their Proceedings are an admirable Copy, for all following Councels to write after; even they, who beſt might, do not Magiſterially give us their Naked Decrees and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; for though they had the Holy Ghoſt, and in their Decree did ſay, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us;</hi> yet they do not ſay this, before they had undeniably proved, that it did ſeem good to the Holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to them. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> clearly proves, that God Himſelf had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64154:48"/>
already determined the Matter in the Caſe of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> And then <hi>Barrabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> as clearly proved Gods further Confirmation of it by Miracles and Wonders wrought amongſt the Gentiles, whileſt they Preached the Goſpel to them. So that here was nothing left for Men to ſay againſt the Decrees of the Councel, unleſs they would Argue againſt God. And though the ſame degree of Evidence and fulneſs of Authority do not Attend after Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, yet it would be a great means to procure ſubmiſſion to them, when their Imitation of the Apoſtles, and Care of the Churches did Appear, by their Accompanying their Determinations with the cleareſt Evidence that might be.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Some <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will needs have every General Councel <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch as they Call Lawful) to be as infallible as that of the Apoſtles; but methinks they ſhould allow ſome difference, if it were only for this Reaſon, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſtles did infallibly and fully diſcover to us the whole Truth of God in order to the Salvation of Man; All that come after them have nothing more to do, then to enquire after that Truth which they taught, and which Reſts upon their Authority as Inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; And therefore certainly there is a great difference between them, and thoſe who follow them, and are bound to build upon them, and are certainly in the wrong, whenever they depart from them. Infallibility is a word that ſounds high, and promiſeth all that Man can de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

But when we come to look for this Salve for all Sores, we know not whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to find it; for they themſelves are ſo miſerably divided, that they know not where to place it. And then how can we, or indeed they themſelves, be any thing the better for it? Some ſay it is in the Church, ſome ſay in Tradition, ſome ſay in a General Councel, ſome in a Councel together with the Pope, ſome in a Counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and that is a Myſtery too. Now in all and each of theſe they entangle themſelves in ſome palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and woful Abſurdities, that a Man might wonder, that ever ſuch Learned Men ſhould Appear in their Defence, did we not ſee by Experience, that extravagant intereſt as well as great Oppreſſions often makes wiſe Men mad. The truth is, all theſe are ſet up as a blind, as ſhall appear in its proper place. And if their General Reaſons to prove, that there muſt be ſome ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Infallibility, be good, there muſt be another ſort of Infallibility ſet up then any of theſe, and ſuch as they themſelves will by no means approve, and which none have pretended to, but the worſt of Enthuſiaſts; And yet their Reaſons muſt prove this, if any; Such lewd Opinions do Men Run into, when they will take upon them to preſcribe to God, rather then
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64154:48"/>
obey him. And indeed it hath ſometimes ſtruck Me with horrour to ſee how boldly they tell us, what God muſt do, and how preſumptuouſly they charge him with breach of Promiſe, as Neglect of his people, if he do not make good all their Contrivances; As if God were bound to do, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their working Brains can think fit to Advance their unworthy and unchriſtian Intereſts. No doubt but God will not fail on his put, if we neglect not our own; But to Tye Him to ſerve our humours or baſeneſs, is to provoke Him to deſert us in thoſe things, which are really moſt needful for us. But theſe things I muſt not here particularly purſue, nor ſhall I engage in the Diſpute concerning the Infallibility of General Councels, both becauſe whatever they pretend, it is not that which they would have, as alſo becauſe they have Received ſuch Anſwers already in that Matter from <hi>Spalato,</hi> the moſt Reverend A. B. <hi>Laud,</hi> the Learned Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> and others, that it is now altogether a Needleſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p n="3">III. He that takes his Aim, though never ſo carefully, yet may ſometimes miſs his Mark; And if that ſhould be my Misfortune in what I write in this place, I may in Equity expect the more favourable Uſage. For though in a good Senſe a Councel may be ſaid to be the Church Repreſentative, as I ſhall ſhew anon. Yet I have Conſidered and Conſidered again, and can by no means Reconcile to Reaſon that Notion or Propoſition, (in the ſenſe which ſome Men take and Explain it,) <hi>That a General Councel is Repreſentative of the diffuſive Body of the Church.</hi> For if it be ſo, it muſt either be by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution from God, or Delegation from Men. But that God in any Caſe hath Appointed the whole Body of Chriſtians to chooſe certain Perſons as their Repreſentatives, whoſe Acts by vertue of ſuch Election ſhall be as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inding, as if it had been done by all and every Man, I think can no where be found; for my own part, I could never ſee any Footſteps of it, or any thing like it. If on the other Hand, it be by an unpreſcribed ſpontaneous Delegation from Men, it muſt either be by the whole Body of Chriſtians Met together for that purpoſe, or by Parts Aſſembled in particular Churches. The Firſt, I think, if it be not impoſſible, is altogether impracticable, as the ſtate of the Church now is: Nor was it ever put in Practice, when the Church being leſs, cloſer and better united, did not labour under thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which now it doth; As for the ſecond, it hath neither Scripture nor Antiquity on its ſide, and for that Little, which ſome may wreſt to look that way, it is ſo very little, that it may thence Appear, that the Churches of God never thought it neceſſary. For though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain others were ſent up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about the Controverſie between the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>(Acts</hi> 15. 2.) Yet there is not any Circumſtance to lead us to think otherwiſe, but that they went by Order or Agreement of theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64154:49"/>
of the Churches, (among whom that Controverſie had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but could not be finally decided, by reaſon of the turbulency of the Jews) and not by Election of the People: And when the Councel Met at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though all Chriſtians had freedom to Appear in it; yet when the Apoſtles and Elders are ſaid to come together to Conſider of the Matter, <hi>(verſe</hi> 6.) they Met by their own Authority. And further, if a Councel be ſo the Church Repreſentative, that in Order to its being a Repreſentative, it be neceſſary, that the Perſons Appearing be Elected from the Church-Members of particular Churches; the Conſequence will be, That the firſt four Famous General Councels were not lawful Councels; for they Met by the Emperours Summons, not by Election from the People; And therefore upon this Suppoſition could not be duely Convocated. Beſides, if a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the People or Church-Members be neceſſary, let the Honour or Orders of the Perſons deputed be what it will, they muſt Repreſent moſtly as Laymen; for ſuch are Incomparably the ſar greater Number; But we read not of any Biſhops Sitting in Councel, but as Biſhops, and ſubſcribing as Biſhops, and taking place there by vertue of their own Authority as Biſhops, not by any Deputation; unleſs perhaps ſome Perſon Appeared for ſome abſent Biſhop as well as himſelf, or as the Legate of ſome Biſhop; But then a Commiſſion or Deputation from that abſent Biſhop was ſufficient without ſo much as Conſulting any Church-Members. I do not ſay, but that ſome Perſons were Choſen on purpoſe to be ſent to Councels, but then they were either ſuch Prieſts or Deacons, as the Biſhops thought Fit to take along with them, or were pitch'd on by the Advice of their Clergy. And we have a Cuſtom amongſt our ſelves, that Two out of every Dioceſs be Choſen and ſent to the Provincial Synod or Convocation; And thought it is Reaſonable that ſome ſhould be there, who by daily Inſpection and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience underſtand the Countreys Affairs, and the Circumſtances of the Rural Clergy, upon whom not the leaſt part of the Burthen lies; yet the great Reaſon is this, That the Determinations of the Convocation may paſs into the Law of the Land, which they cannot do, unleſs the Convocation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſuch Perſons as the Law requires, whoſe Acts muſt be Ratified by the King alſo to that purpoſe. But then thoſe Perſons ſo Choſen are only the Proctors of the Clergy, not Deputies of the People: And Canons for the Church might be made without them, though not Laws of the Land. And indeed the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, though they talk loud of a Councels being the Churches Repreſentative, yet ſometimes they are as dumb again, and willing to let it ſleep, or to ſhift it off. When they have to do with private Perſons, or ſuch whom they Call Hereticks, then they talk big of their pack'd Councels, and what a Madneſs it is to withſtand the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the whole Church of God; This looks great, and ſeems to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64154:49"/>
carry no ſmall Authority with it: But if Diſcourſe happen of a Councel in Relation to the Pope, then they are as Mute as Fiſhes, or Mince the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will by no means be induced to ſpeak out as to any ſuch Authority in Councels of themſelves. And it is well known, That the Tridentines were never ſuffered to uſe the Phraſe, <hi>Repraeſentans univerſalem Ecclefiam,</hi> though many ſtickled hard for it, the Pope being in no ſmall fear, that an Inference would be thence drawn, That any Member, how great ſoever, was Inferiour to the Repreſentative of the whole Body of Gods Church, the Conſequence of which might have been fatal to Himſelf. But the Queſtion concerning the Right to, or Exerciſe of Authority in any diffuſive Body of Men, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, perhaps deſerves a more thorough Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, then it hath ever yet undergone; And conſequently, whether any can? And if any, then who and how far they can make a Repreſentative? I may perhaps have Occaſion to diſcourſe of it hereafter, but ſhall not in this place.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He that proceeds only in a deſtructive way, gives too much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Looſe Wits, and in ſtead of Inſtructing unſettles weak Heads. It is therefore but juſt, that he who oppoſeth what he thinks a Miſtake, ſhould ſet down what he thinks right; leſt he do more hurt by leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to build upon, then he doth good by diſcovering an Errour, which perhaps might be harmleſs, if Conſequences of too great moment were not Wire-drawn from it. If therefore we ſhould ſay, That a Councel, <hi>(ie.</hi> as far as Relates to ſuch Churches, whoſe Biſhops Appear in Councel) is the Church Authoritative; and in Conſequence the Repreſentative, as bringing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ith it all that Authority Chriſt left in his Church, and which he Lodg'd in his Church-Officers, by Vertue of which Authority they Repreſent, and not by any Deputation from the People or Church Members; I think that (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements) it would be much more plain in the Explication, and facile in the Reaſons of it; And thence would Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Appear the true Grounds of the different force of their Decrees and Canons. For in what Relates to Diſcipline and external Government, every Biſhop hath Power to make Orders in his own Church; And when they are Met in Councel together, for the Agreement and Harmony of Churches, and better upholding Communion, they may make Rules bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe Churches, and in all things lawful and honeſt they are to be obeyed. For in their Hands God left the Government of his Church as a Church. And it is no leſs then an Apoſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is further Obſervable, That Conſtitutions of this Nature were never thought to be ſo unalterable and binding. But that not only follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing General Councels might alter them, but even Provincial Councels in ſome Caſes might Reſcind, what more General Councels had Appointed. For no Laws are binding contrary to their own End and Deſign. Now the End and Deſign of their Conſtitutions being the Peace and Benefit of the Churches, and for the moſt part in Matters of themſelves by Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different or mutable; It can hardly be, that in all things their General Sanctions ſhould Hit the Condition of all Churches, for Climates alter Men much; And the Humours, Inclinations and Cuſtomes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that what is convenient, eaſie and uſeful in one place, may be inconvenient, uneaſie and unprofitable in another. If therefore by Reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome particular Church or Churches, which was not well made known to the General Councel, ſome of their Conſtitutions ſhould prove to be really and truly Burthenſom and Offenſive to ſuch Churches: If there be no Proſpect of another General Councel near at Hand, a Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of their own, who underſtand their ſtate and neceſſities, may Relieve them, by making other Orders more Fit and Practicable ſor them; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with Honour and Obſervance of thoſe Conſtitutions, where they do take place, and without any Contempt or diſreſpect, where they are laid aſide, To this Effect is that Anſwer of our Learned Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi> to his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">V. But though in Relation to Government and Diſcipline the Power of Biſhops in Councel is very great, yet in Matters of Doctrine it is by no means the ſame. For he that Committed to their Truſt the Government of his Church, gave them no Power over the Faith. Rules for Diſcipline may alter, as Caſes alter; But the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus muſt be yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever. No Monckiſh <hi>Evangelium aeternum,</hi> nor Fanatick <hi>Evangelium armatum,</hi> muſt be ſuffered to thruſt this out of doors; What Chriſt and his Apoſtles delivered to the Saints at firſt muſt be the Rule to the laſt: And therefore here the Buſineſs of Councels is not to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point but Enquire; Not to Conſtitute, but declare: They have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make us a New Goſpel, or any New Article of Faith, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Old; And therefore here their Authority goes equal pace with their Sincerity, Diligence and Skill.

               </gap> Aſpect upon General Councels, and the very Naming one was enough to put any of them into a Fit of a Feavour; And indeed this made following Councels not only uſeleſs but noxious. For if the Neceſſities of the Church ſeemed at any time to Require a General Councel, the Pope would never ſuffer it to be, but in ſuch place that he could Command; And always took care, that it ſhould Conſiſt of ſuch Perſons, who at leaſt for the greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were at his devotion; And yet even then was wofully uneaſie, till it was Finiſhed; ſo unwilling are Popes to truſt themſelves with a Councel, though themſelves have the packing of it. But that Spark, which firſt fell through the Claſhing of <hi>Luther</hi> and the Pardonmongers, being blown to ſuch a Flame, that no Common Help could quench it, a General Councel ſeemed neceſſary: But to Manage it for the Advantage of the Roman See, and to hold it in convenient place was a Matter of no ſmall difficulty in ſuch times of Confuſion; ſo that it ſeemed to be as dangerous to the Pope, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Church. It was well for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the greateſt Princes of thoſe times were perſwaded that it was the Popes Right, (though meerly Founded upon Uſurpations) to Call General Councels: For by this means they gained time to Fit Matters for their Turn; And yet though the moſt Refined Politicians in the World, it was not a little time did ſerve their Turn; For though tho Popes ſucceſſively ſeemed daily willing, that ſo they might ſtop Mens Mouths, and Gratifie their Importunity, yet was it not leſs then Twenty-ſeven yeares before theſe perfect Crafts-Maſters could Contrive Matters to their Mind, and then too they were rather Neceſſitated then willing, and in no ſmall fear that their Wings would be <hi>Clipt-Luthers</hi> firſt Appeal to a General Councel, which was quickly followed with the deſire;

Thus what ſhrivelled things are Councels to a Pope? But as if all Reformation Conſiſted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the Pope, in the Decree of Reformation, <hi>(Seſs.</hi> 6 <hi>cap.</hi> 1:) He is ſtiled, <hi>Ipſius Dei in Terris Vicarius;</hi> They could hardly have made him greater, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had ſtiled Him, <hi>Our Lord God the</hi> Pope; And in the latter part of the ſame Decree they declare him to be <hi>Captain'Mend-all,</hi> with a power to puniſh at Diſcretion, even the Higheſt Prelates of the Church; And that not by Vertue of any Truſt repoſed in Him by the Councel, but <hi>Suae Supreme Sedis Auctoritate:</hi> This I think is pretty fair, they did deſerve to be ſtroked and called his white Boys for it. When they come to determine the Matter concerning the Reſervation of Caſes, which extreamly needed Reformation, (for by that means Perſons oft were forced to Travel to <hi>Rome,</hi> from the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Countreys at vaſt Charges, and often for meer Trifles) in ſtead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, they Juſtify it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for fear of loſing the booty, they ſeem wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſome other Biſhops ſhould have a Share with Subordination to his Holineſs; But as for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps ſome will ſay, that this was done in good Manners, and by way of Complement. But put a Complement upon the Pope, and if it ſerves his Turn, he interprets it a Reality; And the Decrees and Canons of this Councel are Reſtrained to his Interpretation, that they can only ſpeak what he pleaſes, ſo that he may make the utmoſt uſe of it; And we know, that Sayings, which do not by the hundredth part ſo much Countenance his Supremacy, are Confidently brought in to prove it.

By what Surprize this Decree was obtained, the Hiſtorian briefly tells us. When a Councel was juſt Shutting up, few Men gave their Minds to Heed or ſtick at any thing; and therefore in the Cloſe of the day this is paſſed as a thing granted, though it had never been mentioned in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>(Hiſt.

One would think here they had been taken in a Nooſe, but they ſlip the Knot with eaſe; And certainly never any thing was more Neatly taken away in the very giving. For when Matters came under debate, which did Require the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Juriſdiction upon the place, they then Committed it to the Biſhops, but with this Reſtriction, <hi>As Delegates of the Apoſtolick See.</hi> Here indeed the Biſhops Received a Power to Exerciſe ſome Authority, but in the very Accepting it they gave up their Right, and placed all Authority Originally in the Pope; ſo that if he pleaſed at any time to undelegate them, he did in effect unbiſhop them. And yet the only Reaſon which moved the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, <hi>St. Clemens</hi> and <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> to perſevere in their Opinioe to the laſt againſt the Confirmation of the Councel, was this, <hi>That too much Authority had been Given to Biſhops in that Councel,</hi> (Hiſt.

to take off that Decree, yet it could never be obtained; And we may Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably believe, that it was Reſolved it never ſhould, whatſoever they might pretend. For when this Decree with no ſmall Art had paſſed, the Pope was ſo well pleaſed with the News, that he wrote privately to the Legats, That they ſhould Maintain it firmly, and put it in Execution, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But though this was too much yet this did not ſatisfie them; But they took ſtill a greater Liberty to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave all the Reſt. For when they had propoſed any Matter, if the debate did not proceed to their Mind, they took upon them to interrupt Men in their ſpeaking, and to Check, Reproach or Threaten Others; ſo that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral died of Grief or Indignation for the Diſgrace and Abuſe Received; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

If this did not do, then by Proregations and Delays they wearied Men out, and would do nothing till an Opportunity Preſented for their purpoſe. Neither was the Councel under leſs Reſtraint as to time, then Matter; they were ſo far from having any Power to Sit, till they had diſpatched the weighty Affairs they came about, that they could not Sit an Hour longer then they pleaſed their Maſters the Legats; For they had a Bull by them, empowering them to prorogue, transfer or diſſolve the Councel as they ſhould thin Fit. So that let the Neceſſities of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> be what they will, if the Deſignes of the Legats were not carried on, all the Biſhops in Councel muſt either Sir ſtill and cool their Heels, or March off and be gone; And that they were Reſolved to take this Courſe, if they could not Compaſs their Ends, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from that rude Tranſlation of it to <hi>Bologna.</hi> And yet one would think there ſhould be little need of all this Caution; For the Councel conſiſted wholly of Perſons ſworn to the Pope, in as full and ample Manner as any Oath of Allegiance can be made by a Subject to his Lawful Prince, as is plain from the Form of the Oath ſet down by our Learned <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>St. P. (Vind. A. B. L. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 491.) ſo that they couid Practice nothing contrary to the Pope's Will without being guilty of Perjury; And the Legates upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion did not fail to put them in Mind of it. Indeed, it may more properly be called a Faction then a Councel, for there were none Admitted but the Pope's Party; And was it likely, that they ſhould do right, who were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of for doing all the wrong? The Proteſtants are not ſuffered to Come and Sit as a Part of the Councel, but to be heard as Criminals: And they had great Encouragement to come, who were Condemned before hand.

That Phraſe, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad ipſam Sanctam Synodum ſpectat,</hi> looks ſuſpitiouſly, as if they intended it as a Reſerve for another to do that, which they were aſhamed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and there is the greater Reaſon to think this, becauſe the very laſt words of the Safe-Conduct ſhew, that they did intend to proceed againſt ſuch, whom they ſhould judge Hereticks; Only they promiſe, that they ſhall have <hi>Judices ſibi benevolos,</hi> i. e. They ſhall be Hanged with Silken Halters. And what kind of Entertainment they were like to find, we may hence Gueſs, that it is ſometimes plainly ſaid by ſome in Councel, <hi>That their Coming thither was to Condemn the</hi> Lutherans; And when <hi>Vega</hi> ſpake of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Opinion, as Reconcileable with what they called Catholick, the Councel was highly Offended, as thinking it a prejudice, that any of the Differences might be thought Reconcileable, <hi>(Hiſt. C. T. p.</hi> 208.) yet they had the beſt Knack at Reconciling, when they had a Mind to it, that I ever knew; for they could Reconcile differences amongſt themſelves, that were as oppoſite as Light and Darkneſs, without Condemning either of the Contraries; Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, the Controverſie between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> about the immaculate Conception. They were ſo bent on this deſign, that they would Admit none into the Councel, who were thought in the leaſt to favour the Reformers. When <hi>Vergerius</hi> Fled to the Councel, though as a Biſhop he had Right to a place there, yet the Legats would not ſuffer him to be there, but ſend him to the Pope to clear himſelf from the Imputation of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm;</hi> And he was glad to be gone, and at laſt to get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> though he did in ſome Meaſure Requite the Kindneſs afterwards. For in Revenge he wrote a Book to prove, that all Liberty was taken away from the Councel, and that it was Called by the Pope, not to Eſtabiſh the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the Councel having taken Care for Correcting the Vulgar Edition, and for procuring an exact Impreſſion, and having Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Deputies on the Work; When this News came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope undoeth it all by his own Authority, and the Legats in purſuance of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cauſe the Deputies to deſiſt from the Work, and to bring all they had done to them, and this without any Reſpect to the Councel, or ſo much as making them privy to it. It ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, that they ſhould have no more at leaſt ſeeming liberty, but be uſed ſo ſcornfully; For the Pope had ever the Major Party in the Councel. It began, if not altogether, yet for the moſt part with his own Creatures: And they, when but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Number, and (as the Hiſtorian ſaith) for the greater part a very igno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ber of Prelates in <hi>Trent.</hi> The Catalogue at the End of the Councel tells us, that they came from four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Nations; but if it were well Examined, it would Appear, that many of the Prelates of thoſe ſeveral Nations were only Titulars, or the Pope's Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners; But the Number of all together, (and yet they never were all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) Amounts to 281. Now all of this Number, (take Procurators and all) which App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now when all the Complaints were againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> let any Man judge what could be Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">X. Another ſmall Objection which I have againſt this Councel is this, That the Decrees and Canons ſet forth in that Councels Name, were really not the Decrees and Canons of the Councel: for the Truth is, it was a meer Sham, and only a Skreen or Curtain drawn between the World and the Pope, that he might play his Game more ſafely out of Sight. For what do they tell us of <hi>Trent?</hi> If there was any Councel, it was at <hi>Rome;</hi> for there all was really Tranſacted and Concluded. In <hi>Trent</hi> they did only Act the Play which Others made, and therefore it is unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t that they ſhould be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Authors of it, and Rob Others of their Glory; for though they carry the Name, yet in Truth the Tridentine Fathers, were neither Fathers nor Mothers of thoſe Decrees and Canons, but were only the Midwives to deliver the Pope and Conclave of a Brat, which they had long been big with; though they were partly forced and partly Hired to take it upon

themſelves, left the World ſhould have judged it a Baſtard-Child. By the Orders of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. to the Legats, they were to receive from him what they ſhould propoſe, deliberate and conclude, and not to publiſh any Decree in Seſſion, before they had Communicated it at <hi>Rome, (Hiſt. C. T. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 164) And all along there were Deputies in <hi>Rome</hi> kept over the Councel, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be diſpatched in <hi>Trent,</hi> till they had firſt Conſidered, Corrected and Concluded the Matter, and ſatisfied the Pope in it: And then he ſent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to <hi>Trent,</hi> that it might paſs for their Decree. And to this purpoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches came from <hi>Rome</hi> every Week at leaſt once, and ſometimes twice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Waters were up, (as they often were there) and then the Pope could not inſpire them, but the Legats were forced to make delays, and Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e the Councel in By-matters; of all which a very pleaſant Account is given in the letter of the Biſhop of Five-Churches to the Emperour. And ſometimes it hapned, that the Deputies in <hi>Rome</hi> did not underſtand the Affair ſo well as the Legats, who were upon the place; And ſo the Pope ſometimes put things upon them that were uneaſie or unſafe; And then they were at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now I cannot underſtand, but that thoſe who made the Decrees and Canons, were more effectually the Councel, then thoſe who publiſhed them. And being <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are apt to Ask, what Objection can be made againſt the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which may not alſo be made againſt the Councel of <hi>Nice?</hi> I deſire to know of them, whether they will ſay that theſe things can be truly Objected againſt the Councel of <hi>Nice?</hi> If not, then they muſt Acknowledge a wide difference.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. But ſuppoſe theſe and other Objections did not Lye againſt it, yet what is the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> to us? If the Acts of that Councel bind us it muſt either be from the Authority of the Councel, or the Nature of the things determined. If from the Nature of the things, then they are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and without the Councel: And ſo where the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in the Right, we may receive it for its own ſake, not the Councels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is true, not becauſe the Tridentine Fathers ſo determined; And ſo the Plea of the Councel is laid aſide to Examine the Nature of the thing. But if thoſe Acts muſt be ſuppoſed Binding by Vertue of the Authority of the Councel, I would know how that Authority Reacheth us? for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels bind thoſe Churches, whoſe Biſhops are preſent and Conſenting to them.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Canons of the Councel were not Reputed to be Binding to their particular Churches. If the Determinations of the Councel were thought to be of General Concern, then they were ſent to other Churches, whoſe Biſhops were not there, and they might Receive or Reject, either in whole or in part but what they received they bound themſelves to, but not but by their own Act. Now what Biſhops of ours were at <hi>Trent?</hi> or when did we receive it or approve it <hi>ex poſt facto? Henry</hi> the 8th. was ſo far from ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Biſhops to that Councel, that he Proteſted againſt it. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. was leſs a Friend to it. What Queen <hi>Mary</hi> would have done, I know not; But all the time of her Reign the Councel was under a Suſpenſion, and ſate not; And though it was Revived again in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is well known, that ſhe thought, that neither the Pope had Right to Call a Councel, nor equal that he ſhould Preſide in it; Neither did any of the Biſhops of her time, (either of thoſe put out, or thoſe put in) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there. As for the Blind <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> he is nothing to us, and as little I think to his own Nation. It is indeed true, that Cardinal <hi>Pool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> an <hi>Engliſb-man,</hi> whom even Proteſtants Honour for his Moderation and Piety, was in that Councel ſome ſmall time under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third; But he Sate there as the Pope's Legat, not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop: Nay, at that time he was not a Biſhop, at leaſt not of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, nor deputed by any Biſhop of Ours; And therefore could not Carry with Him the Authority of any one of our Churches. I wonder the Pope had not ſo much forecaſt, as to Set up ſome Titulars to ſupply this defect; But if He had, we ſhould have little Regarded ſuch a Mock-Authority. And as none of our Biſhops were there, ſo there is not the leaſt Colour to ſay, that we Received it ſince; And therefore they may Keep their Councel for a Snare to themſelves, it doth not bind us.
