            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is affected with some ague or with some other
burning disease, hee must be placed in some
lower roome or some coole chamber, where
the heat of the Sunne comes not so forcibly.
In Winter time let fire correct the raw and
cold aire, specially for them, that be afflicted
with cold sicknesses. For such, a close warme
roome must be prepared, secured from winds,

                     <p>First, you must choose out a fine soile,
which hath water and wood annexed vnto it,
and forecast in your minde whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

if the minde be not pleased, nature doth


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6562:8"/>
abhorre, and if nature doth abhorre, death
at last must consequently follow. Next you
must marke, whether the ayre which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
the situation of your house, be of a
pure substance, and that shortly after the
Sunne is vp groweth warme; and contrarily
groweth cold after the Sunne is set. Thirdly,
you must make your foundation vpon a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
ground mixt with clay, vpon a hill, or a
hils side. Fourthly, looke that your windowes
be Northward or Eastward. Lastly, when
your house is finished, you must prepare a

hearbs and flowers, wherein you may recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

                     <p>Perry is a sweet kind of Cider, either pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from Peares or from sweet Apples: such
Cider therefore as is sweet, because of his
sweetnesse, which commeth of temperate

but cooleth least of all: and againe, it is
the most nourishing of all Ciders, and the
most profitable to be vsed of such as haue
cold and dry stomacks, and on the contrarie,
but smally profiting them which haue a hot
stomack, whether it be more or lesse, or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
that are full of humidity, very tender
and queasie, and subiect vnto chollerick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
so that in such complexions as are hot
and chollerick: it is needfull as with wine, so
with Cider to mixe water in a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
with sweet Cider when they take it to
drinke: especially when such persons haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

pressed new from sweet apples is windy by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as are also the sweet apples themselues.
This is the cause why Phisitions counsell and

be two sorts of flesh, the one foure-footed,

those that be foure-footed, some are young,
some are of middle age, others are old: the
young are moyst, and doe commonly cause

at the least to nourish soundly and profitably,

                     <p>Certainely that of the male, doth far excell
the flesh of the female, as for example: the
Oxe flesh is better then the Cowes flesh: a fat
Wether is better then a fat Ewe, but this is
to be vnderstood of those males which are
gelt: for I cannot deny but Bull beefe and
Ramme mutton is far worse then the flesh of
the Cow and the Ewe, and to them which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
dyet, I must needs say that all flesh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
be it Beefe, Mutton or other that is
bred on dry places or mountainous, where
ther is any reasonable pasture, is alwaies better
and more wholsome, then that which is bred
in valleyes, or on low and marshie grounds,
where there grow bulrushes, and other weeds
and hearbs, cold moist, and of little substance:
To conclude this flesh of foure-footed beasts,
I haue found that Mutton, Beefe Kid, Lambe,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6562:23"/>
Veale, Pigges and Rabbets, are meats easie to
be digested, and doe engender good bloud;
whereas on the contrary, I finde that Martle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse

the kidneyes, liuers and the entrals of beasts,

                     <p>THere be many kindes of milke according

with which there is no comparison, as being
the most agreeable to the Sympathy of our

                     <p>There are three things worthy of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be marked in egges; the first is, their
proper substance and qualitie, for egges of
some fowles are better than of some others,
Hen egges are the best, and of better nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
then the egges of Duckes, Geese, or
other fowle: the second thing remarkeable in
egges is, the time, to wit, whether they be
fresh or stale, whether they be layed of a
young Hen or of an olde Hen, for experience
teacheth vs that these last doe quickly corrupt
within the stomacke, and be nothing so good
to nourish. Likewise it hath beene noted that
egges layed after the new of the Moone in
the moneth of August, or in the wane of the
Moone, in the moneth of Nouember, as those
likewise which are laved on Christmasse day
or on Whitsonday, are lasting and durable,
and not easily corrupted. Whereof there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deuised any other reason, than that in
some of them the shel is made hard and not to
be pierced through of the aire by the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6562:29"/>
of the time: and in the other, there is a
most quicke exhaling and expending of that
which might be corrupted within the egge,
by the heat of the time, &amp; season then being.
The third and last obseruation is the dressing
and making ready of egges, some are sodden

                     <p>Diuine dreames, are they which were sent

of trueth, so are they true and certaine.</p>
                     <p>Supernaturall dreames are placed in the
middest, betweene the diuine dreames and
the naturall, for they may happen without
being precisely sent from God, and their cause
comes not onely by the sole deprauation of
humours, as naturall dreames doe, but by
the rauishment of the spirit, which wakes,
while the body reposeth, and which being


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6562:37"/>
oftentimes holpen by the inspiration of some
good Angel or <hi>Genius,</hi> doth represent by such
Dreames, things which commonly come to
passe. These kind of dreames chance in the
morning, when the braine is more free from
the vapours of the meate, which before had
dulled it: Among many examples which I
haue read of, this one seemes most strange
vnto me.</p>
                     <p>Two friends trauailing together to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Citie, by the way at a little village, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the one to his friends house, and the other
to an Inne. Hee which lodged at his friends
house, saw in his dreame, his companion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing
him, that he would come to help him,
or else he was to be killed by his hoast, which
when he saw, he awaked, &amp; rose out of his bed
and was about to goe to the Inne, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to himselfe, and thinking how it might
be a false dreame, returned to his bed, and
slept; then againe his friend appeared vnto
him, and seemed to request him more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
that he would succour him, but he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no account likewise of this dreame, slept
againe; to whom in like manner the third
time, his companion with a great complaint

desiring him because hee had neglected to
helpe him in his life time, that now he would
at last, not denie to seeke reuenge on the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
saying, that his murthered body was
brought out of the gate of the Citie vpon a

And as the causes of the bodyes griefes are

                     <p>The cause of loue among fooles is beauty:

euerlasting: and when all other things, as

more fresh, more sweet, and inestimable then

to chuse wiues, not by our eyes, but by our

of their honest deedes and good huswiueries.
Ordinarily the most beautifull and goodly

the reason is, because they prefer the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall

the true and right noble vertues of the minde:

haue turned to be Idolaters: and braue Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialists,

fooles or mad men. Saint <hi>Augustine Libr. 11.

apprehension of his mistresse body imprinted
in his braine, that he imagined himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present with her, and committing of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
copulation with her so sensibly, that his
very seed did spend in the said imaginary act.

                     <p>For the cure of this beastlike and slouenly
sinne, I will content my selfe with three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

                     <p>There dwelt in <hi>Alexandria</hi> a dame of great
beautie, and of greater learning, called <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patia,</hi>
which publikely read vnto Schollers. It
came to passe, that one of her chiefest Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
became so inamoured of her, that the
ardent desire of loue compelled him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
vnto her his passion, entreating her to
pittie his languishing state. <hi>Hippatia</hi> a very
wise woman, and loath to cast away so worthy


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6562:53"/>
a Scholler by a cruell disdaine, bethought
her selfe of this subtill and sodaine remedie:
she out of hand prouided her of a filthy, blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and mattry smock: and after shee had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
him to her chamber, fayning her selfe
willing to giue him contentment, shee tooke
vp her peticote, and shewed him her flowry
contagious smocke, speaking vnto him after
this manner: My friend, I pray thee see here
how thy iudgement hath beene abused; see
what thing thou louest so precious: examine
more straightly, what motiue induced thee
to loue such filthy trompery ouer-cast and
disguised with a glozing beautie. At these
words, the young man began to be ashamed,
to repent himselfe, and thenceforth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more wise and sober.</p>
                     <p>It is reported of that great Scholler <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus
Iullius,</hi> that falling in loue with a faire
Gentlewoman, he pressed her very earnestly
to respect him. Shee to dispatch and to ease
his passion, concluded to lye with him: but
when shee came, shee presently shewed him
her left dugge most vgly to behold by reason
of a canker which had almost rotted it. At
which hideous sight his courage sodainely


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6562:53"/>
quailed, and cooled in such sort, that his lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
loue was conuerted into a charitable loue
to study for some extraordinary Physicke to
help her.</p>
                     <p>A Lawyer of <hi>Tholouza</hi> for his further lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

insnared with loue at <hi>Venice.</hi> Whereupon he
often passed by the doore of his mistresses
house, and made many tokens of his good
will towards her. Hee attempted by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Bawdes to corrupt her with gifts,
and in the end with much adoe found means
himselfe to impart his loue vnto her. The
Gentlewoman with bitter threatning repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him. All which could not cause him to
desist from his idle exterprize, so vnbrideled
was his affection, so violent his motion. But
at the last perceiuing his purpose frustrate

this amourous foole, as <hi>God</hi> would haue it,
was resisted and led into prison. The matter

The wise <hi>Senate</hi> vpon graue deliberation dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
him, committing his cure to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Physitian <hi>Pracastorius,</hi> who at that time
dwelt in <hi>Venice.</hi> This learned man vndertaking
his charge and cure, disguised a Courtizan
like the Gallants mistresse to lye with him a
whole night, and to yeeld him his amorous
contentment, vntill he was weary. Then hee
caused him to be well couered with clothes,
till he fell into a sweat. His phantasie and lust
being thus partly pleasured, hee proceeded
to other remedies, to purge him of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke
humours, so that at length he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him to his former state. I write not this,
to the intent it should serue for a precedent,
(the same being diameter-wise repugnant to
our <hi>Makers</hi> Commandement) but because
our Physitians should counsell the youthfull
amorous to marry, rather then to burne in
vnlawfull desires: and the amorous marryed
to content himselfe with the wife of his youth,
giuing her due beneuolence, and satisfying
his burning lust vpon her body, whom <hi>God</hi>
had ioyned with him for that purpose: for

                     <head>VVhat be the causes of both these kindes?</head>
                     <p>Their causes are outward and inward. The
outward are grieuances, which happen vpon
diuers occasions: eyther for the losse, which
Husbands receiue by reason of their Wiues
deaths; or by reason of some deare friends
death, which in nature wee loue extreamely;
or else by reason of the shipwracke or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of our name, fame, and goods. To these
outward causes I adioyne the depraued dyet


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6562:56"/>
of the melancholicke, which engender me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke
humours: as those euill weedes
and seeds, which our Farmers gather among
their corne, grinding the same with the rest,
into bread or malt. Out of these corrupt seeds
malignant vapours arise vp into the head,
which intoxicate the braine, whirling about
the imaginatiue facultie, straying vp and
downe along the memorie, and eclipsing the
light of the vnderstanding. The inward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
spring from melancholick or burnt bloud,
contained within an inflamed braine, and
there-hence tainting the veines and whole
body. Of this blacke and enraged bloud,
which originally proceeded from the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of vapours or exhalations, there grow
diuersities or diuers sorts of Sorrowes, which
diuersly work vpon the functions of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>For if it be true, that the soule is in the
bloud, and dispersed through euery part of
the same, (as God is wholy in the world, and
wholy in euery part of the same) then surely
must it follow, that the variety of the bloud
doth change and diuersifie the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and also that the actes of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6562:57"/>
soule doth change the humours of the
body: so that out of these diuersities of tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
humours there are ingendred strange and
wandring phantasies, caused by reason of
such blacke bloud, smoake and sweat, which
is crept into the humour of melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Some of extreame sorrow haue turned
mad, famishing themselues to death: some
imagined themselues to be Vrinals of glasse,
expecting when they shold be broken through
some accident: some thought that they were
become Owles, and therefore feared to be
seene abroad in the day time. Among these
sorrowfull sots, I cannot but remember a
Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> with whom I was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
acquainted at the Citie of <hi>Noua-palma</hi>
in <hi>Italie,</hi> about nine yeares past. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
by reason of crosses, hauing fallen into
a sorrowfull discontentment, began to scorne
all of his rancke, and grinding the world as
it were into oatmeale, would eyther be <hi>aut Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
aut nihil,</hi> eyther a Monarch, or a Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcher.
And to this end he studyed by what
meanes hee might aspire to the Empire. At
the last, hauing wearied his braine with the
losse of many a nights sleepe, to his bodyes


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6562:57"/>
annoyance, hee imparted his mind vnto me:
whereupon, to put him out of dumps by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
I aduised him to leaue off his solitary
walkes, and to betake himselfe to reading, or
to some outward exercise, thereby to banish
away his inward thoughts, or rather doating
Dreames. This counsell of mine, hee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
followed for a time: but at length he
fell into his wonted phantasies, and persisted
so strongly therein, that hee wrote very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
letters and pathetical vnto the <hi>Electours,</hi>
for his aduancement into the throne <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,</hi>
very earnestly soliciting me to become

                     <head>Into how many ages is mans life diuided?</head>
                     <p>MAns life by the computation of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
is diuided into seauen ages: ouer
euery one of which, one of the seauen planets
is predominant. The first age is called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
which continueth the space of seauen
yeares. And then the Moone raigneth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the moyst constitutions of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
agreeing well with the influence of that
planet.</p>
                     <p>The second age named childhood, lasteth
seauen yeares more, and endeth in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of our life. Ouer this age, <hi>Mercurie</hi>
(which is the second sphere) ruleth; for then
children are vnconstant, tractable, and soone
enclined to learne.</p>
                     <p>The third age endureth eight yeares, and


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6562:62"/>
is termed the strippling age: It beginneth at
the fourteenth yeare, and continueth vntill
the end of the two and twentieth. During
which time, gouerneth the planet <hi>Venus:</hi> For
then we are prone to prodigality, gluttonie,
drunkennes, lechery, &amp; sundry kinds of vices.</p>
                     <p>The fourth age contayneth twelue yeares,
till a man be foure and thirtie, and then
is he named a young man. Of this age the
<hi>Sunne</hi> is chiefe Lord. Now a man is wittie,
well aduised, magnanimous, and come to
know himselfe.</p>
                     <p>The fift age is called mans age, and hath
sixteene yeares for the continuance thereof,
subiect to <hi>Mars;</hi> for now a man is cholerick
and couetous.</p>
                     <p>The sixt age hath twelue yeares, that is,
from fiftie till threescore and two. This age
is termed (although improperly) olde age:
of which <hi>Iupiter</hi> is master, a planet significant
of equity, temperance and religion.</p>
                     <p>The seauenth and last (by order) of these
ages continueth full 18. yeares, ending at
fourscore, to which few attaine. This age, by
the meanes of that planet <hi>Saturne,</hi> which is
melancholick &amp; most slow of all other, causeth


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6562:63"/>
man to be drooping, decrepit, froward, cold,
and melancholick.</p>

                     <head>Why did men liue longer before the floud,
then they doe now?</head>
                     <p>The principall reason, why men in those
dayes liued longer then we do, is, because they
had not then any of the causes, which ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in vs so many maladies, whence conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ensueth death. Their liues were vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the course of the heauens, with the
qualities of the planets &amp; stars, being at that
time farre more glorious and gracious then
now. There were not so many meteors, comets,
and ecclipses past, from whence now diuers &amp;
innumerable circumuolutions proceed.</p>
                     <p>We must also vnderstand, that our first
Parents were created of God himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other instrumentall meanes, And
againe, the earth in those dayes was of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
efficacie to bring foorth necessaries for
mans vse, then it is in this crooked and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne
age. The soyle was then gay, trim, and
fresh: whereas now by reason of the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which tooke away the fatnesse thereof) it
is barren, saltish, and vnsauorie.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, they knew the hidden ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of hearbs and stones, vsing great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6562:63"/>
in their dyets and behauiours. They
were ignorant of our delicate inuentions and
multiplied compounds. They knew not our
dainty cates, our marchpanes, nor our super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
slibber sauces. They were no quaffers
of wine or Ale, nor were they troubled with
so many cares, and vaine glorious pompes.</p>

                     <head>Tell me the certaine time, wherein man must
of necessitie die?</head>
                     <p>To die once, is a common thing to al men.
For that was ordained as a punishment of God
for our fore-parents, when they transgressed
his commandement, with longing and lustfull
thoughts touching the fruit in Paradise: but
to tel how, &amp; at what time, that is a secresie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
disclosed to any creature. Such as the mans
life is, such is his death. A Righteous man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
righteously. But a wicked man hath a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
end dying without repentance. Death is a
so daine and a sullen guest, neuer thought on,
before hee apprehendeth vs as his slaues.
When we think our selues safely mounted on
the pinacle of worldly felicity, he vnawares
suppresseth vs rudely, and smiteth vs deadly.</p>
                     <p>For which consideration, O mortall men,
lead your liues vprightly, hearken not vnto
the counsels of the vngodly, nor like greedie

Cormoraunts snatch vp other mens rights.
Rather know your selues contentedly: which
done, be vigilant, well armed in Christ Iesus,
and alwaies meditating on your deaths.</p>

                     <head>VVhich be the most dangerous yeares in mans
life?</head>
                     <p>The auncient Sages, by curious notes
haue found out, that certaine yeares in mans
life be very perillous. These they name cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mactericall
or stayrie yeares, for then they
saw great alterations. Now a climactericall
yeare is euery seauenth yeare; The reason is,
because then the course of the planets returne
to <hi>Saturne,</hi> who most commonly is cruell and
noysome vnto vs. And euen as the Moone,
which is the next planet vnto vs, and swiftest
of course, passeth almost euery seauenth day
into the contrary signe of the same qualitie,
from whence she came forth, and there-hence
bringeth the criticall daies: so <hi>Saturne,</hi> which
is the planet furthest from vs and slowest of
course (for hee resteth in one signe so many
yeares, as the Moone doth dayes) bringeth
these climactericall yeares, and causeth sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
mutations to follow. Hence is it, that in
the seauenth yeare children doe cast and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6562:64"/>
their teeth. In the fourteenth yeare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
their strippling age. And betwixt
that and the fifteenth yeare there falles out
in the body a tumultuous whurly-burly or
wambling commotion of humours, which in
some breakes out into scabs or hote watry
issues, in others into kindes of agues. In the
one and twentieth, youth. And when a man
hath past seauen times seauen yeares, to wit,
nine and forty yeares, hee is a ripe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man. Also, when he attaineth to tenne
times seauen yeares, that is, to the age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten, his strength and chiefest ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
begins to fall away. And againe, euery
seauenth yeare was by Gods owne institution
pronounced hallowed; And in it the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
were prohibited to manure their grounds
or to plant vineyards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> mentioneth, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Octauian</hi> sent a Letter vnto his step-sonne
to this effect: Reioyce with mee my
Sonne, for I haue past ouer that deadly yeare,
and enemie to olde age, threescore and three.
In which number the seauenths and ninths
doe concurre.</p>
                     <p>The sixe and fiftieth yeare is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6562:65"/>
to men borne in the night season, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the doubled coldnesse of <hi>Saturne.</hi>
And the threescore and third yeare is very
perillous to them that be borne in the day
time, by reason of the drinesse of <hi>Mercurie</hi>
and <hi>Venus.</hi> It is also obserued, that the nine
and fortieth yeare composed of seauen times
seauen is very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Others againe of our late Criticks collect
by experience, that in the seauenth yeare more
vnnaturall ill humours are ingendred, then
the true and naturall constitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
can possibly digest, because the liuer and
heart being the radicall Fountaines of the
bloud, by little and little, are so corrupted
within the compasse of sixe or seauen yeares,
which cannot chuse but at the last breake
out, like the Paroxismes or fits of an ague
tertian or quartane, in some kinde of bodies
at the seauenth yeare, and in others of a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ability at the ninth yeare. So when these
steps are past, the liuer &amp; heart do prepare hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
for the yeares or steps following, vntill
it burst out into a remarkeable euent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, whensoeuer any man entreth into
these climactericall yeares (if certaine tokens


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6562:65"/>
of imminent sicknesse doe appeare, as weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse
of the members, griefe of the knees,
dimnesse of sight, buzzing of the eares, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse
of meate, sweating in sleepe, yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or such like) then let him incessantly
pray, and beseech God to protect and guide
his heart; let him be circumspect and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                     <p>Euery one humour raigneth sixe houres.
Bloud is predominant from nine a clocke in

the night, vntill three a clock in the morning.
Choler from three a clock in the morning, till
nine. Melancholy ruleth from nine a clock

Likewise flegme gouerneth from three in the
euening, vntill nine a clock at night. So that
flegme and melancholy doe raigne at night,
and bloud and choler in the day time. Also
bloud hath his dominion in the Spring time;
choler in the Sommer; melancholy in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne,

I aduise you (if perchance you fall into
a disease) to marke well, in the beginning of

alterations either towards your recouerie, or
towards your further sicknesse willensue. Most

nights are of equall length, the cold weather
is diminished, the pores of the earth (being
closed and congealed with cold) are opened,
the fields waxe greene, hearbes and flowers
doe bud, beasts rut, the birds chirp, and to be
briefe, all liuing Creatures doe recouer their
former vigour in the beginning of the spring.
Now a man must eate lesse, and drink somwhat
the more. The best meates to be eaten are
Veale, Kid, yong Mutton, Chickens, dry fowle,


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6562:68"/>
potched egges, figs, raisins, and other sweet
meate: and because the Spring is a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
season, it requires temperature in all
things. Vse competent Phlebotomy, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or such like. Venery will doe no great
harme.</p>
                     <p>As the Sunne by steps and degrees makes
his power manifest abroad: so within our
bodyes hee workes strange and meruailous
effects after his cloudy absence. Sweet meat
must haue soure sauce: after our gurmundise
and gluttonous fare, let vs now likewise imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
these degrees, and by little and little
weane our bodies from such luxurious cheer.
Wee see Nurses annoint their teates with
Wormwood iuyce, to terrifie and withdraw
their froward Children from their auncient
sustenance: so in like manner, let vs in this
season beginne to sequester our wanton wils
(being the bodies rulers) from persisting in

coole themselues now and then with waters of
Endiue and Succory, or with fountaine water,
together with a little Comfits to expell infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

case let them which regard their health, take
heede of salt Herrings and slimy Fish, as a
meate fitter for labourers, then for tender na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Or if their longing wantonnesse be such
that they must needs eate them, let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
or omit their next meale, whereby
those ill humours may be spent or dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
which were caused by reason of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome

of idle people will be quickly tainted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
so that the bad excrements will break
out into itch, tetters, the small pockes or
meazels: or else they will descend from the
head into the eyes, teeth, or lungs, and there
engender a fearefull cough. In old persons
these brackish, viscous, and salt humours will

the dayes are shortned, and the nights pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
Windes are sharpe, Snow and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
inundations of waters arise, the Earth
is congealed with frost and Ice, and all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
creatures doe quiuer with colde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man must vse warme and dry meates:
for the cheerefull vertues of the body are
now weakened by the colde ayre: and the
naturall heate is driuen into the inward
parts of the body, to comfort and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the vitall Spirits. VVee must expell
the colde ayre with warme drinkes, wines,
braggot, metheglin, malmesie, and such like,
and aboue all with warme clothes, which I
wish to be of wooll, rather then of any other
stuffes. In this season, wee may feede libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
on strong meates, as Beefe, barren Does,
gelt Goats, and on spiced or baked meates:


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6562:70"/>
for whose better digestion, and to shut the
orifice or mouth of the stomacke, some vse
to eate Comfits of Anise-seedes presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>At nights be sure to keep your selfe warme,

                     <p>Now Wardens, Apples, and Peares may
be vsed with wine or with salt, for swelling: or
with comfits, for windinesse. To vse carnall
copulation is expedient, if the weather be
moist, and not very cold. Astronomers auerre,
that if the first day of <hi>December</hi> be foule and

it is expedient to eate meat of a light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,

be let bloud. But for bloud letting I could

                     <head>Declare vnto me a daily Diet, whereby I may
liue in health, and not trouble my
selfe in Physicke.</head>
                     <p>I Will: first of all in the morning when you
are about to rise vp, stretch your selfe strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for thereby the animall heat is somewhat
forced into the outward parts, the memory is
quickned, and the body is strengthened. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily,
rub and chafe your body with the
palmes of your hands, or with a course lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
cloath: the breast, back, and belly gently,
but the armes, thighes, and legs roughly, till
they seeme ruddy and warme. 3. Euacuate
your selfe. 4. Put on your apparell, which
in the Sommer time must be (for the most
part) silke, or buffe, made of Buckes skinne,
for it resisteth vermine and contagious ayres:
in Winter your vpper garment must be of
Cotton or Frizeadow. 5. When you haue
apparrelled your selfe handsomly, combe
your head softly and easily with an Iuorie
combe, for nothing recreateth the memory


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6562:78"/>
more. 6. Pick and rub your teeth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would not haue you to bestow much
cost in making dentrifrices for them, I will
aduertise you by foure rules of importance
how to keepe your teeth white and vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and also to haue a sweet breath. First,
wash well your mouth when you haue eaten
your meat: secondly, sleepe with your mouth
somewhat open. Thirdly, spet out in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that which like the scum of a pot, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together that night in the throat: then
take a linnen cloath and rub your teeth well
within and without, to take away the fumosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the meat and yellownesse of the teeth:
For it is that which putrifieth them, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
the breath. But least (perhaps) your
teeth become loose and filthy, I will shew you
a water farre better than pouders, which shall
fasten them, scoure the mouth, make sound
the gummes, and cause the flesh to grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if it were fallen away. Take halfe a
glassefull of vinegar, and as much of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Mastick tree (if it may easily be
got) of Rosemary, Mirh, Mastick, bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,
Dragons hearbe, roach Allome,
of each of them an ounce: of fine Cinnamon


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6562:78"/>
halfe an ounce, of Fountaine water three glasse
fuls: mingle all well together, and let it boile
with a small fire, adding to it halfe a pound of
hony, and taking away the scum, then put in
a little Benguine, and when it hath sodden a
quarter of an houre, take it from the fire, and
keep it in a cleane bottle, and wash your teeth
therewithall as well before meate as after: if
you holde some of it in your mouth a little
while, it doth much good to the head, and
sweetneth the breath. I take this water to be
better then a thousand of their dentifrices.</p>
                     <p>7. Wash your face, eies, eares, and hands
with Fountaine water. I haue knowne diuers
Students which vsed to bath their eyes onely
in Well water twise a day, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
their eye-sight free from all passions
and bloud-sheds, and sharpned their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
meruailously. You may sometimes, bath
your eies in Rose water, Fennel water, or Eye-bright
water, if you please: but I know for
certainty, that you need not, as long as you
vse good Fountaine water. Moreouer, least
you by olde age or some other meanes doe
waxe dimme of sight, I will declare vnto you,
the best and safest remedy which I know, and


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6562:79"/>
this it is: take of the distilled waters of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueine,
Bettony, and Fennell one ounce and a
halfe, then take one ounce of white wine, one
drachme of Tutia (if you may easily come
by it) two drachmes of Sugarcandy, one
drachme of Aloes Epaticke, two drachmes of
womans milke, and one scruple of Camphire;
beat those to powder which are to be beaten;
and infuse them together for foure and twenty
houres, and then straine them, and so vse it
when you list. Or if you abhorre Artificiall
meanes to cleare your sight, suggested by the
spirit of incredulity, that a <hi>Decipe</hi> might be
inserted in stead of a <hi>Recipe,</hi> hold fast on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
documents, and follow these plaine
rules to preuent sore eyes: First, keepe your
belly alwaies soluble: Secondly, abstaine from
winde, dust, smoake, fire, sorrow, watching;
from eating of Mustard, Beanes, Onions, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Leekes, and grosse meates: from wine
bibbing or strong drink, and reading of small
printed letters. Thirdly, sleepe not after
meales presently. Fourthly, vse to regard
greene or yellow colours. Fiftly, holde not
downe your head too much. Sixtly, touch
them not with your hands, specially vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washt.


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6562:79"/>
Lastly, keepe your feete cleane and dry.</p>
                     <p>8 When you haue finished these, say your
morning prayers, and desire God to blesse
you, to preserue you from all dangers, and to
direct you in all your actions. For, <hi>the feare
of God</hi> (as it is written) <hi>is the beginning of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi>
and without his protection whatsoeuer
you take in hand, shall fall to ruine. Therefore
see that you be mindfull of him, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that to that intent you were borne, to wit,
to set forth his glory and most holy name.</p>
                     <p>9 Goe about your businesse circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and endeauour to banish all cares and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
which are the onely baites of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.
Defraud no man of his right: for
what measure you giue vnto your neighbour,
that measure shal you receiue. And finally, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
this saying deeply in your mind: A man
is but a Steward of his owne goods; whereof
God one day will demaund an account.</p>
                     <p>10 Eate three meales a day, vntill you
come to the age of 40 yeares: as your break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
dinner and supper; yet that betweene
breakfast and dinner there be the space of
foure houres, and betwixt dinner and supper
seauen houres: the breakfast must be lesse then


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6562:80"/>
the dinner, and the dinner somewhat lesse
then supper. In the beginning of meales, eate
such meates as wil make the belly soluble, and
let grosse meates be the last. Content your
selfe with one kinde of meat, for diuersities
hurt the body, by reason that meates are not
all of one quality. Some are easily digested,
others againe are heauy, and will lie a long
time vpon the stomack. Also the eating of
sundry sorts of meate require often pots of
drinke, which hinder concoction; like as wee
see often putting of water into the meat-pot
to hinder it from seething. Our stomack is
our bodies kitchin, which being distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how can we liue in temperate order? drink
not aboue foure times, and that moderately,
at each meale: least the belly-god hale you at
length captiue into his prison house of gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundise,
where you shall be afflicted with as
many diseases as you haue deuoured dishes of
sundry sorts. The cups, whereof you drinke,
should be of siluer, gold, or siluer and guilt, or
Venice glasse, or of Chinaes mould, and those
without couers, that the breath may not be
restrained within.</p>
                     <p>Labour not either your minde or body,


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6562:80"/>
presently after meales: rather sit a while and
discourse of some pleasant matters: when
you haue ended your confabulations, wash
your face and mouth with colde waters, then
goe to your chamber, and make cleane your
teeth with your tooth-picker, which should be
either of Iuory, siluer, or gold. Watch not
too long after supper, but depart within two
houres to bed. But if necessity compell you
to watch longer then ordinarie, then be sure
to augment your sleepe the next morning,
that you may recompence Nature, which
otherwise through your watching, would not
a little be empaired.</p>
                     <p>12 Put off your cloathes in Winter by
the fire side: and cause your bed to be heated
with a warming pan: vnlesse your pretence be
to harden your members, and to apply your
selfe vnto militarie discipline. This outward
heating doth wonderfully comfort the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heat, it helpeth concoction, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
moisture.</p>
                     <p>13 Remember before you rest, to chew
downe a dozen graines of Mastick, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
or in the conserues of Roses, for it will
preserue your body from bad humours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:6562:81"/>
14 Pray feruently to God, before you
sleepe, to inspire you with his grace, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
you from all perils and subtilties of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
fiends, and from their spirituall temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to prosper you in all your affaires:
and then lay aside your cares and businesse,
as well publick as priuate, for that night: in
so doing you shall sleepe more quietly.</p>
                     <p>15 Make water at least once, and cast it
out: but in the morning make water in an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinall,
that by looking on it, you may gesse
somewhat of the state of your body, by noting
the quantity and colour: sleepe first on your
right side with your mouth open, and let
your night cap be somwhat thick quilted, haue
a hole in the top, through which the vapour
may goe out.</p>
                     <p>16 In the morning remember your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and if you be troubled with rheumes, as
soone as you haue risen, vse <hi>diatrion piperion,</hi>
Pellitory of Spaine, Tobacco snuft vp into the
nostrils, or eate white Pepper now and then,
and you shall be holpen.</p>
