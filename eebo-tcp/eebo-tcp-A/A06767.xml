         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

since my first entring on

sundrie times counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by her Maiesties appointment, in the
place where I serue, to post from place to place
on such affaires as were enioyned mee, so that
not hauing fully finished one sheete, and the

I haue been greatly his hinderaunce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb facs="tcp:2883:4"/>
to catch hold on such little leasures, as in
the morning ere I went to horse-backe, or in
the euening comming into mine Inne, I could
compasse from companie. That I fable not
herein, you are my witnesse; in that at your

in your companie, as occasion serued:
and sithence in a long lingring iourney, I haue
knit vp the rest, sending leafe by leafe vnperu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

doubt of a perfect Translation. In this hard
case, I hope your Worship will the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor

better, if more respite had been graunted me.
Yet this dare I saye beside, that except it bee a
word here and there by mee left out, or by the
Printer mistaken, I am assured verie little lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
I am certaine not so much as a line of the

with you by too long circumstance (of which I assure
my selfe you make no doubt) I will leaue protestations, &amp; go
forward with my purpose. Sir, so it is, that in your late em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
about her Maiesties affaires, hauing left the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of <hi>Gerileon</hi> vnfinished, I chaunst to heare of a newe
part fully ended, by an excellent Scholler (I assure ye) as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
attained to the vnderstanding of <hi>As in praesenti.</hi> His ripe
wit, rare learning, and excellent Science, hath plentifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
in sundrie inuented bookes of newes; wherein how
euer he hath audaciously abused sundrie well deseruing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
by attributing to them victories, when they at that
time came not neere the enemie; yet hath hee been liberally
rewarded (after six pence a sheete) of the Book-binder hys
Arch-workmaister. For this sea-swolne Sycophant, can no
sooner heare the thunder cracke, but he interpretes it to bee
the roaring of Cannons, the confusion of enemies, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to the English. Then ouer his Kan of <hi>Canarie</hi> wine:
nay, soft and faire, his labour gets no such allowance; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
truly, and in good sooth, ye see this world is hard, &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
drink than Barley yeelds, cannot be spar'd. Yea, say ye so;
well, sith we are all English-men, let it bee so: and ouer hys
Ale-pot let him ruminate. Now, in such a month at <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2883:5"/>
fire consumed so manie <hi>Hambrough</hi> ships of Corne; witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of <hi>England:</hi> them a valiant <hi>Suffolke</hi> Gentleman, (as indeede
he is) at such a sight tooke such a prize; at another, one so
rich, as it is almost incredible to report: when God knowes
the worthy Gentleman came home, and hardly had saued his
owne. Sundrie of these could I set downe, beside that paltry
rude ryme, wherein an honourable personage of this Realme
was so palpably abusde. But what cares hee? not a Barley
corne: for he calls himselfe a Canonier, and in the discharge
of pot-shot, cares not at whom he leuell, so he fasten on the
white, that by diminutiue degrees is drawen from the strings
of his Stationers purse. But I remember ye tolde mee once,
his newes-buyer is no Stationer, yet I am sure he is a Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
and hath a whole Armie of runnagates at his reuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that swarme euerie where in <hi>England,</hi> and with theyr ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauld

I maruell who the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell is his Printer: and but that
I am assured, it cannot bee done but by some mans helpe of
that profession, I should hardly be perswaded, that anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of so excellent a Science would bee so impudent, to
print such odious and lasciuious ribauldrie, as <hi>Watkins Ale,
The Carmans Whistle,</hi> and sundrie such other. But it may be,
there is some wainscot fac'd fellowe, that is abel to print no
good thing, found out to be his instrument: if it be so, it were
not greatly amisse, might my censure serue for a determinate
sentence, that he might dance at a Cartes tayle the Car-mans
whistle, till his backe were as well seasoned as his face. But
this belongs to higher powers: returne wee to our first man.
Who, how euer his credite may bee impayred by the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of vntrue newes, it hath not been a little recouered by
the exquisite Translation of Fortunes Defier <hi>Andrugio.</hi> For
this is to be prooued, he so followed his Author, that not the
best Scholler in the worlde can reprooue him of digression.
Indeed (as I take it) it was first written in broken English, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:2883:6"/>
so I am sure it is printed: for if he had not in some measure
the English tongue, he woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be vtterly mute. But here may
a question be mooued, if this that I affirme bee true; where
shall we haue <hi>Gerileon</hi> by him Englished, sith he vnderstands
not French? Why easely. Is it not a Fiction first deuised
in French? Yes So shall it be in English. Why tell mee, art
thou so impudent to abuse the worke of so noble a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as the French Author was; wherein such excelent pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
such morrall prudence, such singular conceipted passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

counterfet part thereof in print: if I doo, I will hang Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> Church Corner with such Scutchions of thy shame,
that <hi>Mannering</hi> musing what it should meane, shall neuer

of the first Booke of this nistorie. After she had by insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable

burning feauer: as what with the violence therof,
and her balefull passions of loue together, she had at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
dyed, but that she was continually comforted by the

who followed in quest of the vnknowne Knight, and
hauing found him, brought him to the Emperours Court,
where in eight dayes his wounds were healed. By meanes
whereof, these Ladyes (who knew well the cause of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

this hope grounded in them, that the death of the Knight
and Fayrie youth, was no more certaine or to be credited,
then the report of <hi>Pharisor:</hi> And that the vnknowne Knight
who rumourd foorth these tidings, had doone it but for the
aduantage of his glorie, or to couer the dishonour he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Ioust: which made her somewhat to recomfort
her selfe, so that (but for her feauer) she might easily haue
recouered her former state of health.</p>
               <p>But if she suffered such anguish for her friend, the Fairie
youth endured no whit lesse for her, in that his loue tooke
life at that instant, when she did him the honour to girde on
his sword with her dellicate hands: but he fearing that their
loues were not reciprocall, languished in selfe same fits as
the Infant did, esteeming him selfe so vnfortunate and
flenderlie fauoured by loue: that he thought their wounds
to procéed from shafts of contrarie nature, whereby the cure
of either would prooue as different. Thus did the fire search
through the bone to the marrowe, and he was so distracted
in himselfe (as hath béene toucht in the former Booke) as
wandering from the care hee had to séeke the vnknowne
Knight, to reue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now hath lost himselfe, in thinking and contemplating on
that heauenly beautie, which lay neerest his hart, and aboue
all things else he most prefered. So that in steed of taking
<pb facs="tcp:2883:7"/>
the right way, for embarking himself so some strange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
hee returned with his Squire <hi>Geliaste</hi> towards the
Cittie of Constantinople, imagining (neuerthelesse) that he
rode farre enough from it. On the other side, the Princesse
<hi>Porphiria</hi> was euen at deaths doore, for the loue of her
knighth, and so farre extended each extremitie, as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all soueraigne remedies appplyed, from one houre
to another, a daungerous end was still expected.</p>
               <p>The Emperour and Empresse were wonderfull gréeued
at their daughters sicknes, not knowing whence the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof procéeded: and therefore wholy committed her to
the care of <hi>Sagibell</hi> her Phisition, a man most expert and
skilfull in the art of medicine. This Phisition was likewise
greatly experimented in the art Magique, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of long time discerned in him very speciall affection and
fidelitie towards her: wherefore among diuers contrarie
opinions, which day and night combatted in her labouring
thoughts, she imagined how to finde some ease for her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and sent for him by the Lady <hi>Marcella,</hi> who knewe
much better then the phisition where the disease pained her,
she beeing then to <hi>Harderina</hi> participating these secrets.
Right prompt and readie was shee to obey the Princesse
will, and suddenly went to finde this wise man, who was
altogether confounded with greefe and pensiuenes, because
he could not attaine the meane, whereby the faire Princes
might recouer footing againe: for to her serui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirelie
affected, considering that all his happines depended
on her safetie and health, and shee recured it would enrich
him for euer: for the Emperour had promised him, that if
by his skill he could restore his daughter, he would returne
him such a recompence, as should both exalt and content
him for euer. But without any such promise <hi>Sagibell</hi> was
carefull enough of the Infants health, and failed not in his
very vttermost endeuours: and <hi>Porphiria</hi> (for her part) was
willing to bestowe on this skilfull man, what euer she might
<pb facs="tcp:2883:8"/>
enioy by the Emperour and Empres, prouided, that her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
sicknes might finde desired recouerie. Wherevpon,
<hi>Marcella</hi> hauing tould him the Princes would speake with
him, and that with speed he should repaire to her chamber:
without further questioning with the Lady, he went thither
immediatly, not a little ioyfull of this message, which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
might presage some good to ensue, because hauing so
lately left her, he was now so suddenly sent for. When <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibell</hi>
was come to her, he demanded how she felt her selfe:
When the Princesse (breathing foorth a déepe fetcht sighe
from the bottome of her hart) thus spake vnto him. Ah <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibell,</hi>
impossible is it I should be well, considering the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
wherein I am, all your medicines and drugges ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no abilitie to giue me my former strength, health and
quietnes; yet notwithstanding, your knowledge might doe
me great good seruice, if you were so pleased. <hi>Sagibell</hi> was
not a little abashed at the woordes of the Princesse, and
knew not what to coniecture of them, because they implyed
such a contradiction: for she said all his medicines and drugs
could not helpe her, and yet she might be highly benefited by
his knowledge, which made him to returne this answere.
Why Madame, doe you thinke I haue made spare of my
knowledge, and that I haue not endeuoured my vttermost
(according to Art) to set ye on your feet againe? Thereof I
am perswaded my good friend <hi>Sagibell,</hi> quoth she, but your
art of medicine is not auailable for me in this case: for were
your God <hi>Appollo, Aesculapius, Hipocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> heere
present to giue me remedie, yet could they vnderstand no
more of my disease then you doo. But will yee promise to
be faithfull and secret to me, as I did neuer yet finde yee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
and I shall acquaint yee with the cause and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
of my greefe, which when ye haue vnderstood, easily
by your knowledge may the effect be taken away. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
who was quick conceited, began to waxe iealous of
the cause, gathering by hir wordes, that loue had made a
<pb facs="tcp:2883:8"/>
great breach into her tender hart: yet making shewe as
though he suspected no such matter, he sayd to the Princesse.
Beléeue (good Madame) that I will be secret to yée, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
such fidelitie towards yée, as the Emperour your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and your selfe haue alwayes found in me. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
being in bed, caused her pillowes to be raysed, to the
end shee might deliuer her minde with the more ease: and
hauing heard the answer of her Phisition, with voice faint
and weake, entermedled with a thousand sighes, shee thus
began.</p>
               <p>My sicknes is caused by the loue I beare to the fairie
youth, if he liue not, then thinke a speedie end will deliuer
me from this anguish: except you take pittie on mee, and
succour me in other sort then as yet you haue done, I know
you are skilfull in the Magique science, and that by Art you
can let me sée him aliue or dead: he is the man, whose onely
remembrance giues life and content to my amorous passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Then let me sée in what estate he is, for nothing else
can ease my afflictions, and all remedies else are vtterlie in
vaine, as by the applying and proofe you haue hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.
I had not knowne aboue fourtéene or fiftéene yeeres,
when first his loue made seyzure on my hart, euen amongst
the Ladyes of the Empresse my mother, where I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to swoune in the publique assemblie: he then that
hath occasioned this hurt to me, can take it away and giue
me helpe, but it consists in you to giue me some ease by your
knowledge, in shewing me my friend aliue, wherein I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be resolued, because I stand in doubt he is dead. If I
be assured of his end, then mine hath no long date of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
so shall I bee freed from these extreame passions,
which not alone wounds my hart, but deuides in sunder my
very soule: leauing me so disconsolate, as but I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
by one of my Ladyes, long since had I pass out of this
miserable life into a better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sagibell</hi> hauing attentiuely heard the Princesse, thus
<pb facs="tcp:2883:9"/>
answered. Madame you haue well séene my faithfull seruic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
towards yee till this present, and be ye assured, that though
it valued the price of my life, yet will I hazard all for the
safetie of yours: for so must I confesse my selfe bound to do
in dutie, in regard yee haue discouered to me such a secret,
as neuer could be gathered by the rules of phisick, beside, the
many honors doone me, in being toward the Emperour and
you, commaunds me to do my vttermost for your good. Most
gladly then doo I yeeld to satisfie you request, but perhaps
it cannot be so soone as you would, because heere I may not
make proofe of any such practise by arte, for feare of being
discouered: it behooues vs then to finde out, a place more
proper and conuenient, and it were not much amisse, the
better to couller our enterprise, that the Emperour were
giuen to vnderstand, that it is needefull for your health to
change this ayre, otherwise your life will be in great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.
As for the place, both faire, delightfull, and agreeing
with your intent, choose the Castell of pleasure which the
Emperour hath hard at hand: and there may yee commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
without any suspition, haue knowledge of him you
loue so deerely, and vnderstand likewise of whence he is.</p>
               <p>The Princesse intreated him very earnestly that it
might be so, and foorthwith to mooue the matter to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:
which he hauing effected, she would requite it with
such liberalitie, as hee should haue cause to extoll his good
fortune. The phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ition hauing in this sort comforted her,
and giuen her hope of knowing what most she desired: tooke
his leaue, promising very quickly to returne againe, to tell
her how he sped with the Emperour. Before whom when
he was come, both he and the Empresse demanded of the
phisition, the estate of <hi>Porphiria</hi> their daughter: when <hi>Sagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
answered, that he thought it méete she should change
the ayre, to sée if that in any sort would amend her, for hee
was of opinion, that the alteration of the ayre would do hir
great good, and bring her to her former health and strength,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:9"/>
next to the grace of God. And whither were it best (quoth
the Emperour) she should be remooued? To some fayre and
pleasant place, replied <hi>Sagibell,</hi> that her body finding ease by
change of ayre, her eye might likewise bee delighted with
pleasing obiects. It were good then (said the Emperour) to
conuay her to my Castell néere at hand, which is seatedmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous
fitly for such a purpose. There cannot be (quoth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibell</hi>)
a place more conuenable, but it were not expedient
that any traine should accompanie her, for disquieting her
head with goers and commers to speake with her: and I
doubt not, but (by Gods helpe) you shall shortly see her as
well and merrie as euer she was, albeit now she is more
likely to die then liue. God prosper your attempt then (said
the Emperour) and turning toward the Empresse, thus he
proceeded. Do you (Madame) cause all her equipage to be
prouided, and appoint such Ladyes for her companie as you
shall thinke méete. In this time of their conference, <hi>Sagibell</hi>
departed, and aduertised the princesse how he had sped, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise what resolution was set downe, to transport
her to the place himselfe before had named. Whereof the
princesse not a littlle ioyfull, though weake, yet hoping to
receiue some comfort: intreated the phisition to hasten this
iourney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sagibell</hi> was scant departed the princesse chamber, but
the Empresse entred, hauing her eyes full of teares, and her
hart cloyde with greefe, accompanyed with hir Ladyes and
Gentlewomen, saying to hir daughter: that for recouerie of
her health, it was thought expedient shee should change the
ayre, and (it she were so pleased) she should be conducted to
the Emperours Castell of pleasure, which was not farre
without the Cittie of Constantinople. She answered with
a spent and wearyed voyce, that she submitted her selfe to
their good pleasures, and desired she might haue to kéepe hir
companie, her Coosin <hi>Harderina</hi> and the Lady <hi>Marcella.</hi> You
shall haue them (quoth the Empresse) with all things else
<pb facs="tcp:2883:10"/>
shall stand with your liking: in meane while then bee of

possible may be, if ye regard the ioy of the Emperour and
mee.</p>
               <p>Hauing spoken these words, the teares fell from her eyes
in such aboundance, gréeuing to sée the faire princesse of the
world in this weake estate: as being ouercome with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
she was constrained to depart the chamber, not saying
any thing, but that shee should rest her selfe awhile, and shee
would go giue order for her departure. Which accordingly
she did, and after all things were in a readinesse, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still, calme and cléere, <hi>Sagibell</hi> aduised the Emperour
and Empresse, that now the time serued most f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this sort, and very well accompanied, especially with

that by all meanes possible he could deuise, he sought how

counterfeit and dissimulation, that so (vnder this pretext) he
might the more easilie induce the good Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople

And as he had suddenlie thus determined, as suddenlie did
he put it in execution, not hauing any companie with him

and poore estate, through diuersitie of religions which there
he suffered. And this oftentimes is cause of the intire ruine
and desolation, of the very greatest Monarchies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
yet left he the rule to one of his bretheren, a

young man, voyd of exper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nce in such high affayres. And
albeit hee was apt to armes, and a good knight in triall of
his person: yet had hee not sence and vnderstanding, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
the helme of so huge a vessell, as was the monarchie
of Persia. Thus was the Sophie not assured of his suffien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and but that his head was troubled with amorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
he would not haue reposed any such trust in him: but
let it be, he did it by indis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>retion, or else for more assurance
of his secret departure, not thinking his voyage would be so
long as afterward it prooued, suffice it he did not wisely, as
you shall perceiue by the discourse following in the historie.</p>
               <p>Hauing committed this poore kinde of order to his very
greatest affaires, he departed in equipage as ye haue heard,
riding many dayes and nights together, vnder cléerenes of
his meruailous shining helmet, without finding any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
worthy the writing, and passed thorow diuers Citties
of his owne kingdom, vnknowne of any one, and made such
quick expedition, as he came to the vtmost merge of Persia:
where finding a Barque readie to depart, in few dayes hee
landed in the desert of Arabia, and from thence by great
trauayle, not without enduring sundrie hazards and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
on the way, he reached the countrey of Palestine, still
carryed on with the inward remembrance of his loue, as he
little regarded whether he rode right or wrong. Being thus
arriued in this countrey, he entred into a Forrest thick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
with trées, which contained many mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es both in length
and breadth, wherein he had not ridden any long while, but
he met two pilgrimes conferring together: the one of them
being young of age, and endued with very singuler beautie,
for his haire was yellow like wyers of gold, and the prettie
downe on his chéekes and chin was of the same couler, in
his face like wise stood the liuely couler of the Rose: his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was neither great nor smal, but indifferent euery way:
his broad ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was garnished with Scallop shels round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and Medialles of gold and siluer, intermingled with
<pb facs="tcp:2883:12"/>
little pilgrime stones of Iuorie very artificially framed: his
Cassock and hose was of fine linnen cloth, and at his girdle
hung a little bottle, wherein hee had both wine and water,
according as he had occasion to vse them, and in his hand a
staffe piked at both the ends. The other pilgrime was an
old man, the haire of whose head and heard was of reddish
couller, griz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led among with many white haires, his visage
drie and withered, and tand with blacknesse almost like a
Moore, flat nosed, the tooth standing in his head very vgly to
behold, of very euill fauour was he and disposition: his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was grosse and short, big bulkt before downe to the
girdle, and on his back arising mountaine: his garments
were of old besmered lether, all ragged and torne, and his
hat (in stéed of shels) was garnished with skales of some
young Tortoise: his Medailles were of saffronned lead,
where among stood little staues of the bones of dead beasts.
The Sophie drawing néere them, saluted them very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouslie,
and addressing his spéech to the younger man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of whence he was, whether he went, and wherfore
he was disguised in that sort, considering that his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
deliuered him to be a man of other qualitie then his
garments made shew of: and if I be not deceiued (sayd the
Sophie) you are discended of some noble linage, and are a
man likewise of no meane valour. Sir, answered the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime,
if ye will somewhat slack the pace of your horsse, and
(withholding his bridle) make him goe according as we do,
if likewise ye will vouchsafe such patience, as to heare my
discorsiue answere to all your questions: I shall satisfie ye
concerning the matters enquired, and beside acquaint yee
with other things, whereat yee will not a little meruaile.
Beléeue me, said the Persian king. I am very well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and I thinke my horsse would gladly ease his pace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while:
then the pilgrime thus began. My Lord, because
I perceiue both by your wordes and behauiour, that you
are a man more accustomed to commaund then obey,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:13"/>
I would intreat yee not to be offended, if talking familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
with yee, perhaps I haue indiscréetly said, that to listen
what I conceiue worthie of meruaile, you should enforce
your Stéed to a more gentle pace, that happily would run
so fast as he could, according to the weightie affaires of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
you goe about: which hardlie will permit yee to
stay my discourse, being (in regard of your selfe) not so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
hearing as I estéemed, but rather may yéeld yée more
discontent then pleasure. If then I haue offended héerein, or
shall do by ouer tedious circumstance: I beséech yee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
I was not well aduised, which in respect of my submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
may the more easily be pardoned. Well, well, quoth the
king, vse no more words concerning me, but answere what
I haue demanded: for were I not so desirous to knowe, I
would not shew my selfe so inquisitiue, and if your discourse
be worthie the hearing, as you haue sayd, it cannot be too
long for me to listen, or displeasing any way, but verie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
               <p>First then (quoth the Pilgrim) you must vnderstand, that
albeit in this estate you behold me, yet am I discended of
noble linage, for my father beares the title and crowne of a
king, and my mother was sister to the puissant Emperour
of Constantinople, a man that (for his manifold vertues) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
to be highly estéemed and accounted of. In whose
Court, both in my youngest age, and since the time of mine
infancie, I was carefully nourished and brought vp: vntill
the houre I receiued knighthood, which is no long time
since. Notwithstanding, after I began to enterprise my first
exploites of good or bad fortune, trusting more to the
strength and dexteritie of my body, then reason would I
should, for a proofe or triall what I could do: I was so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
one day, to goe in person alone, to aduenture on the Den
or Caue of Rock Alpine, and there assayled the horrible Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<hi>Ferclaste, Androfort</hi> and <hi>Ergoferant,</hi> by whome I was
vanquished, and long time kept as prisoner there very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserable.
<pb facs="tcp:2883:13"/>
For after I had a great while endured the fight
against <hi>Androfort,</hi> without suffering him to gaine the verie
least aduantage ouer me: the cruell <hi>Ferclaste</hi> came treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
behinde me, and gaue me such a weightie blowe on
my helmet, as layde mee well néere dead at his foote: and
strange it was that he tooke not my life from me, as my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
much boldnesse had deserued. But as the Glead snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vp a Chicken in her talents, so almost dead, and with
like facilitie, did he graspe me vp, carrieng me into a streict
and darksome prison: where I endured such miserie and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
as hardly could a humaine creature suffer the like, by
reason of the woundes I had receiued in the fight, which
with the hard enterteinment they gaue mee beside, (being
bloodie enemies by nature, and men in whome no naturall
compassion harboured) was insupportable. An hundred
times they would haue put mee to death, if I had had an
hundred liues for them to tirannise on, but that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the grace of God, and his sonne crucified for the
redemption of man, on whom incessantly I euermore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
was still my succour and comfort: and their brother <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goferant,</hi>
a man of more milde and gentle nature then the
other were, did all that possibly hee might, to preserue mee
from death. Neuerthelesse, the crueltie and rigor of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wherein I was so strictly detained, was such, as I knew
not whether I liued or no: but the Almightie, in whome
continually I trusted, taking compassion vpon my miserie,
casting downe his eye of pittie, sent to deliuer mee out of
this captiuitie, by an vnexpected helpe, as I shall declare
vnto yée.</p>
               <p>First giue me leaue to tell yee, that one (without the
knowledge of any man) arriued in the great Emperours
court of Constantinople, a young knight, so beautifull as an
angell in all perfections: yet no one there knew him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did himselfe know who were his parents, but sayd hee
was sent thither by a Fairie named <hi>Ozyris,</hi> who from his
<pb facs="tcp:2883:14"/>
infancie had nourished and brought him vp, likewise of her
he receiued horsse, armour, and all things else beséeming a
young gallant that sought the order of knighthood, without
which it was not lawfull for any one to meddle with the
search of aduentures, or to attempt exploits of armes and
chiualrie, whereby renowme and honor was atchieued, and
religiously obserued among the professors thereof. I will
not trifle time with particuler discourse, how well shaped,
lustie, and faire his horsse was, caparasonned so rich and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as all the beholders much admired thereat: it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in one word to tell yee, that neuer was séene in the time
of our memorie, a young man, who in countenance, aspect,
and assured behauiour, could promise more louely déedes of
armes, and galliardise of person, then he did: nor was there
any one, whose eyes could be glutted, or hart satisfied with
looking on him, imagining that hee was sent from heauen
by the grace of God, to do some act of memorie for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Empire, as it was not long before it came so to
passe. For he who by the aduise of the Fairie was thus sent
to the court, to require of the Emperor his order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
after he had humbly intreated it at his hand: with
great honor was it giuen him, and all the worthie obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereto belonging, the most diuine and faire princesse
<hi>Porphiria,</hi> daughter to the Emperour, girding on his sword:
in the dooing whereof (a thing worthie noting) the sweete
Roseate rednesse in her chéekes, suddenlie changed to such a
liuely vermillion hew, that they which before imagined no
addition could bee made to make her more beautifull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she contained such an absolute perfection, by this effect
were drawne to a quite contrary opinion. For she séemed
such as the Knight himselfe did, vpon whose front sat an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
boldnesse, with a countenance immooueable, blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with such a swéete grauitie, as if some alteration had
suddenly entred his thoughts, and that present affection had
surprised him, which (as I learned of such, who take héedfull
<pb facs="tcp:2883:14"/>
regard in like occasion, and therefore marked this the more
na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rowly) proued so in deede. The morrow after this young
youth was made knight, for proofe of the exteriour valour
that seemed to be in him, the Emperour feasting and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
him accordinglie: gaue him to vnderstand of the
manstrous and inhumaine giants <hi>Ferclaste</hi> and <hi>Androfort,</hi>
who too much iniured and oppressed the whole countrey.
This hardie new knight, presently determined so go com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

with them, desiring to atchieue by the price of his blood
and perrill of his life such immortall praise: withall, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
his thankfulnesse to the Emperour, for the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
he had doone him, whereto he was bound by all meanes
possible he could deuise: not being ignorant I warrant ye,
that the power of a mightie enemie was not so much to be
feared, as the fauour of so great a personage was to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
and maintayned.</p>
               <p>Being then secretly departed from the Courte, to put in
execution this faire enterprise, such was his happie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
after a long, doubtfull and dangerous fight, wherein
he endured more paine then I am able to rehearse: that he
got the victorie of the Giants, killing two of them, and the
third he tooke to mercie. This déed which I haue discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to ye, was of greatest honor that euer was heard of in
our time: and the Emperour hearing thereof, was driuen
to no little admiration, especially when hee vnderstood the
certaine trueth in deed. It is reported, that these newes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blazed abroad in sundry countries, as indéed they were
in mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> knowne places of the world: that the great Sea it
selfe was sore troubled, and the greatest part of the forrest
of Ardene was distraunched, and the rest of the Trees stood
halfe rent in sunder, without any honour of their former
verdure. The great flood of Egipt ouerflowed the banckes,
and left the common course where it was wunt to glide,
being so furious and outragious: as the people of Egipt
were more then halfe part drowned, and the whole land so
<pb facs="tcp:2883:15"/>
couered with water, as many were forced to endure famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
others (with conceit of greefe) dyed presently. For my
selfe, I can hardly be drawne to credit these reports, because
such insensible things cannot be mooued by any so great a
meruaile: I rather coniecture, that this came from some
Poets of those times, who (as Painters doo take an auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
licence, to iustifie by their writing and painting what
neuer was) to make the more ample discourse of this déed so
full of admiration, did set downe the historie in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer it was, to come againe to my purpose, I
know it well, and that for a certaintie, that the knight ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vanquished the Giants, and annihillated all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that he came to deliuer me out of that accursed prison,
wherein I had beene so long time enthralled. And when hee
vnderstood that I was named <hi>Pharisor,</hi> a knight of some
fame, and Nephew to the Emperour: most kindely hee
came and embraced me, suffering mee to doo the like to him,
by whom I had receiued so great a benefit. Then began I to
remember (according as I had often times heard talked of
before, and that by no meane personages in times past,) that
we should account the day of our desiuerance from any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
bondage, much more happie then the daye when
first we were borne into this world: because from the day
of our birth, we g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but on the day of our deliuerie, wee were restored
from such a feare, as we neuer need to stand in doubt of any
more: thus are we no lesse bound to the cause of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,
then to our parents from whom wee receiue life.
And beere vpon wee contracted together such an intire

be compared with my affection to him. For albeit by vngen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fortune wee are sundered the one from the other, the

greefe and sadnesse I endure for his absence, hath constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me to disguise my selfe in these habillements as yee sée,
thus barefooted as I am, to goe and visit the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre,
wherein was buryed the precious body of the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the world: to which place I am bound, by a solemne
vowe long since made, to giue him hartie thankes for my
deliuerance, and with great deuotion and humilitie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
that it would please him I might soone recouer and

               <p>As thus the young Pilgrime continued his discourse on
the way, they came to a place in the Forrest which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
spatious and plaine, in the midst whereof stood a great
thicket of meruailous high trees: and there they heard such
a clanching of swordes vppon armour, as all the whole
forrest ecchoed therewith, which caused the Sophie and the
young pilgrime direct their course thither ward, to see what
it was: but as for the olde pilgrime, so soone as hee heard
the noyse, he set foote forward more speedie then the winde,
to seeke some corner where he might hide him. And there
will wee leaue him, and proceed with the Sophie and the

to the plaine, where the noyse caused him
forsake his way, to know the occasion of
that hurly burly: beheld two Knights, of
more then common stature, being armed
<hi>capape,</hi> who fought very violently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to sley each other. The one of them
was more mightie of body then the other, because hee was
of monstrous and Giantlike composition: but in dexteritie
of armes and valour of courage, he went not so farre beyond
his enemie, but that the greater part of the day was spent,
yet little aduantage was gained on eyther side. For if the
Giants shield were battered in pieces, his body wounded,
and his strength much diminished: the knight with whom
he dealt had likewise his armour sore mangled, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
iniured in many places, from whence the bloud issued in

there, they were vpon the point to pause a breathing while,

being vnable to withstand each other any longer, so were
they ouertrauailed with a sharpe and dangerous conflict,
which as it had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so was it still to continue betweene them.
The Sophie, without enquiring the cause of their debate,
or speaking any word to the knights (for he was meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
proud and arrogant) allighted from his horsse in great
hast, and went to vntie a goodlie faire horsse, which he saw

about to do it, being somewhat to néere the horsse, he smote
him such a violent stroke with his héele vpon the shéeld, as
made him tumble along so amazedly, that hee lay a good
while ere he could recouer himselfe againe: and had not his
sheeld beene of some temper indéed, he had not liued to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of his hurt. But the goodnes of the mettall saued his

which was to take and beare the horsse, that so highly liked
him: as well for the beautie and likelihood of goodnes to
be in him, as also for the necessitie he was in of one at that
time, his owne horsse being ouer much wearyed with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.
When the two Combattants perceiued what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
they cryed to him, that he could not carry thence
the horsse so easily, without buying him more dearly with
the price of the combate: and that if he did not forbeare and
let the horsse alone, he should by them be well beaten, as his
boldnes did deserue no lesse.</p>
               <p>The King of Persia hearing these hardie menaces, was

presently toward them, with resolution to deale with them
both, striking first at the Giants legge with such force, as if
he had not quickly clapt his shéeld before, he had cut it quite
off at that blowe: But the Giant who was readie at armes,
as any man of his qualitie in those times, to defend this
stroake thrust forward his shéeld, the greater part whereof
<pb facs="tcp:2883:17"/>
was pared away with the blowe, and laide on the ground,
which the other knight perceiuing to whome the Persian
addressed him selfe, aiming at a part of his body, which he
sawe was bare by losse of some of his armour: but he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the thrust, gaue the Sophie such a mightie stroke on
the Creast, as had it beene any other Helmet, beside this
meruailous one and not to bee equalled, as before I haue
told ye: he had cleft his head downe to the shoulders, but of
such soundnesse was the helmet, as certaine sparkes of fire
issued thereout, not receiuing anye other harme by the
stroke, whereat the Giant not a little enraged, sayd, that
to him alone appertained the chastising of the Persian
king, and not to any other: because he had receiued the first
stroke at his hands, and besides, himselfe was the more able
man for the combate. Likewise, quoth the Giant, to mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
the defence of the horsse, and not to thee, as thou

shall chasten this rusticall fellow, who thus ventured to
trouble vs, when I was vpon the point of giuing end to our
strife, and thylife together: whereto the knight Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
thus replyed.</p>
               <p>I know well Giant, that commonly the people of thy
sorte are mightie and strong, by reason of theyr great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
beyond other men: but withall, they haue much
lesse courage, valour and vertue, then presumption and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie,
as at this present I may gather by thy wordes
which I finde to be more hautie and proud, then either thy
<pb facs="tcp:2883:17"/>
strength or dexteritie to armes is, albeit (without shew of
fainting) thou hast doone thy best to vanquish me, and neuer
dealt I with any one, that held me harder tack then thou hast
doone, since the beginning of our combate, at the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I am certainlie perswaded, that I shall remaine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour:
as long ere this I had beene, if this knight had
not béene our hinderance. And therefore the correcting of
him appertaineth to me, and not thée, as hauing more
right to the horsse, the shéeld, and the Cup, the prizes of our
combate, then thou hast: thou oughtest therefore to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
thy selfe, and leaue the fight alone to me, otherwise I
shall be enforced to set my selfe against thée with him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to offend thée the more. Much rather had I a thousand
times (answered the Giant) to fight against ten such as thou
art, then to giue thée such an aduantage: such is the small
estéeme I make of thée. These words were no sooner ended,
but the Sophie and the knight ran both vpon the Giant:
the one to hinder him from dealing alone with the Sophie,
and the other to beare away the horse, and alay the pride of
the Giant.</p>
               <p>Soone after, the Sophie and the Giant (for the same
intent) put them selues against the knight, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
(without kéeping any order among them) the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and the knight fought against the Sophie: by meanes
whereof, the combate was of as long continuance as disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
betwéene them, which was very pernicious and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for them, had it not béene that the young pilgrime,
who but newly arriued there vpon this confused bickering,
and séeing such an vnruly manner of fight, as in all his lyfe
time hee had not séene the like, sharpe, rigorous, and cruell,
on each side, and one or other must in the end beare away
the woorst: he aduentured to seperate them with his staffe,
but the blowes fell so thick, that it was quickly cut in thrée
péeces, which when hee sawe, and doubting greater harme
might happen to him: hee was enforced to keepe aloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had the better: sauing that the Sophie séemed more fresh
and lesse we aryed then the other, but at length, with the
consent of the Sophie, who had as then least need of all, they
sundred themselues to breath a while, when the young Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime
thus bespake them.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it were a great losse, if thrée such knights of so
great valour, and endued with hautie resolution, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you all are, that it may be iudged your equals liue not
in the world: should perish so miserablie, as I know you
cannot but finish your dayes in this combate begun, onely
through want of due order to be obserued among ye, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such reasonable connsell and aduise, as might be giuen
yée. Already haue you spent most part of the day, yet no one
of yée can certainly make vaunt of any aduantage ouer his
enemie: neither (for ought I perceiue) dooth any one of yée
know which is his aduersarie, nor against whom he ought
especially to direct himselfe: for sometimes two beares
themselues against one, and then that one ioynes with one
of the two against the third: in continuance of which most
kinde of fight, it cannot be but all thrée at the last will mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
end their liues: so that no man shall be able so say
which is the conquerour, or who beares away the honor of
the combate, whereby your intent was to merit commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
but now on the contrary yee shall get no praise at
all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather bee esteemed as insensible and misgouerned,
whereas well yee wot, that reputation and accompt is the
principall guerdon of noble and valiant knights, that make
profession of armes. Thus shall your parents if ye haue any
be gréeued, your freends will be waile your mishaps, and
your country, that challengeth your vttermost endeuours,
will lament your wilfull losse, beside the sorrow of such as in
distresse receiue succour by vertuous knights. Rather should
each of yée take one of those launces that leanes against
<pb facs="tcp:2883:18"/>
yonder Tree, and trie the fortune of the Ioust one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
till it may bee séene which shall bee dismounted, and
then to pursue the combate afterward, when the third may
aduenture as he sees occasion. Thus shall the victor be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and who is woorthie the honor of the field, when hee
that paused while the other fought, may enter the Lists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the conquerour: but if yee continue in this order ye
haue begun, the greater will be your daunger, and all three
will foyle themselues thorow choller and ouer-weening.</p>
               <p>Thus spake the Pilgrime, and the Combattants (after
they had rested a while) creditting his councell, and liking
well of his aduise: tooke each of them a Launce, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on their horsses to begin the Ioust, whereto the readiest
were the Giant and the knight, against whom he fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the comming of the Sophie, who could not so soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his horsse, because he had strayed aside, and was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
alone by himselfe in the Forrest. In meane while these
two ran fiercely against each other with their Launces, and
met together with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urie, as when two billowes of the
sea méet violently, when the winde carryeth them contrary
to their course, and then breakes them aloft in the ayre with
a most terrible murmour. The Launces being shiuered in a
thousand pieces, flew like a fire thorow the ayre, and theyr
horses being shrewdly hurt with méeting their shoulders to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
brake their girts, cruppers, and their other capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and tombled along on the ground with their maisters,
each hauing the saddle betwéene his legs: making such a
terrible noyse with the fall, as the ground trembled and
shooke more then a mile about the place: and they, hauing
theyr Shéeldes battered, and theyr sides mortally wounded,
lay in a traunce vpon the earth, without moouing either
hand or foote, but as though the life and soule were parted
in sunder. Whereat the Sophie abashed, began not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

when the one or other would ryse and vrge the combate:
<pb facs="tcp:2883:19"/>
and séeing neither of them stirre, he ran to the place where
the horsse was tyed, which they combatted for. But séeing
he was not there, and could not tell what was become of
his Squire likewise, he followed a path that led further into
the Forrest, which when he had trackt a long time, not mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the two strong and puissant knights, that fought the
Combate in the Forrest. And how he tooke away perforce
the great Lycocephall from a Damosell, that made a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

one of the wounded knights vpon his horsse, the succour
which he gaue him, by conducting him to a place, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
might be giuen to his wounds. What the old misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Pilgrime was, and the speech he had with the mightie
Giant Squamell: how hee found the Tree whereof the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime
told him, and what happened to him. Wherein may
be seene, what chastisement foolish and ouerbold women
are woorthie of, that misprise and disdaine the seruice done
for them, and with what punishment their ingratitude is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times recompenced. Then by the young and euill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Pilgrime, and the succor they gaue to each of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

accompaning the good, and the other the wicked.
They that are guided by vertue, some matter of woorth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

the end.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw began it to were darke, and the heauens being
couered with obscure clowdes, declared to humaine
<pb facs="tcp:2883:19"/>
creatures, that the houre of their rest drew neere: when
the great king of Persia, hauing long sought the proud and
goodly horse <hi>Lycocephall,</hi> and perceiuing that he could not
finde him, determined to passe that night vnder a Trée in the
Forrest, for hee was so tyred and wearyed with going on
foote, that he could hold out no longer.</p>
               <p>Beeing thus armed as he was, and couched on the gréene
grasse, he had not line there any long while, but hee heard a
feeble voyce, which he gathered to be the voyce of a woman,
lamenting very gréeuouslie, vsing these or the like kinde of
speeches. Alas most miserable that I am, in what place or
part of this darke vast Forrest may I méet with him, whose
absence brings to my desires more obscure gréefes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes:
then this black comfortlesse night, or this place so
hideoue presents to mine eyes. Alas thou hardie and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
knight, the most faire and agréeable to my heart that
the earth beares: in what nooke art thou hidden that I
should not sée thée? I haue the eyes of my remembrance so
open, as all the obscuritie of this night cannot hinder me,
but that I could and can behold thy image and resemblance
before me: but to touch and hold thee according as I wish,
my misfortune and thy crueltie dooth forbid me. Aye me, if
heeretofore when thou soughtest for me, I was any thing
offensiue to thée: pardon me I intreat thée. Pardon me (O
Loue) thou mightie God of heauen, if in thus dooing I haue
offended thy maiestie, that now I should bee woorthie of so
seuere punishment. Tell mee faire horsse, tell mee I pray
thée, where hast thou left thy noble maister? I am deceiued
if thou be not the beast he so highly estéemeth, and on whom
he was mounted the last time I sawe him. How happens
it that thou art thus strayed from him? and what is the
cause thou hast forsaken him? But foolish that I am, speake
I not to a beast, which hath no more habilitie to answer me
then hee who is not present whome I so dearely looue? O
vnkinde, peruerse, and detestable fortune. O vnhappie
<pb facs="tcp:2883:20"/>
                  <hi>Lucinda,</hi> what deitie hath coniured against thee, to make
thée so miserable: as hee that looued thée when thou didst
disdaine him, should now hate when thou féelest &amp; estéemest
more of him then thine owne selfe, thine eyes, or thy heart?
Ah <hi>Lucinda,</hi> mischaunce follow thée <hi>Lucinda,</hi> a Princesse
most vnluckie and vnfortunate, thy mishap may well befall
thy freend, because he flyes from thée now when thou séekest
him. These lamentations in such sort pronounced, as if they
had beene vttered out of the hollow of a Rock: or the strokes
vpon an Anuile: that euen as the fire softneth waxe, so
must it haue beene some <hi>Hircanian</hi> Tigar, or some vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
deuouring Lionnesse, but would therewith be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to pittie. But the Sophie, who was so proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as possible might be, was not any thing mooued at all:
but hauing by the cleere light of his Helmet discouered a
young beautifull damosell, that held the goodly horsse by
the bridle, went presently to her, and giuing her a rude
thrust, tooke awaye the horsse from her: whereon being
quickly monnted, he rode to séeke his Squire, and the waye
which guided him the day before. And riding part of the
night by his lightsome Helmet, by this rough encounter
and vnmanly iniurie, the damosell remained greatly asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished:
yet recouering courage and spirit, she followed him,
and a hundred times she called him théefe, robber, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous
knight, vnwoorthie to ride on such a horsse, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thencefoorth to weare armour on his body. And hauing
breathed foorth a thousand such like hatefull spéeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. Canst thou (quoth she) inhumaine as thou art,
thus vndeseruedly wrong me? thou maist liue to sée the day,
that thy Lady shall despise thy teares and intreats, as now
thou disdaynest and makest small account of mine: and let
a more cruell shaft, then euer Cupid bare in his Quiuer,
wound thée thorowly, to bring thée into the middest of most
violent flames, and then vtterly to consume thée to cinders.
But of all these spéeches the Sophie made no reckoning,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:20"/>
but held on his way, as I told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee before, where we will
leaue him, and the disconsolate Lady in the Forrest: whose
mishap may well serue as an example to young damosels,
that beeing sometime beloued with true and sincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hold such kindnes in contempt, and oftentimes make
scorne of men of great valour, who merit better fauours
then hatred and disdaine: which in the end they knowe so
well how to reuenge, as they shall repent and bemoue their
estates more miserablie, then did this Princesse, of whom
we haue made mention in the former Booke, and whom ye
now behold consounded with folly, discheneled running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the fields, hauing forsaken the king of high <hi>Misia</hi> her
father, to meet the strong and puissant Giant <hi>Squamell:</hi> who
thus badly recompenced the seruices she did him, by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
hazards wherein shee aduentured her life, onely for his
looue. Let Ladyes then bee carefull, least they fall into any
such inconuenience, and so making like proofe, there ensue
like punishment: for they are better taught, that learne to
be wise by others harmes, then they that fetch wisedome out
of their owne follies. So comming againe to our historie,
we will speake of the two knights, whome wee left halfe
wounded to death in the Forrest.</p>
               <p>The Historie speaking of them, saith, that they both reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from their traunce, the one so soone as the other, and that
the Giant was he who first espyed the Sophie to be gon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
caried away the horsse with him: wherefore all woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as he was, he ran presently (as he had béene mad) into
the Forrest, wherein when hee was but a little entred, hee
met the old pilgrime wee spake of before, who ran thither to
hide himselfe, when hee heard the noyse of the combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
the Giant and the Knight. This was an old Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer,
that could foretell to passengers their good and
euill fortune to come, and knew by the lineature of theyr
handes, till what age they should liue, and what day, what
houre, by what aduenture, and howe they should dye.
<pb facs="tcp:2883:21"/>
He knew by heart all the bookes of the <hi>Sibelles,</hi> of <hi>Circes,</hi> of
<hi>Medea,</hi> of all the old liuing Magitians, and the Magitians
of former times. And because he knew that the Fairie <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyris</hi>
was his aduersaire, and the greatest enemie in the
world to his charmes and enchantments, likewise that she
had greater skill and knowledge then he, and specially that
for his ruine, and such as he loued, she had nourished the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
knight the cause of our historie: he had opposed by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticharme
this strong Giant <hi>Squamell</hi> and his brother, who
by theyr owne nature were endued with most high prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse:
yet notwithstanding by deuillish subtiltie hee preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them still from death, and to them oft times he gaue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and supernaturall strength. So that knowing him
to be in quest of his horse, his shéeld, and other aduentures,
and chéefely, that he earnestly desired to haue the enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Cup, whereof he sometime had heard great report: hee
had put them all into the custodie of this strong Giant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
withall incited and perswaded him in a dreame, that
he should combate against the most puissant knight on the
earth, and so set downe (as prizes for the conquerour) the
sheeld, the horse, and the Cup, whereof wee haue spoken.
Heereupon hee should holde open Ioust to all commers and
goers in the Forrest, causing the Forrest to bee commonly
called <hi>The Forrest of great Aduentures:</hi> and alreadie had he
performed many fayre exploits, by meanes whereof he was
much renowmed thorow the world, and very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arre were
his deedes talked of: wherevpon the knight (so hardly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
came to combate with him, of whom heereafter we will
speake more liberallie, as also by what aduenture, and for
what reason he was thither conducted.</p>
               <p>But now let vs a little while speake of the Giant, who
séeing the olde man, of whome hee had no more knowledge
then if hee had neuer seene him: because hee could disguise
himselfe in diuers sortes, as now he did in the habit of a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime,
to deceiue such great numbers as passed that waye,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:21"/>
and as he had deceiued <hi>Pharisor,</hi> if the meeting of the Sophie
had not preuented it. The Giant at the first sight of him
began to be somewhat afrayd, seeing him looke so vgly and
hidious: but the old Enchanter that very well knew him,
began to reason after this manner.</p>
               <p>Most generous and puissant knight, as this day liueth
not thy like vnder heauen, who now being mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
doost trauerse this darke forrest of high aduentures:
stay thy selfe, and forbeare (if thou be wise) to run thus as
thou doost, to finde and recouer what the destinies will not
permit thée as yet. And if thou art not enemie to thy selfe,
but hast regard of thine owne life, heare and credit my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and doo as I shall presently direct thée: concerning
what I say vnto thée, who I am, and for what cause I am
so carefull of thée, the effect shall acquaint thee withall.
Know then that I am the old and auncient Necromancian
<hi>Charonifer,</hi> father to great <hi>Minofoll,</hi> of whom (it may bee)
thou hast sometime heard some spéech: such as thou nowe
seestmee, haue I liued and reigned more than a thousand
yeeres. It is in my power to make the black night a fayre
and bright day, and the fairest day againe to make the most
darkesome night. I can make the Moone and all the starres
to discend from heauen downe to the earth, by my charmes
and enchauntments: but a woman of great wisedome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
hinders me from dooing what I would. Iknew
thy graundfathers, who were great kings and Monarches
on the earth. I haue seene to my ioy, the mightie <hi>Horfella</hi>
thy mother, who (in her life time) was very deere to me, and
whome I looued as mine owne life: for of thy forefathers

<pb facs="tcp:2883:22"/>
So that for your aduancement, I haue dayly preserued yee

to your destinies) you were readie to fall: but by
mine arte I haue preuented all inconueniences, which I
perceiued were threatned against yée. And namely, let me
remember thée of the deuillish spirits that were in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell
of the Enchanteresse <hi>Melanda,</hi> which could not be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thence but by one of the best knights in the world: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Combate thou hadst with them, by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lady whom thou seruest: then maist thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bee mindfull, of the great sorrowe and vexation thou
wert to endure, before thou couldst vanquish them, and from
which (for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ertaine) thou couldst not haue escaped without
death, but onely by mine arte and by my meanes, which
succoured and defended thee: for there did I so handle the
matter, that in the end thou didst obtaine the victorie, as thy
selfe doost very well knowe: and nowe againe thou art in
farre greater daunger of death, if thou doost not as I shall
say vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Goe then and follow the path which now thou treadest,
thorow the forrest, vntill that hauing many times turned
by my circle, made in manner and forme of a Laborynth,
thou perceiuest thy selfe to be in the middest thereof, where
thou shalt see a great Trée, straite as any Ceder, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
had braunches, leaues, nor fruite, since first it sprang
from out the earth. In that tree thou shalt behold a doore
open, which notwithstanding is now so fast shut, as no one
can discerne that euer it hath beene opened, neither shall
such as come néere it, sée it, except it please me: those onely
whome I will, shall perceiue it, but others that by chaunce
light vppon it, shall imagine it to bee a huge great Rock,
wherein is a strong Caue, full of Lyons, Tigars, Beares,
and other sauage and cruell beasts. But see that boldly thou
enter thereinto, and discend lowe vnder the earth by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
stayres, which thou shalt finde made expressely for this
<pb facs="tcp:2883:22"/>
cause: and when thou art discended an indifferent waye,
thou shalt finde a floud, the water whereof runneth so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently,
as the flood is very fearefull to behold. Uppon this
water thou shalt sée a black Barque, furnished with oares
and sayles, necessarie for conueyance to the place where I
make my continuall abiding. Enter boldly into the vessell,
enter as thou art, without dread of any thing, and coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy selfe therein, keeping thy selfe alwayes beneath,
and thy mouth fast closed, remooue not at all: for from
thence vppon the flood (which continually runneth downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
shalt thou bee brought to a place, where thou shalt
receiue helpe for thy mortall woundes, for in very déed thou
art somewhat daungerouslie wounded. Afterward thou
shalt be aduertised what is expedient for thée to doo, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
glorie and reputation among the Gods, that make their
aboad in the inferiour part of the world: and if thou doost
other wise then as I haue tolde thee, thou canst not any way
escape the death.</p>
               <p>If the Giant were amazed at the first beholding of this
olde man, no doubt hee was much more now, hearing his
wordes, and yet was it more meruaylous then all the rest,
that when he had concluded his spéech, there appeared in his
place a flame of fire, which béeing conuerted into smoake,
was carryed héere and there thorow the ayre, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
left of any other thing, which caused the Giant to
stand along while pensiue, without aduenturing on any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
an indifferent space: but after hee had considered
with himselfe the wordes of the old Magitian, he gaue credit
to them, and determined to do as he had willed him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the losse of his bloud from foorth his wounds, made
him feele his strength to diminish very much, and a very
great weaknesse conquer all his body. In this determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he put himselfe vppon the way, to finde the Tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

<pb facs="tcp:2883:23"/>
He (as writes the Historian) being come to himselfe againe
so soone as the Giant, could not yet arise so readily, for hee
was of a more weake and soft complexion. Which <hi>Pharisor</hi>
(who had béeneah eye witnesse of their encountring) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding,
went to him, and hauing vnlaced his Helmet, saw
that his visage, which naturally was faire: was now so
spent and discoulloured, as one could perceiue nothing of
his wunted perfection. Héereat he began to greeue, for hee
was of good nature, very pittifull and succourable to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and séeing the knight complained verye much of his
woundes, which made him now feele a dangerous and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

could. And séeing that still his bloud wasted in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he bound vp his wounds very handsomly. When the knight
féeling more ease then he did before, and that his vigour in
better sort encreased: he intreated to be mounted vppon his
horsse, which he did by the helpe of <hi>Pharisor,</hi> who leading the
horsse by the bridle, guided him by sundry pathes thorow the
Forrest, séeking where he might finde any village or house,
or any one that knew howe to cure the knights woundes:
with kinde comfortings and other fréendly spéeches, he thus
conducted him along the forrest, when the night being spent
at their entrance thereout, they came to a very great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion

of some house: which made the fayre pilgrime to guide the
horsse that way. But hee had not gon much ground, till hee
sawe the Knight giue a signe of falling from his horse, for
he was suddenly surprised with the trembling fit of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame

to the pilgrime, who tooke him from his horse in his armes,

swoune againe: wherewith <hi>Pharisor</hi> was so troubled, as
fearing he was néere his death, hee layde him along on the
the grasse, and bound againe his wide gaping woundes.
Then taking him in his armes, hee got vp on the Knights
horse, and so caryed him before him ouerthwart the saddle:
and hauing long ridden that way as he beheld the smoake,
there ensued as you shall heare in the following chapter.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2883:24"/>
hoping in that place to méete with some one that could giue
remedie to the knights wounds: for very great care he had
of him, because of the bountie and valour he had discerned
in him. But drawing néerer to this long expected place, hee
thought his hope would be deceiued, by reason he sawe it to
be but a little lodging, couered with Reedes and Rushes,
in which he could not be perswaded to finde what he would.
This made him halfe minded to change his way to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

abide there. Resoluing thus, he discended from the horse, and
brought the knights body before the doore of the house, which
hauing thrust open, he saw an olde man, with his head and
beard as white as snowe, sitting before a little pan of fire,
chafing his bloodlesse and withered vaynes, and reading in
a booke which he held vppon his knee. The good olde man
was somewhat astonished when he sawe the pilgrime, but
much more when he beheld the Knights halfe dead body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and reuerence, yea, with more regard, then if he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>Father, for that thy white head and beard, with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable

their frequenting) induce the good to doo ill, whereby they
incurre the wrath of God and his indignation: where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
hee regardeth with a chéerefull eye such as doe

lead a life austere and full of solitude, to temper
and appease (by these meanes) the violence of inordinate
appetites and euill desires, whereby they are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
and prouoked to doo badly, enclining rather to vice
then to vertue. If thou haue any humanitie, and art not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

the shippes of the Giant <hi>Squamell,</hi> with them that

their goods and treasure, where he heard tidings of his horse

and made the Seas vnfit for passengers) were ceased, not for
any longer abyding there.</p>
               <p>Heerevppon, he commaunded the maister of the Ship to
launche out a Squiffe, whereinto hee entred with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and his Squire: desiring the Knight, whome hee had
saued from shipwrack on the Sea, as yee haue heard, which
was he for whose méeting he enterprised this voyage, to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the Ship for the safetie thereof, and to hinder that
the Pirate which brought them against the aduentures
and forces of <hi>Nabot</hi> and <hi>Squamell,</hi> should doo them no more
iniurie, or flie away with the Shippe which hee had gotten

or lingering. The knight, who had learned all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seignes,
the occasion of his searche, and other aduentures,
promised to fulfill his request: so vnder this promise going
on shoare, he was somewhat abashed, to sée a place so great
and spacious, to be so desert, barren, and comfortlesse, for he
could not discerne one Tree, where vnder he might take a
little repose: which he not a little desired, because hee was
crazie and ouer much wearied, with his long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Shippe on the Seas, whereto hee was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and in soothe it cannot but bee yrkesome and
<pb facs="tcp:2883:28"/>
tedious, to such as are not acquainted with that kinde of
trauaile. So finding a little path on the port where he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he kept on his way, to see if wandering further from
the Sea, which was inhabitable by the sterilitie of the place:
he could finde anye bush or shadowed plot, where hee might
rest awhile and take the fresh ayre. For the countrey of it
selfe was naturally enflamed with extreame heate, and the
shade of the ship which he had so lately left, was likewise
hot and troublesome to him. But when he had gon about the
space of a mile, hee found himselfe so ouercharged with his
armour, which till then hee alwayes had worne vppon his
body: as he was constrained thorow the extreame weight
be felt thereof, to disarme himselfe, hauing desire to walke
longer time, and more at his ease, vntill he could sée some
place conuenient for him to rest in. And as <hi>Geliaste</hi> his
Squire was beginning to take off his armour, perceiuing
that hee must beare this heauie burden on foote, hee thus
spake to his maister.</p>
               <p>In sooth my Lord, this Armour dooth so well become ye,
as no heat (me thinkes) should cause yee to disarme your
selfe: for in mine eye, séeing you armed by me, I see Saint
<hi>Michaell</hi> the faire Acchangell, leading me with such securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
into paradise: as all the deuils in hell cannot get me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands: you are so proper and of so goodly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when you are armed, as ye cannot méet any Lady vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the way, but presently she will become enamoured of ye.
And it is no small thing, to gaine the loue of faire Ladyes
that may be met withall: for such a one she may be, as is
not to be refused. To others likewise you séeme so redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as there is not a beast in all the world, but beholding
you approching, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> farre enough from yee. Whereas
if ye vnarme your selfe: I am afraide I shall bee driuen to
trie the goodnes of my legges, which were my great sorrow
if any thing should so happen. It seemeth when you are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that you were brought into this world, and fourmed

armed, and made expressely to beare this ornament. If God
had béene so gratious to me, as to haue made me of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and propertie, as that I had béene borne to weare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
I would neuer make my selfe naked thereof for any
other clothing, notwithstanding the greatest heate that
might be, but he hath not made me apt to beare such honor,
or any way to defend it. If I carry it in mine armes, and
any one méete me therewith, hee will say: that I am some
Iugler, so decked to make the world laughter and pastime.
And therefore (my Lord) I beséech yee credit my councell, to
suffer your Armour still on your body as it is: for what
know ye may suddenly happen, and what but your armour
can do ye seruice. As for me, these armes will not serue me
to doo any thing therewith: because I know, as I haue bin
a little instructed, that from my birth I should be but faint
hearted and a coward. Whereto the knight, who knew wel
his squire spake these wordes but to make him merrie and
pleasant: smyling to himselfe, thus answered.</p>
               <p>My freend, I pray thée carry no such dismay in thy minde,
as to vaunt whether I am armed or vnarmed: for I rather
doubt this will make thée become ouer courragious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

as I ought to doo, but rather haue kept thee fasting wursse
then in the time of Lent. Therefore onely do as I command
thee, carrie mine armour: and thou shalt sée, we shalbe as
merrie afterward, as now, and that no furious beast dare
venture to make thee trie thy legges.</p>
               <p>My Lord (quoth <hi>Geliaste)</hi> I am most constant in obeying
your commaund, yet doo I esteeme it a much better aduice,
that I should weare your armour on my body, for the more

requireth this which I saye, because there is no other
difference betweene vs: for wee are both men, and as you
haue beene armed, so am I nowe at this present, doone by

the selfe same honor, and much more then I can doo to you,
when you are as I am n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in bad case: and thereof ought honor be doone to armes, and
to such likewise as beare them. Certainly (quoth the knight)
<hi>Geliaste</hi> my good freend, there is too much sophistrie and

when you goe, I goe: when you are on horsseback, I
am not on foote, and when you are on foote, I am not on

               <p>Continuing these speeches, with diuers other to passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the time, as the Knight was highlye contented with
this pleasant kinde of arguing: they followed still the path
that had conducted them from the Sea, and were come now

Bushes: this gaue him some hope, that there hee should

his thirst, which pained him greatly, and shaddow sufficient
<pb facs="tcp:2883:30"/>
to take the frew ayre, and rest himselfe as he had some néed.
Here vpon he continued his way thither ward, and beeing
there arriued, was glad hee had found the thing he desired.
For this place was round enuironed with great goodlye
Trees, where vnder was a most pleasing shade, and in one
part thereof was a most fayre cléere fountaine, the sourse
whereof was engirt with a daintie sweet spring, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whereof contained three acres of ground. The grasse
was there so greene and cheerefull as possible might be, and
cheefely there, more then in any other part adioining: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Knight greatly meruailed, and without care of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
after any other particuler occasion, but contenting
himselfe with the naturall fertilitie of the place, proceeding

beholde, and mounting on a higher part of the ground, to

                  <p>How Gerileon being at rest, and sleeping in the wood neere the
fountaine, which he had so fortunately found: was awaked
by his squire, to heare the pleasing lamentable voyce of a
Lady, that did sing there hard by, which hauing vnderstood,
he intreated the Lady to sing the same Song againe. The
talkes which the Lady had with him, during which time,
there came vppon them an horrible cruell monster, called
the sauage Polippe, wherewith Gerileon began a fierce and
daungerous fight. From whence may bee gathered, that

THe good and vertuous knight <hi>Gerileon</hi> remained a
sléepe, according as you heard in the end of the former
chapter, about the space of two houres: but <hi>Geliaste</hi>
could not sleepe so long, because in his slumber he dreamed
that he heard a swéet hermonie, wherein his thoughts tooke
very great pleasure. So that when he awaked, he plainlye
heard what he dreamed on, no imagination, but a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
voyce singing a song. He heard a femenine voyce, very
swéete and mellodious, which sang with pleasure to the
eare, yet pittifully in regard of her cause, a song in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
language, the substance whereof héereafter followeth.
Nor was there any humaine heart that heard it: but as it
would haue beene highly pleased, so could it not choose but
compassion would haue mooued it. The Song was thus.</p>

               <p>Alreadie six times together had the voice sung this song,

yet had heard nothing: but the seauenth time, as the song
was halfe finished, or at this place where we haue paused,
he well vnderstanding both the words and sence: arose, and
awaked the knight that slept, saying. My Lord, I pray yee
take your armour, for I imagine you shall finde some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
heere, that will incite yee to the combate. As for
me, I shall not, because I haue bound your armour so long,
as I am wearyed therewith. I pray yee this once stand in
my defence, and fight for mee and in my place: because I
finde my selfe so spent with choller, by reason of the greefe I
conceiue at the Ladyes song which ye heare, that if I should
lay hand to my weapon in this rage and agonie: I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
I should kill my selfe, which I should be very sorry to

(quoth <hi>Gerileon</hi>) thou hast reason to be so carefull of me, and
I take it in very good part: but what Song is that thou
tellest me of? and wherefore hast thou awaked me? Listen
a little my Lord, quoth the Squire, and you shall heare

exquisite beautie, as yet the feature of her countenance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered:
but the long languishing solitude, which as it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
shee had no little while endured, had so extenuated and
chafed awaie her perfection, as she séemed nothing in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

made her séeme lesse beautifull than indéede shee was, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
men of iudgement may easily conceiue, that
were she reduced to her wonted plight, shee would appeare
more excellent than euer she did. The knight beholding her,
began to reason and talke with her, as thus. Faire Ladie,
(quoth he) I wish that once more for my sake you would sing
the song, which not long since ye did, for you haue a voice so
swéete and agréeable, that in hearing yee, I conceined excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great pleasure. Or if you thinke me not of such desert,
yet at the least doe me the fauour to sing it againe, for the
loue of <hi>Phynander,</hi> him whom you haue so great desire to sée.
The Ladie was somewhat abashed when shee hearde the
knight speake, especially when shee behelde his wonderfull
beautie: then came to her memorie, that this was he she had
so many times séene in her sléep, combatting against the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
sauage <hi>Polyppe,</hi> and of whom she had heard the faire <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyris</hi>
speake: wherevpon she chaunged sodainly into a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million
colour, like a fragrant gilleflour, when with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
voice she thus aunswered the knight.</p>
               <p>If thou art not he that must bee the cause of my deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
I praie thée friendly knight, for the youth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which I beholde in thée, and whereof I haue verie great
compassion, staie not héere to listen my singing. For it may
so fal out, that if once more thou giuest eare to my song, thou
wilt receiue more displeasure, than therein thou tookest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and contentment. But without further expence of
time in questioning wherefore, I pray thée (whilest it is yet
permitted thée) to be gone spéedily, and with the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
thou canst possibly vse, out of this place, assuring thy

the same. For thou must knowe for certaine, that if while I
sing, the sauage <hi>Polyppe</hi> ariue héere, he will kill thée though
<pb facs="tcp:2883:32"/>
thou hadst an hundred liues. Therefore I counsell thée as
thou louest thy life, to get thée gone from hence as soone as
thou canst.</p>
               <p>I neuer feared (quoth the knight) the thing I neuer saw,
nor whereof I euer heard anie spéech, therefore you labour
in vaine in perswading me to flight, I rather imagine that
you vse these wordes, to excuse your selfe in the request I
made vnto you.</p>
               <p>The Ladie would haue spoken something more to him,
but sodainely came a swift foule whistling with her wings,
and flying hard by where the knight stood, pearched her selfe
in one of the highest trées about the dungeon. At the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whereof the Ladie was so ouercome with passion and
feare, that her tongue stood as fast bounde in her mouth, in
such sorte, that shée (not hauing the power to speak anie one
worde) was constrained to withdrawe her selfe farther into
the denne, tourning her backe towardes the knight. Uppon
this accident <hi>Gerileon</hi> hearde a greate and fearefull voyce,
which without customable order, made a meruailous noise,
lyke vnto the bellowing of a Bull, when he is strayed from
the troupe of kine that he conducteth. Then presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the bushes entered the cruell and fierce sauage, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dead béefe vppon his shoulder, and in one hand he helde
two other deade béefes, intending with this prouision to
make his supper. The aspect and forme of him, at the first
sight, made the knight somewhat dismayed, for hee was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
all the bodie and face with long shagge haire, as black
as a coale, and no manner of white appeared about him but
his téeth. The eyes in his head were lyke fire, hee was of a
Gyants stature, and right before his nauell he had the head
of a dragon, verie hideous and vgly, with a greate mouth,
whereout appeared two mightie long hooked téeth, sharply
pointed, and verie dangerous. On his necke he bare a great
staffe, made in the fourme of a mase, wherewith hee was
wont to take and kill both men and beasts of all sortes. So
<pb facs="tcp:2883:33"/>
soone as he espied the knight, he presently layde downe his
load, and taking his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to laie at the knight: who seeing the vnaccustomed furie of

which when his maister had, hee ranne to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the hole where he had seene the Ladie. The Sauage
leaping to the dungeon, which was as large as it was high,
first smote at the knightes head with the staffe, from which
to shield himselfe, he turued with such dexteritie and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

he stood firmely against him, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

all red, and his eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(as it were) to issue out of him.</p>
               <p>This happened not to him of himselfe, but by the succor

fearefull resemblance, thereby to weaken the vntonqueta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

with his swoord to cut off the monsters head, who espying
the blowe comming, ranne fiercely vpon him, and grasping
him about the bodie, stroue to ouerthrowe him, or by his fast

most cruelly he bit him by the vpper parte of his thighes, his
armour for that part not auailing him, but the two crooked
téeth entered quite thorowe. The knight fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cut off his arme, albeit it was couered with rough and harde
haire, which was of great defence for his bodie, but that the

well on his head, as on other partes of his bodie, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured

of his Mistresse. The second was his feare of his squire,

him so deerely, as he could not sleepe, vnlesse he were assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that his Squire was as well as himselfe, such was the
care he had of him. The third, which was no lesse hurtfull
to his body, then these other twaine were to his minde: was
the great paine he felt in his thighes and shoulders, by the
téeth and clawes of the monster, by meanes whereof all his
body became enflamed, by reason of the venim wherewith
the nailes and téeth of the Sauage was infected. Heereby

               <p>My sweete friend, within these two houres am I come
hither, guided by the channels of vnder-ground, from
whence these waters ascend to this place: euen from the
Pallace of the Nymphe <hi>Ozyris</hi> thy Nursse, whome I serue
and reuerence, shee louing thee extreamly, as well thou
knowest. Hither am I come from her to preserue thee, and
to tell thee withall, that if thou suffer me not to embalme
the wounds on thy body with this precious vnguent, which
she expressely commaunded me to bring in this golden bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
thou beholdest in my hand: thou art in very great danger
of thy life, so that thou canst hardly escape the death, if thou
continue in this estate but till to morow morning. Therfore
disdaine not to discouer where thy wounds are, that I may
put in execution the command of my lady, wherto I dare in
<pb facs="tcp:2883:35"/>
no wise be disobedient. I may not (quoth he) faire <hi>Olympia,</hi> &amp;
my friend, refuse the succour of my most deare <hi>Oziris,</hi> nor of
thyselfe likewise, for albeit the necessitie wherin I now am
did not incite me to take it, yet the obeisance which I owe
both to the one and the other of ye, marie more great to the
mistres than to the seruant, commands me to obey all that
you can command in a knight. So saying, he discouered his
woundes to the Nimphe, who applyed to them the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ointments in the golden bottell: which was no sooner
spread vpon them, but presently he felt no paine at all, and
became immediatly as whole and sound, as if he neuer had
béene wounded. Hereof was he not a little ioyfull, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasing,
colling and kissing the Nimphe more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

him: he often enquired of the health of her Lady, and the rest
of the companie, and chéefely if she had receiued any charge
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, to tell him what issue the combate should haue which
he had begun, whether he should be the conquerer, or himself
he brought vnder and vanquished. Enquire not at all gentle
knight (answered the nimphe) what shall happen to thée, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this combat, or any other enterprises, wherein thou
art to hazard thy life: for it is not lawful that mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
should know things to come. Only be thou of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and take no gréefe of the multitude of trauailes, which
thou must procéed in. Let it suffice that I say to thée in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
howbeit I néed not specifie so much before hand to thée:
that thou art destined to vndertake &amp; finish before thou diest
many hautie enterprises. And of all them to behold the end,
it behooueth thee to endure much to expose thy self to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thousand dangers and perilous hazards: especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou canst know who is thy father, or maist behold the

Therefore I say God be with thee, to whom I recommend
thée, desiring him to guarde and preserue thée from all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

vanished suddenly before him, he not séeing her, till she came

himselfe néerer and néerer, to throwe a violent blowe on
the braue warriour, which (notwithstanding all his subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
could not hurt him. For hee beheld the weapon aloft,
wherewith the knight verily thought to spoyle the Sauage:
but the blow missing the aymed intent, falling to the earth,
entred more then halfe the length of the sworde thereinto,
which he being vnable presently to recouer, was left desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

               <p>Heerevpon, he smote fiue or six strokes with the pommell
of his sword on the Lyons head, for otherwise hee could not
reach at him: and with such woonderfull puissance were
these blowes deliuered, as he brake the scull of his head, and
made his two most hurtfull teeth fall out of his mouth, the
bloud likewise gushing foorth in great aboundance. When
the Lyon felt himselfe so grieuously wounded, fearing least
woorsse should befall him: endeuoured all he could to auoide
taking and getting farre off from the knight, forbare to
turne againe as he did ere be came to those assaults: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Gerileon</hi> felt himselfe much eased, for the beast pressed
him in such fort, as hee was well néere sweltred and out of
breath. Thus continuing still the combate in extremetie of
furie, the rest of the day was spent, when the Lyon at one

stroake thinking to finish the combate: let driue a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
blowe at the knight, who foreséeing his mallicious
rage, carefully regarded least, hee should abide any more
gripes, and therewithall deliuered him such a stroke on the
crest: as he was compelled to stagger backward, yet not to
giue ouer the fight, when lifting vp one of his pawes, hee
thought therewith to rent away the knights helmet: which
<hi>Gerileon</hi> perceiuing, preuented him with such a sound salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as made him fall to the ground very weightily: then
redoubling an other couragious stroke vpon his head, cleft
it in the middest, the one halfe whereof (with the right
chéeke and braines) fell to the earth. At this instant the Lion
changed his shape againe into the likenesse of a Beare, that
halfe breathlesse and ouerspent with trauayle, fled into the
Caue againe, and there hid himselfe.</p>
               <p>The knight well contented to pause a while, went from
the Den, and returned to the place where he might rest all

féeling no anguish or paine at all, saue onely that his bodie
was wearied very much: being ouercharged with sleepe, he

                  <p>How the cruell Polyppe came againe the third time

Howe afterwarde hee entered combat with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hauing vowed not to rest or sleepe, till he had

the end of their combat, and what perplexitie (after

From which things may be gathered, what labour
a good and vertuous man endureth to conquere
sinne, when hee beholdeth the frailtie of his owne
nature, that would make him sleepe in faire resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

what trouble and busye care hee hath to ouercome

               <p>Now about two houres after the Knight had begunne to

both within the Caue and euery where without. The Bird

and rising vp tooke his Helmet, looking euery where

But no where could he perceiue the dooer of this deed, only
he heard the <hi>Polyppe</hi> turmoiling and rauing on each side, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Unhappie that I am, to sleepe so long in this place, where I

séeing hauing now found them, I make so slender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

deuoire bids me wake and do my dutie. High time then is it
for me, by meruailous diligence, and chiualrie, such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séemeth
a man of vertue and account, to amend this fault:
whereon I sweare, that I will neuer sleepe or take any rest,
till I haue slaine this mutable and inconstant monster, that
disguiseth and changeth himselfe into so many shapes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
and depriue me of life by an ouer long lingering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
Hauing thus spoken to himselfe, he lightly stept aloft
to the large den, wherein was the lothsome kennell of the
sauage, whom he found in such manner and forme as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
I haue told ye: to wit, in the likenesse of a Beare, excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
meruailous in greatnesse to behold, yea, more then I

you would haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would haue imagined when he opened his mouth, that there
ye beheld fire &amp; flaming brands, when his teeth shewed like
glowing red fire hookes, and were of such greatnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
as he could not containe them within his mouth, but
were seene out on each side the length of more then halfe a
foote. All his body was couered ouer with very long hayre,
vnlike such as other beares haue, his clawes were great and
sharpe, &amp; his skin was of such proofe, as it could not be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thorow to the flesh, as the knight well perceiued at the
very first stroke, which hee deliuered at him so soone as he
came to the Caue, &amp; with such force did it fall vpon his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as the sworde hauing sliced away a great quantitie of
the hard harsh haire: hee might see it fall on the ground, but
no hurt at all was doone to the flesh. For the weapon grated
vpon the skin, as the noise of a file vpon hard mettall, when
it breaketh through the place where it enters: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the monster felt some paine hereby, for he was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
smitten, but he braied aloud so horribly, as he was heard
<pb facs="tcp:2883:40"/>
more then ten miles from the place. This could not withhold
him from running on the knight, against whom he so bestir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe, as he fastened his two feete about his necke so
rudely: as the knight had no meane to hurt him, or defend
himselfe. Then with his teeth he would haue bitten him by
the throat, in which place if he had wounded him, he had bin
dead though he had an hundred liues. But the knight fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeing
the danger well enough, got the shéeld from his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
right before him, where against the monster could not
any iot preuaile, because he could fasten no hold thereon, so
the knight stood wholy couered therewith. Now striue they
to throw one another down, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Gerileons</hi> strength against
the <hi>Polyppe</hi> was to small purpose, such was his wonderfull
and vnmeasurable power: on the contrary, the monster so
roughly shooke the knight, as if he had not had more agilitie
and skill, then force, at the very first offer he had bin cast: but
he vsed such nimblenes and sleights, in succouring that part
where he was most in danger, and containing himselfe still
firmely on his féete: as the beast thus contended with him
more then an houre, and yet could get no other aduantage.
In the end hauing incessantly tormented himself in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
so long time, he (for al this) made him measure his length
on the earth, euen as the mightie huge Pine trée, long labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

it is hewen down, stand quaking and trembling with feare.
Euen so the valourous knight, making a fearfull thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
with his armour, fell so weightily on the earth, as the
marke of his armes, his helmet, braces, &amp; print of his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
remained engrauen on the ground, he being also sore
astonied with the fal. The beast that wonderfully laboured
for this aduantage, vnable to containe himselfe on his legs,
fel also vpon him very fiercely: yet the knight was not so lost
<pb facs="tcp:2883:41"/>
in his sences, but that he tooke speciall guarde, how thus ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his back, he might bestowe some hurtfull wound vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the beast, hee made him glad to leape from him hastily, in
which leap taking vnaduised heed, he fell with such weight
vppon his owne head, as he became in a traunce with the
fall. This gaue the knight libertie to recouer footing againe
when aduauncing himselfe to this sauage disguised Beare,
he gaue him so many strokes with the sharpe keene edge of
his sword: that a great part of his body séemed to be shorne in
like sort, as when a cittizen is barbed or polled by a yong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentise
Barber, vnskilfull in his occupation, his head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

when he saw no little gutter of blood was drawn from him
he grew into exceeding choller, when presently he beheld the
beast come vpon him with wide open mouth, to get hold of
him by some mortall morsell: for since the rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

new shape, he had not yet receiued any great harme, which
made him run likewise at the monster with the sword point
and seeking to pierce it in at his mouth, by entring further
into his body or head, deuised how to take away his life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him: but herein he was deceiued, for the monster féeling the
sharp weapon in his mouth, held it with his teeth more hard
then the stéele it selfe, in such sort, that if the knight who (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what might ensue) had not quickly xecouered it thence,
he had broken it in many peeces. But he rather intended to
suffer the monster to take hold on him againe, then to lose his
weapon and be a naked man, wherof if once he were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
hee then knew that he could not escape with life. The
beast hauing thus fast seazed on him, wounded him with his
teeth so cruelly on the right arme, as he well pierced quite
thorow: wherby the knight felt such pain, as if his arme had
bin pierced with hot yrons, such was the venim of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
téeth: this anguish prouoking <hi>Gerileon</hi> to anger, made
him thrust violently with his sword at the belly of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> beare,

but it was as hard as the rest on his bodie, notwithstanding
he still laboured that place with thrust vpon thrust, till hée
had the skinne there so soft and tender, as at last the swoord
passed in a great waie. Now began the sauage to be so mad
and fierce, as snatching at the sword which was in his belly
with his téeth, brake it in the midst and then getting foorth
of the knights power, tooke his former shape of the sauage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ranne to hide himselfe in his denne, as before hée
was wont to doo, when he thought himselfe to be depriued
of life, leauing nothing in the knights hande with the péece
of his sworde, the breaking whereof did not a little grieue
him. Neuertheles being so couragious and magnanimious
as possible a man could be, he chéered by his spirites, hoping
that night (which alreadie was come vpon him) to imagine
some meane whereby he might victoriously escape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

this, as all fearefull doubts were now vtterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and so he went from the caue, to the place where hee
was accustomed to take his rest the nightes before: where
being set downe, he opened himself to view such wounds as

precious ointments that were brought him by the Nymph

helpe, in that he receiued no wound on his bodie but it was
mortall, and which (without the vnguents sent him by <hi>Ozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>)

For it is sayd, that a thing spoken in choler and vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly,
remaineth without effect: because till the humour
be past, he hath no perseuerance to knowe what he sayd. In
like sort if I binde my selfe by oath to doe a thing impossible
for humane power, mine oath yeelds it selfe as vaine and
vnprofitable, because of the vncertaintie of future euents
and successiue affaires: in which case to be quit of mine oth,
it ought not suffice that I haue done my endeuour, and all
possible I coulde to doe what I haue vowed, albeit for the
greate difficultie of the thing sworne, I farre differed from
compassing it in such sort as I tooke mine oath. But howe
now? quoth he sodainely, why séeke I reasons to excuse a
matter sworne, where there is none to be admitted? I haue
vowed to God, then can it not bee that mine oath is vaine:
for breaking of such an oath, is a thing that verie weighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chargeth the conscience, and God is the onelie punisher
of so great and greeuous an offence. For before I swore,
I might verie heedfullie and aduisedly regard what I doe,
and the fault committed by folliie is as punishable as that
done by aduise, in that all faultes are committed willinglie
and by knowledge: in that God hath giuen reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the compulsion of anie one to cause mee sweare, séeing then
I began thus willinglie, it followes of necessitie that I kéep
mine oath inuiolable, without any breach whatsoeuer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Nor ought I seeke anie cauils whereby to excuse my
selfe, for none at all is to be allowed, in that a man of vertue
making profession of honour and armes, ought to keepe his
vowed faith, with all other matters belonging to his oath,
euen so dearely as his proper life: lesse then which wee
ought not to esteeme our conscience and our honour, both
which in me I should account greatlie iniured, if I shoulde

Then came another opinion into his head, to laie a greate
deale of wood on the mouth of the caue, and putting fire ther

would now make proofe if hee could do any thing with his

rodoubled with his Cimetarie such a stroke on the knights
sheeld, as cutting of a great part thereof, it fell to the ground,
very hardly escaping the arme that held it, but no more
harme or offence happened as yet. On the other side, the

the couragious knight bestowed such an other greeting on

<pb facs="tcp:2883:46"/>
when eche recouering himself, a great many violent blows
were dealt betweene them, as it would haue required a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

victorie. But in the end <hi>Gerileon,</hi> being highly offended the
combate endured so long, within him called vppon God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
deuoutlie, desiring him to strengthen his present stroke:
and then lifting his staffe with meruaylous hardinesse, the
blow fell so peisantly on the monsters buckler, as made him
amazedly turne three or foure times about, during which
time he redoubled such an other stroke vpon him, as broke
the back bone of him in sunder, with all the ioynts of his
neck, the bloud streaming from foorth his mouth in great
aboundance, likewise out of his eyes, eares and nose, so that
with the losse of this bloud, hee lost life and all together,
though he might discerne as he lay vomitting, how with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged

made a great lake in that place. Nor can I compare his fall

               <p>Ladie (answered <hi>Gerileon</hi>) riches and treasure are no

the execution of dangerous exploits of Armes: but an
earnest affection to do good, and bringing to passe such things
as are pleasing in the sight of God: as is shortning the liues
of the wicked, that ordinarily commit a thousand cruelties,
displeasing to his maiestie. Nor am I ignorant, that among
men of honor and vertue, I shall beare away more account
and fame by the effects of this affection, then should I bee
possessed of massie heapes of riches, the greedie desire wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

And this is my assurance, that thus I shall obtaine more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie

repute the déed to bee of so slender valew, in regard of your

still dismaied her heart, and this inward dismay, greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and changed her beautifull complexion, making her

greatly to meruaile heereat, and withall stood as amazed,
when be beheld the vnlooked for companie of a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
so néere him, fayre and of good grace, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
this loouely change in the Lady: nor did he take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
iote displeasantly, though with a smiling and debonna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
countenance, the young Gentleman approached néere
to touche her, saluting her with a swéet kisse, humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and kinde embrace, expressing his inward affection
and goodwill, which immediatlie was pursued with amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and gentle spéech to <hi>Gerileon,</hi> full of gratulations and
thankfull courtesies, as well for his deliuerance, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
there present, where to when the knight had kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
as he was not to learne his court-ship, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ran and embraced the Lady in such sorte, as they are
wunt to doo, that haue béen long time without the sight and
company of such as they extreamely loue and affect: and she
like wise, as finding no small ease heereby to her amourous
flames so strictly bound the Gentleman in the circle of her
armes, ouercome with loue and intire affection, as if he had
not had more discretion then the Lady, fearing least <hi>Gerile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
would be offended at these ceremoniall actions of loue:
I thinke they would neuer haue sundered till the worlds

behauiours, (which neuerthelesse were performed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
and comely) winding himselfe (though loth) from the
anchorholde of his ioye, brake foorth in these spéeches to the

Ladie. Swéet Mistresse, I heard that you made a promise
to this knight, to whome both you and I remaine so highlie
beholding, as you ought not delay any longer time, but to
reueale what ye haue promised: aboue all things be so good
as your woord, and obey whatsoeuer he shall please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
yee: being assured that hee will command no other
thing, then what shall be agreeing with honor and honestie.</p>
               <p>My good Lord and fréend, answered the Lady, I doubt not
but this woorthie knight will pardon me, if I be a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
of my dutie towarde him: considering the sight of
you rauished my hart with such ioy, that if euer he knew to
loue, and what his conquering passions are: he will rather
referre the fault to his power, then to any disgrace or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie
on my behalfe committed.</p>
               <p>At these words <hi>Gerileon</hi> sighed and changed couller, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to kindle againe within him by this new touch or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
the liuely amourous flames which not long
since tooke beginning in his youthfull brest: and so much
the more they encreased in him, as hee stroue to couer and
dissemble the same, which the Ladie and young Gentleman
well enough perceiued, albeit they made no shewe thereof,
tearing to displease him to whom they were so greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted.</p>
               <p>In this time <hi>Geliaste</hi> came foorth of the Caue, quaking
and trembling, which made the knight so glad (fearing hee
was dead) as he forgot some part of his late remembrance:
for next to his Ladie, hee intirely looued his Squire, and
would not lose him for any thing in the world. His comming
causing pleasure and content to them all, they went further
from the Caue, and laye downe in the shade vnder a great

<hi>Diegonde,</hi> was in his younger yeares a most accomplished

yeares mariageable, called <hi>Pollyda.</hi> This Ladie, beside her
excellencie of beautie, could cunningly twist, spin &amp; sowe, as
is most proper to women, likewise she was well instructed
in good letters and the liberall Artes: in such sort, as she was
able to disgrace the most wise and studious Philosophers
<pb facs="tcp:2883:49"/>

               <p>By reason héere of shee became so proud and audacious,

worthie to ioyne with her in mariage, and therefore despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

durst enterprise to demaund the question, no, not the great

the king my father was extreamly offended, yet left

and cunning in these affayres, where hee thought
strength and manhood might happen to fayle, hauing to
deale with such mightie and puissant aduersaries.</p>
               <p>In this determination, vnderstanding that the great
king <hi>Belligande</hi> of Gaule had a Launce, the yron poynte
whereof was so inchanted, as all such as were touched ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
should bee dismounted: eyther by sleight or force hee
resolued to be possessed thereof, imagining which of these
meanes were lykest to speed, and to aduenture both rather
then fayle of his intent.</p>
               <p>To bring about this stratageme, he went with all speed
into the realme of <hi>Gaule,</hi> where beeing, hee heard that in a
Forrest appertayning to that kingdome, dwelt a certaine
man, which termed himselfe a knight, but commonly hee
was called the cunning Théefe: and so subtill was hee in
robbing, as nothing could escape his fingering, and all his
<pb facs="tcp:2883:50"/>
attempts were so artificially compassed, as such as had lost
any thing, or were otherwise robbed, presently the blame of
their losse was imputed to him: he likewise séeing each one

and pollicies, tooke great pleasure therein, and oftentimes
would sit solemnly smiling thereat.</p>
               <p>To this man the king my father foorthwith trauailed,
and promised him very large summes of money, if he could
rob the king of this enchaunted Launce, which he so safelie
kept in his Cabinet, as it was thought impossible to get it
thence. The cause why hee held it with such vigilant care,
was for the loue of a fayrie named <hi>Oziris,</hi> who thereof had
made a present to him: hoping withall hereafter to leaue
it to a sonne of his, which as yet was but a very yong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.
Notwithstanding the great difficultie consisting in
this busines: yet in respect of the large summe of money, the
théefe promised to deliuer this Launce into my fathers
hand, as he did the day after my father had this conference
with him, but first he thus bespake him. Knight, quoth he to

               <p>My father liked well of this councell, and (to make short)
it came to passe euen as the theefe had before deuised: for
the king of <hi>Gaule</hi> hearing the defiance, and weening that all
my father tolde was true, made no doubte of giuing the
Launce into his hand, and my father being possessed thereof
while the king of Gaule went to put on better Armour:
both he and the cunning theefe departed, so that none could
tell what was become of them. The king and all his Court
(at the first tidings hereof) was greatly abashed, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
soone after the cause of this theft, and who was
the inuenter of this pollicie: it was made but a merrie iest

                  </gap>idie to so great a Prince. So
what thorow loue and pleasing spéeches, as also force and
frowning countenances, in the end she yeelded to his wyll.
But this was after the Lady had had conference with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and excellent Fayrie, named <hi>Ozyris,</hi> who had beene
greatly helping in her birth, endowing her with manifolde
vertues and riches of spirit, for which she was not a little
commended: and after the decease of her mother, Sister to
king <hi>Barachen</hi> of Scotland, she had sometime nourished her
in her rich inuinsible palace, which was in the realme of
great Brittaine, and euer afterward shee perswaded her,
that she should not marie with any liuing man, which was
the cause shee helde so aloofe from this aforesaid marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>After she had well schooled her concerning this matter,
the noble and vertuous Fayrie sayd, that in respect children
by the diuine lawe) ought obedience to theyr parents, and
it was her fathers will she should match with the king <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde,</hi>
who alreadie had doone so much for her looue, and
was euen readie to despaire if he fayled thereof: shee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
her not to withstand her fathers appointment. And
although in former time she had diswaded her from mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
it was because she discerned by her skill, that such issue
as discended from her in mariage (if shee fortuned to haue
<pb facs="tcp:2883:51"/>
any) should haue hard hap, and prooue very vnfortunate,
which would be such gréefe both to her husband, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of theyr youth would bee spent in greefe and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuenesse.
Notwithstanding, if this marriage must néedes
be accomplished, she promised to vse the matter in such sort,
as by this coniunction she should neuer haue child. And so
found she meanes to comfort them sufficiently, as heerafter
yee shall vnderstand the manner how, without iniurie to
the beautifull <hi>Pollydon:</hi> but my father (by himselfe and his)
should féele the euill and misfortune, whereto yet she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
a day of finall conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Princely maide giuing credit to hir propheticall
speeches, was greatly comforted and satisfied, and so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to marie with the king my father: after which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
once knowne, soone was hee sent for by the King
<hi>Dorino,</hi> when with great pleasure and content to euery
one, he espoused <hi>Pollyda,</hi> with her he liued more then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares, yet could he haue no issue by her, which so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him, confounding his thoughts with sadnes and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
as the most part of the time he eat his bread in mone
and teares: for I imagine it a meruaylous hart breake to
a man that desires to liue after his death, and perpetuate
his memorie by his children: to sée his mariage consumed
without any generation, that might make mention of him
when he is dead. And such (heerefore) was his intire conceit
of gréefe, as oftentimes he meant to repudiate his Queene
<hi>Pollyda:</hi> but such againe was the woondrous loue he bare
her, fearing to offend God, and displease king <hi>Dorino</hi> her
father: as hee was still diswaded when such thoughts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
his fantasie. All this likewise the Queene very well
noted, and notwithstanding her former despisings, yet after
her marriage she loued him exceedingly, pittying his gréefe,
but shaddowing her owne so much as possibly she could, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by all meanes to remedie both, as in the end she did, by
the aduise and counsell of the wise <hi>Ozyris,</hi> who euery daye
<pb facs="tcp:2883:52"/>
and in all places assisted her, perswading her to doe as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
One of her wayting Damosels, whome my father
vsed good countenance towards, because she was of perfect
beautie, being named <hi>Olympia,</hi> daughter to he Duchesse of
<hi>Terciede,</hi> a chaste and prudent dame: with her the Fayrie
aduised the Queene, that my father should haue dalliance.
She following this councell, one night when the king my
father sent woord to haue her company in bed: so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
handled the matter, that this damosell lay there insteed
of her, for the maide was likewise secretly amourous of the
king, which was the cause, that (being where she would be)
she disliked not this swéet and pleasant deceit, but without
any shew of displeasure, shee gladly endured the kings pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
with her, séeing the Quéene was so well content to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord
her her place and priuiledge. To such effect grew my
fathers labours, who little thought he was thus beguiled:
as the Maide was conceiued with childe: when afterward
the Queene comming to sleepe with the King, sayd that she
felt her selfe conceiued, answerable to his so long desire, for
which good fortune hee should applaude the heauens, from
whence procéeded so great good to her. Héereof was the king
my father glad, thinking the Quéene had tolde the trueth
indéed, as within short while after, he minded to goe on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
to pray at the holy Sepulcher of Iesus Christ, and
returning thence, to visit Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Galicia,</hi> at each
place to thanke God for this fortunate euent.</p>
               <p>Beeing thus resolued, one day hee secretly departed in
disguised garments (feigning some other excuse) to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
his intended voyage, in which time (beeing the space
almost of a whole yeare) it chaunced that the fayre <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>
was deliuered of me, to the great content and pleasure
of Quéene <hi>Pollyda,</hi> who nine moneths together feigned her
selfe with childe, though but meere dissimulation: and vsing
the Damosels deliuerance as her owne, gaue generally to
be knowne by some of her, fauourites and moste familiar
<pb facs="tcp:2883:52"/>

owne bodie. And to the end this mysterie might not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
the wise <hi>Ozyris</hi> tooke to her inuisible Fairie house
or Pallace, the faire <hi>Olympia</hi> my mother, where euer after
she continued of selfe same nature as her other nimphes and
faires, among whom at this present she is most beloued, as
I certainly knowe by such reuelations that her selfe hath
showne me. Now the king my father being ignorant of all
these things, was so glad when he returned from his voyage
to sée me growne to a prittie porte or stature, and that the
Quéene was not sicklie or felt such paynes as other do after
their deliuerie: as all his care now was for my education
and instruction, not onely in curious weauing and sowing,
but also of good letters, especiallie poesie and musique, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
my voyce apt and proper for singing.</p>
               <p>Héerein likewise did the Quéenes care agrée with his,
and so dearely did shee looue me, as if I had beene indéed a
braunche of her owne bodie: for neuer wente shee to any
place, but still I must accompany her, through which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
association, it happened one day among the rest,
that she would needes ride on hunting, a pastime wherein
she tooke excéeding pleasure. I being with her, the hounds
egerly pursuing the graue, and she chasing that things fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not according to her minde, roade so fast that wee had
soone lost one another.</p>
               <p>The space of a whole day almost, remained I thus alone
in this meruaylous great forrest, wearyed and spent with
séeking to finde my company againe, till at length by good
happe I came to a fayre and cléere fountaine, from whence
streamed foorth a swift gliding riuer, that made his course
quite thorow the forrest: where alighting from my horsse,
to rest and refresh my selfe on the soft tender hearbes that
grewe about the banckes of the fountaine, I had not long
sitten there in this sorte, but the fayre <hi>Olympia</hi> my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appeared in sight vnto mee in the habit of a Nimphe,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:53"/>
at whose sudden sight I was greatly amazed. But with her
swéet and gratious language, she deliuered my heart from
feare and dismaying, recounting to me (as in a dainty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
historie) the whole discourse of my birth, in manner
and forme as you haue heard, albeit somewhat more at
large.</p>
               <p>Moreouer she told me, how the mightie and skilfull Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<hi>Ozyris</hi> her Mistr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sse, had disclosed to her, that by the craft
and meanes of an old abhominable Necromancian, named
<hi>Charonyfer,</hi> should bee nourished a cruell and hideous mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
called the <hi>Polyppe,</hi> whose crueltie and puissance should
be doubted and feared ouer the whole earth. This beast, to
iniurie both her and me, should one day steale me from my
parents and friends, to keepe me in extreame miserie and
thraldome, vntill the best knight in the world, nourished
and brought vp by this Fayrie as her owne childe, albeit
extracted originallie from the best, puissant and most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
king aliue: should trauaile to the place of my imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and there by his prowesse and valiancie (killing the
monster) deliuer me out of captituitie.</p>
               <p>Beside this, shee tolde mee, that during the last seauen
yeares of my detayning and miserie, a young noble man,
brother to Quéene <hi>Pollyda,</hi> to hinder the monster from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me, should follow me to the place where I was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonned,
and there each day for six yeares space, changing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as many sundrie formes as the monster, should combate
with him for my libertie: yet all his endeuours would
prooue in vaine, because the monster was onely to be slaine
by the knight of the Fayrie <hi>Ozyris.</hi> And to let me know
when the last yeere of my miserie should ensue, she said, that
from the beginning thereof, the noble man (who loued mee
with perfect loue) should be changed into a Foule or Bird of
straunge sort, in which shape dayly would hee come to visit
and sée me, euen vntill the <hi>Polyppe</hi> were slaine, when hee
should receiue his manly shape againe, and the day of the
<pb facs="tcp:2883:53"/>
                  <hi>Polyppes</hi> death, should bee the finall extermination of my
miserie.</p>
               <p>After she had imparted to me all these things, she threw
foorth such a perfume of Poppie vppon me, as (from the end
of her discourse) I slept so soundly by the Fountaines side,
that I neyther sawe or heard when shee departed: and as
some while I continued in this sléepe, Queene <hi>Pollyda</hi> not
a little displeased for my losse, hauing with her traine
sought thorow the forrest, came at last and found me where
I slept, when gently awaking me, wee thence departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into the Cittie.</p>
               <p>Within a while after, it chanced, that by the aduise of
the king my father, and his Queene <hi>Pollyda,</hi> I was sent to
king <hi>Dorino</hi> my imagined Grand-father, who desired to
haue me néere him, because he verely thought me to be his
daughters childe, by reason whereof he wunderouslie loued
me. Hauing continued certaine yeares in his Court, this
young Prince heere present, named <hi>Phinander,</hi> youngest
sonne to king <hi>Dorino,</hi> and brother to king <hi>Dorian,</hi> that at
this day gouernes ouer the Spaniards, beeing equall in
yeares with me, taking me for so néere in kindered to him:
spent the time of his infancie with me, and I in like sorte
with him.</p>
               <p>Among these pastimes and sportes of children, it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that we became amourous of ech other, and that in such
manner, as we could not endure long without each others
sight: which loue each one imagined to growe by naturall
affection, that so neere kinne doe customablie beare one to
another, and the young Prince verily perswaded himselfe,
that the iouissance of our loue might not bee compassed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the prohibition of Christian laws, concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
betweene so neere kindred as we séemed to be. Héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
séeing him one day very sad and pensiue, being alone
in the Garden, I faithfully discouered to him the manner
of my birth, according as my swéete mother <hi>Olympia</hi> before
<pb facs="tcp:2883:54"/>
had tolde me: which highly, comforted him, causing both in
him and me farre greater affecton to each other, if more
might be then was commenced before. Our passions were
still worne out with honest sollace and pleasure, expecting
that the long delay of time should minister more intire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of our loues, according to the honest desire abiding in
eyther of vs: but both our hope and desire were suddenly
squandered, by a new and strange accident that immediatly
followed.</p>

entered the great hall of the Pallace with a most horrible

with spéed to get on theyr armour, and others to saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

to make choyse of mee, among all the other Ladyes of the

any stay, he ran ouer the land and sea, what of his owne
nature, and by the enchauntments of that curssed Magitian,
who gaue wings to his course: that in short time (astonnied
and néere hand dead with feare) he brought me to this place,
where euer since I haue remained in greefe and torments,
liuing the most part of this dolefull season, with raw flesh,
and other viands, sometime good, sometime bad, such as the

if he had fayled of his pray, or could not get it so conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb facs="tcp:2883:54"/>
as he would, I iudged that my selfe at last should haue
serued to slake his hunger. But at the beginning, my deere
mother <hi>Olympia</hi> so assisted me, and from time to time gaue
me so good councell: as (by many slight subtilties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions)
I appeased his anger toward me, euen vntill this
prince arriued heere: for yee must note withall, that from
the first day of my surprising, as I haue beene assured by my
mother, and since by him, that hee ceased not to followe the
monster, and to enquire the place of his adode, when (after
long and painfull trauaile) he found it: and one day when
the monster was abroad, hee aduentured to come sée and
speake with me, when I aduised him, as I did you, to bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gon,
least hee should chance to be taken or slaine by the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppe.</hi>
He giuing credit to my words, went to the king of
this country, who is the king of <hi>Assiria,</hi> a meruailons migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
courteous, and debonnarie knight, to whome making
himselfe knowne, and my misfortune: the good king (that
diuers times had layd ambushes for this monster, because
hee had ruined and wasted all this countrey, yet by no
meanes could be slaine or taken) caused an assembly of most

this deuill, and deliuer me from my miserie: but such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of all things. And to let yee sée that I speake not by hart, I

much to discouer, if I should recount each necessarie pointe
therto belonging, that ye may the more bréefely vnderstand
these high affaires: I wil shorten the discourse conueniently
as I may, reueling nothing but the very principal matters.</p>
               <p>Know then sir that I am a knight, my natiue countrey
is the kingdome of Persia, neere to the great cittie of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and not long since was I sent in company of twelue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knights, with the strong &amp; puissant <hi>Ariodant,</hi> a knight
of great reputation, neere coosen to the mightie <hi>Mutiuell</hi>
king of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was elected and chosen by the greater
part of the inhabitants of that countrey (to goe to the great
Emperour of Constantinople, to intreate his succour for a
multitude of good knights and christian souldiours, whom
the young prince <hi>Mauspasian,</hi> brother to the great Sophie of
<hi>Persia,</hi> very straitlye besieged in the citties of <hi>Susa</hi> and <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
beside diuers other places of the <hi>Persians</hi> kingdome. And
to the end ye may know wherefore we went, ye must note,
that (some while since) the great Sophie, a man worthie of
great dignity, for the high prowes where with he is indued,
hauing séene a portrait curiously drawn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the faire princes
<pb facs="tcp:2883:57"/>
of Constantinople, daughter to the Emperour: became so
carryed away with the loue of this most beautifull Ladie,
as he immediatly resolued to make her his wife, what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
or aduenture so euer stood thereon. And to compasse the
same, he sent ambassadours to the Emperours, to demaund
her in marriage, but the Emperour at that time made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall,
because hee was contrary to him in religion, and it
was not lawfull for a Christian to marrie with a Pagan,
neither for a Christian to ioyne in any conuersation with
a heathen. Which was the cause (to take away this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
which onely séemed to hinder the mariage) that the
great Sophie of Persia with all his people would become
Christians, and should be baptized. And because the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sort should frame their actions, and fashion their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
answerable to their king: himselfe was the first that
receiued holy baptisme, and commanded in all the countries
of his kingdome, that the Christian law should be anounced
and preached. Which being doone according to his will and
commaund, many willingly receiued the faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
others finding the alteration very strange, withdrew
themselues in displeasure: some other that would not at all
receiue it, but were constrained thereto, thought better to
forsake their houses, lands and possessions, to liue in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kingdome with libertie of conscience, and so continue
the rest of their liues in the Pagan law. After these things
were thus ordered, it chaunced that the king absented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so that no one could tell what was become of him: some
sayd, that as in former times hee had beene accustomed, so
now (like a knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrant) he was gon in search of strange
and perillous aduentures, with especiall intent to make
proofe and combate body to body, with the puissant <hi>Nabot</hi>
and <hi>Squamell,</hi> who were counted the most hardie knights in
the world. Others sayd, that being transported with this
amourous passion, hee was gon to the Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
to demaund of him the Princesse his daughter:
<pb facs="tcp:2883:57"/>
for if he found her to be of such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erfect beautie, as the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by his art had discouered, surely by force or fayre means
he intended to haue her. But which way so euer hee tooke,
very true it is, that soone after his departure, the Prince
<hi>Mauspasian</hi> his brother, whom hee had left to gouerne the
Realme in his absence, would by force of armes compell
such as had abiured the pagan lawe, and were become chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
to take againe their former religion, saying, that
what the king his brother had doone and intended to doo,
was but onely to induce the Christian Emperour, with
more ease to graunt the marriage of the princesse his
daughter. And because there was no likelyhood by that
meane to obtaine her, by force he minded (after his returne)
to haue the Lady, and this <hi>Mauspasian</hi> said that the Sophie
had disclosed to him. But all would not giue credit to his
spéeches, for many resisted to doo as he commanded, thus
vrging the contrary: that séeing they found the Christian
religion good and profitable to their consciences, as also the
saluation of their soules, séeing likewise their king had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to vndertake that religion and beléefe, and since had
giuen them no commaund to the contrary: the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
(being but a deputie) ought not constraine them to
forgoe the religion, but the same king might do it when he
should be present. Beside, what once he had so fréely granted
and established, could not so suddenly displease him, to the
preiudice of his people, for as they did owe loyaltie and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
to their prince, by submission which they voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
made to his power: so are all princes bound againe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their people, to guarde, defend and kéepe them by his
power, and to entertaine them vnder the obedience and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of conuentions, made betweene them and the laws
of the land.</p>
               <p>Upon this debate rose many perticuler quarrels and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities,
betwéene such as had auouched Christianitie, and
them that continued idolaters to their false Gods, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

withdrew themselues to their houses, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
would depriue them (of the other part) of theyr houses
and possessions, whereby is nowe growne in <hi>Persia</hi> a ciuill

beene séene sundry bloodie battels, where on each side
are, slaine many Christians and Pagans, especially two
most signall and markable persons: one on the coast of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risir,</hi>

to flye the field, with great losse of their men, to make
themselues strong in the citties of <hi>Tauris, Susa,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
townes beside, where they are at this instant begirt
with very sharpe siedge. So despairing of theyr former
trust in God, the valiant prince <hi>Ariodant,</hi> determined secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to leaue the cittie of <hi>Tauris,</hi> where hee was Generall of
the Christians, accompanyed onely with twelue chosen

and hauing assembled all his people, assayled vs so fiercely,
that six or seauen of my companions were slaine outright,
the other taken prisoners, and my selfe escaped in such

               <p>In middest of this talke, whilst <hi>Gerileon</hi> armed himselfe
with the swoord of dead <hi>Argontes,</hi> and <hi>Taffinor</hi> with his

At last they beheld the two Christian knights, riding with

<hi>Adylas</hi> stood greatly abashed, and the rather, because (in

imagining that <hi>Gerileon</hi> was one of the Gods
whom he adored, to wit, <hi>Mars</hi> the God of battailes, and (as
they supposed) that hee was highly displeased with them.
When hee beheld what hauock the Fayrie knight made of
his people, hee came foorth from the middest of his troupe,
to know for certaintie what he was, and if he were one of
theyr gods, with praiers, oblations and sacrifices he would
appease his anger: but <hi>Gerileon</hi> that made no regarde of
such folly, prepared to endure the braue against all the rest.
And for this cause, hee entred further in among them with
<hi>Taffinor,</hi> where sundring themselues, no one durst stirre to

déedes séemed to surpasse the common valour of men, and
had some thing in him to out goe other in hardinesse: they
easily were induced to beléeue, that this was one of their
imaginarie Gods. This false perswasion serued very well
for these two Christians, because if all the troupe had risen
against them, you quickly may conceiue their daunger: but
the good Angell that conducted them, by the helpe of God
assisted them in such sort, as <hi>Adylas</hi> alone offered spéech to

one of whose traine he was: thou hauing discomfited
him and his men, detainest some of them as prisoners, which
iniurie he intreated me to reuenge, and I haue vndertaken
it both vpon thée &amp; thine: for well thou knowest, that by the
lawe of chiualrie, inuiolably obserued among such as are
woorthie to beare the title of knighthood, all errant knights
séeking aduentures, are bound to reuenge the opprobrious
wrongs, that the ouerstrong offer to the ouer weake, hauing
no iust cause or reason therefore, and to defend them against
all forcible violence, indirectly throwne vppon miserable
and afflicted persons, maintaining euermore the quarrell of
the wronged that haue no helpe. Beside, the quarrell (for
which thou hast so hardly dealt with <hi>Ariodant</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
is publique, touching all good Christians, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

and slaughter of their men, beside their cheefe heads and

dooing a déed becomming a king that feared God and
looued his people, as euery prince that is called to so high
dignitie ought doo, séeing and knowing, how without helpe
of the celestiall bountie, he was in most great danger of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ruine, (which had béene no small hurt to all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
<pb facs="tcp:2883:63"/>
also that as yet he had some aduantage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
hauing subiected one of the principall heads to his
will, and an other of the best knights in all their troope:
he would not now shew himselfe slothfull, but perfourme
the act of a good Christian, by yéelding thanks and prayses
to God, with intreatance to continue towards him and his
people, these fauourable effects of his almightie goodnes,
cheefely in a quarrell so iust and equitable, as was the cause
of this seuere and outragious warre.</p>
               <p>To this end, the same night that eche was retired from
the fight, hee commanded the belles in all the Churches of
the Cittie to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>noled, to assemble and call together all his
people, from the highest to the lowest that had knowledge of
God: willing them to render dutifull thanks to God, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in mercie he would assist them, against his vnbelée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
enemies who would not acknowledge him: which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one did very deuoutly, and there was no holye place
thorowout the Cittie, where lampes, torches, and tapers,
were lighted, but the people flocked thither in exceeding
number. And for this purpose, the aforenamed places were
persumed with incense and Aromaticall odours, beside the
musicall and mellodious voyces of Priests, Moonkes, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
children, and other seruants of God, who with hearts
full of heauenly deuotion, sung Canticles of prayse, with
prayers agréeable and pleasing to God. Continuing thus
well néere all the night, such as were more apte for warre,
sayled not to be on the walles in their glittering Armour,
to impeach the enemie, that hee should presume so prowdlye
as the daye before hee had doone: in which time, they that
were in guarde and kept the night watche, went to thanke
God, and afterwards to their rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angrafolt,</hi> whome king <hi>Floridament</hi> had taken prisoner,
séeing all these things, admired the meruaylous foresight
of the king, the industrie, care and vigilance he vsed, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Citties defence and people: when well hee
<pb facs="tcp:2883:64"/>
perceiued, that many of the <hi>Pagans</hi> should loose theyr liues,
before they could vanquish the people beloued of God: but
beyond all other things, he was astonned at the sight of the
faire Infant <hi>Polydamie,</hi> who by commaundement of the
king her father, entertayned him beningly, and shewed him
good countenance: because the king had determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
and vse him with such contentment, as the force of his
kindnes and benignitie, might mollifie the hard crueltie of
his enemies. And so making them (against their nature) soft
and gentle, they might bee induced to vse humanitie &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
to foure worthie Christian knights, <hi>Accial</hi> of Surrie,
<hi>Ramelin</hi> of Uuich, <hi>Melchior</hi> or Ireland, and <hi>Frangard</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Durford, whom the Giant <hi>Brisard</hi> and <hi>Rongemont</hi>
had taken prisoners in combatting. For this cause he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Angrafolt,</hi> to write vnto king <hi>Grandowin</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to vse those foure hardy knights so kindly as might be:
which he did, fearing if they misdealt with the Christians,
by ouer sharpe or inhumaine seueritie, like rigour would
be vsed towards him, and he should be as cruelly tormented.
Heere vpon the <hi>Pagans</hi> did not put them to death, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would haue doone, for the liues of these foure va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
knights was desired of king <hi>Floridamant,</hi> more then
the death of fiue hundred of his enemies, considering the
present necessitie he was in.</p>
               <p>And although <hi>Angrafolt</hi> (before his taking) was abooue
all other a fierce and cruell aduersarie against him, yet now
hee was so ouercome by the courtesie and kindnesse of the
king vsed toward him: as more gladly would he continue
in this prisonment, then returne againe to his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for in such sorte was hee arrested by the fayre Infants
beautie, which in his eye excelled all other hee had séene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as made him more desirous to abide in this fayre pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
so that when libertie was offered him, hee had no will
to forgoe this swéet seruitude. For yee must vnderstand,
that beyond her naturall perfection, which was no lesse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb facs="tcp:2883:64"/>
then I haue tolde yee: shee was adorned with such
sumptuous garments, iewels and other trickes of embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment,
as like stately princesses are accustomed to weare,
that the barbarous king feeling himselfe altogether surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with her loue, desired nothing more, then dayly to liue in
contemplation of her good graces: and albeit thereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
some pleasure and contentment, yet was it a gréefe
and martirdome to him to enioy nothing else, his amourous
conceit being vnable to compasse any other effect, then this
vaine imagination and fantasticall contemplation, so lying
figured in his hart. And if by chaunce he dreamed on some
little shew of hope, that perswaded him he should enioy the
pleasant skirmishes of loue: yet presently againe was hee
kild and discomforted: not vnlike the angrie and arrogant
boot-haling Pirate, that was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ouer poorer théeues then himselfe, seeing he is (for
some offence by him committed) bound fast by the leg with
a chaine, blames the houre of his birth, exclaming on God
and his iustice, without any feare or regarde of his supreme
greatnesse.</p>
               <p>Euen so was this proud Pagan tormented, and in his
torment oftentimes to himselfe, hee imagined some subtill
and detestable meane, whereby he might rauish the young
and tender princesse, or forcibly carrie her awaye: When
shee (good Ladye) without any thought of euill or mallice,
vsed him most gratiouslie and courteous, euermore shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him freendly and smilying countenances, and (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the king her father had giuen in charge) would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and sundrie tymes, entertayne him with honest talke
and familiare conference: which more and more serued to
prouoke forward his loue, and from milde amourous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
to make him more violent, inducing this cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to an euill and pernicious intent, such as heereafter ye
shall knowe more of. For in this Chapter I must tell yee
what chaunced (meane while) in the enemyes Campe.
<pb facs="tcp:2883:65"/>
whether safely were retyred (as yee haue read in the first
booke) the king <hi>Guittard</hi> of <hi>Baccaleos</hi> and the <hi>Carybes,</hi> who
had beene in the thickest of the hurlie burlie: and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
offended were they, to be thus shamefully driuen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
from their enterprise.</p>
               <p>It is necessarie then that wee consider, howe almightie
God dooth sometime send afflictions on the good, to make
tryall of theyr perseuerance in well doing, supporting with
pacience the aduersities wherewith they are exercised: so it
séemed now, that he would permit the Pagans of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
farre and neere, to assemble together with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable
forces, to peruert and ruinate altogether the
estate of Christendome, whereof the kingdome of England
was the great and strongest colour. For the day after this
meruaylous assault, there arriued in the enemies campe for
theyr helpe and succour, a great multitude of theyr allyes
and confederates, such as had vowed with them the euersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and totall ruine of Christendome. Among others there
came a Captaine sent by the king of the Turkes, named
<hi>Grimoaldo,</hi> a man hardie and valiant of person: who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
vnder his Ensignes fiftie thousand braue fighting
men, and in goode quipage. Hee with his troope was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed
and receiued by the heads of the Pagan armie, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of the old king <hi>Grandowin,</hi> who feasted and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him in the best manner he could deuise, for hee kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w
well, that this <hi>Grimoaldo</hi> was a man of marke, as skilfull
in feates of armes as any in all the host. He caused him to
he lodged in the reregard of his Campe, whereof he was the
head and gouernour, and this fresh supply made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
so glad and ioyfull, as nothing was heard among
them but sounding of Tabourines, Trumpets, and other
warlike instruments, expressing no little ioy and pleasure
amongst them, with menaces against them of the Cittie, of
quick discomfiture and extermination.</p>
               <p>This ioy endured a great many dayes together, and as
<pb facs="tcp:2883:65"/>
theyr succour encreased, so did theyr iouissance, for beside
this Turkish Captaine, there came a puissant and meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Pagan, of monstrous forme and Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntine stature, a
proud monster, mutinous, and a mightie drinker. He had
thrée heads or faces vppon on neck that supported them all,
and when he entred the Campe, he wore a massie Crowne
of golde, triple fourmed according to his heads: the crownes
were made high like the Turrets of a strong Tower, and
vnderneath was written this verse.</p>
               <l>I am Triphon, the great and puissant king of Scythia,</l>
               <l>The most valiant and strongest, in combate I conquer.</l>
               <p>This arrogant and proud subscription was no leasing, for
he was so strong and puissant, as himselfe was able to foile
a whole Armie: and therefore to this assembly he brought
with him but ten thousand combattants, with whome hee
thought himselfe sufficient to subiugate all Christendome.

               <p>The other that were of better spirite and courage, knew
well, that his arriuall would bee greatly succourable to
them, because his force and valiancie was vnspeakable and
inuincible, farre beyond any other humaine strength. And
he that ioyed most to sée him, was the arrogant and fierce
<hi>Brandissant,</hi> who sent for him, and at his request he came: for
they two had long before beene companyons together, in
many robberies and cruelties by them doone ioyntly, and
by their association, forcibly, violently and thorow tiranny,
they had gotten kingdomes, many rich booties and herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which they deuided betwéene them as brethren, that
parte the common herritage of their Father when hee is
deceased.</p>
               <p>So by reason of the wunted familiaritie and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that the one of them had with the other, they vsed
many sundrie ceremoniall embracings to each other, being
glad they had so fortunately met in this place, where they
assured themselues of the pillage and spoyle, of the famous
and wealthie Cittie of London, beside the rich treasure of
king <hi>Floridamant,</hi> after they had vsed towards him and his
people, the like or more bloodier crueltie, then euer the
Grecians in times past did shew to <hi>Pryam</hi> and his warlike
Troyans.</p>
               <p>And surely this good Christian king was verye sad and
sorowfull in his heart, seeing himselfe so weake against
such a puissant armie, wherein were so many hardie and
strong knightes, as but fewe like them could bee founde
through the whole world, and aboue all the rest this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Scythia was most redoubted, in that he was most to
be feared for his force and crueltie: yet notwithstanding,
putting his trust in God, the walles of his cittie beeing
strong and well appointed, hee was pacient in this perill,
expressing meruaylous hardinesse in his countenance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
<pb facs="tcp:2883:66"/>
his people with fayre speeches and exhortations,
that by their generous actes and behauiour, they should be
vigilant and carefull for the defence of the cittie, giuing
them to vnderstand by woorthie examples, how religiously
euery subiect stood bound to their king and countrie in that
behalfe.</p>
               <p>The enemyes on the contrarie side (for the reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie

their campe was nothing but songs of ioye and pleasure,
dronken pastimes, beastly gourmandisings, and such like
insolencies: for beside the succour before rehearsed, came
to the Pagan hoste two strong and puissant kings from the
coast of Barbarie, the one named <hi>Phoas</hi> king of <hi>Alger,</hi> and
the other <hi>Orontes</hi> king of <hi>Marocco,</hi> both co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them be seene in this warre, because many of their friends

                  <hi>Grandowin</hi> in meane while (being ignorant of this vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected

such as were the chéefe of his armie, to the Pauillion where
councell was accustomed to be holden: to the end they might
deligently deliberate on their present affaires, and by what
meanes they were likeliest to gaine home againe their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
friends. At this councell there met about fiftéene or
sixteene puissant kings, all wearing Crownes, and were
placed according to their auncient honor and degrées. The

it should continue as a yeerely tribute to the chéefe of theyr
Armie, twenty Uirgins of noble familie and exquisit beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
beside two Millions of Golde.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he and his knights should come bare headed,
and without any armour, to aske parden of great king
<hi>Grandowin</hi> for the death of his sonnes, in reuenge whereof
this warre was commenced: withall, that hee and his
knights should voluntarily submit themselues to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that hee might dispose of their liues and goods as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
best to him: when peraduenture he would take pittie
on them, not putting them to death so cruelly, nor race the
Cittie, nor murther all the rest of his people, as otherwise
he intended to doo, (if he denied theyr demaund) with such
ruine and desolation, as neuer was mention made of the
like.</p>
               <p>To carrie these newes of this fayre resolution, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

to whome the gate of the Cittie was presently ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

performed what hee imagined concerning his deuoyre, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
the before named Letters to the king: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his maiestie grewe presently into excéeding great anger

iniurious and vnreasonable, and not to bee allowed of in

their vttermost endeuour, according as himselfe hither to

matters against his will, wherefore it was too late for
him now to begin: and so (quoth he to the messenger) yee
may returne with this answere. Which presently he did,
whereat the <hi>Pagans</hi> greatly meruayled, that a man hauing
so few to helpe him, should containe such hardinesse, as to

oure-wéening, wherefore he would spéedily take such order

follie and rashnesse.</p>
               <p>Wherevppon, within thrée daies following at the most,
each one should prepare himselfe readie to armes, when
such an assault should be made against the cittie, as not one
stone should be left standing vppon another, but bee rased
and extermined altogether. In regard whereof, euery one
should withdraw himselfe to his quarter, and giue order for
all things needfull against the day of assault. Heereof the
Christian king being aduertised, commaunded the Pagan
<hi>Mycrophon</hi> to bee closely locked vp, to the end that during
this troublesome time, hee might compasse no meane of
working any treacherie or treason. But as for the king of
<hi>Corse,</hi> hee restrayned not him of libertie, which hee had to
walke within the walles of the Pallace royall, where was
roome sufficient and verye spacious: well perceiuing that
he was so carryed away with the loue of his daughter, with
whom and the Queene <hi>Bellizene</hi> he still kept company, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring

but the mayden especially: the more willingly they would
conuerse with him, and among other familiar conferences,
the Quéene made him recount the number of straunge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

secret meanes, the enemyes had concluded to assaile and
seaze on the Cittie: withall hee declared to them, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

and vse in such warre, which was most likelyest, and
which not.</p>
               <p>By these meanes king <hi>Floridamant</hi> had knowledge of
many things, that serued as speciall rules of discipline to
his Court of guard, and therfore appointed his men in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines

day and night with <hi>Grandilaor, Fertand, Candior, Sylban,</hi> and
other hardie knights of name that were in the Cittie with
him, who (according to his commaund) busied themselues
very carefully, letting nothing flip that any way concerned

Duke of Suffolke, and <hi>Lampridion</hi> Countie of Norffolke,

The first came from demaunding helpe for the

were sent, before the Pagan armie had engirt the Cittie

and they well perceiuing, that <hi>Hoaster</hi> knew them by their

who caused the neerest gate of the cittie to them to be
opened, when they safely entred, not being at all discouered
by the enemie. Hee that came from Spaine aduertised his

Launce, where of hee had robd the king his father, which
Launce hee heard was againe recouered by the young

they might lawfully require a truce or peace: thus feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some forwardnes in themselues to this marriage, they
should induce the Pagan to write the more willingly. But
king <hi>Floridamant,</hi> who had his spirit more vigilant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

                  </gap> thereon, I may not follow their aduise, for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and considerations, which if it please you, and all the
<pb facs="tcp:2883:75"/>
assistants, to listen with fauourable eares, I will describe
vnto ye. In the first place, if we should write to our enemies
and defie certaine of them in combate against like number
of ours: they presently would conceiue opinion, that all our
strength and valour consisted in the hardinesse of a doozen
men, which might be easie for them to discomfite, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hope remaineth now for vs, where as yet hither to they
haue beene of a farre contrary minde. For howsoeuer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
they bee to assayle vs, they imagine vs to bee a greater
number then we are, as ye may gather by so many likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
lately seene, disposing their campe into so many and
sundrie places, all to hinder our issuing foorth vppon them
by day or night: the rest in farre fewer number, are ranged
into foure direct places, where best they may make their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.
Farre better it is for vs it should bee so, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
because if all were prepared to assayle vs, wee should
finde our selues more seuerely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then we can do by the
order that is nowe disposed: and this will fall out for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
if we write to our enemies as these good Lords haue
aduised.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas we would combate, as it is thought
méet to be demaunded, or else we will do or can do nothing:
if we be so desirous of the combate, twelue against twelue,
we shall bring our selues into very great hazard. For it is
necessary to consider, as euer more in taking things at the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that be it wee gaine or we loose the battaile, we shall
be sure euery way to loose: because in a case of victorie, we
can take no assurance of our enemies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

murther them, if they bee not miraculously preserued from
<pb facs="tcp:2883:76"/>
so great daunger: and which is more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what likelihood can
be gathered, that twelue men, the cheefe and head of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
great and puissant armie, should go foorth to hazard the
liues and libertie of so many persons? where being vnited
together within the Cittie, and fenced round about with
strong walles, me thinkes, that although all the Pagans in
the world were héere assembled to enforce vs, yet should it
be impossible for them. And before they can get entrie, their
siedge will be longer then that of Troye was, but we must
make no issue out vpon them, neither wil we any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend
to this combate: for it were but a faint harted trick,
if they should take vs at our woord, and we our selues after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
glad to refuse it, this for euer will redounde to our
great shame and dishonour, which we should rather flie then
the losse of our liues. Nowe for constraining the Pagan
prisoner to write any thing thereby to respite and delay the
assault, I mislike that more then the other, because wee
ought not vse any force or violence against a prisoner, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him to write any matter whatsoeuer, that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
to him or his: least that our enemies who are
Pagans, and in whome yet neuer appeared any sparke of
loyaltie or fidelitie (as well we knowe) should intend some
thing against our prisoner, both hurtful vnto them and vs,
and I am of opinion, that if vnbeléeuing men containe such
good thoughts, as to vse kindnes and benignitie towarde
their enemies, the like or more ought appeare in them that
professe faith and loyaltie. Wee then that follow the right
path of a farre better religion, should thinke on no fraude
or trumperie whatsoeuer, and much lesse in time of a kinde
intreaty, as we promise to our prisoned enemie, vnder hope
whereof, they whom our enemies detaine of ours, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
such fauour from them, as they shall not be compelled
to doo any thing hurtfull to themselues. Let vs not then
constraine him to any thing against his will, much lesse let
vs speake or once open our mouthes concerning any marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:76"/>
in that it will seeme a matter incredible to our enemies
that against the lawes of our religion, wee would permit
the marriage of a Pagan with a Christian: this were but
to make them veryly beléeue, that we would altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our God, and the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mercurie, Phoebus,</hi> and such like idols as they reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as things celestiall, so altogether to take their parte:
whereas we ought not shew them the least attaint of our
thoughts, but firmely to stand on our strong faithfull foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
toward God, who euermore hitherto hath maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and preserued vs, by his exceeding mercie and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
dower. And still in his goodnes we ought to resolue
with our selues, that all the <hi>Bethulians</hi> were in times past
deliuered, from the miserable and cruell siedge of cruell
<hi>Holofernes,</hi> onely by power diuine, that for their deliuerance
raised vp a woman, who by vndauntable stomach cut off the
head of their chéefest enemie: we by the like or greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
by his supreame and diuine grace shall be deliuered
from our proud enemy: for whose destruction if our strength
be two feeble, or in any sort wanteth, hee can by his will, if
we firmely trust in him, make flye on them againe, eyther
the Sword of <hi>Gedeon</hi> or <hi>Aioth,</hi> or else an other <hi>Iudeth,</hi> to
ouerthrow and exterminate theyr dayes altogether, so to
preserue and deliuer them that abide in faithfull obedience
and trust, continuing theyr firme hope and assurance onely
in him.</p>
               <p>We sée by many holy and sacred misteries and examples
wherewith the diuine and holy Scriptures are plentifully
stored and furnished from how many euils and mischiefes
he deliuered, and miraculouslie preferued the Children of
<hi>Isaack</hi> and <hi>Israell,</hi> that trusted in his goodnesse and mercie,
and did with hearts full of deuotion and penitence, call for
his helpe and succour in theyr calamities and afflictions:
let vs then altogether trust &amp; hope in him, beleeuing that he

is at this present, euer hath beene, and for euer will bee, as
gracious and mightie as then hee was, and in this hope let
vs take paine, valiantlye and couragionslie to defend our

they are for the preseruation of all Christendome, which
would bee meruaylously shaken, if this wofull distressed
kingdome (at this instant the most flourishing estate of all,
where the name of Iesus Christ is knowne, honored and

                  <p>How the Pagans prepared themselues to the assault, and how
the besieged Christians endeuoured to the contrarie, in such

from Councell, it was almost night, and
hauing a lighted Torche before him, as
is the manner in the Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the chéefe and most noble Lordes

ended, the guarde and watch was orderly placed, each one
of the inhabitants thus resoluing, rather to die the death,
then turne their backes on their enemies, or forsake the
walles, which they manned and fortified very strongly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
iuuincible and neuer quayling courage. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were there in person, and hauing in the night made
sundrie roundes about the Cittie, to see if any thing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in any place: they found all well and in good dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through the carefull dilligence of the Captains by them
appointed, and according as the king had commaunded for
conduct of the footmen. This doone, they departed for a
while to the pallace againe, that they might take a little
rest, because they had beene so ouertrauailed the dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Not three houres or thereabout had they slumbringly
slept, but they heard a great rumour and noyse thorow all
the Cittie, the cause whereof was, in respect the enemies
<pb facs="tcp:2883:78"/>
had sounded their drums and trumpets, giuing an allarme
to the inhabitants: wherevpon king <hi>Floridamant</hi> arose
immediatly, and all the Christian kings and Princes that
bare him companye, who betooke themselues as the king
had appointed, to the rampiers and contremures seuerally
prouided, to withstand this first and sudden assault of the
Pagans. And as each one was come to his place of charge,
they found the enemies alreadie verye busie, against foure
places of the Cittie at once, with their Trepans, Rammes,
Bricolles, Scorpions, Crowes, with other such like engines
and instruments for warre, wherewith in those times they
vsed to breake and beat downe the walles of Citties, they
saw withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they had erected theyr high terrasses and
platformes that commaunded ouer the Cittie, and on the
principall of these Fortes, they had builded certaine bastils
or houses of wood, wherein were placed great store of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and crossebows, who standing with assurance against
the enemie, might greatly iniurie such as attempted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peache
the escalade, appointed in these places and for this
purpose. For this cause likewise, they commanded their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
to be brought neere the wals, to the number of two
or three hundred, carrying little castles of wood vpon theyr
backs, wherein also were a number of Pagan Archers hid.
Beside, many were appointed with Torches and burning
firebrands against the gates of the cittie, where they layde
store of pitch barrels, to make the fire the sooner do his office
when the gates being burnt downe, they entered in great
number the citty, while the christians was busied to defend

them so furiously ouer the false rouered déepe trenches, as

being followed by the foure Pagan kings his vassalls, all

as the port of the bulwarke (where into the greater part ran
for safetie of their liues) being too straight to let them in so

this brunt more then fiue hundred men. Brandissant pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

at such a late houre to performe the same. But she could not

the voyce very perfectly which sung the song, the wordes

consolation this vnknowne musitian promised, by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

her former tears, fighs and intire lamentations. Then
tourning againe to remember what fewe daies before her

had contraried his spels, whereby hee sought to giue her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance

hardly yet be found: she (I say) knowes very well howe to
command them, as also so skilfully to imploy them, albeit
by diuine permission as is said: that shee makes them goe
whether she thinkes good, locking them vp as shee list, and
by charmes enclosing them in the bodyes of beautifull da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosels,
that inuisibly are transported hither and thither,
wheresoeuer she commannds them, and not else. These da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosels
are called Fayries or Nimphes, one whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by her commaund, did sing the Song to giue you some

whatsoeuer the song disclosed: but for better knowledge

conferre with <hi>Sagibell,</hi> to vnderstand what in this case he

I thinke ye may say true, for one reason which as yet
you touched not, and whereof I was remembred by your

commonly called the Fayrie knight, because a certaine fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

and called <hi>Ozyris,</hi> as hee tolde vs, had giuen him nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and sent him likewise to my fathers court, there to
receiue his order of knighthood. But how can that bee?
(quoth then the faire princesse againe, continuing her spéech
and doubting what reason should mooue her so to do) what
knowledge hath she of me? can shee tell whether I loue or
no? who should reueale it to her? or how can she diuine on
matters so strange? this can neuer enter into my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

tell yee other newes, and in the meane while trouble not
your selfe: but sléepe, and let mee doo the like, for all this
night you haue not suffered me to enioy any quiet. When
the faire Uirgin perceiued her cosen and deere companion
wearie of talking, she held her peace, and soone after falling

was, to talke with her phisition Sagibel, and vnderstande

thus answered.</p>
               <p>Madame, I cannot presently giue ye anie certaine reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

promise to tell ye truth of all, or at the least shewe yee some

and in the meane while vse what diligence yee can best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
that at least I may knowe what thou coniurest, or else
canst gather of this wonderfull accident. Immediatly the
wise man departed the chamber, to compasse that she had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned

               <p>Not a little ioyfull was she to sée him, being perswaded
in her thoughts that her phisition had nowe promised some

that he could know nothing of all that was done. But his
spirites had reuealed vnto him, that to knowe the certaintie
in this case, it was expedient, that the Ladie which desyred
such sound knowledge in these affayres, shoulde one nyght
plaie on some instrument, and sing at the same windowe
where shee hearde the song before: withall, the effect of her
song should be, to aske the voice that had song what it was,
the wordes and circumstance wherof should agrée with one
that he had made for the same purpose, which he opened and
gaue her, and shee learned it by heart euen at that instant.
Now albeit the princesse receiued not such intire comfort,
as then presently she expected, yet were her passions some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
mittigated, and this song serued her as a pastime all
the after noone, to learne the lines perfectly and sing them
well, as before night with her lute she made it agrée verie
excellently, and so cunningly could she touch euerie string,
that both the dittie and musicke fitted passing well her
owne desire.</p>
               <p>When the daie was passed, and night approched, for that
she could not with patience tarrie till the next morrow, she
tooke her Lute in her hand, and going vnto the windowe,

So breaking off her song in this sorte, the voyce would
make her no more answere, which made her more curious
and full of greefe then before: yet remembring what the
voyce had said, that one day when she should sit alone by a
Fountaine, she should be satisfied in the rest of her demanud
and finde ease for her languishing: héervpon seauen or eight
daies together continually, without letting scape any day,
she went &amp; lay downe in the Arbor or Garden, where were
thrée or foure verie stately fountaines, and by euery one
she sate downe to sléepe, that she might haue answer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the voyce had promised: but this desire was so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
aduanced within her thoughts, as shee could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
no way to forget it, and the remembrance therof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

beat vppon her heart, as would not permit her the
very least moment of quiet, and the neerer shee approached
the Fountaines to fasten on a sleepe, the more did these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
vexations torment her. Hauing continued in
these insupportable agonies the space of eight dayes, the
length and vehemence of, which trauaile had so ouerwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
her, as now she wexed heauie and desirous of sleepe:
one day when she least thought h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ereof, she was sequestred
from all her companie, and going alone into the Garden
(not perceiued by any one) about the time of midday, she sat
downe by a Fountaine in the middest of the Garden, which
was round beset with daintie. Arbours and Cabinets of
Gessemine, Rose trées, with floures and hearbes of all sorts
that smelled most swéetly: and excellent pure water flowed
from the fountaine, being brought thither in pipes from
foure fayre Griffons, that were placed in the foure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Garden, which was equall square euery waye.
On the side of this fountaine sat downe the young Princes
who had past so many nights without receiuing any rest,
and thinking nowe but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

soundly the space of two houres, without knowledge to any
of her attendants what was become of her: each one sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
verily she had lockt her selfe into her chamber, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
dayes before (to couer her melancholly) she was wunt
to doo. It so happened, that about the verye latest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her sleeping, the water of the Fountaine murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and made such a mightie noyse, as oftentimes the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
sea dooth, when beeing stirred with great and most
tempestuous winds, the fierce billowes beat either against
some stonie rock, or driues vp the sandes against some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montorie,
aspiring vp sharpe pointed from the middest to
the top: by meanes whereof the faire Infant quickly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
dreaming that she was not by the side of so faire a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but on the raging of the sea, which leaped against the
foundations of the Castell wall, and mooued very extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
as séemed to her.</p>
               <p>Being thus awaked, the bruite of the water ceased, and
appeared before her the most fayre Nimphe <hi>Aegle,</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in beautie not any humaine or liuing creature, but
rather some deitie or matter celestiall: such as comming
néere the newe built walles of Carthage, appeared to the

séemed to the princely maide, who at the first sight of her
was some what astonied, doubting whether she should take
her selfe to flight, or tarie still there, or whether this appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was to encrease her heauinesse, or bring her comfort.
This being well perceiued by the fayre Nimphe, who héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
had amazed the most assured by her presence: she spake
to her in this manner: bee not afrayd (O princesse of rare
vertues, and the fayrest creature in the world) nor be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The young princesse lending eare attentiuely to these

his quéene conceiued with childe, wherof she was deliuered

enstructed him in all good manners, vntill hee was of able

might discouer what hee was. She prouiding him of all
things necessarie for a knight, chusing and appointing him
as her loyall and faithfull seruant, she being the wisest and
most faire princesse liuing, as likewise he is the most valiant

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nymph Aegle hauing thus left
the company of the yong princes,
she remained very pensiue, &amp; more
desirous than before, to know the
newes of her knight, for now shée
would faine bee acquainted with
what the nymph had concealed,
not contented with what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
reuealed, though in some
sort pleased, by knowing that her part and amorous desires
aimed at no meane or base obiect, but so sortable and worthy
as she could make choice of. And verie certaine it was, that
in those times there was no Empire or monarch more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
nor anie king or Christian prince more esteemed,
then was the realme of great Britaine, &amp; the worthie king
Floridamant. For his predecessors and himselfe had inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and augmented theyr gouernment further a great deal
then the continent of England, not onely by their force and
prowesse, but likewise by their swéete curtesse and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
so valiant did they euermore shewe themselues to bee, as
also humane and affable withall, yet al this aduantage was
not sufficient to satisfie the princely maide, but rather vrged
her to more pensiuenes and impatience, vnderstanding him
to be of such rase and originall, whome before shee reckoned
and estéemed but as a simple knight arrant: now proouing
to be of so high extraction and great birth, hauing seated her
affections in place of such dignitie, she remayned still doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whether he were aliue or dead, for so long absence might
verie well raise great and vehement suspition thereof. Here
vpon she withdrew her selfe secretly into her chamber, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much discomforted and verie passionate as before, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and pondering much more profoundly on her new and
fresh conceites, than on the discourse of the beautifull and
fayre Nymph Aegle: and albeit shee was indifferentlie
comforted thereby, yet made shee no signe or semblaunce
<pb facs="tcp:2883:92"/>
thereof to her cosin. Wherefore when the night was come,
thinking in the darke shade the nymph would come again,
and resolue her in the rest of her desires, shee went to the
window and song the same vearses which the phisition had
taught her, but all was in vaine, for shee hearde no song but
her owne, nor anie mellodie but her Lute, which made a
heauenly concordance with her voyce. Fayre Aegle was
deafe for this night, and woulde not make answere to her
musicall questions, but when the morning was come, and
the rising Sunne made shew of a new daie, the young prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
hauing enioyed no rest all that night, amorous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
had so carryed her thoughts to and fro, with wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and rewishing for the midde daie houre. So wearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
the tediousnesse of the time with as greate patience as
he could, at the last she got her againe to the same fountains
side, where she had slept the daie before, and the nymph Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
retourned thether agayne while the princesse slumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
making lyke noyse as at the first she dyd, wherwith the
Infant awaked, marie not so much afrighted as earst shee
had béene, but beeing verie gladde to beholde and see the
fayre face of the demie goddesse, from whome shée hoped to
receiue greater consolation then shee had done in the daie
before.</p>
               <p>Now the Fayrie had brought with her a sphere, or for
your better vnderstanding, a bowle of peeces of engrauen
wood, made in forme round lyke a sphere, wherein appeared
the whole vniuersall world, how it was inclosed, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the earth, with all the prouinces contained therein, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>These things might there be discerned with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:2883:92"/>
and contentment than they can conceiue that trauaile
farre, to see a little portion or many particulars, of that
which this fayre Nymph shewed at one time to the Infant
Porphiria. For you must vnderstand, that hauing drawen
from forth the siluer waters of the cleere fountaine, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
peece of workemanship so lately named, shee opened
a certaine little couerture, which was expressely made to
discouer all the rest within, at the opening whereof she vsed
these wordes to the princesse.</p>

               <p>Speaking these wordes, hauing opened the doore that
was aboue, wherein was contained the figure of heauen
and the starres, shee parted in three partes the rest of the

And to tell thée in few words (least I should offend yée with
tediousnes) with what other regions this land is inhabited,
ye must vnderstand that Ethiopia is this which ye sée rising
from the red sea, and butting on Arabia, neighbouring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

were so called after a man named <hi>Aethipos,</hi> that the olde
Pagans sayde was the sonne of Uulcan: he being the first
king, all the region tooke the name of him. Then may yee
discerne here on the other side, the habitation of these olde i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
Egyptians, a verie fertile region, which in elder
time was called Aeria, and since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleped Egypt, by a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and on the North side the mediterranean sea. The
great citie which yee sée in this region so well seated, with
walls so ancient, and whose proud pallaces are now like an
olde ruined mazure, is the ancient citie of Thebes, whereof
Amphion is sayd to laie the first foundation, and the king to

being there slayne when cruell Achilles entered to sacke
and spoyle the towne, murdering seuen of his children, the

afterward in this other place was builded by king Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great this other beautifull citie, the walles whereof
are not so ancient as the other, and according to the name of

               <p>This other greate Citie and wonderfull strong,
<pb facs="tcp:2883:93"/>
whose walles are more fresh, as also beeing more newlye
builded then all the other: is the famous Cittie of <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
so called in former times, but at this present is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Marocco, Alger</hi> and <hi>Thunis,</hi> inhabited with terrible and

in their possessions they are very mightie men, well skild in

doone, or you attaine to behold the long wished place: I
will tell yee what these fayre Islandes are which you

               <p>Knowe then that these are the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> otherwise

The people there dwelling, are subiects to a puissant
Pagan king, who at this daye swayes the scepter thereof,
named <hi>Brandissant,</hi> that chased thence sometime <hi>Argamor,</hi>
the cruell father to foure sonnes, who succoured king <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissant</hi>
in so dooing, because the king had promised to each

offensiue to them, then any infectious disease to a healthfull

Egypt in like manner is by flowing Nylus: not by naturall

continued on her spéech. If your affection drewe mee not so

some are good and true Christians, and others, onely
gouerned by frenzie, fearing that their king will renye his
Christianitie: &amp; by force of armes seeke to reduce the rest
to their former religion, which beeing vnable to compasse,
such venemous hatred and despight is kindled amongst
them: as hee must hope of another remedie for so great an

which will so come to passe in very short while. For
your knight, who is arriued heere but lately since, shall

loue he beareth you, and extreame affection in him, to let
you sée by effects, the seruice hee hath vowed to your diuins
beautie: this shall make him (for some while) abandon this
famous Monarchie, for euer to continue in dooing déedes
of vertue, laudable and worthie of great admiration. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

shall send hither a strong and valiant knight, who with

rebels vnder his awe and obedience: his name, by
reason of his generous acts and braue enterprises, shall be

knowne from this part to the other side of the Pole, yea, hee
shall bee so redoubted and feared, as the verye hardiest shall

transported with amourous affections, not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
his desseignes and enterprises: will vnfortunately
end his dayes, as your selfe in time shall perfectlye beholde.
You tell me meruayles, answered the princesse, but yet yee
shewe me not where the knight is, according to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

should I be much more pleased so behold him. Lady, quoth
the Nimphe, it is as necessarie for yee to knowe all these
things, as it is expedient for you to sée him, because I am
assured, both the one and other is agreeable to yee. Looke

See this famous Cittie called <hi>Tauris,</hi> neighbour to the

besieged by the Persian pagans, vnder the conduct of a
young foole named <hi>Mauspasian,</hi> brother to the Sophie, hee
that hath caused all this warre: behold into what extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
these poore Christians are brought, that are within the

yet will they not (for all this) yeeld to theyr enemies, or

because else-where they cannot expect anye, rather desire

so ioyfull, seeing her knight represented to the life, as shee

entraunce into the Cittie (so narrowly besiedged on eueri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

side) would prooue very difficult, the gates being ramd vp,
and the walles enuironed with Persian men at armes. An
indifferent while he deuised with himselfe, by what meane
both easily and couertly hee might get entrance. Hauing
some space considered heereon, the Historie saith, that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
noted one side of the cittie wall, where the enemies
had made a very great breache, to enter thereby on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
vpon the answer Quéene <hi>Lyxandra</hi> should returne to
king <hi>Artabaz:</hi> and this breach was guarded by certaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men of the Cittie, while the Quéene assembling her
councell, should agree on some expresse resolution of answer
concerning her submission to her enemie. The assaylants
on the other side of the breache, were making banquets,
passing away the time very merrilye, vnder certaine assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that now the cittie should be yeelded or taken, vppon
theyr request within of composition: and well ye wot, that
a Cittie comming to composition, is more then halfe taken.
This was the cause, that the young knight beeing come
neere the breache, and séeing they that kept it were verie
carefull of their charge, hee softly whispered with them, to
know by what meanes hee might enter the cittie, to haue
<pb facs="tcp:2883:100"/>
some spéech with the queene <hi>Lyxandra,</hi> concerning matters
of importance that would prooue profitable to her, desiring
them to let her vnderstand thereof, in that the cause of his

               <p>The Souldiers made him answere, that one should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
goe do his errand, and the Queene being aduertised
heereof, was very glad, knowing well by his renowme and
valour, that he was the gentle knight of the Flower, (for
so was he called, because as then hee loued a Ladye named
<hi>Florixa,</hi> in regard of whose name, he bare a Uermillion Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liflower
painted in his sheeld) a man so hardie and valiant,
as hee was esteemed beyond all the knights of that time.

into the Cittie, by a doore that passed from her Castell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
the Towne: marrie it was to be doone in the dead time of
the night, and that so couertly or closely as might be: thus
escaped the knight in, vnseene of the enemie, with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and horsse, and one Squire that bare him companie.
In breefe, to tell ye what passed betweene them, the quéene
letting him vnderstand the occasion of this warre, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
thereof, and the extremitie whereinto she was brought
farre more in effect then the knight had heard reported: she
fell downe on her knées before him, and with the teares
trickling downe her chéekes, intreated him, to helpe her
both with councell and valiance, promising to deliuer vp
all the treasure of her kingdome into his handes, if in this
darkenesse he could illuminate them with some meanes,
whereby they might escape the tyrants power, that forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
sought to make a rape of her, wherevnto before shee
would condiscend, shee minded to murther her selfe with

               <p>When the knight of the Flower had noted his words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

which according to her recitall, séemed to him most iust and

answer the Persian tyrant, that shee would not yeelde her

he bare her, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the morrow aduenture the combate, against one knight,
man to man, with what armes himselfe would choose. For
one should be sent foorth of the Cittie, armed at all pointes,
whom if hee could vanquish, shee would condiscend to his
will: but if the contrary happened, and he were conquered
he should raise his siedge, and depart with his hoste from
before the Cittie, deliuering and restoring into her repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
all such Citties, townes, borroughes, places, castels,
lands and seigniories, as he had taken and ruined, rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and restoring to her likewise, all the treasure, which
she spent to maintaine her resistance in warre, the vale we

               <p>If he pleased not to accept this offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she was determined
to kill her selfe with her owne handes, rather then shee
would graunt what he so earnestly desired. This councell
was so agreeable to the Queene, that presently she dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a messenger to <hi>Artabaz,</hi> to heare from him some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
or resolution. At this message hee did nothing but
smile and laugh, in derision and mockerie (as it were) assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himselfe of the victorie: and therefore accepted the
Combate, with knightes ordinarie armes of Launce and
Swoord: but to make short, the knight of the Flower and
hee combatted the next day man to man, in such sort and so
long time, as (after a fierce and extreame cruell fight) <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baz</hi>
was vanquished, and yeelded prisoner to the Queene
<hi>Lyxander:</hi> where by meanes of the knight of the Flower,

the mean of her deliuerance, entertayning and feasting him
there the space of a whole yere, euen perforce, as it were,
causing him to tarrie with her, so that in the end she became
enamoured of him, and but that she was a Pagan and hée a
Christian, he being lykewise else where vowed, she woulde
haue ioyned with him in marriage. And notwithstanding
this prohibiting bond, both of the one and other religion, she
could not support the extreame flame of this amorous fyre,
but being ouercome with incontinencie, was constrayned
to yeld her selfe in such sort, as she had knowledge of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

the young knight perceiuing, beeing wearie of these amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
sportings, which else where ought to be emploied, euen
in place where his heart serued, one daie secretly getting
from his companie, and being disguised, hee went whether
the winde and fortune would conduct him. At his departure
she was meruaylously discomforted, causing diligent search
to be made for him in all places her lande, as also far and
neare to enquire after him, being willing to change her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and become a Christian, onely to marrie with him, or
once more to get him in her custodie. But hearing by credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reporte, that hee was the valiaunt Brandismel, king of
great Britaine, who being a young knight, so chaunged his
name and disguised his armes, hauing espoused his Florixa,
from whome came the king Floridamant, of whome at this
daie is held such account: she comforted her selfe so well as
she could, and couered her fault so cunningly, that albeit shée
was great with child, she married with the worthie Knight

a goodly son called Florant, in remembraunce of the knight
of the Flower his father. Within thrée years after she had
thrée other sons, one named Adylas, the second Phoas, &amp; the

as euer liued in anie time.</p>
               <p>Now because Ferramond was chased forth of Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,

Florant grew strong and abie to carrie armes, who beeing
assisted with a mightie and puissaunt armie, and especially
imployed in these affayres, went forward with his charge so
effectually, that hee expelled thence Clarion and his people,
who grew into such vexation heereat, as séeing he was no

murdered him with certaine pistols, which for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

tooke himselfe to be his father, was so offended and grieued
hereat, as a good father will naturally be for the death of so
valiant a sonne, and sent Adylas his other sonne, with a far
more great and stately armie, to reuenge the death of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

                  <p>When <hi>Squamell</hi> had read these lines, he was so ouercome
with choller and despight, as letting fall the writing, he set
hand to his Semitarie, where with hee smote at the Ladie,
and cut her quite thorowe in the middest by her girdle: so
that the one part of the bodie, to wit, the head, neck, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and sides remained hanging on the tree, and the belly,
flankes, thighes, legges and féete tombled on the ground, a
thing very cruell, hideous, and gastly to be seene. Hauing
in this sorte some what appeased his anger, hee did nothing
but laugh, breathing foorth many iniurious spéeches against
her: at which very instant, an other Giant of meruailous
stature, exceeding <hi>Squamell</hi> in heighth by the head, arriued
there, who hearing him speake such vile wordes, and seeing
withall such an inhumaine déed: thought good to check and
reprooue him for it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Knight, thou mayst well blush with shame, that any one
should euer see thee beare marke of chiualrie, and the arms
which thou doost weare: imploying them so hadly as thou
hast doone, vpon a poore and miserable creature, whose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie

                     </gap>, as heauen, earth, and all contained therein do
admire them? especially this last déede by me doone vppon
this Ladie, is so deseruedly to be praised, as if thou knewest
the occasion thereof, thou wouldst commend and reckon me
among other knights of vertue, that doo dayly make high
estéeme of mee, and that more worthilie, than thou canst
dare thus rashlye to reprehend mee: but because I repute
thée vnworthie to know this occasion, I haue nothing else
to say vnto thée, but if with speed thou get thee not gon: I
will learne thee against an other time to speake more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in that I haue the power both to tame and teache. And
albeit thou art of bigger constitution then I, yet will I
shew thée, that in all the rest thou art farre lesse aud inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

and the bruite of thy name hath often héeretofore pierced
mine eares: yet (for all that) I am nothing hastie of flight,
because I doo not imagine thée to be so hardie and valiant,

thinke and assure thy selfe, that I who am Ergoferant, the

What, answered Squamell, art thou one of those thrée huge
Colosses, that serned as a terror to all Gréece? and of those
thrée remaineth none aliue but thée? Tell mee what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of thy brethren, for if they be dead, assure thy self I am
greatly displeased, in respect of the earnest desire I hadde to
combate with them, and conquere ye all thrée one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not for anie loue I dyd euer beare ye, or doubting anie
hatred ye all durst beare me. Content thy selfe, sayd Ergofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

                     </gap>st ther were such thrée, thou must now
enter the combate alone against me, I shall bee sufficient to
breake thy foolish pate, and cause thée quickly giue ouer this
proud daring spéech. To knowe what is become of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
how they were slaine, and by whome, I am not to tell
thée, because thou hast shewen to little curtesie to me, in scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to tell me this. Ladies misfortune, and the occasion of
thy hatred to her, vrging thée to committe such a monstrous
and inhumane act, in this respect I thinke thée vnworthie to
knowe theyr mishaps. I perceiue wel (quoth Squamel) why
thou darest not tell mee, because theyr ende was with such
shame and reproch, as it were thy dishonour, being their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to make report thereof, for perhaps, as it is no other like,
some knight of smal valour hath slain them, and by conquest
brought thée likewise vnder his obeisance. Thou liest in thy
throate, answered Ergoferant, for a knight of slender valor
could not conquere them, nor yet subiect me to his obedience,
but if I yelded my selfe to anie one, assure thy selfe hee was
no meane man of vertues. And that thou maist beare record
thereof, we trifle too much time in prating, let the effects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
which of vs two proueth most valiant, otherwise thou
doest but séeke occasion to shunne the combat, which take as
<pb facs="tcp:2883:107"/>
thou will, for I will dally no longer. So saying, with a
mightie mase which he bore, he let driue at his aduersarie, &amp;
the stroke fell with such violence, he standing with his semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
drawen to defend it, as had hee not withstoode it with
wonderfull strength, it had layde him on the grounde. But
Squamell well awarded this horrible blow, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
anie great domage therby, and deliuered back a sound
answere for the same with his semitarie, which the gyaunt
escaped in as ample manner: and thus began between them
a sharpe and cruell fight, continuing the space of two hours,
without discouery which side had most aduantage, but in the
end it so fell out, that Squamel was readier to fight on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
than the other, knowing howe to tourne and manage
his horse for most harme to his enemie, mary Ergoferant
was nothing so nimble, only his strokes were more waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
than his aduersaries, but he was nothing comparable in
dexterie and nimblenes, which is the onely thing required
in a combat. At length Squamel began to be verie sore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
when sodainely ariued in place a knight of so little
stature, as he might easily stand vnder the cleft of eyther of
them, he galloping with the full carrire of his horse, hauing
a fayre broad glistering sword in his hand, which hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so lightly, as if it had bin a litle riding wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yet was it in
sight so heauie, as it he could not haue lifted it with both his
hands. To each of the combattants hee gaue a meruaylous
stroke, saying, holde and cease your fighting, to tell me forth
the occasion of your combat. Ergoferant was astonned here
at, as giuing his horse the bridle, without conduct or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he ranne awaie, kéeping no direct course, but here and
there ouer the forest, as in short space he was farre inough
from his enemie. Squamel likewise was so amazed with
his stroke, as albeit hee rained his horse as strongly as hee
could, yet ran he away with him swifter than the wind, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
him also as far off the other waie. Heereat they both
meruailed not a litle, especially the short knight, who séeing
<pb facs="tcp:2883:107"/>
them fight so fiercely, reputed them of greater valor than to
flie awaie so spéedily. But kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
