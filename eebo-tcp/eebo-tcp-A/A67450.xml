            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>You! Sacred Writers of the <hi>Muses</hi> Tribe,</l>
               <l>In lasting Numbers must the Pomp describe:</l>
               <l>Each should be ready at the doleful Call,</l>
               <l>And All lament a Loss that touches All.</l>
               <l>Let no vain Fear deterr an opening <hi>Muse;</hi>

               <l>Nor Modesty their want of Zeal excuse:</l>
               <l>When Sorrow is become the Publick Test;</l>
               <l>'Tis he who grieves the most, that writes the best.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>See! See! The melancholy Scene appears!</l>
               <l>And see a Nation overflow'd with Tears!</l>
               <l>See how their Looks unfeign'd Affliction show!</l>
               <l>And all their Discords melted into Woe!</l>

               <l>Each will have Tears too few to mourn his own.</l>
               <l>The Poor their Aid; the Church its firm Support;</l>
               <l>Its Pride the Nation; its Delight the Court;</l>
               <l>Her Foes (if any Foes to her cou'd live)</l>
               <l>An injur'd Princess ready to forgive;</l>
               <l>Her Sex a Pattern of a Spotless Life;</l>
               <l>The King a Friend, a Partner, and a Wife.</l>

               <l>Now clear the way! let the sad Pageant move!</l>
               <l>And give the Nation leave t' express their Love!</l>
               <l>The Great and Mighty too must take their Turn;</l>
               <l>Nor shou'd the meànest be forbid to Mourn.</l>
               <l>While such a dismal Cause for Grief appears,</l>
               <l>'Twere barb'rous to restrain a Man from Tears.</l>
               <l>Her Soul so many Vertues did engross,</l>
               <l>That every State has some peculiar Loss.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First, Let the Poor her Charity declare,</l>
               <l>With unaffected Tears, and grateful Pray'r:</l>
               <l>Oh Heaven! (they cry) the Queen! the Queen is dead!</l>
               <l>Her Grandeur fall'n, and all Her Glories fled!</l>
               <l>Oh ye inexorable Pow'ers! When you,</l>
               <l>Doom'd Her sad Fate, you shou'd have doom'd ours too.</l>
               <l>Or was it doom'd? Tho' Death you yet deferr,</l>
               <l>We lost our only Means of Life in Her.</l>
               <l>Now She is gone, who shall our Wants supply?</l>
               <l>Attend our Miseries? Or hear our Cry?</l>
               <l>Who, when they're Happy, mind their Neighbours Ill?</l>
               <l>Or, free from Want, reflect what others feel?</l>
               <l>In Her that Pious Care appear'd alone;</l>
               <l>She made the People's Miseries Her own;</l>
               <l>In midst of Glory sigh'd for unfelt Woe;</l>
               <l>Nor, cou'd be blest, while others were not so;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94920:3"/>Heaven, that Her Vertues to the Throne preferrs,</l>
               <l>Seem'd more to mind our Safety, sure, than Hers;</l>
               <l>Plac'd like the Sun in so sublime a Sphere;</l>
               <l>That She more freely might relieve us here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next, Let the Church its solemn Grief reveal,</l>
               <l>And mourn Her Piety, and Christian Zeal;</l>
               <l>Not Zeal like theirs that sets the World in Flames;</l>
               <l>Where that and Barb'rous Rage by diff'rent Names</l>
               <l>Express the self-same thing; She better knew</l>
               <l>What milder Paths Religion shou'd persue;</l>
               <l>All Pride, and Rancour from Her Breast removes;</l>
               <l>By Piety alone Her Faith She proves;</l>
               <l>That Sacred Maxime rightly understood;</l>
               <l>They best believe, that do the greatest Good;</l>
               <l>For, whatsoe'er peculiar Sects have thought;</l>
               <l>This was the Doctrine that our Saviour taught.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tho' diff'rent Cares Her Princely Breast might share,</l>
               <l>Yet still the Church was Her peculiar Care,</l>
               <l>Nor Partial yet; but knowing that the best,</l>
               <l>And easiest Method to reform the rest:</l>
               <l>For who on Preachers Doctrines can rely,</l>
               <l>When all their Actions, give their Words the Lye?</l>
               <l>To this our late Corruptions owe their Rise:</l>
               <l>The Land was plung'd into a Sea of Vice;</l>
               <l>Men by Prophaneness to Preferment haste,</l>
               <l>And Women thought it Scandal to be Chaste;</l>
               <l>Under a Load of Crimes the Nations groan;</l>
               <l>The Queen with Pious Thoughts ascends the Throne;</l>
               <l>Resolves judiciously t' oppose its Force:</l>
               <l>First, by Example She restrains the Course;</l>
               <l>Vertue's no longer made the Vulgar Sport,</l>
               <l>Nor Leudness passes for a Jest at Court.</l>

               <l>And Publick Spirits share the Publick Trust:</l>
               <l>Prelates, tho' made still by the Sovereign Choice,</l>
               <l>Seem recommended by the People's Voice;</l>
               <l>She too, whose Royal Hand had place'd 'em there,</l>
               <l>Taught 'em to move, and to adorn their Sphere.</l>
               <l>Religious Lives successfully they Teach,</l>
               <l>By giving Patterns of the Lives they Preach;</l>
               <l>This seen by all; by all must be confest.</l>
               <l>'Tis true, She liv'd not to mature the rest;</l>
               <l>Those Glorious Scenes that were for Peace design'd;</l>
               <l>Those Seeds of Wonders brooding in Her Mind;</l>
               <l>Yet had we been as Worthy to receive</l>
               <l>Those Gracious Favours, as the Queen to give;</l>
               <l>Heaven, without doubt, had spar'd Her precious Blood;</l>
               <l>Her Schemes had taken, and Her Platforms stood;</l>
               <l>Taught by our Loss, let us the Cause reverse,</l>
               <l>And mend the Manners that produc'd the Curse;</l>

               <l>But see that Lovely Melancholly Train,</l>
               <l>That droop like Lillies over-charg'd with Rain!</l>
               <l>The Ladies, now divested of their Pride,</l>
               <l>Each Ornament of Beauty laid aside;</l>
               <l>No more in vain Disputes their Time mispend,</l>
               <l>But only for their Share of Grief contend.</l>
               <l>Taught, at too dear a Price, that Fatal Truth,</l>

               <l>The Nations Glory, and the Publick Care,</l>
