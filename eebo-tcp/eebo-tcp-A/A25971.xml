            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>FOrbear, vain Muse, to vent thy Passion here,</l>
               <l>Thou canst not offer one ingenuous Tear;</l>
               <l>Nor mayst thou hope thy unregarded Verse</l>
               <l>Can have admittance to this Sacred Herse.</l>
               <l>Yet Silence here wou'd be Ingratitude,</l>
               <l>'Tis then more pardonable to be rude.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If Men of Sense and Fancy more sublime</l>
               <l>Condemn th' unpolish'd meanness of thy Rhime;</l>
               <l>This just Excuse for that Disorder shew,</l>
               <l>Tell them thy Thoughts are Discompos'd and Thou.</l>
               <l>Less Mourners may Methodically weep,</l>
               <l>Thy o're swoln Grief within no Bounds will keep.</l>
               <l>Then venture to bewail thy rigid Fate,</l>
               <l>And with the Saint departed thus expostulate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah! Why so soon didst thou resign thy Breath,</l>
               <l>And leave the World Impoverish'd by thy Death?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48011:3"/>Didst thou, to taste some Heavenly Bliss unknown,</l>
               <l>Destroy our pleasure to increase thine own?</l>
               <l>Ah no, thou knewst no such inferior Ends,</l>
               <l>Thy nobler Aim still was t' oblige thy Friends;</l>
               <l>For them thou hast thy Best Enjoyments given,</l>
               <l>And might'st a while defer thy flight to Heav'n.</l>
               <l>For no Bliss there to thee cou'd Foreign prove</l>
               <l>Thy Conversation was so much Above</l>
               <l>And thou enjoyd'st of Heav'n so large a store,</l>
               <l>That Consummation scarce cou'd give thee more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy Love soard high, above all Human Aim,</l>
               <l>Angels scarce boast a more Exalted Flame;</l>
               <l>Scarce to their God more Frequent Homage pay,</l>
               <l>Nor thou less Serious, less Devout than they;</l>
               <l>On his Great Work thou didst thy time bestow,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor was the Case which did this Jewel hold,</l>
               <l>Made of Course Earth cast in a Common Mold;</l>
               <l>But suited to the Beauty of thy Mind,</l>
               <l>Thy Body too was polish'd and refin'd.</l>
               <l>Thy Face so Heav'nly, we believ'd it still</l>
               <l>Not Human, till we found it passible.</l>
               <l>Till Envious Time, to lessen our regard,</l>
               <l>By stealth the lovely Frontispiece impair'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet Time design'd this Injury in vain,</l>
               <l>Beauty amidst the Ruins did remain,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>But Heav'n displeas'd to see that Work abus'd</l>

               <l>That it no Ruin, no Decay shall know.</l>
               <l>But Lasting and Impregnable shall be</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah! then forbear, mistaken Muse, in vain</l>
               <l>In thy Hibernian Dialect to complain.</l>
               <l>Demand no more why the Bright Soul is fled</l>
               <l>And left our Joys, like her lov'd Body, dead:</l>
               <l>But if thy Flight can track her through the Air,</l>
               <l>Follow and see her great Reception there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Angels in Choirs croud the new Guest to meet,</l>

               <l>Now comes a noble Troop, in Heav'n well known,</l>
               <l>A Troop of Works which she on Earth had done;</l>
               <l>Of Pray'rs untold a very numerous Train;</l>
               <l>For oft she us'd to pray, and ne'r in vain.</l>
