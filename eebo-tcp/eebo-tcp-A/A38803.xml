         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is now almost five Years since, that finding so little written
on this Subject of <hi>Medals</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> and so very much in
the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and the most Learned Languages; I
imployed some hours in putting some Notes together, and
into such Method, as might serve (I thought) for Institution:
But whilst part of it was already ingaged, and the rest finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Press, I was told, the Learned, and my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Friend, Mr. <hi>O. Walker</hi> (than whom, none of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that I know, is better able) was publishing a Book upon the
same Design; which caused me to deliberate, and leave it off, lest
I should <hi>actum agere:</hi> But when I had perused that Excellent
Piece, and Historical Part, and considered how many Authors of
the Learned'st Nations about us, had notwithstanding the plenty of
Treatises, published large and ample Volumes on this Subject (for
I could reckon more than Forty) and that tho' there possibly might
no wide and spacious Fields be left uncultivated; there were yet some
Corners, and little Wasts, not altogether subacted, and so Improv'd,
as to admit of no more dressing.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account, I have inserted all that I thought material,
and so handsomly delivered to us by many others; especially, by the
Anonymous <hi>Author De la Science,</hi> &amp;c. published long since this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
but to which I acknowledge my self greatly, and almost only, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
That therefore in this Discourse, I now and then seem to repeat
what is already said; neither can, nor indeed, ought by any means to be
omitted: All who write for Institution (of whatever Art or Science)
commence with Principles and <hi>Postulata;</hi> Grammarians with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Letters: The Mathematician (after five hundred Volumes
published of that Study) begin with Points and Lines, and the
simplest Figures: And tho' I therefore needed no Apology on that
account; I have yet contracted very much I had prepared, and was
necessary, out of Respect to what I found already so well performed:
The Reader will yet find something New, and Entertaining, and I
hope, not unuseful in this Essay; at least accept of my Good-Will,
<pb facs="tcp:61438:4"/>
which is all I ask, besides his Pardon (or Act of Oblivion indeed
rather) of Typographical Errata, and my own Imperfections.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, as to what I have advanced concerning Modern
<hi>Medals,</hi> and their <hi>Reverses</hi> (in <hi>Chap. III.)</hi> I do not pretend, much
less affirm, that all, whose Types are there exhibited, were Stamp'd
by Public Decree of the Prince or Magistrate (as neither were all
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Medals</hi> yet extant:) But as they are
such as relate to the Confirmation of some remarkable Matter of
Fact, discover the Genius of the Age, and link the History of divers
notorious Passages of the latter Centuries and Revolutions; and
thereby incite others, who have better Store and Opportunities of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
what I have first Begun, and to Supply my Defects.</p>
            <p>One thing more I am to acquaint the Reader, who may wonder
to find that seeming Digression concerning the late, and (I wish I
could not say) present Diminution of Money in the Chapter of <hi>Mints,</hi>
as unseasonably Resumed after so many able Persons had already
published their Thoughts upon it: But, as that was written when
that Epidemical and destructive Villany was yet flagrant; so was it
long since by me presented out of this Copy, to one of the Right
Honourable the Lords of the Treasury, and which, since I could not
retrieve from the <hi>Printer,</hi> will, I presume, justifie me, as well as
what I have said <hi>Page 42.</hi> concerning the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with
some other Passages: Which, with all the other Defects of the Book,
and Errors of the Press, will, I hope, obtain the Favour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Readers.</p>

A
DISCOURSE
OF
MEDALS.</head>
         <div type="introduction">
            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>EVERY one who is a lover of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of <hi>Marbles</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> may yet neither
have the faculty to be at so vast a Charge, or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Collecting them at so easie and tollerable
an Expence, as he may of <hi>Medals;</hi> which well and judicially
chose, have always been esteemed (and that worthily) not
only an Ornament, but an useful and necessary Appendage
to a <hi>Library.</hi> And verily, if we consider <hi>Medals</hi> in respect
of the Matter; they are, for ought appears, the most last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and (give me leave to call them) Vocal Monuments of
Antiquity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptian Pyramids</hi> are indeed vast and enormous heaps
of Stones, burthening the ground on which they stand; but
they are mute and dead, without any Soul, or so much as
Character on them, to tell us by wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; or to what end they
were erected. Wherefore among all the various ways that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61438:6"/>
men have sought Immortality and Freedom from Oblivion,
by <hi>Marbles, Statues, Trophies,</hi> &amp;c. Nay even by <hi>Books</hi> (Holy
Scriptures, dictated and preserved by their <hi>Divine Author,</hi> only
excepted) there is nothing in all this Tract of Time that has
proved more lasting than these <hi>Nummi Memoriales,</hi> which we
call <hi>Medals:</hi> Witness those inscrib'd <hi>AETERNITATI &amp;
PERPETVITATI AVGVSTI, ROMAE AETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAE,
AETERNAE MEMORIAE,</hi> and the like. Nay
even the very Names as well as Actions of many famous
Persons, had been long since as unknown as if they had never
been at all, but for these small pieces of Metal, which seem
to have broken and worn out the very Teeth of Time, that
devours and tears in pieces all things else.</p>
            <p>We cannot without grief consider, that of once so many
thousand <hi>Statues,</hi> nay (as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms) in number almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to living Men, there are hardly four or five at this day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
intire and unblemish'd. Neither could the <hi>Colossian</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of some of them secure them from decay. Marbles with
their deepest Inscriptions crumble away, and become no more
legible: <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> fade. What's now become of all
those admired Works of <hi>Apelles, Zeuxis, Phidias, Praxiteles,</hi>
and the rest of those Celebrated Artists? What of so many
antient Books as once filled those Noble and Royal Libraries
at <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Alexandria?</hi> 'Tis deplorable even to consider,
what irreparable loss the Learned World has suffered by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Conflagrations and other funest Accidents, as have not only
dissipated, but quite consum'd infinite numbers of Volumnes;
so as of all that Noble and Venerable Store, so very few in
comparison are left us, that there is hardly to be found a <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi>
in the whole World which can honestly pretend to above
eight hundred, or a thousand years Antiquity, and to have so
long escap'd the rage of Fire, Wars, or (what is worse) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Ignorance, and Fanatick Zeal: whilst <hi>Medals</hi> (though
even these likewise, as all other Sublunary things, be not
wholy exempt from diminution, through the Avarice of some,
who have melted down all they could get of them of <hi>Gold</hi> or
<hi>Silver</hi>) have surviv'd, and out lasted the most antient Records,
and transmitted to us the knowledge of a thousand useful things
of twice a thousand years past. 'Tis on this account that there
is lately an <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Medalists</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> where in the <hi>Royal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61438:6"/>
Palace,</hi> all those Gentlemen meet, whose Curiosity and Genius
lead them to the study of <hi>Medals, Inscriptions,</hi> and like Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.
And indeed the advantages which <hi>Divines, Historians,
Chronologers, Criticks,</hi> and other Learned Men (witness <hi>Scaliger,
Lipsius, Salmasius, Peireskius, Vossius, Holstenius, Gottofredus,
Signor Noris,</hi> (once Chief Library keeper of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and
now Cardinal) <hi>Antonie Pagi</hi> of <hi>Aix, &amp;c.</hi> and some few of our
Nation, as <hi>Camden, Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Marsham,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon D' Ewes,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> the late Bishops <hi>Walton,</hi> and <hi>Pearson,</hi> have deriv'd
from the light which <hi>Medals</hi> have contributed to their Studies;
and the benefit that may accrue by them even to the greatest
Princes and Politicians (as the Learned <hi>Cuperus</hi> shews in that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Dissertation concerning the <hi>Apotheosis</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> speaking
of <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> and antient <hi>Marbles;</hi> but <hi>instar omnium</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
Learned <hi>Spanheim</hi>) sufficiently discover for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they are and have been cherish'd and search'd after with so
much Passion and Industry in other Countries; though so little
understood or minded in this of Ours: where yet the <hi>Romans</hi>
once fixed their Victorious Eagles, planted so many Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and left so many <hi>Monuments</hi> of their Residence.</p>
            <p>With the assistance then of many Learned Foreigners who
have expresly written of <hi>Medals,</hi> as well in their own Languages
as the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue; that I might in some measure cultivate
so useful and diverting a Study, and supply the want of Books
in our Own, I thought a Treatise on this Subject might not
be unacceptable.</p>

         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Use of Medals, whether for Mony, or to preserve the
Memory of worthy Actions; their Antiquity, Materials, Size,
Model, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Shall not here detain the Reader with any prolix Discourse
of the antient <hi>Moneys</hi> and their Value, so many Ages ago
first used in <hi>Trafick,</hi> and succeeding that Original Barter, or
Commutation of one Commodity for another, which <hi>Tacitus</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61438:7"/>
and <hi>Pliny</hi> affirm was previous to <hi>Money</hi> (especially among the
antient <hi>Germans</hi>) till some more precious Matter, as Metal, for
its rarity and beauty, durable texture, and easiness of carriage,
became the Price of things, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> shews us in his <hi>Politicks:</hi>
But in all appearance the first Purchases were generally with
Cattel, the <hi>Kishitah</hi> or Lamb; wherein consisted the innocent
Riches of elder times, before there was any <hi>Money</hi> known or
coin'd. Whence some Expositors for <hi>centum Nummis (Gen.
c. 33. v. 19.)</hi> will have it read <hi>centum Agnis;</hi> though it will
still remain a question, whether <hi>Agnus</hi> there do signifie proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Lamb,</hi> or rather <hi>Money</hi> marked and stamped with the
image of a <hi>Lamb.</hi> For <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi>
being so great a Master in Cattel, and abounding in Flocks,
might probably set that figure on the <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> which he
us'd. And indeed that <hi>Money</hi> was in use very early; the three
and twentieth Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> and other Texts which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>probatam Monetam,</hi> seems to make clear, both as to the
<hi>Weight, Species,</hi> or both. And as among the <hi>Romans</hi> from the
Figure of <hi>Cattel</hi> stamped and impressed upon the Metal, 'tis
generally conceiv'd the name of <hi>Money</hi> obtain'd, <hi>à Pecore Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunia;</hi>
of which see <hi>Varro, Pliny, Plutarch,</hi> and the <hi>Medal</hi> in
<hi>Gente Rustia</hi> mention'd by <hi>Ursinus:</hi> so <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Money might be
call'd <hi>Keshitah</hi> from the Impress of a <hi>Lamb.</hi> So a sort of Coin
was called <hi>Bos</hi> antiently at <hi>Athens,</hi> as now <hi>Corvus</hi> at <hi>Basil,</hi> from
the Figures impressed on them; and not many Ages since
Mouttons among the <hi>French,</hi> as bearing a <hi>Sheep</hi> on the Coin:
and so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of old among the <hi>Athenians, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerians,
Aurelians;</hi> as we <hi>Iacobus</hi>'s, <hi>Carolus</hi>'s, <hi>Horse-men</hi> from
the Figure or Effigies they bear; nay sometimes from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
or Workman; as heretofore our golden <hi>Florens</hi> in the Reign
of <hi>Edward III.</hi> coin'd by certain <hi>Florentine</hi> Moneyers, who were
it seems imploy'd here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Copper</hi> or other Metal, used in Traffick, whether
form'd into Vessels, Oeconomic Utensils, and Instruments of
Husbandry, which those who had more than they need, might
exchange for other necessaries, or afterwards cut and divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Plates, and value by weight or pound, not unlike to what
is still familiar among the <hi>Sweeds</hi> rich in Copper (or when any
Stamp or Devise was first set on it in the several Kingdoms and
Republicks by Authority of the Magistrate, to render it more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61438:7"/>
Current, than otherwise its natural and intrinsic Value alone
would amount to, and which apparently at first prevailed) I
am not in pain about. But that at first it was plain, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Character, is the most probable and received Opinion, 'til
that was added by those to whom belonged the Prerogative of
Coining upon a Legal Account, for the ease and benefit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
This is certain, that among the <hi>Romans</hi> the first Species
antiently minted, namely <hi>Brass,</hi> was without any mark at all,
till the Reign of <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi> who stamp'd it <hi>nota pecudum</hi>
from whence it was called <hi>Pecunia,</hi> as we have already observ'd.
Before his time it was payed by Weight only; so as there was no
Buying or Selling without the Scales. And the first design of
Coining in every Country was to save the labour and trouble
of Weighing; the Stamp being a publick Testimony, that
such a piece was of such a Weight, and so might pass in Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
without the trial of the Scales. At first therefore among
the <hi>Romans</hi> the <hi>As</hi> was adequately of a Pound or Twelve Ounces
Weight; whence also it was called <hi>Libella:</hi> And thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
till the publick necessity in that sharp and expensive
War (the first against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) made them call in the
old <hi>Asses,</hi> and Coin new ones weighing no more than two
Ounces a piece; though of the same reputed Value and Name
with the Old. These new Coined ones had on the front a
double <hi>Ianus,</hi> on the <hi>Reverse</hi> a <hi>Prow</hi> of a <hi>Ship;</hi> the former
Effigies of the <hi>Pecus</hi> being laid aside. The like Exigency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
in the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War, reduced the <hi>As</hi> still lower;
and new ones were stamped, weighing only a single Ounce:
After this a Law was Enacted, to melt down those Ounce <hi>Asses,</hi>
and set out new ones of half an Ounce. And at this last pitch
they generally continued, during the time of the <hi>Republick.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>As,</hi> other smaller Moneys of <hi>Copper</hi> were in use; as
the <hi>Semissis,</hi> the <hi>Triens,</hi> the <hi>Quadrans,</hi> the <hi>Sextans;</hi> each having
its appellation from the proportion it bore to the <hi>As.</hi> The
<hi>Quadrans</hi> was of old called <hi>Teruntius;</hi> because it weigh'd three
Ounces, as long as the <hi>As</hi> weighed an intire Pound: But when
the <hi>As</hi> was reduced to half an Ounce, the <hi>Quadrans</hi> by degrees
lost its old name, being diminished proportionably to the eighth
part of an Ounce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61438:8"/>
The first <hi>Silver</hi> stamped at <hi>Rome,</hi> was a little before the first
<hi>Punic</hi> War: the <hi>Denarius,</hi> so call'd from its Primitive Value,
which was Ten <hi>Asses</hi> of <hi>Brass;</hi> the <hi>Quinarius</hi> worth Five, and
the <hi>Sestertius</hi> worth Two and Half. But in the Second <hi>Punic</hi>
War, when there was a necessity of inhancing Mony to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the publick Extraordinaries; as in the First they had
raised the Price of <hi>Brass</hi> Mony; so now the <hi>Denarius</hi> (though
of the same weight as before) was made equal in Value to Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<hi>Asses,</hi> the <hi>Quinarius</hi> to Eight, and the <hi>Sestertius</hi> to Four.
The Impress on the <hi>Silver</hi> Coin at first was a Chariot: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Devises were varied, as the Mint-Master pleased.
That Piece which bears the Head of <hi>Roma</hi> with a winged Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
on, and frequently some Sacrificing Vessel, intimated (as
some conjecture) that <hi>Rome</hi> had by her Arms, Diligence, and
Care of Religion, been made Empress of the World: and
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself has something to this Sense, in his <hi>City of
God,</hi> speaking of the wonderful success of that <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these Moneys of <hi>Silver</hi> we sometimes meet, besides <hi>Figure</hi>
and <hi>Device,</hi> with other Marks and Characters, denoting the
Value of the Pieces: Thus X stamped on the <hi>Denarius</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>denos aeris,</hi> and declares it to be worth ten <hi>Asses</hi> of <hi>Brass:</hi>
V the mark of <hi>Quinarius,</hi> five <hi>Asses;</hi> and H S the note of the
<hi>Sestertius,</hi> two and an half. But we meet with some few <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii</hi>
marked with XVI, and <hi>Quinarii</hi> with VIII; an indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they were coin'd in those times, when the Value of
the <hi>Denarius</hi> was inhaunc'd from its original Value of Ten
<hi>Asses</hi> to that of Sixteen. In the <hi>Consulars</hi> of <hi>Brass</hi> the Price and
Weight of the <hi>Mony</hi> is sometimes denoted by a certain number
of Points, signifying so many Twelfths of the <hi>As:</hi> so the
<hi>Sextans</hi> is marked with two points, the <hi>Quadrans</hi> with three,
and the <hi>Triens</hi> with four: And thus remained the <hi>antient Mony</hi>
with those <hi>Stamps</hi> and <hi>Emblems,</hi> whilst that glorious Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
continued; after which we find how the succeeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
adorned them with their own Heads, Effigies, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
according to their several Fancies.</p>
            <p>But now after all we have said of <hi>Roman Mony,</hi> none is there
so frequently and honorably mention'd, none so peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61438:8"/>
the name of <hi>Nummus,</hi> none has so much exercised the
<hi>Criticks,</hi> as the <hi>Sestertius,</hi> wearing for its Badge, <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>
with the Head of <hi>Roma;</hi> marked by H S, and called <hi>Sesterti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
quasi Semitertius,</hi> from its primitive Value, two <hi>Asses</hi> and
an half of the Third. And here our Young <hi>Medalists</hi> must
take notice of a peculiar way of speaking in use among the
<hi>Romans;</hi> that is, whereas <hi>Sestertius</hi> signifies a single <hi>Sesterce,</hi>
and <hi>Decem Sestertii,</hi> so many single <hi>Sesterces;</hi> yet <hi>Decem Sester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
(in the Neuter Gender) signifies ten thousand of them, and
<hi>Decies Sestertium</hi> (in the Neuter Singular) no less than ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand.</p>
            <p>The last Metal that came to the <hi>Roman</hi> Mint was <hi>Gold,</hi>
sixty two years after <hi>Silver, C. Claudius Nero,</hi> and <hi>M. Livius
Salinator</hi> II Cos. stamped generally with the same Devices,
as the <hi>Silver</hi> Mony, weighing two Ounces of <hi>Silver,</hi> and
was valued at twenty five of them; the worth of <hi>Gold</hi> to
<hi>Silver</hi> of equal Weight bearing then the Proportion of twelve
and a half to one. Though in the earliest times <hi>Gold</hi> had
only a <hi>decuple</hi> value of <hi>Silver,</hi> both among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may suffice then for a tast of what antiently were
the Products of the <hi>Roman Mints:</hi> Those who would be more
accurately Instructed may consult the learned <hi>Budaeus, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,
Hottoman, Iacobus Bontius, Scaliger, Snellius Capellus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vot;</hi>
our Country men <hi>Breerwood, Greaves;</hi> and for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
of all Nations at present Trafficking through out the
World; that useful, and excellent Account given us in <hi>Malin</hi>'s
<hi>Lex Mercatoria;</hi> the late <hi>Lexicographers</hi> and others treating <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>professo</hi>
of <hi>Coines</hi> and <hi>Mony;</hi> their <hi>Definition, Notation, Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
Estimate, Fabrick, &amp;c.</hi> together with the <hi>Notitia Imperii;</hi>
where the Curious may find a full Account of these, and of the
<hi>Procuratores Monetarum,</hi> of which every <hi>Mint</hi> had one distinctly
to govern it, and (under the <hi>Comes Largitionum</hi>) to inspect these
matters.</p>
            <p>I pass by some other Coins larger in bulk and shew, as the
<hi>Majorana</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Cade</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> being of <hi>Silver</hi>
debased with <hi>Copper;</hi> as I also do the <hi>Bezantines</hi> and others
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61438:9"/>
counted by Weight and not by Pieces; as likewise those of the
later Stamp and Empire, the <hi>Ceratia</hi> or <hi>Siliqua; Miliareuse,</hi>
and the <hi>Follis, </hi> and now proceed to <hi>Consular</hi> Coins, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;</hi>
not as priz'd for the intrinsick worth of the <hi>Metal</hi> only,
but for the Knowledge they communicate to the Learned, and
such as on that account prefer them to sordid Gain; since it
may happen, that a <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Copper</hi> may be of more Value to
the <hi>Knowing,</hi> than its weight in <hi>Gold,</hi> as an <hi>Otho</hi> in the <hi>Grand
Bronze.</hi> In the mean time I am far from being convinc'd,
that what we call <hi>Medals</hi> did always pass for bare and simple
<hi>Mony,</hi> as the name seems to import and challenge by the sound.
The Problem is indeed learnedly discuss'd by <hi>Antonius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus,
Sebastian Erizius, Aeneas Vicus</hi> and others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
generally in the affirmative; but I think all, except the
<hi>Iesuit Hardoin</hi> make exception to <hi>Medalions, Imperials,</hi> and
those of larger size. For these could not be design'd for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Mony,</hi> being evidently stamp'd (to me more especially)
upon solemn and extraordinary Occasions and Events; as the
more curious and elaborate <hi>Reverses, Legenda,</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions</hi>
evince, as well as the Shape and Model, for the most part too
large and thick for common Exchange and Use; Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their paucity, being rarely found in that great aboundance,
and of the same Emperor and Percussion, as are daily the
smaller <hi>Monies,</hi> more accommodate to Commerce. And
though the <hi>Senat</hi> and People of <hi>Rome</hi> honoured their <hi>Caesars</hi>
(as we shall come to shew) by decreeing their <hi>Effigies</hi> should
be set on their <hi>Coins</hi> (as we may learn from our Blessed <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s
Question to the Captious <hi>Iews</hi>) yet does it not, I think,
infer, that where we find an <hi>Emperors</hi> or <hi>Consuls</hi> Head on a
<hi>Medal,</hi> it must therefore be common <hi>Mony:</hi> Nor does the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
weigh light with me which was alledg'd by <hi>Cobergeus</hi> to
the Noble <hi>Peireskius,</hi> consulting him about this matter; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the impossibility of <hi>Medals</hi> being made for current <hi>Mony;</hi>
forasmuch as the very <hi>Type,</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of one single Stamp,
would have taken up at least two months time of the most
diligent Artist to finish it for the Hammer, and then not endure
the Coining of above two or three hundred; which being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
batter'd and impair'd (if for <hi>Mony</hi>) the Charge of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would far have exceeded the value of the Species. To this it
being answered, that the <hi>Romans</hi> using the Industry of their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61438:9"/>
Slaves, (it cost them little or nothing) <hi>Cobergius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that could not be, since Slaves and servile Persons,
were by an express Statute prohibited the Painting any thing,
or so much as Learning, or using the Art of Drawing and
Design; without which address it could not possibly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished:
For that ingenuous Quality being taken into the
<hi>Liberal Arts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nat. Hist. l. 35. c. 10.</note> it was, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, defended <hi>Perpetuo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicto,

that any excellent Piece of that nature, was the Work of a
Slave or servile Hand. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Medals</hi> been look'd on as Pieces of <hi>Money</hi> only, they
would not (as we said) have been held in that estimation,
as we find they were; and by the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> and
other Princes, given and received as Jewels; Presents and
<hi>Missilia</hi> made of them as marks of Honour. But not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
the Reader with these Researches, (which have already
taken up large Volumes well deserving the perusal;) 'tis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the Dignity of <hi>Money</hi> abstracted from <hi>Medals,</hi> that
the Scriptures repeat the antient Use of it for the Purchase of
Lands and Commodities; and that <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> as most
pretious, beautiful, and least obnoxious to rust and decay,
(such as was proved and refin'd;) were the Matter, valu'd
for its intrinsic Goodness, long before we hear of it in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Authors; however in after Times, not only all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Metals</hi> were imploy'd, but their purity debased, and
alloy'd with ignoble Mixtures and Adulterations, as necessity
and occasion requir'd: Of which <hi>Plutarch, Zondras, Xiphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and other Historians afford many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
Thus we read, that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> (tho an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Prince) compos'd a <hi>Melange</hi> of a fifth part of
<hi>Silver,</hi> and a fourth of <hi>Gold;</hi> (by <hi>Pliny</hi> call'd <hi>Electrum) Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla</hi>
dishonoured it with <hi>Lead;</hi> or to reckon better, the
degeneration not of Money and Metals only, but of all the
politer Arts, succeeded that Inundation of the <hi>Goths,</hi> not so
much invading as invited in to their Destruction.</p>
            <p>Here then ended the lustre of <hi>Medals,</hi> Riches, and Glory
of that renowned Empire, counting from the Dictatorship of
<hi>Cesar,</hi> impress'd on the finest <hi>Silver;</hi> and so continuing till <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
or as some say, from <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, to <hi>Caracalla</hi>
(whom now we mentioned;) when after this <hi>Gordian</hi> made
his Coin, half of <hi>Brass,</hi> till the <hi>Posthumi,</hi> and so down to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61438:10"/>
who indeed restored it to some degree of splendor,
both as to the Matter and Form again, until about the Reign
of <hi>Phocas,</hi> when Church-Tyranny began with that of the
<hi>Turk,</hi> and both East and Western Empire were Ruin'd, by
the Ambition of the one, and Arms of the other.</p>
            <p>The truth is, after the first three hundred years of the <hi>Cesars,</hi>
there was very little care of any Coins, preserving the <hi>Roman</hi>
Majesty by <hi>Medals.</hi> For from thence to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> we meet
with none but small, thin, despicable Pieces, without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo;</hi>
and from the Division of the Empire, since the death
of that Prince, nothing save barbarous in <hi>Figure, Reverse,
Character, Legend, &amp;c.</hi> so as none looked any more after
them: Nor recover'd they any sort of value for either their
Beauty or <hi>Metal,</hi> for almost a Thousand Years; when <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Architecture</hi> began to revive, and rose as it were out
of the dust. This first Resurrection one may reckon to be
about the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> or the Reign of <hi>Iohn</hi>
Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> somewhat before, when there was
struck a <hi>Golden Medal,</hi> representing the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> with
some tolerable Art.</p>
            <p>As to other Nations, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Coin was first in
Lead; that of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Iron; and even some <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
both of the Republick and Imperial, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Silver</hi> upon this sturdy and inflexible <hi>Metal;</hi> of which our
Ancestors the <hi>Britains</hi> had not only Plates engraven with
Flowers and Animals of hideous shape, but Chains and Rings
of it instead of Money. Our learned <hi>Selden</hi> (speaking of
the <hi>Bracteate</hi> Coin) seems to infer their beating it extremely
thin a long while after, to prevent its being counterfeited; so
as a Piece of Money which was then worth but a Penny, made
square, and with Coins or Corners (as then they shap'd it, till
<hi>Henry</hi> the First turned it round again) might easily be broken
into two, or four parts for Half-pence and Farthings, as some
of our worn-out and detrited <hi>Harry</hi>

And <hi>Philip Comines</hi> says, that Money was so exceedingly
scarce in <hi>France</hi> after the Ransom of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> Son of
<hi>Phil. de Valois,</hi> that they did use <hi>Leather</hi> Money, through
which a small Boss-nail of <hi>Silver</hi> was struck in the middle,
as we now find a little piece of <hi>Copper</hi> in our Tin Farthings,
to give them strength and value. The sum of the Ransom, it
seems, was so vast (as Money then was precious) that their own
Historians tell us, that besides several Lands, Territories
and Seigniories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Homage done by great Persons (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Titles of Sovereignty both of Sea and Land) there
was pay'd no less than <hi>Three Millions of Crowns,</hi> which is,
<hi>One and Twenty Millions, Four Hundred and Twelve Thousand
five Hundred Livers</hi> of their money at this day. In the mean
time, if it be true, that <hi>Numa</hi> us'd <hi>Leather</hi> Money, a truly
antient Piece were an extraordinary Rarity, and would speak
its value. We read, and have seen of <hi>Paper Money,</hi> nay of
<hi>baked</hi> and <hi>sigillated Earth; Purcelan, Coral, Salt, Linnen, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Fruit,</hi> &amp;c. in comparison of which <hi>Achate</hi> and <hi>Ieate</hi> (which
have been also us'd for money) bear some intrinsic Worth.
Mention is likewise made of <hi>Shells,</hi>

human Skuls, (which if of an Enemy slain in War, were of
great Value among some barbarous People) and other Bones
are Traffick at this day among the rude <hi>Americans;</hi> but of
what Animal we are not told, only that 'tis yet so great a
secret with them, that the most industrious Nations Bartering
with them, have not hitherto been able to impose upon them
by any thing they have endeavoured to Counterfeit it by. In
short, these base and inferior Materials, were among the
civiliz'd Nations never made use of, save in utmost exigence,
as was that on Card, or Paper, in the famous Siege of <hi>Leiden.</hi>
Upon other occasions 'tis remarkable, that wherever the

grievous Oppressions. Thus that Tyrant <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and
those of <hi>Sicily</hi> money'd <hi>Tin,</hi> and corrupted the Coin; and so
our Chronicle tells us, that when there were in <hi>England, tot
Reges, vel potius Tyranni, quot Domini</hi> (almost as many Kings
or Tyrants, as Lords of Castles) they stamp'd what they
pleased: But then (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> notes) was the whole
Kingdom miserably torn in pieces, and the Rights of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
shattered, which obtains to it self no little lustre from
Coining Money. Indeed the Cities of <hi>Canterbury, Rochester,</hi>
and such as had<note n="*" place="margin">As Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Ceol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothus,</hi> An. 831. before King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans</hi> Reign.</note> been Garrisons of old, and some other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations

their <hi>Aedes Monetarii,</hi> with Privilege <hi>Flandi, Feriundi,</hi>
&amp;c. at pleasure; but we speak of those who had it not, but
who abus'd it. The last I think among our Prelats
was the great <hi>Cardinal Wolsey,</hi> of whom there are yet to be
seen small Coins with his half Face Effigies, stampt at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
and some of <hi>Cutbert Tunstal,</hi> and there is a Piece of
Archbishop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> I do not say from this Privilege.</p>
            <p>And now after all we have said of these Debasements
of the barbarous Ages, there were, and still are extant of
<hi>Lead</hi> both <hi>Consular</hi> and <hi>Imperial Medals,</hi> with some <hi>Greek</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Antient, nor less Authentick, and for that cause purchas'd
now and then with <hi>Gold</hi> it self. 'Tis true, they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
prohibited by a Law express, which did but inhaunce
their value among the curious; as did some of the noblest
<hi>Metals</hi> that were call'd in, melted down, and abolish'd in
detestation of Tyrants, and such as unworthily abus'd their
Power; <hi>Nero, Tiberius, Commodus, Caligula,</hi> the obscene <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagabalus;</hi>
that of our late <hi>Regicide</hi> and others. But as to
that Metal (whatsoever it were) the debasers of <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver</hi> (tho mighty Princes) lost their Reputation, it being
almost the only blemish of that virtuous Emperor <hi>Marcus
Antoninus,</hi> for but covering his Coin with thin Plates of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
Be it therefore to the praise of our renowned <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
(after it had been corrupted almost ever since <hi>Richard</hi> the
<hi>First,</hi> and the Standard establish'd by K. <hi>Edward</hi> the First)
who made this Reformation so great and shining a part of her
Royal Care, tho something had been done in it before by
the <hi>German</hi>

But however <hi>Money,</hi> and <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> were
ever had in highest Estimation for the <hi>Matter</hi> (as having
those transcendent and essential Conveniences, <hi>Metallum, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

for their egregious <hi>Form, Antiquity,</hi> and that commonly
they bear the Figures and Reverses so accurately, as not sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to dispute it with the richest <hi>Ore.</hi> Indeed whatever we
find in either of those precious Metals, is also found in <hi>Copper,</hi>
but not <hi>Vice versâ:</hi> All is not to be met with in <hi>Gold</hi> and

might be of the elder date; there being no question yet
of the Antiquity of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> next to those: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
is, when first they began to Coin either, to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of <hi>Medal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Homer</hi> says, the antient <hi>Achivi</hi> us'd no
money stamp'd, but a rude mass of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> which
they Barter'd as the wild <hi>Indians</hi> now do for Baubles, Knives,
Glass-Beads, and as of old the <hi>Scythae, Seres, Sarmats,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitani,
Lacedemonians, Bizantines</hi> and others: And, for ought
I find, <hi>Aes Grave</hi> in the lump, and <hi>Bullion</hi> it self (as many
Ages after they paid Sums in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Lingat,</hi> as well as in
Coin, to the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi>) continued without any
elegant Form or Impression, till <hi>Servius Caepio,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
being Consuls; or as others, from the beginning of the
Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the time of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> before they
set any mark or stamp upon <hi>Silver:</hi> And their <hi>Copper</hi> at first
was flat, without any Sculpture at all, until <hi>Servius Tullius</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61438:12"/>
(I speak of the <hi>Romans</hi>) made on <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Sheep,</hi> or some such
Animal be Coined on the <hi>Reverse.</hi> But still (as we said)
the Matter was only <hi>Copper;</hi> whence the <hi>Quaestors</hi> or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
of the <hi>Aerarium</hi> had their Denomination, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
it all the time that the nobler Metals were in use;
which, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, (speaking of Silver) was not till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the CDLXXV. year after the Foundation of the City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Consulship of <hi>Q. Fabius Pictor,</hi> and <hi>R. Gallus,</hi> five
years before the First <hi>Punick</hi> War; nor stamp'd they any
<hi>Gold</hi> at all till the LXII. year that the other had been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Use; some affirm above Two Hundred Years after:
A good note to caution ones not being impos'd on by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi>
tho of that precious Metal, pretending to have been
struck by any King or Consul before that Date. In the mean
while is it not strange, that in the late Discoveries of <hi>America</hi>
neither <hi>Gold</hi> nor <hi>Silver,</hi> so greedily coveted, were thus made
use of, where those rich and precious Metals do naturally
grow?</p>
            <p>Now as touching Impressions (which as we observ'd, were
very rude and simple at first) 'tis probable they began them
with their <hi>Deities,</hi> and next with their <hi>Kings,</hi> whom they
Worshipped and often made their Gods.</p>
            <p>Then appeared <hi>Roma Galeata,</hi> with her Helmet often
wing'd <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> on Horseback, the Figures of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
in the double or triple <hi>Car;</hi> whence the <hi>Bigati, Trigati,
Quadrigati, Victoriati, &amp;c.</hi> on the <hi>Denarius,</hi> were of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
stamp: Sometimes the <hi>Tutelary</hi> of the Place, Name and
Effigies of the Prince, Magistrate, Cities, Foundation, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
or <hi>Monetarie Triumviri</hi> (who during the <hi>Consulat</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
the <hi>Mints</hi> a long time as they pleas'd) for what use,
of what Matter and Weight we have partly shew'd. Hence
are sprung the <hi>Aeginates, Gigates, Staters</hi> of <hi>Croesus, Darics, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippics,</hi>
and other Denominations, known, as we noted, by
the Heads, Places, Characters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And tho doubtless at
first (even among both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> whilst that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Flourish'd) the Title, Note or Cypher express'd the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
weight of the Metal only, <hi>S. C.</hi> or some <hi>Consular</hi> Mark
(as already shew'd) Yet as the Republick declined and the
People became Flatterers of the haughty Conqueror; they
easily submitted to whatsoever alteration might gratifie the
ambitious Prince, by Engraving the Name, and celebrating
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61438:12"/>
the Exploits of the aspiring Man: And then began their <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies,</hi>
with the various <hi>Reverses,</hi> expressing their most signal
Actions, Exploits, and Heroic Undertakings, to adorn their
Coins and Medals; so very useful for the clearing of many
obscure and recondit Passages of <hi>History, Chronology,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of Erudition: Of which in the following Periods.
To proceed then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medals</hi> are in the first place to be consider'd, not only as to
the <hi>Metal</hi> and <hi>Impression,</hi> but in relation to the <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi>
We pass therefore from the <hi>Matter</hi> to the <hi>Form</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which was antiently neither so thick nor large as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
nor the <hi>Reverses</hi> of their amplest <hi>Medalions</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
three Inches Diameter, and thence diminishing to three
quarters of an Inch, usually distinguished by their several
magnitudes, which are Three.</p>
            <p>Of the first (suppos'd of <hi>Greek</hi> Original) were those of
<hi>Copper</hi> (yet not excluding <hi>Gold</hi>) more frequently met with
of the two later dimensions, <hi>de moyen Bronze,</hi> or middle size,
some few excepted; as those of <hi>Philip</hi> Father of <hi>Alexander
Magnus, Lysimachus, Arsinoe, Berenice,</hi> the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> with
some others; and those Coined by the infamous <hi>Elagabalus,</hi>
(more rarely found) with such as <hi>Tiberius Constantine</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have sent to <hi>Chilperic</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> (describ'd by
<hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi>) and as were usually given to great Princes
upon occasions extraordinary, and not seldom likewise scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
among the <hi>Mobile</hi> and Spectators on days of Triumph,
Jubilees, and solemn Processions; of which sort <hi>Caligula</hi> long
since sprinkled a considerable <hi>Largess</hi> from the Palace of <hi>Iulia,</hi>
which rendred them more common. Some of these were
<hi>Medalions</hi> of the large size, <hi>de grand Bronze</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi>
Term is) more substantial, and in higher <hi>Relievo,</hi> which are
very rare; especially the <hi>Romans,</hi> by reason that the <hi>Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Heads,</hi> and <hi>Reverses</hi> are more legible and conspicuous,
as having been struck on Publick and solemn Occasions, and
Ceremonies of State; such, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, <hi>Augustus</hi> was
wont to present to his Favorites during the <hi>Saturnalia;</hi>
and we at this day see frequently stamp'd in <hi>Gold,</hi> as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Tokens appendant to Chains of considerable value; and
even to Orders of Knighthood, as that of <hi>S. Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice,
&amp;c.</hi> also to Soldiers, Seamen, Commanders, Masters of
Ceremonies, Heralds, great Scholars, Poets; for such a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61438:13"/>
tho but of Silver, the witty <hi>Ovid</hi> somewhere celebrates,
<q>Argentum felix, omnique beatius auro:</q>
For its bearing the <hi>Effigies</hi> of that Demy-God <hi>Augustus:</hi> And
so famous <hi>Painters, Sculptors,</hi> and other Persons of distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Merit wore <hi>Medalions.</hi> They were given likewise to
<hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and sent to <hi>States-men,</hi> as was that to the <hi>Swiss</hi>
by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> with his Effigies; the <hi>Reverse</hi>
an Altar between two Columns, wreath'd about with Palms
and Laurels, and supporting a Crown; the <hi>Exurge. E X.

RENOVATI. EFFOSSO.</hi> and in the Circle this <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,</hi>
M. DC II. <hi>RegIs SaCra FoeDera MagnI.</hi> But like to
these truly antient, and of <hi>Gold,</hi> were a rarity inestimable, such
a one as that <hi>Posthumus</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, that weighs Six
<hi>Lovis d' Ors,</hi> and a <hi>Gratian,</hi> in the Imperial Cabinet, of above
twenty, approaching the size of the largest Brass. Such, I
say, were inestimable; forasmuch as besides the intrinsic Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the Metal, there were ample field to contain the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
represent the Figure, Historical <hi>Reverses</hi> and Erudition
in bolder <hi>Relievo</hi> (as that of <hi>Adrian,</hi> and some others) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a Collection, tho of <hi>Brass</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> were precious indeed;
but a perfect Series would, I fear, not only be very difficult
to procure, but impossible to be met withal in any Cabinet
of the best furnished Prince in <hi>Europe.</hi> He that arrives to four
or five hundred such Pieces is Master of a great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Those of the <hi>Greek</hi> consisting of all <hi>Metals,</hi> and of very
moderate size, and little elegancy, are every where to be had;
and the variously denominated <hi>Attic Obolus,</hi> with the <hi>Head</hi>
of <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Noctua,</hi> of as vulgar Use as our <hi>Farthings,</hi>
but hardly by half so large as the <hi>Tokens</hi> which every Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and Tippling-House (in the days of late Anarchy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us) presum'd to stamp and utter for immediate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
as they were passable through the Neighbourhood,
which tho seldom reaching farther than the next Street, or
two, may happily in after times, come to exercise and busie
the learned <hi>Critic,</hi> what they should signifie, and fill whole
Volumes with their Conjectures; as I am perswaded several
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61438:13"/>
as arrant trifles have done, and still do, casually mentioned
in antient Authors.</p>
            <p>Another sort of <hi>Medalions</hi> (not altogether so ample, nor
so skilfully wrought, and ever in <hi>Copper</hi>) are by our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
call'd<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> gave them a Ring or Circle of Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Contorniati,</hi> sometimes distinguish'd by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hollow bordure, or small shallow insculp'd Figures, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be about the date of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> or at farthest <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
or not much before; rarely enough to be met with:
But for this chiefly estimable, that they received their Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
whilst most of the antient <hi>Rome</hi> was yet subsisting; and
for which <hi>Medalions</hi> of the largest Volume are ever to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued:
For in those it is we sometimes meet the Heads of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Solon, Pythagoras, Euclid, Socrates, Ap. Tyanaeus, Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic
Victors, Palms</hi> and <hi>Charrioting;</hi> whether resembling the
Persons or not, and therefore their Antiquity a little questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
Those in <hi>Silver,</hi> from <hi>Pompey</hi> downwards, are not
so rare; relating chiefly to Kings and Cities, as of <hi>Syria, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
&amp;c.</hi> Of which see the learned <hi>M. Vaillant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medalions</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and greater volume, I think there are
very few, if any at all, or of the rest larger than our new
Half-Crown Pieces, and those (as I said) of Copper only, rarely
of any other: But towards the lower Empire, there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
found great and smaller, of which the largest are
<hi>Gold,</hi> some equalling the weight of our five Pound Pieces;
more or less estimable for the Stamp and Person. Next these
we reckon <hi>Medalions</hi> of the larger <hi>Copper,</hi> somewhat broader
and thicker than our Horsemen; and of <hi>Silver</hi> very rare.
The <hi>Grand Bronze,</hi> after <hi>Posthumus</hi> (when, as we noted, the
Coin was alter'd) is a <hi>Medalion;</hi> those of the middle size,
and the same Species, are somewhat smaller. Next to these,
being the very smallest, whether <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> (and which
perhaps might pass commonly for Money) exceed not much
our new Mill'd Shillings, nor are some so large, especially
towards the <hi>Bas-Empire.</hi> We frequently meet of the first in
<hi>Gold</hi> and of more substance, till approaching the later Reigns
they diminish'd extremely.</p>
            <p>Here it is they critically Note, as to the three dimensions
of <hi>Copper Medals</hi> (namely the larger, middle, and smaller <hi>Bronze</hi>)
that in case one of the first size for breadth and substance,
bear a Head no bigger than one of the second or middle <hi>Bronze,</hi>
it is to be reckon'd but one of the second Class; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
another, tho not so thick and substantial, yet bearing a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61438:14"/>
deeper and more extant Head, shall take place before one of
the first Form: Tho there be <hi>Medals</hi> of the least size of much
greater Value and Esteem, for their being rare, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
preeminence of the largest. To conclude, as to
Model and Size of <hi>Medals;</hi> we meet with both <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of not above half the Weight and Substance of the first;
nor are the last we mentioned any thing so rare, as those of
<hi>Gold.</hi>

that peculiar Nation had in the World requir'd: And
therefore had they Coins both <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Copper</hi> of all sizes,
specifying the value; but whether they stamp'd any of <hi>Gold</hi> is
not so evident. To be sure, they Coined none for <hi>Medals</hi>
upon any Historical account, whatever we derive from them,
tho <hi>Monsieur Foinard</hi> be of another opinion; who from the
date of certain <hi>Medals</hi> with <hi>Samaritan</hi> Inscriptions, illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(as he thinks) that remarkable Passage in 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> iii.

in the <hi>Exurge,</hi> and not seldom with a <hi>Wheat-sheaf,</hi> a <hi>Cluster</hi>
of <hi>Grapes, Vine-leaf</hi> or <hi>Lotus.</hi> In others we have a <hi>Crater,</hi> or
standing Goblet, and now and then the <hi>Harp, Portico</hi> of a
Temple or Sepulchre; most of which being long since their
last and final Captivity and Dispersion, with <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
are looked upon but as modern, and for the most
part of cast Metal; whilst the more antient (or at least so
reputed) bear the stamp of the <hi>Pot</hi> of <hi>Manna,</hi> as some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
or as others, the <hi>Censer</hi> or <hi>Thuribulum,</hi> casting forth a
cloud of Incense, and not seldom Revers'd with a sprig of
<hi>Opo Balsamum,</hi> or the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as is conjectured, for
they do not all agree; only as to the <hi>Legenda,</hi> the <hi>Shekel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
with <hi>Samaritan</hi> Letters (tho <hi>Kircher</hi> mentions <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>)
is least of all suspected. But of these consult <hi>Velser,
Hottinger, Conringius,</hi> and others, who give ample Accounts,
besides that much commended and shorter Treatise of <hi>Henry
Thulen</hi> of <hi>Erford, De Variis Siclis &amp; Talentis Hebraeorum,</hi> and
our learned Countrymen <hi>Brerewood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greaves,</hi> and out
of them the no less learned and industrious Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> late
Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomenon</hi> to the <hi>Polyglotte</hi> Bible.
But, as we noted, these <hi>Medals,</hi> even the most reputed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,
reserv'd in the Library at the <hi>Escurial,</hi> collected by
the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> have not the universal suffrage
of being Authentick.</p>
            <p>We have spoken of the <hi>Greek,</hi> of which the largest and
most valuable, (exceeding not our <hi>Silver Crown-Pieces</hi>) and
they of <hi>Copper</hi> only, were by some thought to have been
us'd only for weight, under the Names of <hi>Drachma, Stater,
&amp;c.</hi> others there are more common, and not so large by half,
tho somewhat thicker both <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Silver.</hi> Finally, to
these succeed Coins of all metals and sizes, diminishing (as
we noted) to less than our ordinary single Pence: Such of
the <hi>Greeks</hi> as we find of <hi>Gold</hi> in the smaller Pieces are most
esteem'd: Of other Metals (tho for the most part <hi>Copper,</hi> if
struck under the Emperors) there are not a few; for the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spreading Conquests of that People, by the wonderful and
successful Expeditions of the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> had scattered
innumerable <hi>Medals</hi> and Coins, wherever their Armies
came, bearing the Effigies of their victorious Leaders, the
Cities and Places they won, who had then obtained the Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61438:15"/>
We should now come to the <hi>Symbola,</hi> but we reserve it
to the <hi>Reverse,</hi> and proceed to shew, that those <hi>Medals</hi> of
<hi>Gold</hi> (tho of the most refin'd) are, as we noted, by no means
the most estimable, excepting the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> of superfine
Metal, and those of the higher <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as pure as 'twas
possible to render it malleable, for the intrinsic Value, and for
that every one cannot go to the price of them: Such are those
of the first Emperors, rare indeed both for weight and work;
and so the <hi>Silver;</hi> but above all those of <hi>Copper,</hi> as far as
<hi>Severus Alexander,</hi> as we have already shew'd; but thence
from <hi>Caracalla</hi> to <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> both Stamp and Metal became
despicable: Albeit we afterwards find <hi>Medals</hi> of the finest
<hi>Silver</hi> from <hi>Heraclius</hi> to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and of excellent Masters,
but thence lamentably declining.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>Medals</hi> as have been struck in <hi>Spain,</hi> or any part of
<hi>Africa</hi> subject to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> bearing the Effigies of <hi>Dido,</hi>
whom they affirm to have first Coined Money among them,
are to be reckon'd <hi>Punic,</hi> and pretend to great Antiquity:
And there is yet in the hands of the curious (and which they
have imitated in <hi>Spain</hi>) some that serv'd for Traffick: But
whether the <hi>Medal</hi> stamp'd with the Head of that famous
Queen, with a Reverse of an Horses Head, and inscrib'd with
inexplicable Characters be authentick, is to be doubted.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (as of the same
race) of which some we have of <hi>Copper,</hi> bearing a fair resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Letter: Nor pass we by the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
and <hi>Arabian,</hi> nor <hi>Greek</hi> of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> even before the
Conquest of <hi>Alexander;</hi> which would be well and diligently
consider'd, as of great Importance to the clearing of several
Historical Passages: Forasmuch as the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>
have hitherto taken up almost the whole Study and Application
of the curious in this sort of erudition, exclusive to all the rest.</p>
            <p>To these in like manner belong the <hi>Persian</hi> or <hi>Daric,</hi> which
being of <hi>Gold</hi> only, represent the Head of that great Prince,
with sometimes a <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> or Bow-man on the <hi>Reverse;</hi>
both these, and the <hi>Parthian</hi> bearing frequently a kneeling
Figure, holding a Bow in one hand, and Dart or short Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin
in the other; is <hi>Revers'd</hi> with a Rowing <hi>Galley.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to these we add</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbarous,</hi> whether Antient or Modern, whose wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ingraven work betrays their Pedigree, especially appearing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61438:15"/>
mute and without Inscription, or any relation to good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>We do not forget the <hi>German, &amp;c.</hi> with what <hi>Ursmus</hi>
and others' have plac'd next the <hi>Consular,</hi> under the Families
<hi>Afraniae,</hi> bearing Characters resembling the antient <hi>Hetrusci:</hi>
Those of the <hi>Goths, Huns, Lombards, &amp;c.</hi> belong to this
Class; as of <hi>Atalaricus, Totila, &amp;c.</hi> with the <hi>Reverses</hi> of a
rustic Cart or Wagon drawn by a pair of Horses, in base
Metal and ruder Sculpture, very little improv'd even to the
Time of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and many Ages after. <hi>Olaus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
yet mentions divers of their Kings both in <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
as well as <hi>Copper,</hi> and some very large ones, from the
time of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> when that truculent and savage People first
invaded that glorious Empire: But of these, as we observ'd,
many bear no Letters at all, and therefore of no Use or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
worth the looking after; but in the mean while,
such as have, are not wholly to be slighted: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had after all its grandeur suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
those deplorable Inundations, under the <hi>Gothic</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
barbarous Nations, we shall find the City of <hi>Rome</hi> still
preserv'd her antient <hi>Elogies</hi> of <hi>INVICTA</hi> and <hi>AETERNA, &amp;c.</hi>
in her Coins and <hi>Medals:</hi> Nor of all her insolent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
was there above one who so much as attempted to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
that honor from her. <hi>Atulphus</hi> going about to change her
Name (as did <hi>Adrian</hi> once that of old <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) from <hi>ROMA</hi> to
<hi>GOTHIA</hi> in the Publick Money, with a <hi>Reverse</hi> of the
old City, and Inscrib'd <hi>MEMORIA GOTHIAE,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>AUGUSTI, URBS ATULPHI.</hi> After all,
could not the ambitious man obtain his end, her venerable
Name emerg'd again, which she has kept to this day.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Saracens</hi> (who likewise are to be censed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Barbarous) we meet with nothing, nor indeed of
those we mentioned in any good Author who has made it
his peculiar work.</p>
            <p>Coins purely <hi>British</hi> we find in our learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> and
industrious <hi>Speed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> and many my worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> has
mentioned in his <hi>Natural Histories</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Staffordshires;</hi>
and I have seen a Series of our antient Moneys (I dare say
no counterfeits) from <hi>Edward Confessor,</hi> to our present times,
<hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> excepted, which it has not been my hap
to light upon, and 'tis probable the Mint might not be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61438:16"/>
much imploy'd during the short Reign of that Usurper, which
render them so rarely found. There is a small hollow Coin
seeming to be <hi>Gold,</hi> but of a mixt or <hi>Obrize</hi> sort, which has
on it a Horse, rudely design'd, with the Letters <hi>Conob,</hi> which
some will needs have to signifie <hi>Constantinople;</hi> other, with
good reason, some <hi>British</hi> Prince of ours: But as none of
them pretended any Title (<hi>Constantine</hi> himself excepted, and
<hi>British</hi> by his Mothers side) to the Eastern Empire, it is not
agreed to whom it may belong: and what indeed if those
who fancy it a <hi>British</hi> Prince have taken it for our <hi>Cunobelin?</hi>
The very first of <hi>British</hi> Coin stamp'd <hi>Roman</hi>-like about the
time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> representing two <hi>averse</hi> Faces, and in
many of them an Horse: The mistake of one single Letter
has often mislead wise Men into as great an error. Besides
this, the renowned <hi>Voadicia,</hi> and sundry other Moneys (some
without any Letters at all) are in the hands of the curious;
since the <hi>British</hi> Kings, even under the <hi>Roman</hi> Government,
were all along permitted to Stamp and Coin, which they
sometimes made a little hollow on the <hi>Reverse;</hi> but wherein
if any thing intitle them to History, it is the various Figures
which one meets with of some Animal, Tree, or Plant, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
ears of Corn) for distinction, as may be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
according to the Nature or Species of the Tribute,<note place="margin">Vide Cambd. Notar. ad</note> by

it improv'd on the sudden by some <hi>Italians, Germans,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61438:16"/>
Of <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> are extant many full-fac'd
Princes, tho rarely with any tolerable or significant <hi>Reverse,</hi>
yet sometimes endeavouring to present us the <hi>Gothic</hi> Front or
Porch of some Church or Monastery, as one may see them
pictured in King <hi>Alfreds</hi> Life with his Cypher, and in several
of <hi>Charlemaines</hi> and his Successors.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have spoken of the most refin'd and precious
Metals, <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> with those of <hi>Copper</hi> and other
mixtures, whilst <hi>Medals,</hi> even of the basest <hi>Lead,</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of good Antiquity, tho chiefly valued for, and during
the <hi>Roman Saturnalia,</hi> at which times their Slaves kept holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and were of Custom indulg'd to play the Masters:
But at that any time <hi>Lead</hi> was current Money, we find no
great likelihood; tho a passage in <hi>Plautus,</hi> and another of
the Poet <hi>Martial</hi> seem to hint some such matter. One <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
indeed there is in <hi>Fulvius Pedaniae gentis,</hi> rarely any where
else. But those Pieces which concern the <hi>Saturnalia</hi> have
commonly stamp upon them a <hi>Swine,</hi> or some such <hi>Grotesque</hi>
Figure, or odd Bird, without any profitable Relation to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
History, all Royal Coins being prohibited, whilst this
Mock-Reign continu'd. Nothing all this jolly time but <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
and <hi>Iocus;</hi> no body was to be serious, nor yet any thing
spoken maliciously Abusive, or in cold and studied Railery,
but ingenious <hi>Parodias</hi> and Wit upon the spot: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both at <hi>Athens</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> there was sometimes a Prize
and a Garland given to the Person who made the wittiest
Jest, during this relaxation, as may both be gathered out of
<hi>Sophocles, Horace</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>In these <hi>Liberatate Decembri,</hi> the Masters of the Family us'd
themselves to serve at Tables, or at least sit Cheek by Jole
with their <hi>Mancipia.</hi> Hence <hi>Lucian</hi> calls them <hi>Kings of the
Table;</hi> of whose Election <hi>Arrianus</hi> on <hi>Epictetus, Lib. 1.</hi>

               </gap>
&amp;c. <hi>Bochartus</hi> (in his <hi>Phaleg</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the Custom at least as antient as <hi>Noahs</hi> Malediction on
<hi>Cham;</hi> that his Posterity should serve their Servants, and that
the Usage was Universal. Nay <hi>Becanus</hi> says, 'twas begun
in the <hi>Ark</hi> it self, upon the day of the Patriarchs first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the tops of the Mountains: The Jubilation of the
<hi>Iews</hi> resembling something of such a Festival Relaxation.
But returning to our <hi>Medal,</hi> 'tis not altogether improbable
their ridiculous King, to render it the more fantastical, might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61438:17"/>
be permitted to Mint this ignoble Money during his Reign,
with the Name of his Patron, Office, Sport and Buffonry,
somewhat resembling our <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Misrule</hi> at <hi>Christmas</hi> in the
late Age of <hi>English</hi> Hospitality. A kind of <hi>Prince</hi> of the
<hi>Grange,</hi> happening about the same idle Season of the year,
when they were wont to sacrifice an <hi>Hog,</hi> as'tis still the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
time of slaughtering that impure Animal. A great deal
more there might be added here concerning these <hi>Saturnalia,</hi>
and other times of indulgence and diversions; their various
Symbols, and other extravagancies, of which Authors give
large accounts; as that they were instituted in memory of
the Golden Age, when there was an universal Parity among
all Mankind. Of the Feast in <hi>Babylon,</hi> observ'd in honor of the
Goddess <hi>Dercetha,</hi> which lasting five days, the Masters were
under the Dominion of their Servants; and one among them
call'd the <hi>Sorgan</hi> or Prince, was wont to be Royally Vested.
Human Sacrifices were at this time also offered, in after-Ages
abolish'd by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and changed into Bone-fires, Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>Properties</hi> made of wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the <hi>Synthesis</hi> or
Garment the Masters wore, whilst they Feasted thus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
The Custom of sending Presents, <hi>Strenae,</hi> and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Years
Gifts, with a deal more which we pass over as foreign
to our Subject. There is in the mean time this observable,
that whenever we meet any <hi>Medal</hi> of this Grotesque and <hi>Biz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
sort, one may conclude it a <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> as sometimes the
Letters <hi>S. C. Saturni Consulto,</hi> or <hi>Consilio</hi> shews; having, as we
noted, at this time of <hi>Carnival</hi> and Libertinism, permission
to play <hi>Rex;</hi> say and do all kind of ridiculous Impertinences.
Now and then we likewise meet with the <hi>C</hi> before <hi>S,</hi> which
may perhaps alter the <hi>Legenda</hi> to <hi>Consuetudine,</hi> or <hi>Convivio
Saturnalium,</hi> as <hi>Monsieur Baudelot</hi> conceives, or something to
that tune.</p>
            <p>But other <hi>Medals</hi> of this ludicrous Nature I find not, nor
read I that those grave and heroical States imprest any, save
upon grave and serious Occasions; Raillery in <hi>Medals</hi> was
not then in use, however since degenerated, and serving to
perpetuate as well all Acts of great Injustice and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as Revenge and ynsults. Indeed <hi>Indatyrsus</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> King,
is reported to have sent <hi>Darius</hi> a Bird, a Frog, a Rat, and a
Dart, intimating, that unless he could fly like a Bird, swim
the River like a Frog, and get home again like a Rat, he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61438:17"/>
not escape the <hi>Scythian</hi> Darts. And <hi>Boleslaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi>
sent one of his <hi>Palatines</hi> an Hare and a Distaff to reproach
his Cowardise and Effeminacy. Of the same kind was that
of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who sent to our <hi>Fifth Henry</hi> a Tun
of Tennis Balls, as to a soft and idle Prince: But which he
soon return'd with Bullets that made all <hi>France</hi> weary of the
rude Play. But these were but transient Boasts, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof;
nor find we any such sharp and provoking instances,
on noble <hi>Medals</hi> which were lasting, and had been of evil
consequence, to the keeping up of eternal Feuds, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in Acts of Cruelty. Such as is that <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the <hi>Thirteenth,</hi> Revers'd with the representation of those
inhuman Butcheries committed on so many Thousands of
innocent and brave Persons as perish'd in the <hi>Parisian Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre;</hi>
and another of like nature which we have lately seen,
not only of the abolition of repeated <hi>Edicts</hi> against all that
is sacred in Oaths and Obligations among Mankind; but
the more savage Executions of the <hi>Dragoon Missions,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the several Modes of Conversion to the Catholick Church,
by an ample <hi>Medalion, In perpetuam Rei Memoriam.</hi> Those who
may imagine us partial in exaggerating either of these instances,
may do well to read the description of the first, by that most
impartial and illustrious Historian <hi>Thuanus;</hi> and for the latter,
the present and daily sufferings of so many Thousands more
of Loyal, Valiant, Learned and Noble Persons, and others,
who 'tis impossible should all agree (in this dispersion) or
be able to make the World believe, that all is mere Fable
and Invention (as we are told by many) and that they are
burnt alive, drag'd through the Streets, expos'd to Dogs and
Vultures, chain'd to the Gallies, stript of all they have of
secular, and live in Exile, whilst there is no such things done
or suffered at all; and glad I should be to find this solidly
confuted, which I confess as yet I have not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (the same who not long
after attempted <hi>Geneva</hi> by <hi>Scalado)</hi> easily seiz'd on the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate</hi>
of <hi>Saluces,</hi> during the Civil Wars of <hi>France;</hi> when
elated with that success, the struck a <hi>Medal,</hi> which had in
<hi>Reverse</hi> a <hi>Centaure</hi> trampling on a <hi>Gallic</hi> Crown, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>OPPORTUNE.</hi> The Broils and Troubles
in <hi>France</hi> being shortly after compos'd, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi>
sends an Army into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and quickly stript the haughty
Duke, not only of that he had taken, but of all he else possess'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61438:18"/>
on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> requiting him with another <hi>Medal,</hi> on
the <hi>Reverse</hi> of which was <hi>Hercules</hi> with his Club, treading
under-foot the <hi>Centaure,</hi> with the word <hi>OPPORTUNIUS.</hi>
These were noble and ingenious, and free from cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human.</p>
            <p>To the Form of <hi>Medals</hi> belongs <hi>Impression</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of
whatsoever kind. We begin with <hi>Heads,</hi> as best determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and guiding the Series; and tho there is likewise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be expected on both Tables, and that now and then
we find no Head at all, yet, for distinction sake, one side
is call'd the <hi>Head,</hi> the other the <hi>Reverse. Medals</hi> without
<hi>Reverse</hi> are never antique, but may without <hi>Head</hi> be good;
as that of <hi>Augustus's</hi> Mint-Master, <hi>TRIB. POT.</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Vitellius</hi> which has only two hands joined, with <hi>FIDES
EXERCITUUM.</hi> The <hi>Reverse</hi> a Figure with <hi>CONCOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIA
PRAETORIANORUM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The naked and simple bare Head, and unadorned, was
most antient, which tho usually signifying the Son, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptive
Heir, or of such as died before they came to Reign,
(as <hi>Drusus, Germanicus, Aurelius,</hi> and others) yet we find
some among them who were actually Emperors bare-headed:
<hi>Nero, Galba, &amp;c.</hi> and even <hi>Augustus</hi> himself, tho more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with a Laurel or Diadem; but which few, if any
of the <hi>Cesars</hi> or presumptive Heirs, presum'd to wear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
some of the Family of the <hi>Constantines;</hi> of which,
and of several Coverings, more anon.</p>
            <p>Seldom does the <hi>Ectype</hi> or <hi>Effigies (humerorum tenus)</hi> reach
below the brest, and the more antient <hi>Medals</hi> shew only a
naked neck, as if <hi>Eras'd</hi> or <hi>amputated</hi> from the shoulders, if
farther, not much below them, rarely to the middle in <hi>Bust,</hi>
or dressed in Armour, unless an Emperor, or some great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and that seldom, but more frequently with some small
part of the <hi>Consular</hi> loose Garment, the <hi>Paludamentum,</hi> or
Royal embroider'd Mantle, the Imperial <hi>Praetexta,</hi> or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Chlamys, &amp;c.</hi> for they had of old no distinguishing Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
but the Purple Robe.</p>
            <p>Ladies have their <hi>Peplus,</hi> a sort of slight Scarf, button'd
or hasp'd on the Shoulder or right Arm a little under the
Pap, as we commonly find the <hi>Ephesian Diana,</hi> and other
female Statues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61438:18"/>
But as to the Face, seldom or very rarely meet we with the
full Countenance, or so much as what <hi>Painters</hi> call the three
quarter or <hi>Philip Face,</hi> but in <hi>Profile</hi> only, excepting in <hi>Reverses,</hi>
where sometimes many small Figures meet, and where in
the antient <hi>Greek,</hi> or modern <hi>Roman Medals</hi> we find them
Bearded, as those of <hi>Brutus, Hadrian,</hi> first of all the <hi>Caesars</hi>
(for they generally shav'd close before) <hi>Trajanus;</hi> two or
three of the good Emperors following, and in some of <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humus;</hi>
but <hi>Iulian</hi> Affectedly, I mean not nicely, but that
he might appear like a Philosopher, for which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
by those of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and afterwards sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
himself. And indeed most of the antient Kings of
<hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>barbati,</hi> nor left they off that grave mode, till a
good while after, <hi>Barbers</hi> being interdicted and expelled the
City. All the <hi>Parthian</hi> Kings were <hi>Pogonati,</hi> wearing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix
Beards; so did several of the <hi>Greeks, Demetrius,</hi> and others
of the <hi>Seleucid</hi> Family, tho with only a <hi>Lanugo</hi> about the
Chin. Many of the Philosophers also Bearded, as we find
<hi>Plato</hi> in a certain Reverse of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In some again we meet <hi>Capita adversa,</hi> Face against Face,
as in that <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Severus,</hi> and the Empress <hi>Domna.</hi> Others
<hi>Aversa,</hi> Poll to Poll, but more frequently <hi>Iugata,</hi> or <hi>Iuncta</hi>
rather, as in that of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Antiochus VIII. Nero</hi> and
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> as in some of our Kings and Queens formerly and at
present: And the <hi>Dii Penates</hi> also were with two Heads, and
some had Faces and Heads on both sides, as <hi>Antoninus Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus;</hi>
nay some were stamp'd with Three; for so we find
<hi>Valerian</hi> with <hi>Gallious</hi> and his Brother; <hi>Otacilla</hi> with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Son; but indeed these encounters are not frequent.</p>
            <p>Nor do they only give us <hi>Heads,</hi> but we likewise very
often light on <hi>Medals</hi> representing the full length of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Person, in proportion to the Field or Table; such
especially as represent some <hi>Deity,</hi> discovered by their <hi>Symbola</hi>
and places of Worship, of which not a few among the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perials</hi>
and <hi>Cities</hi> born in the <hi>Reverse.</hi> Some of these are in the
posture of sitting, Vested, and so exquisitely designed to the
Life, as easily to be known; as in some of <hi>Hadrian, M. Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Severus:</hi> Others like <hi>Demy-Gods</hi> and <hi>Genius's,</hi> in honor
of their divine Virtues; nay, two, three or more Figures,
as in that <hi>Medal</hi> of the three famous Sisters <hi>Agrippina, Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi>
and <hi>Iulia, &amp;c.</hi> but such indeed are hardly to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by their Effigies; and yet has <hi>Monsieur Roti</hi> (Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61438:19"/>
to his late Majesty <hi>Charles II.)</hi> so accurately express'd the
countenance of the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of <hi>R—</hi> in the Head of <hi>Britannia,</hi>
in the <hi>Reverse</hi> of some of our Coin, and especially in a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi>
as one may easily, and almost at first sight, know it to
be her Grace: And tho in smallest <hi>Copper,</hi> both for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
represented, and performance of the Artist, such as may
justly stand in competition with the antient Masters; to
name only those which he has made <hi>Medalions, Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of the largest Volume. Indeed such care was taken that
no bungler, or but moderate Workman should be employ'd
on these occasions heretofore; That tho some Emperors and
Empresses did now and then affect to be dress'd and disguis'd
like Deities, a skilful Artist (by comparing them with other
Coins, the Descriptions and Characters in <hi>Suetonius, Plutarch</hi> and
others, who have written their Lives) may without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
know by their countenances, whether their Faces were
done by Fancy, or (as Painters speak) after the Life. But
of this see the learned <hi>Seguins</hi> Epistle to <hi>Gottofred, De Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
Pompeianis.</hi> Whilst in my opinion <hi>(Monsieur Vaillant</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted) his Sculptor has approach'd nearest to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetype</hi>
and original <hi>Medal,</hi> of most I have seen; nor are those
of <hi>AEneas Vicus,</hi> and <hi>De Bries Cesars</hi> far short. 'Tis pity
there had not been the like care taken by other more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Authors who have adorn'd their ample Treatises on this
Subject with the <hi>Burin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of all others the most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
for Antiquity, and long before <hi>Rome</hi> was a City, tho
not at first the most elaborate; and therefore whether justly
to the so perfect resemblance of the Effigies they present us
with, I dare not stipulate, when they offer us <hi>Tmolus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus,</hi>
and go beyond <hi>Amyntas,</hi> and the yet more antient
<hi>Heros:</hi> But from thence arriving to that perfection of skill,
as I doubt not but we may safely rely upon those of his Son
<hi>Philip,</hi> and Grandson <hi>Alexander;</hi> the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> so accurately
described, and set forth in stamp by the learned <hi>Vaillant,</hi> tho
they pretend to Ages long before; nor need we much to
question those which we find of the Republicks in general,
and some particular Cities, with their Names and Characters,
or their Kings and Magistrates, whose Heads are frequently
<hi>Radiant</hi> like the Gods in whatever <hi>Metal,</hi> under the names of
<hi>Drachma</hi> and <hi>Stater,</hi> or what other denomination we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

These Regal Heads with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
dress'd with a <hi>Diadem,</hi> wreathed strap or fillet about
the Temples, the ends of which usually (not always) hang
dangling behind the knot; and some without any <hi>Diadem</hi>
or Rays at all, but bearing some other <hi>Symbol;</hi> as in that
<hi>Cidaris</hi> of <hi>Tigranes.</hi> Others we find Gemmated and Studded,
as in that of <hi>Constantines,</hi> and sometimes with a Cask set with a
rank of Pearl, being, I think, one of the first who wore
Jewels in his <hi>Diadem,</hi> instead of the more antient plain <hi>Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
or simple <hi>Launel</hi> (laid afterwards aside, as having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Heathen Gods) and granted first to the first <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
as a mark of the highest Honor, as well as to hide and
shade the thinness of his hair. For the Kings of the <hi>Romans</hi>
never wore a <hi>Diadem,</hi> but carried a Scepter or Spear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where we meet any of them <hi>Diadem'd,</hi> as <hi>Numa, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Martius, &amp;c.</hi> to be sure they were stamp'd long after their
decease. Others also of the <hi>Bass-Empire,</hi> and some of the
Empresses, we also find with <hi>Diadems</hi> and Crown'd, (but
not before) and set on their Heads with great and devout
Ceremony, when they became Christian; as now at our
Coronations. The younger <hi>Iustin</hi> being the first who put
it on the day of In auguration, and therefore not at all essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the Title of Soveraignty, several Kings using none at all.</p>
            <p>Other Victorial Ensigns were the <hi>Obsidional, Mural, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stral,
Isthmian</hi> and <hi>Agonal;</hi> (usually held in their Hands) but
indeed as Emblems rather in memory of some bold Exploit
and military Service, than properly solid Crowns: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
naturally, and <hi>ab Origine,</hi> Garlands, and Chaplets,
made of the Leaves of Trees, as of <hi>Oak (ob Cives Servatos)</hi>
common <hi>Grass, Lotus, Smallage, &amp;c.</hi> were of highest Repute;
which, how plaited and made up, see in a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Nero,
Hadrian,</hi> and some other <hi>Medals.</hi> In the mean time that
which <hi>Augustus</hi> gave to <hi>Agrippa</hi> upon his naval Victory, was
of <hi>massy Gold;</hi> and such as we find on the Heads of <hi>Deities,
local Gienius's;</hi> Expugnators or Protectors of Cities, Castles,
and the like, are <hi>Turrited,</hi> but none of them so antique in
<hi>Medal</hi> as the naked and natural Head alone, without any
ornament, till (as we noted of the <hi>Romans)</hi> fauning Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
began to flatter ambitious Princes, attributing Divine
Honors and Titles to mortal men. For those <hi>Rayes</hi> we so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61438:20"/>
frequently find about their Heads, were doubtless marks of
the splendor which they fancied to be Emanations invironing
the Celestial Being, (whence Painters Radiate the Heads of
Saints,) or from some Tradition of the lustre and shining of
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Face, after he was descended from his forty days Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with Almighty God. For however our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> nay <hi>Grotius</hi> favour the <hi>Cornuta facies;</hi> and
thence our Painters represent this great <hi>Legislator</hi> with Horns;

thing indeed was the splendor and brightness issuing from the
Countenance of that extraordinary Person; as we observe that
the Rays of the Sun appear pointed, reflecting from any
bright and polish'd Metal. But to put this difficulty beyond
dispute, that they were real and solid Beams, <hi>(Horns</hi>
in good earnest) 'tis reported, they not long since shew'd one
of these very <hi>Horns</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Treasury of <hi>Reliques</hi> at
St. <hi>Marcellus;</hi> and a yet more rare and illustrious Sight than
this,<note place="margin">Mons. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions Voyage d' Italie, <hi>p.</hi> 38.</note> namely, one of the Beams of that miraculous <hi>Star,</hi>
which we read of, lighted and conducted the Three Wise Men
to <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> But, it seems, they are both of them now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
so as the Controversie still remains undecided. But
to be serious, be it one or other, <hi>Horn</hi> or <hi>Beams,</hi> 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
this might be deriv'd by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
who grounded almost all their Fictions upon that obscure
Nation, however disdaining to acknowledg their <hi>Plagia</hi> and
Thefts from a People reputed so very despicable, and little
known in the World. And 'tis observable, (not to insist on
<hi>Meneves,</hi> by some thought to be this signal Prophet, ador'd
by the <hi>Egyptians)</hi> that their <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
(both Compatriots) were the first which we find thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in antient <hi>Medal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> had subdu'd that Nation,
we meet him frequently <hi>Diadem'd</hi> with two conspicuous
<hi>Horns,</hi> denoting his Empire over the Oriental World. But this
<hi>in Transitu.</hi> The Reader who has a desire to see more on this
Subject, may be furnish'd with abundance of Erudition in
the learned <hi>Spanhemius,</hi> and other Critics. I only note, that
altho those radiated Circles have since been bar'd, and made
to close at the top, covering the whole Head; to which the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61438:20"/>
Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> first added a Cross, and <hi>Phocas</hi> another to the
Scepter (as now our <hi>European</hi> Kings do wear them) the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
is yet altogether modern, nor at all so glorious and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic,
as when the simple Diadem or Laurel impal'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
Brows, unless out of reverence it were to leave the
glory and beams of Light to God alone, the Author of it;
For that they were first of all appropriate to the <hi>Deities;</hi>
those of <hi>Rhodes, Tenedos, Trapezuntia,</hi> and divers capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
radiated their <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Gods whom they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
since most of the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian Medals</hi> represent
these Beams darting up as it were out of their very Skulls,
and through the hair oftentimes, without any apparent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
in which one must else imagine their Bases to be fix'd:
But thus, as we said, it belong'd only to that God. Of this
the most remarkable is that <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Antiochus Theos,</hi> whom
they call'd <hi>God,</hi> and to whom accordingly they built and
dedicated Temples, erected Altars, Statues, and ordained
Priests, nay, and armed some of their Idoliz'd Princes with
Thunder-bolts; as did the <hi>Athenians</hi> their <hi>Timon;</hi> and of late
the egregious Flatterers of a neighbour King, whom they
have resembl'd to the <hi>Sun</hi> in all his Glory, and that in no
fewer than seventy seven <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions.</hi> But to leave
this blazing <hi>Comet</hi> a while:<note place="margin">Ursinus in Fam. Rom.</note> We find an Head in <hi>Gentle Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ</hi>
whose Rays seem pointed and tip'd with Pearl, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Coronets of our Earls; but the Custom was not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
and taken up by the <hi>Romans</hi> till after they begun to
court their Emperors with the Style of <hi>Divi,</hi> to whom not
only upon <hi>Apotheoses</hi> and Consecrations after their decease,<note place="margin">Florus l. 4. c. 2.</note>
               <hi>(Nero</hi> being the first who assumed the Ray'd Crown before)
but even during their Lives they us'd the same adulations and
superstitious Rites: Nor these alone to their first <hi>Cesar</hi> (who
suffered likewise the same Devotions to be paid him with the
Gods; and his Radiated Statues to be plac'd both in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Theatres) but to that affected <hi>Antoninus, Helagaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
rather (as his <hi>Syrian</hi> Name imports) who call'd himself the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and even to some of the ambitious <hi>Pro-Consuls,</hi> of which
frequently we meet the first in <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Augustus, Tiberius</hi>
and <hi>Caligula,</hi> tho not so generally before those divine Honors
were arrogated <hi>DEO. AUGUSTO. NEPON. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</hi>
Nor did this Pagan Relique last but till the time of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Great's Conversion, and that he totally abolish'd their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61438:21"/>
impious Rites; for until then we meet both that renowned
Emperor and his Sons, with Radiations, and flattered with
Consecrations: Nor truly was it since wholly so laid aside,
but that several of his Successors made bold to put them on
again, and wear them in their <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Medalions,</hi> as far as
down to <hi>Arcadius, Honorius,</hi> and lower yet among the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
where we meet them with a certain <hi>Nimbus</hi> or Glory about
their Heads, as in <hi>Monkish</hi> Manuscripts and antient Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pieces
we find the Saints depicted. It is indeed reported, as
if <hi>Constantine</hi> (even after he had embrac'd the Christian Faith)
ordered the Radiant Crown to be set on that famous <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyritic</hi>
Column, which he caus'd to be transported to his
new <hi>Rome</hi> from the old; and I remember <hi>Philostorgius</hi> tells
us, that besides Wax Tapers, there was both Victims and
Sacrifices offered to it,<note place="margin">Ex Vales. in Philostorg. excerp.</note> even by some superstitious Christians;
but the Credit of that Historian, we know, is not over-great.
That they set up lights, nay and kneeling before it, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
help and healing of their Infirmities, both <hi>Photius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorit</hi>
and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> affirm; whilst, as to the other, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
has been discovered; that Statue having been made long
before by the hand of the famous <hi>Phidias</hi> to represent <hi>Apollo,</hi>
and by no means for that Religious Emperor, tho he hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it with his Name, after he had caus'd to be inclosed
within it (as they write) some of the Nails which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Helen</hi> is, we know, reported to have miraculously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
with the real <hi>Cross,</hi> some time before. But to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
this matter; we do not only in <hi>Medals</hi> meet with
Princes <hi>Radiant</hi> like Gods, but with all other circumstances
of <hi>Deity.</hi> So <hi>Iulian</hi> was represented like <hi>Serapis,</hi> and others
we find often in their company; <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Reverses</hi> of
<hi>Augustus; Domitian</hi> with <hi>Pallas;</hi> with <hi>Commodus, Hercules;
Hadrian</hi> with <hi>Romulus; Maximianus</hi> with <hi>Mars; Dioclesian</hi> with
<hi>Iupiter &amp;c.</hi> And as these haughty Emperors, so their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses,
Daughters, Neeces and <hi>Misses</hi> to be sure, would come
in for their share, affecting the Garb, Attire, and <hi>Symbola</hi>
of Goddesses, and sometime <hi>Priestesses,</hi> as did <hi>Antonia</hi> the
Wife of <hi>Drusus Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions an amorous Painter who drew all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
to represent some <hi>Deess;</hi> for which <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
the Pagans worshipping their Courtezans. What
would that holy Man now have said to those Christians who
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61438:21"/>
not only set up, and inthrone their <hi>Misses Pictures</hi> over
their Altars, to represent the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> with the Babe in her
Arms, but kneel and pay their Devotions to them. But so
<hi>Painters</hi> with <hi>Poetic</hi> liberty, <hi>Quidlibet Audendi—</hi> set up, and
inshrine these fair sinners as so many Idols. And thus we
have <hi>Cleopatra</hi> dress'd like <hi>Diana, Sabina</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hadrian</hi>
like to <hi>Iuno, Faustina</hi> with <hi>Venus;</hi> as in another rare <hi>Medal</hi>
we see her mounted upon a <hi>Pegasus,</hi> carrying her up to the
Clouds, and so of others, all of them marks of <hi>Deification;</hi>
for such in <hi>Medals</hi> are those who appear veil'd, and with <hi>Stars,
Altars, Temples</hi> and <hi>Eagles</hi> perching on them, <hi>Peacocks,</hi> the
<hi>Phoenix, Elephants, Mules,</hi> and Chariots drawn by <hi>Lions</hi> and
the like.</p>
            <p>Let us now descend again to the <hi>Barbarous:</hi> The <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,
Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs, had their distinct
Crowns; some of which resembl'd the Episcopal <hi>Miter,</hi> or
<hi>Thiara:</hi> Nor was it new, since there are <hi>Medals</hi> that present
us <hi>Cesar,</hi> and others of the Emperors, arrogating pontifical
Dignity, and sacerdotal Offices, with their veil'd Heads,
us'd by both Sexes, and not seldom with the <hi>Lituus, Patera,
Sistrum, Silphium,</hi> and other sacred Utensils and Characters
of Priestly Function and Augurie; <hi>Mercuries Petasus</hi> was
wing'd; <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and the <hi>Cyclops</hi> Caps were without brim; and
<hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> had a <hi>Star</hi> by them. The <hi>Phrygian</hi> Bonet
was what the <hi>Polonians</hi> use at present, or rather the <hi>Venetians
Doge:</hi> Nor seldom meet we both sexes Headed (shall I say,
or Hooded with the spoils of <hi>Lions, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Panthers;</hi>
some with the Tusks and <hi>Promuscis</hi> of an <hi>Elephant;</hi> others
in Casks cristed with the Horns of <hi>Rams, Goats, Bulls,</hi> and
other Animals of the Herd, which now and then are wing'd,
denoting fortitude, terror, sublimity of Mind, expedition in
Affairs; or the Monsters they had subdu'd, which divers
<hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> would be represented by, in imitation of
<hi>Alcides,</hi> the brawny <hi>Commodus</hi> fancying himself descended from
him, <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi> and others of the Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses.
For as to <hi>Horns,</hi> which at this day but to name alone
in <hi>Spain,</hi> would indanger ones Life, (but which the most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
of the <hi>German</hi> Families, and noblest, bear so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
on their <hi>Cimiers</hi> and <hi>Crests)</hi> it seems the <hi>Cornuted</hi> Head
was no such Character and Mark of Ignominy, as the learned
<hi>Spanheim</hi> shews in that Passage of his excellent Work, <hi>De usu, &amp;
Praestantia Numismatum,</hi> which tho not so very pertinent to our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61438:22"/>
Argument, is yet very entertaining, and worthy a curious
Reader.</p>
            <p>To conclude, (and before we leave the Imperial Diadem)
we shall find some, even among our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, wearing
the Regal Circle after the manner of the <hi>Greeks. Edward</hi> the
<hi>Confessor</hi> had of early days a Barr'd Crown; but most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
is that of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth.</hi> How would a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Monarch have boasted this, whose Predecessor <hi>Lewis</hi>
the <hi>Twelfth,</hi> had but a single Bar Arch'd over his Crown, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1500, wearing only a Cap or Bonnet before
(as testifie his Coins stamp'd at <hi>Milan, Genoa, Naples, &amp;c.)</hi>
till he Marry'd our <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighths</hi> Sister, who afterwards
Espoused <hi>Charles Brandon. Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> brought the clos'd
Crown into <hi>Poland,</hi> soon imitated by the <hi>Swedes: Philip</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> took it not till after his Marriage with Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of
<hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> (and
Great Grandfather of <hi>Philip)</hi> first wore an Arch over a Ducal
Coronet. A little after which <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> upon his
<hi>Marriage</hi> with <hi>Margarite</hi> Daughter to our <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi>
Barr'd the Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi>
not until after <hi>Christian</hi> IV. made his Brotherly Visit to our
King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First:</hi> But that of <hi>Portugal</hi> was first worn by
<hi>Iohn Bragança,</hi> late Father to the most Serene and virtuous
Queen <hi>Dowager.</hi> From all which instances it appears, that
the Monarchs of <hi>England</hi> were of the <hi>First</hi> in <hi>Christendom</hi> that
pretended to the Arched Crown. And as for the <hi>French,</hi> till
their First <hi>Francis,</hi> they were for the most part contented with
an open Flowry Bordure only, little different from the <hi>Ducal
Coronet,</hi> which some of the <hi>Saxons</hi> had of <hi>Silver,</hi> and others
wore the copped Helmet (as <hi>Cnutus</hi> the Great) Miter-like. But
more of Crowns see in a Disseration of <hi>M. de Cange.</hi> Whilst
by the way we cannot but take notice of what we meet with
in the famous <hi>Donative,</hi> pretended to be from the Great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine;</hi>
wherein, among other particulars, which Impostors
would obtrude on the World for authentic, (but which has
unluckily discover'd the fraud) this is one; that from him it is
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> claims the Dignity of wearing a <hi>Crown</hi>
of <hi>Gold,</hi> like to that of Kings and Emperors, &amp;c. Whereas
all the learned World who have any knowledge in <hi>Medal</hi> and
good History can tell; that there was never any <hi>such</hi> Crown,
nor any other us'd by the Emperor himself, till <hi>Theodosius;</hi>
but they were content with a plain and simple <hi>Diadem</hi> or <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61438:22"/>
Nor is it likely, that the <hi>Popes</hi> who were then, and
many Ages after, but Subjects to the Emperor, should be
dignified not with <hi>one</hi> alone, but with a <hi>Triple</hi> Crown, which
notwithstanding they did not yet presume to take up till near
Four Hundred Years after; nor indeed so much as a single
Crown, until about the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald.</hi> But as
they grew in Power and Usurpation, arrogated this proud
Ensign to rank, nay to advance, themselves above all Kings
and Emperors. Tis true, <hi>Constantine</hi> wore his <hi>Diadem</hi> or Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
studded with a double row of Pearls and precious Stones
(not unlike some Hatbands which persons of Quality now
and then yet wear) whilst the Princes his Predecessors, had
<hi>more Majorum,</hi> but a simple Purple Ribbon, Strap or <hi>Infula</hi>
tied about their Temples, as we have already shew'd. So
much then for that Fourb of the <hi>Triple Crown</hi> and <hi>Donative,</hi>
exploded by all ingenious Writers even of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>But neither did the Heads alone of those great Princes bear
the Ensigns of Imperial Majesty, but their <hi>Hands</hi> likewise;
which we often see in <hi>Medals,</hi> holding as well the <hi>Orb</hi> or
<hi>Mund,</hi> as the Sword and Scepter, upon the top whereof
sate an <hi>Eagle,</hi> till, as we noted, <hi>Phocas</hi> plac'd the <hi>Cross;</hi>
when arm'd with Helmet and Shield, they commonly held
a Javelin in their Hand, or on the Shoulder, or that array'd
in <hi>Consular</hi> Robes (as are most of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors)
they sway'd the Scepter, till the <hi>Bas-Empire</hi> exchang'd
it for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Ferula,</hi> as did the antient <hi>Greeks;</hi> or
a roll of Parchment, like to what we see in the hands of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,</hi>
tho really what it is, is not yet determined. But that
the Scepter is seen in antient Coins, we find it in the hand of
the Great <hi>Augustus,</hi> represented in his whole Figure, and so
in that of <hi>Roma;</hi> and where <hi>Vespasian</hi> delivers, as it were, the
Empire to his Son <hi>Titus;</hi> and in those more rare <hi>Medals</hi> of
<hi>Pertinax,</hi> from <hi>Hadrian</hi> very often, even to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi>
investing his Son <hi>Philip</hi> in that of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in collecting such Imperial Heads as presum'd to
take on them the Marks and Ensigns of the chief, and <hi>major
Deities;</hi> those of the <hi>minor Gods,</hi> and <hi>Tutelar Genius's, &amp;c.</hi>
are to be distinguish'd and plac'd after them. Next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
(accompanied sometimes with some fierce or strange
Beast, <hi>Elephant</hi> or <hi>Dragon)</hi> the reputed <hi>Demy-Gods, Hero's</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61438:23"/>
famous Captains, such as <hi>Alexander, Cyrus, Scipio, Hanibal, &amp;c.</hi>
The antient <hi>Legislators,</hi> Philosophers, and other renowned
Persons, supposing we had the true Effigies of them (as I fear
we have but few) distinguished for their Virtues, and the
great Figure they made in the World: For it was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every body to have their Effigies honoured in <hi>Medal;</hi> they
were scrupulously and nicely jealous of it, and so very frugal
of prostituting that Privilege, that it was (like <hi>Crimen Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus)</hi>
almost capital for any, save the Prince and chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
so much as to be seen in <hi>Metal</hi> without special leave
and indulgence; so as even the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> themselves
were with difficulty permitted to stamp their own Effigies on
<hi>Silver</hi> only. Hence are we told of <hi>Ariadnes,</hi> being punished
by <hi>Darius,</hi> tho <hi>Praefect</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that <hi>Commodus</hi> condemn'd
<hi>Perennius; Severus Plautianus.</hi> Nor had the <hi>Consuls,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>
Citizens themselves, this <hi>Immunity</hi> during their Magistracy, or
whilst they were alive, till <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> rather usurp'd than fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain'd it; and yet when <hi>Augustus</hi> after all this, us'd it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly,
'twas look'd on as a novelty: nor find we any of the first
<hi>Cesars</hi> single and alone in the <hi>Grand Bronze</hi> and larger <hi>Medals;</hi>
those of that great Princes Head in <hi>Reverse,</hi> being Coined
after his decease, none among them all had any proper
<hi>Medal</hi> save <hi>Agrippa</hi> only, that was struck in his life-time by
order of the <hi>Senate, S. C.</hi> which indeed was done, tho he
was neither <hi>Emperor</hi> nor <hi>Cesar:</hi> For that of <hi>Drusus Nero</hi> Son
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was not Coined till after his Death, by his Son
<hi>Claudius's</hi> command: And as to that of either <hi>Scipio's</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
(if at least that which <hi>Benedictus Bacchinus</hi> has lately
given the Type and Account of to <hi>Signior Magliabequo</hi> be a
genuine Piece) it may happly pass for one of the very first,
which for their great and extraordinary Services (even to the
saving <hi>Rome</hi> it self) the Republick might give Indulgence to.
And if any since had been so presumptuous (as where we find
the Heads of <hi>Metellus, Lucullus, Regulus, Iunius Brutus, Sylla,
Pompey,</hi> and some of the rest) one is not to imagine them
struck in their days, but by stealth, and such as were of the
Republick Party, or by some Descendant, or Relation who
happen'd to be Master of the <hi>Mints,</hi> who frequently set their
own Heads and Names, under protection of some <hi>Deity,</hi> with
<hi>Reverses</hi> of their Actions, and as Monuments of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and to do them Honor. Hence the Families of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61438:23"/>
               <hi>Aemilii, M. Lepidus, Pont. Max.</hi> Vested like a <hi>Consul,</hi> in the
Action of Crowning the young <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They durst not yet (as we observ'd) appear in Stamp till
after their decease, when (perhaps being Coin'd in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country or Province) they thus stole abroad by degrees,
and then too in a time of disorder,<note place="margin">Ursini prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Fam. Rom.</note> during the Civil Wars,
when the Laws were suspended, and every one did what they
pleas'd. For whilst the Republick flourish'd (as now the
<hi>United Netherlands</hi> represent their Commonwealth by a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
holding a cap of Liberty, and a sheaf of Arrows) the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
rarely made use of any Figure on their Coins, than (as
we noted) that of their <hi>Tutelars,</hi> the Image of <hi>Rome</hi> like a
Galeated Lady or Virgin in a flowing Vest, with <hi>Castor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux, Victoria, &amp;c.</hi> on the <hi>Reverse,</hi> as we see in those
<hi>Consular Medals,</hi> (so nam'd because struck during the time of
their Government) till <hi>Cesar</hi> (as we said) invaded all their
Privileges, and brake the Rule, by impressing not only his
own Effigies, but giving Licence to his Favourites and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
as well as to his Kindred, and even to Women, Wives,
and Concubines.</p>
            <p>Thus we find (besides divers Empresses) <hi>Brutus</hi> with <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
Mark Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Augustus, &amp;c.</hi>
What were afterwards stamp'd by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was out of pure Flattery to the <hi>Romans,</hi> now become
their Masters; whilst in the mean time such <hi>Medals</hi> of theirs
as we find in <hi>Gold,</hi> were for the most part the Heads of their
own Emperors. I say, before the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquests, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of which were the Effigies of <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa,</hi>
in complement to <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> and some few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>Thus far of single Heads. There are some <hi>Medals</hi> which
(as we noted) present us with Two Heads, either on the same,
or opposite side; of which one of them is almost constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Princeps Iuventutis,</hi> or design'd to Empire (excepting
such as we meet with of <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> of the
high Empire) distinguish'd easily by the word <hi>CAESAR,</hi>
without addition of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then comes in that of <hi>Ianus Bifrons,</hi> or rather <hi>Saturn</hi>
(by which the <hi>Romans</hi> seem to dispute with the <hi>Greeks</hi> for
precedency in point of <hi>Medals)</hi> whom some will have to be the
Patriarch <hi>Noah</hi> figur'd by <hi>Ianus,</hi> to whom they attribute the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61438:24"/>
first Coining of Money. The <hi>Romans</hi> indeed made a Ship
the Symbol of <hi>Saturn,</hi> feigning him and his Wife <hi>Rhea</hi> to
proceed from <hi>Oceanus</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> and that they were brought
into <hi>Italy</hi> by Sea. Others, that in recompence of his hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Reception he taught him (besides the Art of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry)
the Use of Money; before which it had no Stamp
or Impression upon it. In Recognition whereof, he joyn'd
the Head of <hi>Saturn</hi> with his own in a <hi>Medal, Revers'd</hi> with
the Ship which conducted him,<note place="margin">1 Fastor.</note> whence that of <hi>Ovid;</hi>

is, 'tis rather a double Face, than a double Head, one Head

that came into <hi>Italy</hi> by Sea, as <hi>Evander, Aeneas, &amp;c.</hi> who
brought nothing with them relating to Arts or Manners, to
be compar'd to what the Historian recounts of <hi>Saturn;</hi>
which therefore some will needs ascribe to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the
Ship to his Ark; which they deduce from that which the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians</hi>

the prediction of the Flood, Fabrication of such a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,

Add to this the <hi>Apamean Medal</hi> of <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> whose <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
was a Ship, with a Man and a Woman looking out of a
Cabin Window, and a pair of Doves with Branches in their

that dreadful <hi>Cataclysm,</hi> deriv'd to the Heathen World, doubtless
from the true History thereof in <hi>Genesis,</hi> as is at large discuss'd by
the learned <hi>Bochartus.</hi> I know there is another with almost
the same <hi>Reverse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phaleg. <hi>l.</hi> 1, <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> bearing the <hi>Head</hi> of the Emperor <hi>Philip,</hi>
(concerning whose being a <hi>Christian</hi> there's no small dispute)
with this only difference, of Four Persons appearing in the

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61438:24"/>
rather to represent the good Intelligence and Commerce which
there was between those of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and the City <hi>Apamea,</hi>
which Place, and Country all about it, receiv'd their supplies of

            </p>
            <p>As for the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> signifying <hi>Apamea,</hi> it was (as we said)
the <hi>Apotheca</hi> and Corn Magazine of the Country. The four
Men representing the Inhabitants, or perhaps Merchants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to either City; and lastly, the <hi>Dove</hi> and Olive Branch,
the <hi>Symbolum</hi> of Peace, Amity, and good Correspondence
between them; which likely Interpretation vacates all Mr. <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniers</hi>
Conjectures, and indeed all that is any where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for about it. Nor were the like Correspondences and
strict Alliances at all unusual, bearing the word OMONOIA,
as in that <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, &amp;c.</hi>
In the mean time to return to the Ship; this is
remarkable, that the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd no other <hi>Reverse</hi> than the
<hi>Ratis</hi> or <hi>Prow,</hi> as long as they continu'd to Stamp and Coin
only <hi>Copper;</hi> that is, till they made use of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi>
which was (as we have shew'd) five hundred years after
the Foundation of the City.</p>
            <p>But to dismiss this Pretence, and Challenge concerning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
and their <hi>Cythical</hi> Inferences. 'Tis certain the <hi>Roman
Medals</hi> are most worthy our Collection, as not only easier to
be obtained, but best understood, as they are commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by <hi>Consular</hi> and <hi>Imperial;</hi> and of which there are
found Coins of all the usual Metals and Models.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Consular</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Families, a <hi>Series</hi> of the
most Antient of the Latin (usually in <hi>Silver</hi> in the smaller
Volume, but some in <hi>Copper</hi> of all sizes) appears to be of
large extent, amounting to no less than fourteen or fifteen
hundred, without comprehending any, tho since call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls</hi>
(even as far down as to <hi>Iustinian)</hi> having the Name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without the Power. The true and genuine <hi>Medal</hi> reaches
no farther than to the Decadence of the Republick, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have little remarkable in them till the <hi>Imperial</hi> began,
as bearing only those badges we have already mentioned.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61438:25"/>
But among these (I mean the <hi>Consular)</hi> we sometimes meet
with other Nations Diadem'd Kings, as of the last <hi>Macedonian
Philips, Iugurtha,</hi> and several other famous Persons; both
the <hi>Brutus's, Metellus, Marcellus, Regulus, Sylla, Pompey, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus,
&amp;c.</hi> for the most part <hi>Silver,</hi> with some <hi>Medalions</hi> both
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> The like of the <hi>Imperial</hi> also, inscrib'd
with both those learned Characters, and that as far as from
<hi>Pompey</hi> to <hi>Posthumius</hi> of the <hi>Latin,</hi> or as some, down to the
<hi>Thirty Tyrants,</hi> and of the <hi>Greek</hi> to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> about which
time the most valuable Collections usually determine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the curious may, if they please, continue their search e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Reign of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who set a period to that once
renowned Empire: And tho they are in no sort comparable
for Sculpture or Design, yet belong they to the History, and
are on that account worth the small expence.</p>
            <p>I shall not need repeat, that under the Emperors there were
also struck divers <hi>Medals</hi> in honor of other famous Men, who
were not concerned in the Political Government; we have
nam'd <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and more of that rank, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the Impostor <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and several others; of which
hereafter. But thus you may observe, and by what has been
already spoken of the Origin and Progress of <hi>Medals,</hi> and
from their rude beginnings, perfection, decadency and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
how they still kept pace with the Commonwealth, State
and Empire; which falling out in the <hi>Gothic</hi> Revolution, or
time of the <hi>Heruli,</hi> may from that <hi>Aera</hi> be reckon'd the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi>
Period; of which the most Modern concern <hi>Europe</hi>
only, (for we meet with nothing considerable elsewhere of
this nature,) and are of recent Stamp: But thence indeed begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a fresh to discover some glimmerings of new Day, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
about the Fourteenth <hi>Century,</hi> when about fifteen Years
after, were Coin'd and dispers'd, the memorable Effigies,
Martyrdom, and Predictions of <hi>Iohn Huss, &amp;c.</hi> from which
time forwards were divers <hi>Medals</hi> made in <hi>France,</hi> and other
Countries, on sundry occasions. But what we find more antient
than those we first mention'd, are generally to be suspected,
unless such as served for <hi>Money</hi> only, and of lesser model, till
those of the <hi>Roman Pontif,</hi> which began to appear with <hi>Pope
Martin, An. 1417.</hi> since which there are spawn'd innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fry of <hi>Papal Medals</hi> and <hi>Medalions;</hi> for such I call those
of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> famous <hi>Bishops,</hi> and Ecclesiastick Courtiers,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61438:25"/>
               <hi>Nepoti, &amp;c.</hi> who have had the ambition of <hi>Medals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cardinal Francis Barbarini</hi> (late <hi>Nephew</hi> to <hi>Pope Urban</hi> VIII.)
design'd to have made a <hi>Series</hi> of all the <hi>Popes,</hi> from S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in <hi>Medal,</hi> from whatever Image or Representation he
could hear of in Statue, Picture, or Monument, to assist the
Invention of the Sculpto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; but the Favorite dying before it
could be executed, that Collection remains imperfect. We
have yet from P. <hi>Martin,</hi> and, I think, all his Successors
since, to the present Bishop. But it was <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi>
who about Fifty Years after (others say <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>Fourth)</hi>
was the first who imitating, or emulating rather, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperors, caus'd his Effigies to be Stamp'd in <hi>Medal,</hi> tho
they Coined Money before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> followed his Holiness; for
'tis certain, that before his Reign for near a Thousand Years,
that is, from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> there was very rarely found
the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>French</hi> King so much as in Coin; and then
came up the <hi>Testoons,</hi> (or Heads) as still they call them, tho,
as if they endeavoured to supply that defect, they have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the present Monarch as cheap as Counters, every Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
and Sign post bearing the Head and Effigies of <hi>Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Magnus,</hi> radiated like a young <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now that we have mention'd <hi>Counters (Computatio per
Calculos)</hi> so denominated from their help in Supputation, and
much in use about 400 years past, and still in constant Practice
in <hi>France</hi> (especially in all transitory Reckonings among the
Vulgar, besides what Gamesters use at Cards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
has been the variety for the Subject and Emblem, as
has amounted to at least Two Thousand several Designs and
Fancies, bearing the Heads and Effigies, Arms, Cyphers and
Devices of Kings, Princes, and other illustrious Persons; some
in <hi>Silver,</hi> (but for the most part in <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>blanch'd</hi> Metal)
seldom in <hi>Copper;</hi> and others which I have seen accurately
Printed in <hi>Horn, Tortoise shell, &amp;c.</hi> This Spawn of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
or <hi>Mock Medals,</hi> began about the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the
<hi>First,</hi> simple and without Figure, as serving for Calculation
only; but afterwards they were curiously Mill'd, and some
of them not without elegant Sculpture. Nor did the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
long abstain from vindicating by <hi>Counters,</hi> the vast Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of that <hi>once</hi> fastidious, now declining Monarchy, when,
according to the boasting Genius of that Nation, <hi>Philip</hi> the
<hi>Fourth</hi> not long since vaunted in a <hi>Counter,</hi> what the <hi>Indies</hi> had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61438:26"/>
brought him, with his <hi>HIC. TAGUS. ET. GANGES.</hi>
but which soon after <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> paid him in Kind
and Coin, by a <hi>Reverse</hi> wherein there was an <hi>Olive-Tree</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
by a <hi>Vine,</hi> and ripe Corn growing underneath, with
the same <hi>Motto,</hi> intimating, that the great Fertility of <hi>France,</hi>
so far exceeded that of <hi>Spain,</hi> as brought not only all that
the <hi>Indies</hi> produc'd, but preserved <hi>Spain</hi> it self from starving.</p>
            <p>Asking pardon for this trifling Digression. I shall not insist
on any other Collection of this nature, tho I cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of any thing relating to good Antiquity and Art; among
which come in <hi>Talismans</hi> and <hi>Sculps</hi> in <hi>Gemms,</hi> especially the
<hi>Onyx, Sardonyx, Achat, Cornelian, &amp;c.</hi> to be reckoned among
<hi>Intaglia,</hi> and other precious Furniture of the Cabinet, <hi>Dacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheca,</hi> and peculiar <hi>Gazae</hi> of Princes, and curious Persons
(such as was <hi>Iacomo Maria Favi,</hi> who, when he could not
purchase the Originals themselves, procur'd the Impressions
of innumerable choice Things, descending even to modern
Seals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) divers of them truly Antient, others pretending
to <hi>Astrological</hi> Secrets, Names, and extravagant Figures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be of Magical <hi>Energy</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> by vertue of
their Character: Some of the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> and others to be
worn as <hi>Phylacteries</hi> and <hi>Periapta,</hi> of high Veneration and
Use among the <hi>Arabs, Egyptians,</hi> and other Eastern People;
as sundry Incantated <hi>Medals</hi> and Baubles, are at this day
among the no less superstitious and ignorant Christians:
<hi>Populus vult decipi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, whilst that magnanimous Prince the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Savoy</hi> is in danger of so unmerciful an Enemy, as burns and
destroys wherever his Armies come (by a barbarity exceeding
the most Savage Nations we have mentioned) I cannot but
apprehend the possible Fate of that invaluable Collection of

of Draughts of <hi>Medals, Inscriptions, Relievos, &amp;c.</hi> with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

Invention (let <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the Crafts-men, and those who
are concern'd, talk what they please of <hi>S. Luke</hi> his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
original Paintings, and the <hi>Veronica)</hi> could so well
have preserved, as <hi>Medals,</hi> and as we find by those yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> especially the <hi>Caesars</hi> and
their Successors; since as to the rest (namely those antient
<hi>Hero's</hi> we have enumerated before them) nay even of the
<hi>Consular,</hi> there is less credit to be given to most of them,
being, as we said, made after their decease by their Friends
and Relations. The same doubt occurs even of those cut
in Gemms and Marbles, on which (whatever is pretended)
we seldom find any of their Names ingraven; tho if in any
(and such perhaps we may best rely on) those which have
been design'd from the most antient Marbles and Gemms
in <hi>Fulvius Ursinus, Leonardus Augustinus;</hi> and from them, as
to the old Philosophers in the learned <hi>Menagius's</hi> Edition
of <hi>Laertius.</hi> I do not say there are not some to be found
even of the most antient; <hi>Romulus, Numa, Ancus, Tullus,</hi> or at
least whoever may have liv'd within the compass of two
Thousand Years, since there are <hi>Medals</hi> yet remaining, believ'd
to have been struck so long ago, and Statues doubtless long
before, from which they might be copied. But as to the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi>
and their resemblances to the <hi>Archetype</hi> in <hi>Medals,</hi> I think
we have little reason to question, since they were (as we shew'd)
so nicely delicate and suspicious in this particular, that we read
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> would suffer none to<note n="*" place="margin">Quantum porro digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis à rege Alexandro tributum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti existima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; qui se Pingi ab uno Apelle, &amp; Fingi à Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippo tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo voluit. <hi>Val.

some <hi>Medals</hi> we have seen so accurately graven and wrought
to the Life (as they call it) that I firmly believe, when we
happen upon one that is perfectly fair and antient (suppose
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61438:27"/>
it a <hi>Iulius,</hi> or <hi>Augustus)</hi> we may as safely affirm it like the
Person, as any which our modern Coins present us with;
<q>—Sic vultus, sic or a ferebat:</q>
Which would raise ones indignation (as I have<note n="*" place="margin">History of <hi>Chalcogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
               </note> elsewhere
complain'd) against the presumptuous Exposures, which
Kings and Princes at this day suffer of their Effigies, by every
wretched Dauber on every Sign-Post among <hi>Cats</hi> and <hi>Monkeys!</hi>
By the way, as to the Images of our Venerable and Blessed
<hi>Saviour</hi> (of whom I have seen many with Reverses fill'd with
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Characters) there was not any stamp'd on <hi>Medals,</hi>
till a thousand years after his Incarnation; that is, till that
Age of almost palpable Darkness, in the Reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Iohn Zemisca,</hi> when the IHS did usually accompany it
instead of the Cross, used from <hi>Constantine</hi> downwards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Effigies.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>'Tis to be considered, as to the Resemblance in <hi>Medals</hi> of
the same Person, different in several <hi>Medals;</hi> that it is not
always an infallible Mark of their not being like; the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ages, and other Accidents, often and almost always
somewhat altering the Countenance. This, for instance,
is especially conspicuous in Coins of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, of the Great <hi>Constantine</hi> and others, as the learned
<hi>Fresnius</hi> shews in <hi>Familiis Augustis Byzantinis;</hi> caused partly by
the unskilful Graver, or, as we said, through the real Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Countenance it self; observing yet hardly any
Age so far to change and confound it, as wholly to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Master-strokes of Nature. In confirmation of which,
there are extant <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Adrian,</hi> of all his Ages: How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
they are otherwise to be known by the Stamp, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with their Character and Descriptions, even beyond their
supposed <hi>Busts</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> (to which they so rarely left their
Names insculp'd) let the curious (for example) judge by
taking the Picture of one of the <hi>Caesars</hi> from those who often
both saw, and convers'd with them, or liv'd so near the
Times when so many of their Statues and Effigies were fresh
and newly made, some in Marble, Copper, Wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
wrought and moulded by the Life, nor need we go further
than to <hi>Suetonius's Augustus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sueton. lib. 1. Aug.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forma fuit eximia, &amp; per omnes aetatis gradus venustissima, &amp;c.</hi>
He was (says the Historian) an extraordinary handsome and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61438:28"/>
beautiful Person, and continued so through all the Periods
of his Age; yet so incurious and little nice, and far from
tiffing and sprucing himself, that for haste he would now
and then suffer two or three Barbers at the same time to be
clipping and shaving him together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vultus erat, vel in sermone vel tacitus, adeo tranquillo sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nôuqe</hi>
&amp;c. His Countenance was so open and serene, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he spake or was silent; that a noble Person of <hi>France</hi>
confess'd to some of his Country-men, he was so mollified
and charmed with it, that it prevented a Resolution he had
once taken, of breaking his Neck from a Precipice as he was
passing the <hi>Alps</hi> and approaching him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oculos habuit claros ac nitidos, quibus,</hi> &amp;c. His Eyes were so
bright and sparkling, as there appeared something divine
and extraordinary in his Looks; so as he seem'd pleas'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Men, he lookt fixtly upon, cast down their Eyes, as
if dazzled with the Sun-beams.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capillum leniter reflexum, &amp; subflavum,</hi> &amp;c. His Hair
and Locks inclined to Fair, decently buckl'd and curled at
the ends.—<hi>Supercilia conjuncta,</hi> His Eyebrows met.—
<hi>Mediocres Aures, Nasum &amp; à summo eminentiorem, &amp; ab imo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiorem,
&amp;c.</hi> His Ears were of a midling size, his Nose
<hi>Aquiline,</hi> and bending towards the Top: in summ, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he was every way proportioned.</p>
            <p>I mention only those who are commonly represented to us
in <hi>Medals;</hi> other Descriptions were easie to be produced out
of the same and other Authors, living in the times of the
first <hi>Caesars,</hi> to justifie their Resemblances.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Borromeus</hi> (now Sainted) who was of a very
hard favour'd and crabbed Look, is, by Painters and Statua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
made of a very sweet and lovely Countenance. I do not
therefore affirm that all the Masters of these voluptuary Arts
were heretofore more free from flattering great Persons than
now they are; but that sometimes they might impose upon
future Ages, as 'tis reported of some <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they made
and buried Armor of enormous and gigantic Proportion, to
make the World believe, what extraordinary Men they were
by whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had vanquished them in his <hi>Indian</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But I am persuaded <hi>Medals</hi> are the least to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
in the Effigies of the <hi>Caesars</hi> especially, so perfectly
agreeing with their Characters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61438:28"/>
As for those <hi>Heads</hi> we have extant in Print and <hi>Taille-Douce,</hi>
certainly those exhibited by Monsieur <hi>Vaillant</hi> of the <hi>Syrian</hi>
Princes and other <hi>Medallists,</hi> seem to be most accurate, and
would have been of more Authority, had he and the rest
given us as many <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> as they have of <hi>Reverses,</hi>
and as we might yet hope from that numerous Collection
which has been long expected from Monsieur <hi>Morel,</hi> who
has been so ill, and so unjustly recompenced among the rest
of his persecuted Brethren: I say, how desirable were it that
the same Circumspection had been used by Ingravers in
other Books of this Subject, as in that which the industrious
<hi>Leonardus</hi> (whom we but now named) <hi>Antiquary</hi> to the late
Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII, has set forth, designed from the best O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
any where to be met withal among the Curious;
with the learned Preface, Explanation and Erudition of the
excellent <hi>Gronovius,</hi> who has translated it into Latin. In the
mean time I must not omit to give Notice, that such <hi>Medals</hi>
as personated the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> are commonly represented
in florid and vigorous Youth, without Beards; excepting <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
Neptune, Vulcan, Mars, Pluto, Hercules,</hi> who is yet
sometimes represented as a young Child <hi>imberbis,</hi> strangling a
Serpent, and by several Names of Places, Labours and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithets:
Bearded are also <hi>Pan,</hi> the <hi>Satyrs, Silenus,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> the River <hi>Deities,</hi> and there is a <hi>Fortuna bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, before we pass to the following <hi>Paragraph,</hi> I
cannot but mention a Curiosity of <hi>Medals,</hi> and other <hi>Intaglia,</hi>
painted in <hi>Miniature,</hi> to that perfection so extant, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
swelling out, as would almost persuade one they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
stamp'd: of these I have seen (and possess a few) very
accurately representing the <hi>Dead-Life</hi> (as our Painters call it)
that is, the natural Metal wrought in <hi>Relieve; Achats, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
and other Out-Cuts; which, since a <hi>Series</hi> of them
might be contriv'd in a Book, were a great and useful Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity,
and worth the Value of some in Gold; but which I
wish might be supplied by some learned and industrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that such a Collection were more exactly designed
and ingraven in <hi>Copper,</hi> after the best Originals; the several
Ages compared, and not designed hastily at adventure, or
negligently, as we find too many are. And this Assembly
should be universal, well attested, and judiciously chosen,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61438:29"/>
and collated with the different Ages of the Persons as near
as could be, for reconciling the Difficulties of the same Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
or Person, as we have noted above: I affirm such a
Collection (the laudable Design and Purpose of Monsieur
<hi>Morel</hi>) would not only be greatly assistant to such as have
not the Faculty or Means of storing themselves with the real
<hi>Medal,</hi> but acceptable likewise to those who have; and may
thereby consider them at more leisure, than others who have
but a superficial View; being commonly reserved in the
Cabinets of great Princes, to which there is not so easie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
for modest Scholars.</p>

            <p>HAving now finished what for the present I thought

we turn next to their <hi>Reverses</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> with <hi>Figure</hi> and

fruitful and full of Erudition; that had we a perfect
and uninterrupted Series of them, we should need almost
no other History; such Fragments as yet remain, furnishing
the Studious on so many Occasions.</p>
            <p>For we have in <hi>Reverses</hi> (besides now and then the <hi>Effigies</hi>)

the <hi>Montaries,</hi> with <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his Forging Tools:
They give us the Habits and Robes of <hi>Consuls, Kings</hi> and
<hi>Emperors, Flamens, Vestals,</hi> and other Royal and Sacerdotal
Garments; we are shewd by them what the <hi>Tripos, Lituus,

add, the <hi>Lectisternia,</hi> Marriages, Births, Funeral Pomps,

changed their Names (as now our <hi>Popes</hi> at their Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
but not in <hi>Medals</hi> of the first <hi>Caesars.</hi> And so Families
and Adoptions, and sometimes both, as <hi>Nerva Trajan,
Titus Vespasianus;</hi> and when (as often) the Name remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>DIVUS</hi> was only added.</p>
            <p>They present us with the most magnificent and stately

            <p>They afford us the Prospect of their Triumphal Arches,
<hi>Obelisks, Pyramids, Colossus's,</hi> and other Royal and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Fabrics of venerable Antiquity, long since collapsed and
buried in their own Ruines; but from out of which, by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses</hi>
and <hi>Medals,</hi> have almost all the antient Orders and
Ornaments of Architecture (well near lost or corrupted)
been much revived, restored and vindicated from <hi>Gothick</hi>
Barbarity; nay, and those yet lasting, after <hi>Charles the Great</hi>
had put a stop to that prodigious and universal Inundation;
since it is little more than a <hi>Century,</hi> that Building and other
Arts began to emerge in good earnest, and to hold up their
dejected Heads; as may be seen by what the <hi>Popes</hi> have done
at <hi>Rome,</hi> (where these learned Ruines are chiefly extant) the
Dukes of <hi>Tuscany</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and at <hi>Ferrara, Parma,</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61438:30"/>
other Princes of <hi>Italy; Philip</hi> the Second in <hi>Spain;</hi> in <hi>France,
Francis</hi> the First, whom they called the <hi>Father of Arts</hi> in that
Kingdom; and lately yet in our own Country, where some
part of <hi>Somerset-house</hi> in the <hi>Strand</hi> remains the almost only
poor Attempt that I know of; not omitting the Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
House at <hi>Hatfield;</hi> the noble Seat of the most noble
Lord Viscount of <hi>Weymouth</hi> at <hi>Long-leet,</hi> and very few others
which can pretend to any thing of tolerable: for the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-House</hi>
at <hi>Whitehal</hi> is of much later date; and the
manner now in general Use, first introduced by the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of that great Lover and Patron of good Arts, the
Illustrious <hi>Thomas</hi> late Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> who (tho
neglecting his own Palace) incited others to build with
Stone and Brick after the present Gusto, and which <hi>Inego Iones</hi>
since pursued in that stately Pile at <hi>Whitehal</hi> now mentioned,
the Church and Piazza in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> after the Model of
that in <hi>Ligorne,</hi> &amp;c. But which is at this day exalted (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Architecture)</hi> to a much greater (I might say, even to the
highest Pitch of Perfection) by my most worthy Friend
Sir <hi>Christopher Wren,</hi> Superintendent and Director of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Buildings, who will leave more noble Monuments of
his vast and comprehensive Knowledge in that and other
useful Arts, than has any one Architect here these thousand
Years.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what is learned from <hi>Reverses</hi> (since the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the <hi>Goths, Turks,</hi> and other barbarous People, who
chang'd and confounded the antient Names of things and
places) other singular Aids to good <hi>History, Chronology,</hi> and
antient <hi>Geography</hi> (to name no more) the Learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> in
his <hi>Eusebius</hi> (when we find him to have recourse to <hi>Medals</hi>
for the clearing many difficulties) gratefully acknowledges;
and since the often cited <hi>Mons. Vaillant</hi> in his <hi>Syrian</hi> History,
and the Works of <hi>Lucas Holstenius,</hi> late Library-Keeper at
the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and other learned Persons give luculent proof of.</p>
            <p>To these add the <hi>Iesuit Hardouin</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Pliny,</hi>
with several more, who, from the Reverses of <hi>Medals</hi> alone,
have recover'd and illustrated the true Names of divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
Islands, Rivers, Mountains, Ways, Limits and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
(and how by degrees they extended their Conquests)
<hi>Colonies, Cities, Metropolis;</hi> their Founders, Privileges and

use in computation of Time and Years, when several
famous and memorable Things happen'd and were perform'd;
others that had been quite forgotten; Writers having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
abolish'd the very memory of some Tyrants, and other
unfortunate Princes (who are commonly but of short Reigns)
<hi>Medals</hi> alone have preserv'd the Names of, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of great use in History; witness the famous <hi>Medal</hi>
of <hi>Estimius</hi> King of <hi>London,</hi> whence our learned<note n="*" place="margin">Burt. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have asserted her <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Title, against all the Critics and
Cavillers, tho she was no <hi>Roman Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may thus deduce many Claims and Titles in
cases of Usurpation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For instance, that signal one, wherein
is found that from <hi>Charlemaine, Louis le Debonair,</hi> down to
<hi>Lotharius, &amp;c.</hi> those Princes had their Monies Coin'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and other <hi>Medals,</hi> attesting and vindicating their Claim
and Title to that City, as appears in that learned Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
publish'd by <hi>Mons. le Blane,</hi> and subjoin'd to his History
of the Moneys and Coins of <hi>France.</hi> In which he proves,
that the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were never lawful Sovereigns of any
part of <hi>Italy,</hi> much less of that Capital City; but of old al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Subjects, Govern'd, Elected, and (as occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
Deposed by the Emperors; together with an Account
by what subdolous Arts they got footing in the large and
vast Possessions they now enjoy, and usurp the present
Power.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Epocha's</hi> (wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> were the most
accurate and particular) we shall best reckon from <hi>Roman
Medals</hi> by the <hi>Consulate</hi> or <hi>Tribunes;</hi> tho in that also there is
difficulty, by not knowing the precise years of their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Offices when the <hi>Medal</hi> was struck; whereas the <hi>Greek</hi>
gives the very year of the Princes Reign.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Colonies</hi> discover their <hi>Epocha's</hi> in <hi>Medal;</hi> as in
that under <hi>Philip, An.</hi> VIII. under <hi>Decius, An.</hi> XI. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which,
'tis said, some have so improv'd, as to be able to tell us the
very Age of the <hi>Emperor</hi> by the <hi>Medal,</hi> of which more when
we come to Inscriptions. In the mean while as to <hi>Colonies,</hi>
we find them bear the Names of the Founders, or of such
as either fortified or settled them; <hi>v. g.</hi> those call'd <hi>Iuliae</hi>
were founded by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> as was that at <hi>Berytus; Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipium
Augusta Bilbilis,</hi> by <hi>Augustus</hi> and the like; these by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61438:31"/>
single Persons: But when more were express'd, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two Names together immediately, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
or any word between (and not else) one is then
to reckon the first to be the Founder, and the second the
Restorer. Thus in the <hi>Medal</hi> where we read <hi>Colonia Iulia
Augusta Detrosa,</hi> there <hi>Iulius</hi> settl'd and planted the Colony,
and <hi>Augustus</hi> Recruited it: But when <hi>Augustus</hi> is set before
<hi>Iulius,</hi> there <hi>Augustus</hi> Repair'd only what <hi>Iulius</hi> Founded,
as <hi>Monsieur Vaillant</hi> nicely criticises. By the way observe,
that we meet with no Heads in any <hi>Italian Colonies,</hi> that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
it seems being allow'd to those Cities only which were
Priviledg'd to stamp Money, which Immunity is mark'd
upon the <hi>Medal,</hi> whether granted by the <hi>Senate</hi> alone, or

We moreover learn of him, that such Colonies as were sent

considerably enlarg'd. Nor did Cities and Colonies only
do honor to the Emperors, and Benefactors in <hi>Medals</hi> and

            <p>We mention'd Dedication of Cities, the <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61438:31"/>
supposed to be the very Day when that <hi>Medal</hi> or Coin was
struck, like that of old <hi>Rome cum Urbis Imagine,</hi> tho as
<note n="*" place="margin">Zonaras.</note> some think, the Dedication was not at the laying of the
first Stone or Foundation (as now the custom is) but rather
at the finishing and consummation of the Work; and these
usually bore the <hi>Heads</hi> of the Founders, or such as rendred
them famous; as the <hi>Tarentines</hi> and others. Thus the Island
<hi>Coos</hi> had <hi>Hippocrates, Samos</hi> the Image of <hi>Pythagoras; Smyrna</hi>
that of old <hi>Homer, &amp;c.</hi> tho happly not stamp'd at the time
when they flourish'd, but from such Pictures, or antient
Statues as were doubtless thought to resemble them.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>Critica</hi> and <hi>Grammar</hi> (besides what concerns Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
History, Jurisprudence, and other parts of the politer Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
oblig'd a little to this delightful Study. The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamma</hi>

<hi>Medals</hi> stamp'd so long since at <hi>Corinthus,</hi> spake <hi>Latin</hi> in
their <hi>Inscriptions</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, seeing the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
which that victorious People planted and sent forth,

We have already spoken of a <hi>Reverse</hi> in the <hi>Consular</hi> of
<hi>Lepidus</hi>'s being delegated by the <hi>Senate</hi> and People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to young <hi>Ptolomie</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And in another, <hi>Marcus
Antonius</hi>'s caressing of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> In a third, <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi>
with the Reverse of a Poniard and Cap of Liberty, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his bold attempt to have freed the Commonwealth by
the death of <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> But what is most singular and
conspicuous in it is, the Notation of the very day, when
that bold stroke was given, namely, on the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi>
of which he had fair warning before.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Trajan</hi> we have represented the manner of
their restoring Kingdoms to a vanquish'd Prince; and so in
others of the <hi>Imperial</hi> there might be produc'd abundance
of Examples illustrating the like Histories; some of them (as
we said) no where else to be met withal, others confirming
things doubtful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return to <hi>Names,</hi> Historians had not known that the
Son which <hi>Antoninus</hi> had of his Wife <hi>Faustina</hi> was call'd
<hi>M. Annius Galerius Antoninus,</hi> but by a <hi>Greek Medal</hi> of that
Lady; or that <hi>Barbia Orbiana</hi> was Wife to <hi>Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
or <hi>Hetruscilla</hi> the Spouse of <hi>Trajanus Decius,</hi> and not of
<hi>Volusianus.</hi> It is in the <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Medal,</hi> that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of many antient Families are preserved, which neither
<hi>Ursinus,</hi> or any other Author makes mention of; as among
several more <hi>Alitia, Barbatia, Carrilia, Epira, Fabricia, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Helvia, Iuventia, Menia, Nautia, Papilia, Sextilia,
Trebonia, Vatinia, &amp;c.</hi> enough to fill an Alphabet. It is in
the <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Medal</hi> only where we are shew'd in what
manner that Statue of Coloss Magnitude, representing the
noble Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> was clad and plac'd (which that
egregious Painter <hi>Iulio Romano</hi> has design'd, and the learn'd
<hi>Ciacconius</hi> describ'd) upon that stupendous <hi>Column,</hi> vested in his
Imperial Robes, and holding in one of his hands a Golden
Ball, in which were contain'd his own Ashes; in the other
a Scepter, with the <hi>Cancelli</hi> of <hi>Copper</hi> about the <hi>Plinth</hi> of the
<hi>Capital;</hi> it being the only <hi>Column</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> which, I think,
had any considerable Figure upon it. There are besides
what this Pillar exhibits divers <hi>Medals</hi> of this Prince, whose
<hi>Reverses</hi> shew us his <hi>Aquaeducts, Via, Forum, Circus,</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arch, and the Bridge he made over the <hi>Danube,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those of his Reduction of <hi>Armenia, Mesopotamia, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61438:32"/>
We learn from the <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Medals,</hi> as well as by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
that of old they made use of no Stirups to get up, or
ease their seat on Horseback, and other things of new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>Again, we gather from <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Medals</hi> the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
care they took of the Sea and Navigation, as well as
to celebrate their Victories. In that of <hi>Augustus, Neptuno
Conservatori; Victoria Nep.</hi> in that of <hi>Gallienus;</hi> and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> with his Titles of <hi>Praefectus
Classis, &amp; orae Maritimae,</hi> together with a <hi>Trophy</hi> on the Prow;
and in the <hi>Reverses of Augustus,</hi> whom we mention'd, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with the <hi>Rudders, Rostra, Tridents,</hi> Ships and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and other marks of Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> we behold in <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Medals</hi> the manner of
<hi>Military Adlocutions, Congiaries, Liberalities,</hi> and Royal <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
to the People, taken, as they report from <hi>Callistratus,</hi>
who, that he might incourage the People of <hi>Athens</hi> to come
and frequent again the Courts and Publick Assemblies of the
City (now during the Civil Wars in a manner quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted)
caused Money to be flung and scatter'd among them
in those Places: In imitation whereof great Princes do at
this day disperse Coins, <hi>Nummi Augurales,</hi> and <hi>Medals</hi> at their
Coronations, and other solemn Occasions; as was that at
the Nuptials of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> with <hi>Ann</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Uladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> An. 1515. Thus also
the <hi>Pope,</hi> when he is Crown'd, scatters Money and <hi>Medals</hi>
among his Adorers, which is first but of <hi>Brass,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the words of S. <hi>Peter, Argentum &amp; Aurum non est mihi, &amp;c.
Silver and Gold have I none, but such as I have give I you;</hi> and
then by and by (as soon as his Holiness is lifted up, and
exalted in his pontifical Chair) he sprinkles Silver, with
that of the <hi>Psalm, Dedit pauperibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath given to the
poor; his righteousness endureth for ever.</hi> With this holy <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi>
sporting with <hi>Scripture</hi> after a pleasant manner. But
to proceed,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Medals</hi> gave intimation of extraordinary
Laws and Ordinances; as that of <hi>Tenes</hi> against Adultery,
stampt at <hi>Tenedos,</hi> and described by our learned <hi>Graves,</hi> who
from a <hi>Medal</hi> of his own, recites the History at large out
of <hi>Heraclides.</hi> For as it was accounted a glorious Thing
to have enacted wholsome Laws and Constitutions revok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61438:33"/>
others; so was it often express'd in these more lasting
Records; witness amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> those <hi>Medals</hi> of the
Families <hi>Cassiae, Papiae, Coeliae, Parthiae, &amp;c.</hi> and in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
one of <hi>Augustus de Maritandis Ordinibus;</hi> with other
excellent ones of the Emperor <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi> to the public
Benefit; the generous <hi>Remission</hi> of this noble Emperors Right
over the <hi>Vehiculation,</hi> and all the Carriages of <hi>Italy,</hi> which
was so grievous an oppression to his Subjects, is, I think,
made known to us from the <hi>Reverse</hi> of a <hi>Medal</hi> only, which
the People caus'd to be stamp'd in Recognition of the Grace.
To these add his establishing free Commerce, repressing
Disorders in the Commonwealth; which procur'd him those
deserv'd Titles of <hi>SALUS GENERIS HUMANI</hi>
in his <hi>Medals,</hi> where commonly the <hi>Reverses</hi> express some
<hi>Symbols</hi> of them; as in their due place.</p>
            <p>And now that we have mention'd <hi>Symbols</hi> in <hi>Reverses</hi> of
<hi>Medals,</hi> they shew us, with the Images and Names of the
<hi>Pagan Deities, Custodes, Auspices, Patrii, Genitales, Nutritores, &amp;c.</hi>
their Ensigns and Distinctions: <hi>Iupiter</hi> by the Eagle; by the
Harp or <hi>Chelys Apollo,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>Gryphon; Neptune</hi> by his
Trident and Rudder, sometimes on a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> but never on
the <hi>Marine</hi> Horse, tho it be Consecrated to him; <hi>Pluto</hi> his
Fork; by the Tyger or Panther <hi>Bacchus; Hercules</hi> by the
Club and Lions Skin; by a Serpent <hi>Esculapius, &amp;c. Venus</hi>
by <hi>Cupid,</hi> or the <hi>Doves,</hi> Helm of a Ship, and sometimes
<hi>VICTRIX</hi> by a Target, Cask, Bow and Arrow, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the power and force of Love. Nor was that Symbol
of the Doves attributed to their noblest <hi>Venus</hi> for their sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
as the common mistake is, but too the veneration they
acquired by the story of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> whom they report was
fed by those gentle Birds, into one of which she was fain'd
to be Metamorphos'd, and in that shape ador'd by the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
under the Name of <hi>Astarte.</hi> There is yet a more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Goddess of the Name, the <hi>Celestial Venus,</hi> represented
holding an Apple in one hand, and a Spear in the other;
and if with a little Infant, <hi>GENETRIX</hi> or <hi>FELIX,</hi>
betokening the fecundity of Marriage; <hi>Iuno</hi> has her <hi>Peacock;
Diana</hi> her Crescent, quiver of Arrows, Dog, and sometimes
we find her naked and full of Breasts, a Basket of Fruit on
her Head, as they picture Nature, and not seldom also with
a brace of Harts or a Doe standing by her: she is likewise
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61438:33"/>
accompanied oftentimes with some <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deity, as <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,
Isis,</hi> or <hi>Apis,</hi> and now and then the <hi>Pharo's,</hi> for the
Friendship between <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Others there are
relating to <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and Mysteries of State, <hi>Gryphons,
Harpies, Syrenes, &amp;c.</hi> requiring Study and Interpretation.
And hence we now and then encounter with <hi>Sphinges</hi> in
the <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Augustus,</hi> signifying Prudence and Courage;
and if plac'd before a Temple, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Religion.
The Thunder-bolt according as 'tis plac'd, betokens seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Passions, as well as Regal Power, or that Sovereign
Princes are more immediately under the Divine Protection:
For <hi>Iupiter</hi> tho but one, we find, denominated from divers
Places and Attributes, according to which he is benign, propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
displeas'd or offended; as where he is <hi>Capitolinus, Olympius,

            <p>But to commence at the <hi>Head</hi> in this Recension also
(besides what we have already mention'd) without insisting

The <hi>Phrygians</hi> wore a crooked Bonnet pointing

               <hi>Lares;</hi> nor were the <hi>Genii,</hi> Topic, as well as Personal, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Reverses: They were figur'd by naked young Men,
holding the <hi>Patera</hi> in one hand, and in another a <hi>Horn of Plenty,</hi>
sometimes standing by an Altar pouring out of the <hi>Patera,</hi>
and were as many as there were Places, Societies, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
under their imaginary Guardianship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> (whose <gap reason="foreign">

their <hi>Apis</hi> figur'd like a <hi>Bull</hi> with the Flower <hi>Lotus</hi> between

The same have <hi>Osyris, Isis, Canopus,</hi> and the Deess <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nythia,</hi>
with a Lily-form Flower, or as some, the <hi>Abroto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
We likewise find <hi>Canopus</hi> in the shape of a large Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Jar or Pitcher, out of which there peeps an human
Head; but the <hi>Bust</hi> of <hi>Anubis</hi> is a Dog's Head. <hi>Amazons</hi>
carry the Battle-Ax on their shoulders, or a small <hi>Pelt</hi> or
Buckler Crescent-fashion: In deeper <hi>Busts</hi> and the <hi>Reverses</hi>
of larger <hi>Medalions,</hi> we meet some of these with Cask and
Shield holding a bridl'd Horse, betokening Victory in Fight,
or some Publick Shew. If the Figure have lying by it a
Sledge, Hammer, Anvil, Tongs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conclude it <hi>Vulcan,</hi>
or some of his brawny <hi>Cyclops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Busts</hi> in the Reverse of <hi>Medals</hi> (as before
observ'd) so are <hi>Hands,</hi> and what they hold and carry in
them to be consider'd. Thus the <hi>Hasta pura,</hi> or unpointed
Javelin suits with all the Gods, denoting their universal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity:
So does the <hi>Scepter,</hi> rounded or blunt on both ends
like a Generals Commanding Staff, or what they call
<hi>Parazonium</hi> (frequently taken for a short Sword) found in
some <hi>Reverses</hi> of the Emperors <hi>Galba, Domitian, Vespasian,</hi>
and others, about which the Critics yet are not well agree'd;
for in that of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> 'tis a Javelin or half Pike arm'd
at both ends.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patera,</hi> or some such Religious Character, did usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accompany the Emperors, which sometimes they held
in their hand, seeming to pour an Offering upon the Altar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Termini,</hi> are Figures without either Arms, Hands,
or Feet, so represented, says <hi>Polybius,</hi> to shew that all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and contests about the Limits were determin'd. Such
is the <hi>Mercurius</hi> Herma in a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Augustus,</hi> standing
upon a Thunderbolt, which some interpret to be in relation
to that Emperors <hi>Device, Festina Lente.</hi>

A branch of Laurel in the hand of an Emperor, signifies
Victory; of <hi>Olive</hi> Peace, and hand joined in hand Friendship
and Unity, also Adoption, as in that of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Cocceius

Senatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In whole and intire Figures are commonly represented the

<hi>Piety</hi> like a veil'd Matron, holding a Temple, or box of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
with a Stork standing by; but <hi>Vesta</hi> with a Taper; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia</hi>
seems to touch a Globe with her staff; <hi>Pudicitia</hi> is
modestly veil'd with one finger at her lips. If pressing them

Aequitas</hi> holds the balance, and so does <hi>Moneta,</hi> who is said
to be a Deity, represented by three Figures with the <hi>Cornuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
and near them as many melting Furnaces, and a heap
of Money, to note the three principal Metals, inscrib'd <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Graces</hi> are also three naked and beautiful Virgins,
holding each other by the hand; by the same number is
symbolized <hi>Aeternitas</hi> shaded with a swelling sail over their
heads, importing time past, present and to come, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a single Figure holding the Sun in one hand, in the
other the Moon. Lastly, the <hi>Eumenides</hi> and <hi>Furies,</hi> arm'd
with a Torch, a Poniard, and a Serpent: <hi>Nemesis</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
is pourtrai'd with a Wheel, shewing that tho Divine
Vengeance has long patience, it comes at last with speed:
But the Wheel which we find at the foot of <hi>Fortuna,</hi>
denotes inconstancy. She is also sometimes sitting, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
standing, and sailing, with her hand on a Rudder, or
<hi>Cornu-Copia,</hi> distributing good and bad, and is but one and
the same Deity. <hi>Security</hi> is typified by a woman leaning neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
upon a Chair. The four <hi>Annual Seasons</hi> are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by as many naked Figures, one excepted, who is clad
for winter. The other three have an <hi>Hare,</hi> a Basket of
Flowers, and a Sickle. We sometimes meet a little Child
bestriding a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and such equally appertain to <hi>Melicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
Palaemon, Portumnus,</hi> three names of the same Deity. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
cumbent upon Pitchers and Jars, represent great and
famous <hi>Rivers,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Bust</hi> only emerging out
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61438:35"/>
of the Vessel. <hi>Nilus</hi> has several naked Boys playing about
him, to signifie his many streams: Where we meet Figures
lying along upon Beds, a <hi>Lectisternium</hi> is represented, on
which they usually plac'd the Image of <hi>Apollo, Diana, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
or some other Idol, with solemn Ceremony in time of
calamity, or Epidemic Sickness, as well as upon more joyful
and festival entertainments.</p>
            <p>To go on with things animate upon <hi>Reverses;</hi> the <hi>Phenix</hi>
symboliz'd Consecration, and Immortality; the <hi>Stork</hi> Piety
and filial Duty; the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> Wisdom and Science, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
and Providence, as one sees in a <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Constantine:</hi>
the <hi>Cock</hi> is often with <hi>Mercury;</hi> the <hi>Horse</hi> feeding repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
a Country in peace, rich and abounding; the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>
some Publick Spectacle, and sometimes Eternity; as
the Serpent <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> or the Deess <hi>Salus,</hi> and is now and
then the mark of a <hi>Genius,</hi> or some famous Hero, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Victory if under foot: <hi>Nero</hi> had such a <hi>Reverse;</hi> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
within a Garland of ears of Corn and Poppy, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Plenty: the <hi>Ox</hi> signified strength and patience, and when
accompanied with a veil'd Priest, some <hi>Colony;</hi> if for <hi>Victim</hi> destin'd, the Beast had Ribbons dangling about his Horn:
Liberty of Commerce and Dominion on the Sea, were both
represented by a <hi>Dolphin</hi> clinging about a Trident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Characters of <hi>Inanimates</hi> on the <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Medals</hi> were
likewise frequent. Thus the Cap, or Hat and Wand, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
Freedom, <hi>Slaves</hi> being uncover'd and under Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
the <hi>Cornu-Copia,</hi> or <hi>Amalthean-horn</hi> was the <hi>Symbol</hi> of
Plenty; as <hi>Serapis's</hi> Bushel was of Providence: the Port or
Gate of a City, found in the <hi>Reverse</hi> of some <hi>Medals,</hi> with
the word <hi>Providentia Augusti,</hi> shews a Magazine and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Corn for the People; and if a Star appear over
it, the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in particular: A fortified Camp
is express'd by a sort of <hi>Calthorp;</hi> a <hi>Tripos</hi> with the <hi>Iackdaw</hi>
and <hi>Dolphin,</hi> is the mark of the XV. <hi>Viri,</hi> deputed Keepers
of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles; the Sacerdotal Cap or <hi>Miter,</hi> is
known by the appendant <hi>Apex</hi> and <hi>Flamine,</hi> either alone,
or with sacrificing Instruments, denoting Pontifical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Bucklers and Votive Tables <hi>pro Salute Principis,</hi> and other
Occasions, are very frequent in <hi>Reverses;</hi> a <hi>Wheel</hi> is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of some famous Way made or repaired by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61438:35"/>
as in a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Trajan.</hi> In short, the <hi>Zodiac</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in all its Figures with the <hi>Moon</hi> in Center, was
Emblem of the universal Happiness of a Princes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
such as we meet in a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi>
and <hi>Augustus</hi> was fortunate under <hi>Capricornus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> shut proclaims an universal Peace
thro all the <hi>Roman Empire:</hi> A Gally, or Vessel under Sail
and in Course, betokens Joy, Felicity and prosperous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
but if we find it placed beneath a Figure wearing a
<hi>Turrited</hi> Crown, shews it to be a Port of Commerce; if
under a Victory wing'd, the vanquishing of an Enemies
Fleet.</p>
            <p>But besides all these, Kingdoms, Countries and Provinces,
are distinguished in <hi>Reverses</hi> by their respective Symbols;
<hi>Europe</hi> by the <hi>Horse,</hi> or the Rape by <hi>Iupiter;</hi> some affirm
there never was any <hi>Reverse</hi> at all appropriate to her: <hi>Asia</hi> is
known by the Serpent and the Rudder of a Ship, as a
Country of Commerce accessible by Sea, and the first of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators;
<hi>Africa</hi> is Cask'd with the head or spoil of an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi>
having by her a <hi>Scorpion:</hi> Of the <hi>European</hi> Provinces,
<hi>Macedonia</hi> is represented by a Carter with a whip in his hand,
as a Country of excellent Horses, and sometimes also by
<hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club; <hi>Achaia</hi> had a Flower-pot; <hi>Dardania</hi> a Cock;
<hi>Spain</hi> a Coney, or Olive-branch, and woman in a Soldiers Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sock,
a small Target and two Javelins; <hi>Gaule</hi> is with a Spear,
and in the close Military Coat or <hi>Sagum; Dacia</hi> is figur'd by
a Woman with a Spear also, and sometimes an <hi>Asses</hi> Head;
<hi>Pannonia</hi> by two Women warmly clad, with Military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
denoting the coldness of the Country, and courage of
the Inhabitants; <hi>Italy</hi> is represented by a Royal Lady Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a Tower, sitting on a Globe and holding a Scepter
with an Horn of Plenty; <hi>Germany</hi> by a goodly Dame with
a long Shield, and holding a Spear; <hi>Britannia</hi> represents
a Virgin in a flowing Vest, sitting on a Rock or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
with a Spear in her hand, and leaning on the Rudder,
the Prow of the Ship at her Feet; <hi>Boeotia</hi> has the God <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>'s
<hi>Thyrsus,</hi> or a Cluster of Grapes; <hi>Rhodes</hi> the Sun, or
a <hi>Rose</hi> the Solar Flower; <hi>Sicilia</hi> shews three Thighs and
Legs, issuing from a Man's Head in the Center, to signifie
the three famous Promontories of that Island, and sometimes
by a <hi>Sickle</hi> and Ears of Corn, denoting Plenty and Felicity; of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61438:36"/>
               <hi>Asia, Iudaea</hi> is represented by the Palm-Tree; <hi>Arabia</hi> by a
<hi>Camel; Persia</hi> by a <hi>Dart; Armenia</hi> by a Cap or Hood, Bows
and Arrows; <hi>Parthia</hi> by a Woman in that Country Dress,
with the like Weapons and a Quiver, to shew their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dexterity in shooting; <hi>Cappadocia</hi> has a Woman wearing a
Turrited Crown, and sometimes with the Mountain <hi>Argaeus</hi> in
her hand or near her feet. And now we speak of Mountains,
we find in the <hi>Reverses</hi> of some <hi>Medals</hi> a rude Stone in shape
of a Mountain drawn in a Charriot, representing the <hi>Sun,</hi> as
he was ador'd by <hi>Helagabalus</hi> his Priest, fancying that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Planet an huge <hi>Ignite Stone</hi> with the Star or <hi>Phosphorus</hi> over
it, preceding its Rising, to distinguish it from those of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla:</hi>
But Stones have other significations; as that in the
form of <hi>Pyramis</hi> with a pair of Turtles plac'd in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
resembling that of <hi>Venus</hi>'s worship'd at <hi>Paphos;</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
was himself sometimes ador'd in the shape of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
whence perhaps it is we meet <hi>Argaeus</hi> so frequently in
<hi>Reverses.</hi> But to return to Countries:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> is represented between the two famous Rivers
<hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with a kind of Miter upon her head.
In <hi>Africa, Egypt</hi> has the <hi>Crocodile</hi> and <hi>Ibis</hi> for <hi>Symbolum,</hi> and
sometimes the antient <hi>Taber,</hi> an Instrument play'd on by
their Priests, as was the <hi>Sistrum</hi> by those of <hi>Isis.</hi> With these
a <hi>Medalist</hi> has notice of the most famous Rivers by their
several Figures, <hi>Tiber, Rhenus, Danubius, Nilus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>With the <hi>Nymphs, Naids, Syrens, Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Sylvan</hi> Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
The true Figures of the <hi>Hippopotamus, Crocodile, Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros,
Elephant, Cameleopard, Panther,</hi> and other rare and exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
Animals, usually led, and exhibited in Triumph, or
prepared for Combat and the <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> are expressed to
gratifie and divert the People, especially during the <hi>Secular</hi>
Shews. Other <hi>Reverses</hi> present us with divers Flowers, Fruits
and Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Countries and Rivers had their several Emblems,
so had their chief Cities: <hi>Rome</hi> her <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wolf; <hi>Corinthus, Pegasus</hi> and <hi>Bellerophon:</hi> the
<hi>Sphinx</hi> and <hi>Harp,</hi> the City <hi>Gabala</hi> in <hi>Coelosyria; Constantinople</hi>
the <hi>Thunny,</hi> and other places abounding with that Fish; <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniel</hi> with the <hi>purple Shell,</hi> the <hi>Shell</hi> is common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
upon those <hi>Reverses,</hi> but the <hi>Dog</hi> is rare; <hi>Ephesus</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the <hi>Hart</hi> or <hi>Stag,</hi> sacred to her <hi>Diana.</hi> But I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61438:36"/>
confess some of these belonged rather to their <hi>Coins</hi> as <hi>Money,</hi>
which, as we noted, had denomination from these Badges;
for so that of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was stampt with the Image of <hi>Diana;</hi>
those of <hi>Creta, Iupiter;</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> with a <hi>Crocodile</hi> or <hi>Ibis,
Nilus</hi> or <hi>Serapis; Lacedaemon</hi> with the Head of <hi>Lycurgus;
Delphi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 13.</note> the Fish of that Name; of which see more in
<hi>Alexander ab Alexandrio</hi> and other Authours.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Military Ensign</hi> plac'd upon an Altar, denotes a new <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi>
of <hi>Veteran</hi> Souldiers, whose Felicity depends on the
<hi>Gods.</hi> If there be many Weapons, it signifies their being
drawn out of several <hi>Legions,</hi> but Military Ensigns <hi>alone,</hi>
if more than one, sometimes import the Victory of some
particular Legion, or betokens an Oath of Fidelity to the
Emperour.</p>
            <p>Besides the <hi>Eagle,</hi> which is the Standard-Ensign of every
<hi>Legion,</hi> the Rest are distinctions of <hi>Cohorts</hi> only, or <hi>Guidons</hi>
and <hi>Cornets</hi> of the <hi>Cavalry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Acroteria</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is the ornamental ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Prow, gives notice of a Naval Victory, or some Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
City: the <hi>Rudder</hi> of a Ship on a Globe with the <hi>Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
is sovereign Power: so a Spear lying cross a <hi>Curule Chair,</hi>
signifies a <hi>Consul, Aedile</hi> or some person of Pontifical Dignity,
it is likewise a Symbol of <hi>Iuno</hi> and Consecration: By the way,
there is an <hi>Ivory Chair</hi> at <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> said to be a <hi>Roman
Curule,</hi> but the Shape of it does by no means answer; for
they were not only plainer, but made with arched Legs and
round-back'd, more resembling that easie Chair, which is
wont to be plac'd under the Imperial or Canopy of State, at
Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cornucopia</hi> is common to all the <hi>Deities,</hi> Symbols of
Beneficence and Abundance, especially where there are two,
nor is the <hi>Caduceus</hi> always attributed to <hi>Mercury</hi> alone, but to
Royal and Universal Power and Authority; for so 'tis found
with a Horn of Plenty and the Pontifical Mitre in a Reverse
of <hi>Iulius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abundance</hi> is also symboliz'd by Ears of Corn appearing
out of a Bushel, with the heads of Poppy, which of all
Plants produces the greatest plenty of Seeds. Other Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of Abundance and Fertility are Clusters of Grapes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
of Flowers and Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With the <hi>Augural Lituus,</hi>
we oftentimes see two Pullets, or some other Bird which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61438:37"/>
they kept for Divination, and not seldom in their Coops and
Cages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And may these suffice with others enumerated
by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and the late <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Science,</hi> and such
as we have already named; where one has their descriptions
more at large, but which for being so very necessary to be
known and remember'd, ought not to be counted a needless
Repetition: For <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> may be easily distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> not so <hi>Reverses,</hi> which having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Symbol</hi> only, require particular Explication, as do
other <hi>Emblems, Devises</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> inclosing Morals,
recondite Mysteries and Actions; recommending and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the most conspicuous Virtues of the Persons and
things they relate to. And thus all that was heroical and
great, peculiar and eminent, and properly regarding Antient
History, its Circumstances and Accessories, is, we see, fetcht
out of <hi>Medals</hi> and their <hi>Reverses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 13. ad 17.</note> as <hi>Agostino</hi> amply, and
<hi>Suaresius</hi> more contractedly have given us a Taste.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it is, that such <hi>Memoirs</hi> were consigned to
the most lasting Materials; and that the Heroic Ages bore such
Veneration to Antiquity and the Exploits of their Renowned
Ancestors, that they hung up the Skins and Spoils of <hi>Lions</hi> and
<hi>Serpents,</hi> and other destructive and furious Beasts as wasting
whole Countries, had been killed and cleared by them.</p>
            <p>They adorned the Vestibules and Porches of their Temples,
Halls and Palaces with Armour, Weapons, Trophies, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Urns, Tables and Inscriptions, and all sorts of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As among the <hi>Gaditani</hi> (for instance) they shew'd
<hi>Pygmalion</hi>'s <hi>Auream Olivam;</hi> the <hi>Argives, Atrei Phialum;</hi> the
Skin of the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Boar <hi>apud Arcades;</hi> those of <hi>Delphi,
Pindar's</hi> Chair; as did the <hi>Metapontines</hi> that of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi>
the <hi>Parma Antaei</hi> made <hi>Tanger</hi> famous; <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Bull, those
of <hi>Agrigentum; Leda</hi>'s Egg, those of <hi>Lacedaemon;</hi> the <hi>Arca
Cypseli,</hi> those of <hi>Olympus, &amp;c.</hi> Others the Spear of <hi>Achilles;</hi>
the Harp of <hi>Timotheus;</hi> Fair <hi>Helens</hi> Necklace; the Lamp of
<hi>Epictetus.</hi> These, and the like (long since lost and decay'd,
and not to be compar'd with <hi>Medal</hi>) rendred many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Cities famous; and so fond they were of them,
that <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">In Verrem.</note> 
               <hi>Nulla unquam Civitas tota Asia &amp; Graecia
signum ullum, Tabellam pictam, ullum denique or namentum urbis,
sua voluntate cuiquam vendidit, &amp;c.</hi> They would not alienate
or part with them for any price; as neither of late years
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61438:37"/>
would they of <hi>Rome</hi> sell to that magnificent Collector of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
<hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> the fragments
only of a broken <hi>Obelisc</hi> which had lain neglected so many
Ages in the <hi>Circ</hi> of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> since piec'd together, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that goodly Fountain of <hi>Piazza Navona</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Bernini,</hi> a stupendious Monument of his admirable
Talent.</p>
            <p>There are still at <hi>Rome, Florence, Pisa, &amp;c.</hi> other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
belonging to the Cities, and daily purchas'd and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
Statues, Historical Columns, Trophies, Altars,
Urns, Inscriptions and Pictures, which they keep to adorn,
and for the honor of the Place and Nation, which I know
not that they do in any other; for if they did, those Statues
and other venerable Antiquities search'd out, and with so
great diligence, affection and vast expence, brought from
<hi>Athens, Delphi, Smyrna,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Greece</hi> by that
noble <hi>Earl,</hi> would not have been dispers'd, as I find they
were; those <hi>Inscriptions</hi> only excepted, which were frankly
bestow'd on our <hi>Athenae</hi> (the University of <hi>Oxford</hi>) at my
sole Request to the late illustrious Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and I
had his promise of that <hi>Colossian Minerva</hi> to have follow'd,
but his Grace's so unexpected Death prevented my timely
getting it remov'd. I know not whether it was not since pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
with many other <hi>Statues</hi> by the <hi>Lord Vicount Lemster,</hi>
who for his great love of all that is magnificent of this kind,
and for his no less civilities to me, I think my self oblig'd
to mention with much regard; glad that they are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of one who both knows how to value and
preserve them. For by such <hi>Collections</hi> (as I said) Countries
and Cities become Schools of Art, attracting learned Persons
and many Strangers to visit their Antiquities, as now abroad
to the Churches, Shrines, and reputed holy Places. Nor
did all,<note place="margin">In Verrem Orat. 4.</note> or any of these Circumstances of old <hi>Smyrna,</hi> with
the advantage of her famous Port and Haven, render it so
celebrious as the antient Picture of <hi>Agathocles;</hi> nor the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertines,</hi>
as that one Collection of <hi>C. Hejus,</hi> of which the
<hi>Orator</hi> (describing the Antiquities of his Palace near <hi>Messina</hi>
in <hi>Sicily</hi>) <hi>Messanam ut quisque nostrûm venerat, haec visere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebat:
Omnibus haec ad visendum patebant quotidie; Domus erat non
Domino magis ornamento, quam Civitati, &amp;c.</hi> One nobly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
House was not, it seems, a greater Reputation to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61438:38"/>
illustrious Owner, than to the whole City it self. And thus
<hi>Thepsia</hi> for an excellent Statue of <hi>Cupid</hi> only (the work of
<hi>Praxiteles)</hi> was visited by Travellers and Strangers, <hi>nam alia
visendi causa nulla est:</hi> It had nothing else, says <hi>Cicero,</hi> in it
worth seeing. Upon this account it is, that the <hi>Palaces</hi> and
Studies of the <hi>Farnesi, Medici, Barberini, Pozzi, Angeloni, &amp;c.</hi>
at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Tuscany's</hi> at <hi>Florence; Septalius</hi>'s at
<hi>Milan,</hi> with their Cabinets of <hi>Medals, Statues, Inscriptions,</hi>
and other Antiquities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make <hi>Italy</hi> still venerable in her
very Runis:<note place="margin">Salust.</note> And for what Use and End all this Cost and
Curiosity we are told by that noble <hi>Historian (de Bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,)</hi>
not for nothing or merely to look upon and delight
the Eye with only: <hi>Nam saepè audivi Q. Maximum, P. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pionem,
praeterea Civitatis nostrae praeclaros viros solitos ita dicere,
cum majorum imagines intuerentur, vehementissimè sibi animum ad
virtutes accendi: Scilicet, non ceram illam, neque Figuram tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
vim in sese habere; sed memoria rerum gestarum, eam
flumam egregiis viris in pectore crescere, neque prius sedari,
quam virtus eorum famam atque gloriam adaequaverit.</hi> The
very sight of their Effigies call'd to their minds the
glorious Actions they had perform'd, and even inflam'd them
with an Emulation of their Virtues; nor did it rest there
till they themselves also had done something worthy their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
To this the incomparable <hi>Cicero</hi> again (pleading
the cause of an excellent Poet) <hi>Quam multas nobis Imagines non
solum ad intuendum,<note place="margin">Orat. pro Archia.</note> verum etiam ad imitandum, fortissimorum
virorum expressas Scriptores &amp; Graeci, &amp; Latini reliquerunt;
quas ego mihi semper in administranda Repub. proponens, animam
&amp; mentem meam ipsa cogitatione hominum conformabam,</hi> &amp;c.
And in good earnest, where there is no more Superstition
paid, than what upon the sight of modest Pictures, Statues,
<hi>Medals,</hi> and other productions of Art, these learned <hi>Pagans</hi>
shew'd them for ought appears: I should be no <hi>Iconoclast</hi>
and Demolisher, tho I <hi>abhor Idols,</hi> and cannot but wonder
that Men of Reason and Power to Reform, should give
and continue Scandal to so many excellent <hi>Christians,</hi> and
to so many who are not <hi>Christians</hi> but would be so, were
they either taken away, or (if left standing) their Cult abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
not the imitation of the Sanctimony and Virtues of
those whom they represent. For thus (to return to <hi>Reverses)</hi>
it seems they so inspir'd Men with their very looks, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61438:38"/>
the noble <hi>Alphonsus</hi> us'd to say, he never beheld <hi>Caesar</hi> in
<hi>Medal</hi> without some extraordinary Emotion, inflaming his
breast with an Emulation of imitating his greatness of Mind
and conspicuous Virtues. For the same reason of old, they
plac'd and set up their <hi>Signa, Busts</hi> and Pictures in their
<hi>Pinacotheca's</hi> and Repositories, especially in the <hi>Vestibules</hi> and
<hi>Prima Aedium parte,</hi> Porches, Halls, and particularly in their
<hi>Libraries,</hi> some of Marble,<note place="margin">

Non solum exauro, argentove, aut certe aere in Bibliothecis dican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

Hero's, who seem to breath and speak to us as they stand.
Thus things not really present, appear at least as if they were,
inciting us with a desire of enjoying the absent Person:
for instance, the Poet <hi>Homer;</hi> there being in my opinion
(says he) no greater felicity, than this universal Inclination
of knowing what manner of Man such and such a Person
was.</p>
            <p>How strong a passion the sight of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Statue alone
kindled in <hi>Caesar,</hi> when it made him shed Tears, out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
or Ambition, that such a stripling in comparison to
his Age, should have so far exceeded his Conquests! having

Master of a Province. And doubtless there is nothing does
more stimulate a noble and generous Spirit than a Virtuous
Emulation; and therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> allow'd the use
of Statues also, in that ingenious <hi>Idea</hi> of his Republic (where
otherwise we find him very sparing of unnecessary Pomp
and Expences) when discoursing of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<hi>Non paucis</hi> (says he) <hi>tantum deterrent à flagitiis; sed
propositis quoque honoribus ad virtutes invitant: Ideoque Statuas

bene gestarum Memoriam, simul ut ipsorum posteris majorum
suorum gloria calcar &amp; incitamentum ad Virtutem sit, &amp;c.</hi> And
therefore of old they never decreed those Honors of <hi>Statue</hi>
or <hi>Medals,</hi> but to such as had perform'd some signal Exploit,
or Invented some useful Thing. In this manner they Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and made them Noble, as <hi>Aemilius</hi> and others: and

again, overthrew and broke their <hi>Images</hi> in pieces, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
their <hi>Medals,</hi> when upon any vile Action, or notorious
Treason they deserv'd ill, or betray'd their Country; of which
Histories afford innumerable Examples. And indeed, when
Men (be they never so great and well born) degenerate from
their illustrious Ancestors,

only arguing an infinite plenty of Artists and Materials, but
likewise of magnificent and glorious Thoughts, even
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61438:39"/>
in the common Persons of those Ages, besides the Relation
those goodly Monuments and Memoirs of well doing and
meritorious Persons had to nobler Designs; not as a bare and
transitory entertainment of the Eye only, or gentle decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Time, but that it had a secret and powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
even towards the advancement of the best of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
by their continual representations of great and
virtuous Examples; So as in that point Art became a piece
of State.</p>
            <p>Remarkable for this sort of Magnificence, and one of the first
was <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> (the most learned and knowing Person of the
Age) who made a Collection of all the famous Men from the
Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> to his own Times. <hi>Cicero, Atticus</hi> and
others, follow'd him to that height of Curiosity, as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> that he sought to have the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch Abraham</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extraordinary Persons, as well as of <hi>Achilles, Alexander,
Plato</hi> and others of the Gentile Hero's and Philosophers.</p>
            <p>We have seen, how instead of Ensigns and painted Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
they carried them in Pomps and Processions of State,
stampt and cut in all sorts of Metal, Stones of price, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,
and the most durable Marbles; and this they did for
almost Two Thousand Years, especially in Money and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
innumerable, whereof much is yet remaining, much
more 'tis probable than what is yet come to light, found
here and there casually in single pieces, and often in heaps,
full <hi>Urns</hi> and Jars, to shew the immense Treasure of that
once flourishing State, and vast Extent of its numerous <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
which not only inlarg'd their Conquests over Men,
but (as in recompence of the Changes and Devastations which
they made) Civiliz'd the Barbarous World by their Laws
and Learning, useful Arts, and exemplary Virtues.</p>
            <p>And now after all we have produc'd in favour of <hi>Statues,

approving or encouraging that abandon'd and passionate love
which some have shew'd, in a restless and expensive pursuit

Antiquaries have done, to the prejudice of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,

               <note place="margin">Pignor. Epist.</note> writing to the <hi>Abbot Barisonus,</hi> tells us
(with no small indignation) what a World of Antiquities lie
buried, broken, and neglected. And as to <hi>Medals,</hi> of a
<hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant that melted down abundance of rare <hi>Coins</hi>
to make a Chain of Gold for his Wife to wear. And <hi>Schot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Apothecary who cast a Mortar for the use
of his shop of an invaluable Collection of <hi>Medals,</hi> which had
been left him by his curious Father: <hi>Dignus utique ipse pistillis;
sed in grandiore Mortario Anaxarchi more tundi:</hi> Nay, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
adds, that when, <hi>An. 1506.</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> a Goldsmith was
wont to cast little Shrines and Statues of gold and silver <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;</hi>
he did often use to boast, that he made none but of
such precious things. Such another encounter I remember
the noble <hi>Busbequius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Busbeq. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</note> tells us he met withal in his Embassy

of a Brasier whether he had any <hi>Medals</hi> (or as the <hi>Truks</hi> call
them, <hi>Infidel Money,</hi> using them for weights only) the Pagan
<hi>Tinker</hi> told him, he had a shop-full of them a day or two
before, but that he had newly melted them all, to make
<hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Kettles.</hi> But this of old the nobler <hi>Romans</hi>
(as if foreseeing it) took such care of, that besides a Law expresly
prohibiting the melting down of any Coin or <hi>Medals;</hi> to
preserve all other noble Monuments from being so much as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61438:40"/>
any ways marr'd or injured (expos'd as many of them were

<hi>Libraries,</hi> Buildings of Magnificence, and other publick
Decorations and Ornaments.</p>
            <p>The truth is (whatever care there was of old) 'tis not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an Age since they were even at <hi>Rome</hi> it self so negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
Barbarous, that some <hi>Harpies</hi> would have demolish'd
the <hi>Arch</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and so obliterated the Memory of
that great Emperor and Revolution, as far as in these wretches
lay, had not <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> taken care to prevent them:
They had already pull'd down the <hi>Septizonium</hi> of <hi>Severus,</hi> so
as there now remains no <hi>Vestigia</hi> of that noble and singular
Antiquity, nor of many a <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> besides (as that of

and were proceeding upon the only remaining <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater</hi> of <hi>Titus,</hi> miserably defac'd already; so as that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
City had by this time been hardly known so much as
in her Ruins.</p>
            <p>To resume then our Subject, and at once, <hi>&amp; instar om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
to shew their incomparable Use, and how vastly they
might contribute to the Universal Republic of Letters, were
it possible to make a complete Collection, and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, as doubtless they have
been stamp'd and distributed upon all signal Occasions, when
great numbers were utter'd and dispers'd from time to time,
besides those which were also frequently found under the
Foundations of Public Edifices (on whose <hi>Reverses</hi> was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Model or Picture of the Fabric) I affirm, were such
a Treasure to be met with, the learned World would be
furnish'd and inrich'd with a World of rare Antiquities;
vouchers subsidiary to good History, and of what there has
past of Memorable, with far more certainty than from any
other perishable Records whatsoever, since <hi>Medals</hi> are not
justified by Books and Authors, but Books and Authors by
<hi>Medals</hi> rather. I cannot (says the illustrious <hi>Scaliger)</hi> but
admire how many noble Records, rare and recondit Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are contain'd, and have been transmitted to us in <hi>Medals</hi>
and <hi>Inscriptions, quae nos fugiunt,</hi> and of what we could never
else have had such clear and perspicuous Testimony! But he
who has a mind to see how <hi>Medals</hi> vindicate and support
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61438:41"/>
antient History preferrable to Books, may consult the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Spanheim</hi>'s Preface and Notes on <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I must acknowledg, that I have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by that <hi>Bass Relieve</hi> still extant on that <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi>
of <hi>Titus,</hi> which at my being at <hi>Rome</hi> I caus'd to be most
accurately Delineated by <hi>Carolo Morotti</hi> (since, for his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Talent advanc'd to be the <hi>Popes</hi> chief Painter, and
worthily now esteem'd the first of <hi>Europe)</hi> with all the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunae</hi>
and Detritions in so long a tract of Time, to prevent
the being impos'd upon by most, if not by all those <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
(not excepting <hi>Francis Perrier,</hi> esteem'd to be the most
faithful) whose Prints I have ever seen, and who presume
to supply what is quite worn out with their Conjectures.
I say I have been more edified by this undoubted Antiquity,
and by the <hi>Medals</hi> representing to us the sad and deplorable
Eversion of that once glorious Temple, and Destruction of
that obstinate People for their prodigious Ingratitude and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in putting to Death the Son of God, than by all that
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> and other Historians of that time or since, have
left us in their Books.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that many passages of moment have
been falsely grounded upon these venerable Monuments; as
from that known <hi>Inscription SANCTO. SANCO. SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONI,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apolog. 2.</note>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Holy Martyr S. <hi>Iustin</hi> and others since;
whilst prejudice and superstition make others to mistake the
most grosly; as the learned Dr. <hi>Spon</hi> clearly shews in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Father <hi>Chaise,</hi> who pretended to derive and prove the
Antiquity of the <hi>Popish Mass</hi> from a <hi>Medal</hi> stampt in the time
of <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> because forsooth, in a certain <hi>Reverse</hi>
of that Emperor, one sees a little round thing upon an Altar,
which being more heedfully inspected (without the aid of
<hi>Microscopes)</hi> evidently appear'd to be a <hi>Mund</hi> or Imperial Globe
only; but which the zealous <hi>Iesuit</hi> took for a Consecrated <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:</hi>
Thus <hi>quod volumus facile credimus.</hi> But the instances we have
hitherto produc'd are Authentic and without Reproach, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and establishing what is pretended from them beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And for the Historical Part, by what is already
among the Curious and lovers of this Study; we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
question, but those Kingdoms and flourishing States
who took such care to preserve and trasmit those noble
and worthy Actions to Posterity, were not less diligent and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61438:41"/>
curious not to suffer any thing of Signal and Illustrious to
escape them, than a very Modern State and Commonwealth
near us, have to this day (to our reproach or neglect at home
be it spoken) in their most laudable Imitation of the wisest,
most renown'd and prosperous Commonwealth we find Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
for their Wisdom and Virtue.</p>
            <p>An egregious Instance of this may be seen in what <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Bizot</hi> and his Continuator have Publish'd, in the
<hi>Histoire Metalique de la Rep. d'Holland</hi> (Printed first in <hi>Folio,</hi>
since in three elegantly Design'd and Insculp'd <hi>Octavo's)</hi>
where one has the intire History of whatsoever has passed of
Public and Memorable by Sea or Land, in Peace or War of
any sort, relating to that wonderful Commonwealth. All
of it deduc'd, represented and supported by, and from the
Records of <hi>Medals,</hi> Stampt and Publish'd in the year, and
at the times when such and such Actions happen'd to
be done and were fresh in memory; and that from the
very Infancy of that State, and defection from the Crown
of <hi>Spain</hi> to this day; together with apposite <hi>Devises</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions</hi>
both of Things and Persons, Monumental, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conducing to divers Passages of our Modern Histories and
Revolutions (abating of some Liberties which perhaps might
decently have been pass'd by, not so well becoming the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of <hi>Medal,</hi> but which are yet Matters of Fact) namely,
their Wars, Sieges, Expeditions, Truces, Peaces, Alliances,
Negotiations, Discoveries, Colonies, Adventures, Plantations,
Companies, and Improvements of Arts and Manufactures.
In a word, nothing Memorable has escap'd the <hi>Medal;</hi> nor
what of other Countries that have had any relation to them:
Sometimes to the Honor of their Nation, useful and full of
profitable Diversion: Verily a Curiosity, together with the
Historical Discourses upon them, worthy both the Collection
and Cabinet of the Curious.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore with their <hi>Reverses:</hi> We have there
represented (besides <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies)</hi> all that has fall'n
out of Great and worthy the notice of History, frequent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
referring to most Actions not of <hi>Europe</hi> only, but of
both the <hi>Indies</hi> and the whole World, in any sort relating to
(I think) the most Industrious People in it. For instance,</p>
            <p>They have <hi>Medals</hi> of the very first occasion of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt</hi>
and <hi>Emancipation</hi> from the Tyranny and Oppression of

               <hi>Philip II.</hi> under which they groan'd, upon his endeavouring
to introduce the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and in order thereunto erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new Bishopricks and Tribunals, infringing their antient
Immunities and Constitutions: And how from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
Name of <hi>Geux</hi> and Vagabonds, to <hi>High</hi> and
<hi>Mighty;</hi> they in less than a Century asserted their Rights and

to give them their due, they freely consign to the Record
of <hi>Medals,</hi> as well their disasters as their Triumphs; the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of their Country, and several Conspiracies against it.</p>
            <p>All these, and many more which we pass over, elaborate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and curiously Design'd, Engraven and Coin'd in <hi>Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>Copper,</hi> together with apt Inscriptions and Symbols;
so that none seem more laudably ambitious either of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalizing
their Actions, or for the benefit, incitation, and
imitation of Posterity, or vindication of Authors and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than this Republique; none more addicted to Public
Works and Improvements, therein emulous of, and in some
things even transcending the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> hereself.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Iaques de Bie</hi> did, in the year 1646. set
forth his <hi>France Metalique,</hi> beginning at <hi>Pharamond</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

pompous Volume. But as it is intirely taken up in those sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Deferences, so to the dishonor of those excellent Uses
we have celebrated <hi>Medals</hi> for; we should altogether have
omitted the mention of what we do in this kind, were not
some passages so notorious, and some of them so disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
and such as may serve to convince the present, as well
as future Ages, that whatsoever impartial History shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
record, of Actions the most inhumanly Barbarous that
any Age has produc'd among <hi>Christians</hi> (or indeed the most
Savage Nations) may be justified by the <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
both Stamp'd, and daily Publish'd to acquire the Name
of GRAND, and establish it upon unheard of Ambition,
Cruelty and Oppression, and the shedding of human Blood,
Banishments and Desolations; which, methinks, is so far
from deserving the Honor of <hi>Medal, Inscription</hi> and <hi>Triumph,</hi>
as the best of Princes have merited them all, by the grateful
and immortal Memory of true and lasting Glory; not by
Titles only of Piety, Zeal and Justice, but by their <hi>Clemency</hi>

Great Monarch; his Sieges, Conquests, Buildings, Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Treaties, Truces, Leagues, Conventions, Parliaments,
Laws, Abolitions, Military Orders, Marishals, Colonies,
Forts, Triumphs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would require a Volumne but to
recite a little of them all; nor indeed am I willing to believe
them half approv'd of by the Prince; tho by those Royal
Flatterers <hi>Perault, Carpentier, La Chapel,</hi> and other Court-Wits
they seem to be, who have labour'd those <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> divers
of them appearing so boldly prophane, and with Attributes
of Omnipotence; others so fulsomly Arrogant and Vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and some again scandalous; mean, and trifling; which,
tho added to the <hi>French</hi> second Edition, are yet Historical
of considerable Passages. To give a Specimen of but few.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Medal</hi> representing the King standing between
the two Cities of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> holding the World
on the point of his Sword:</p>
            <q>Victori perpetuo, ob expugnatas urbes ducentas.</q>
            <p>That is, <hi>Pyrgopolinices</hi> like, laying whole Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in Ashes and Desolation. Another, <hi>Rheno, Batavisque
una superatis 1672.</hi> upon that surprizing Invasion, and since
more fatal one <hi>Ultimo Aditu Hostibus Germanis Galliae, &amp;c.</hi>
and actually, during all the Blood-shed and Violation of the
solemnest Treaties, <hi>Pacatori Orbis;</hi> which brings to mind
that Raillant <hi>Medal Galienae Augustae,</hi> with the Legend <hi>Pax

I confess when I turn over <hi>Code Louis</hi> XIII. from <hi>An. 1598</hi>
for now almost an hundred years, comprehending at large
all these <hi>Edicts</hi> with that solemnity Reiterated, Verified and
Registred in several Parliaments, and other Sovereign Courts,
confirmed and granted under the Hands and Seals of <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and all his Successors since; together with the
Oaths of the Supreme Magistrates, and Judges, to observe it
as a Law perpetual and irrevocable, as if Enacted by the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> without any exception. I cannot, I say,
but be astonish'd at what is since done, and made boast of
not only in time of peace, but without the least provocation
of his suffering, and (by his own confession) meritorious
Subjects! But such is this Monarchs pleasure;
<q>—Stat pro Ratione, Voluntas.</q>
But the following are modest, <hi>Sufficit Orbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They radiate the King with the Sun-beams (nor do they
more in their Pictures of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father)</hi> as if alone suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to govern the Universe;
<q>
                  <l>Non alio cerni Majestas se velit ore,</l>
                  <l>Non aliud Mundus poscat habere caput.</l>
               </q>
Comparing his Majesty to that illustrious Planet in no fewer
than seventy five <hi>Devises</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions.</hi> To which add
(what most of all they seem fond of) <hi>Nec pluribus impar.</hi>
But which was indeed the <hi>Impress</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> (as already we have shew'd) written about a Globe
of the World; which, how since from so glorious a Rise
and <hi>Meridian</hi> it is declin'd and ready to Set, might be a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument,</hi> and shew how short and transitory all worldly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
is; but, to prevent that fate, we are told in another
<hi>Reverse, Nec cesso, nec erro.</hi> And, <hi>Caesar-like,</hi> in another,
<hi>Ut vidi, vici;</hi> nay, far exceeding all the <hi>Caesars, Satis est vidisse,</hi>
kills with his very looks; and so does the King of Serpents
the <hi>Basilisk:</hi> And in another <hi>Solo lumine terret,</hi> sending forth
Rays not like the benign Sun to light and comfort, but to
burn and destroy. Thus in another upon the Conquest of
the <hi>Franche Compte,</hi> where the <hi>Reverse</hi> represents a Mountain
of Snow dissolving at the Suns approach; and of the same
kind that unsatiably Ambitious one,
<q>
                  <l>Nusquam meta mihi.</l>
                  <l>I know no bounds.</l>
               </q>

Swallowing all under the pretence of <hi>Appennages;</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds
me again of another of the former <hi>Philips, Non suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit
Orbis.</hi> The <hi>Reverse</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Courser unbridl'd, and
galloping round the Globe of the Earth. But we have seen
how lamentably he was tired before he came to his Journeys
end, within eight or nine years after.</p>
            <p>But what may not he do, whose Law is his Will? For
so 'tis declar'd in the <hi>Medal Bombarding</hi> of <hi>Genoa:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>QUOD. LIBET. LICET.</l>
                  <l>What I list is Law.</l>
               </q>
Whereas in truth, <hi>Pauciora licet ei quàm ulli, cui licet omnia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, and the like, exceeding all that's Modest, <hi>truely
Great,</hi>
and <hi>Christian,</hi> makes me with good reason question;
whether these <hi>Medals</hi> were ever so much as seen, or approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of by <hi>Le Roy Tres Chrestienne,</hi> the <hi>most Christian King.</hi>
Wherefore, after all, I cannot but impute them all to that
<hi>bane</hi> of Princes, and worst of Subjects, <hi>Sycophants</hi> and <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;</hi>
who, to shew what he has perform'd by Sea, as well

            <p>In good earnest, who can seriously allow any Countenance
to this Abuse of <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> which I look upon
and esteem as the noblest Repositories of great and serious
Matters? So as I have frequently wish'd, that we of this
Nation had oftner imitated the laudable Examples of those
Wise and Noble People, who (as we have shew'd) suffer'd
nothing of truly Great and Worthy to pass, which they did
not transmit to Posterity by <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions;</hi> Modest
and Pertinent, and far from that turgid Vanity and gross A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation,
as to the most perennial and lasting Records.</p>
            <p>Nor does this Excess of Flatteries reign among the <hi>Wits</hi>
and <hi>Poets</hi> only, or such as <hi>Blaspheme for Bread;</hi> but is gotten
among the <hi>Clergy</hi> too: nay and crept into the <hi>Monasteries</hi>
and <hi>Cells</hi> of the very <hi>Minimi-Monks</hi> and <hi>self-denying Orders,</hi>
without any Reprehension or Notice at all taken by their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
to discountenance or repress it: Witness their late
publick and famous <hi>Theses,</hi> in which Intrepidly and <hi>sans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi>
they compare a Mortal Prince, whose Breath is in his
Nostrils, to the True and <hi>Eternal God,</hi> no fewer than twelve
times; ascribing to him all those Attributes and Perfections,
which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> make only due to the <hi>Divine Majesty;</hi>
thereby inferring, that the <hi>Transcendent Wisdom</hi> of the most
<hi>Christian King,</hi> is Argument alone sufficient to Convince all
<hi>Atheists</hi> of the Existence of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and of his <hi>Angels</hi> too:

which, whilst these meek and creeping Souls, who profess
so much Evangelical Simplicity (and would above all others,
be distinguish'd for their extraordinary Sanctity) presume to
affirm; gives not only great scandal to others, but to some
worthy Persons also of that Communion; wondering that
the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> (who are set to be the continual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
and Guardians of those Boundaries which are plac'd to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
that which is due to <hi>God</hi> alone from that of <hi>Caesars)</hi> should
suffer such Bold and Impious <hi>Theses</hi> to escape the <hi>Spunge</hi> and

But of this Pagan and Slavish Adulation of Princes, see co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious

c. c. 14, 15, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, let not yet the ill use which two or
three Prodigies of Men, and their <hi>Parasites</hi> have made of
them (for we read but of few exceeding that number, even
amongst the <hi>Domitians</hi> and Pagan Emperors) who prevented
those venerable Monuments of the bravest Actions; and were
therefore noted with Infamy; had their <hi>Statues</hi> broken, their
<hi>Medals</hi> call'd in, and <hi>Effigies</hi> defac'd: I say let them not
discourage us from Imitating those Illustrious Princes and States,
who have modestly deliver'd to us many brave and profitable
Notices, by their <hi>Medals,</hi> which had else utterly, and perhaps
irrecoverably been lost to the Learned World: For so the
Lives, and worthy <hi>Memories</hi> of several Great Emperors are left
and transmitted to us (as those of <hi>Iulius, Augustus, Vespasian, Titus,
Nerva, Trajan, Antoninus, M. Aurelius, Septimus Severus, &amp;c.</hi>
with innumerable Rare and Remarkable Things and Passages
of their Reigns, by the Study and Industry of many learned
Authors upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61438:47"/>
Since then the greatest Nations for Renown and Virtue
have been thus celebrated, and incited to brave and glorious
Actions, by having the <hi>Memories</hi> of them, among other last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monuments and Records, thus consign'd: It would raise
Pity, with just Indignation, to find a Kingdom so fertile
of Gallant and Illustrious Persons, so poorly furnished, to
shew (by any accomplish'd <hi>History</hi> or <hi>Series</hi> hitherto extant)
what has been done and atchiev'd by Ancestors truly Great,
and permit me to add, worthy the Consideration in <hi>Medal;</hi>
and whose Effigies alone were desirable for their Virtues,
equalling many of them to the most Celebrated of the Antients,
and deserving the stamp of the most precious and lasting
Metals. I grieve to find so very few <hi>Medals</hi> of this kind
among us, in an Age so polite and knowing, during all the
Changes, Revolutions, and signal Events either of this, or
foreign Countries, where we have been concern'd in Voyages
and Discoveries, Conquests, Colonies and Plantations: So
many prodigious Fights and Conflicts at Land and Sea, wherein
those <hi>Heroes</hi> have signaliz'd themselves comparably with any
which former Ages can produce: For what People of the
Universe can boast of greater Men for Arms and Arts? But
to name them, and yet neglect them, would be more to our
Reproach.</p>
            <p>For besides some <hi>Coronation</hi>-Pieces and <hi>Medals</hi> stamp'd on
the Births, or Nuptials of two or three late Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We
have ('till <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> of Blessed Memory) almost nothing
to shew which can well pretend to <hi>Medal:</hi> 'Tis true (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Barbarous Ages) we have summarily mention'd
what <hi>British, Saxon</hi> and other later Coins remain among our
Modern Collections, genuine, and of good Antiquity, as to
this Island (exceedingly well engraven in Mr. <hi>Speed's Chronicle</hi>
from the Coins themselves, collected by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and
now augmented, and improv'd in the new Edition of <hi>Camden</hi>)
without <hi>Reverse,</hi> Shield or Inscription; besides perchance a
rude <hi>Cross,</hi> Name of a King, and sometimes of the <hi>Mint,</hi>
with that vulgar Sentence <hi>Dieu &amp; mon Droit,</hi> in use 'till King
<hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and the Union with <hi>Scotland</hi> made some little
alteration; none of which are to be look'd upon, or consider'd
as <hi>Medals,</hi> but as <hi>Money</hi> only.</p>
            <p>My worthy and learned Friend<note n="*" place="margin">Nat. Hist. cap. X.</note> Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> tells us of a
Coin, or Token rather, bearing the Head of <hi>Edward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,</hi>
somewhere found in his Perambulation of <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61438:47"/>
which by an hole or appendant Ring, he conjectures to
have been given to wear about the Necks of such as had been
touch'd for the <hi>King's-Evil;</hi> that Religious Prince being it
seems, the first who had the <hi>Charisma</hi> and Sanative Gift, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to his Successors <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> But this, tho' for
its Antiquity, (and as it related to that particular Effect) it
deserv'd our Notice; yet is it neither to be reckon'd amongst
our <hi>Medals,</hi> as having neither <hi>Legend</hi> nor <hi>Reverse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To commence then with the very first and earliest that
it has been my hap to see of <hi>Historical,</hi> and which may
pass for <hi>Medal:</hi> A <hi>Golden Royal of Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

Ship at Sea; holding a Sword in his right hand, the Shield
with the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in his left: The Royal
Standard <hi>arbour'd,</hi> and displaid at the <hi>Stern,</hi> &amp;c. Justifying
as well his Title to the Dominion of the Sea, as Soveraignty
of <hi>France:</hi> This <hi>Medal,</hi> for so I call it (tho' it also pass for
Money) being purely <hi>Historical,</hi> appears to have been struck
about the time of the Treaty of Peace between that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Monarch, and King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in behalf of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their eldest Sons; namely, <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Black

Numbers of <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Counters,</hi> as a Great Potentate
does; We have yet you see, gotten together such a Collection,
as with a few Links more, would serve to compose a Series
Capable of furnishing an Historical Discourse with a Chain
of Remarkable Instances, and Matters of Fact, without
Fiction or Vain <hi>Hyperboles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, what other <hi>Medals</hi> there remains of this
Sort, relating to our Country in the hands of the Curious; I
can give no farther Account of: I am yet well pleased to find
those of his late Majesty <hi>(Charles</hi> the <hi>Second)</hi> his Return, and
Restauration; Though I could have wish'd the <hi>Reverses</hi> had
been more expressive of that signal Providence, as it concerned
the Church and state of this Kingdom; having ever looked
upon it as a <hi>Miracle</hi> (and since some there are who establish
their Faith so much upon the frequency of them) next to
that of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Deliverance, rightly consider'd in all its
Circumstances, extraordinary and rare Events; by far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
any thing that boasting Party can produce to Affect
their Cause; since the Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>I have been the Longer in giving Account of what <hi>Holland</hi>
alone has published in her <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Reverses (Memorial,
Votive, Triumphant, Gratulatory, Inauguratory, Obsidional,</hi> &amp;c.)
because the Series is so Intire, and Historically Instructive, as
may serve to shew what we have lost of the Antients; who
as frequently we have noted, lest nothing Memorable in
danger of being forgotten by Posterity, which might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated
in some more durable and noble Matter, than <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Reeds, Skins of Beasts, Paper and Parchment. And we
see with what Success the Learned and Curious have Improved
their Diligence in this kind; by their being able to deduce and
Justifie so much of the <hi>Greek, Roman</hi> and other noble History,
even out of these few <hi>Medals</hi> alone that are come to light: Few,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61438:84"/>
I say in Comparison of the Numbers stamp't and which yet
lie buried. To how much Greater Perfection then, and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
might it be advanced, had we intire, and un-interrupted
<hi>Series</hi>'s and Collections of those which were truely Antient
(yet desiderate and Wanting) to supply these <hi>Chasms</hi> and
defects! We should then have had our <hi>Caracticus, Cassibelan,
Alfred, Athelstans;</hi> our <hi>Edgars, Arthyre, Riehards, Henries
First</hi> and <hi>Fifth</hi> in frequenter <hi>Medals; Edward</hi> the <hi>First,
Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the rest of our Renowned Princes.</p>
            <p>It is yet apparent, by what we have produc'd; that as our
Kings have not been altogether Negligent of their Own, and
consequently, of the Nations Honor, by preserving the
<hi>Memories</hi> of Sundry Famous Actions; So there are Innumerable
others, both of our own Princes, and even of their Subjects;
whose Virtue, Courage, and noble Exploits (Emulous of the
most Heroick and Brave of Antient times) merit the most
lasting Records: So as when I again Consider how many
Great and Memorable things, Illustrious Persons, Renown'd
for Arms and Arts, worthy Consecration, these Nations have
produc'd; I go on to Inquire (but without much satisfaction
I confess) what <hi>Medals</hi> were Stamp'd from the Reign and
Revolutions of our <hi>Seventh</hi> and <hi>Eight Henries</hi> time, to almost
this Age of ours? Had such Actions and Events happen'd
among the Rest of the Polish'd World; we should not be
now to seek for the <hi>Heads</hi> of Sir <hi>Francis Drake, Cavendish,
Hawkins, Frobisher, Greenvil, Fenton, Willougby,</hi> and the rest of
the <hi>Argonauts;</hi> And surely they that first Circl'd this Globe of
Earth and Sea (in whose Entrails so much <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi>
and all other <hi>Metals</hi> are contained) might at least be thought
Worthy the Honor of a <hi>Copper Medal,</hi> which yet I no where
find.</p>
            <p>To these Gallant Mens further Atchivements and Merits we
number the defeat of that <hi>Invincible Armada</hi> in <hi>Eighty Eight;</hi>
in danger of being quite forgotten, as to any such durable
Monument among us, when ever those Incomparable <hi>Tapstries</hi>
that now Adorn the House of <hi>Peers</hi> (so lively Representing
to the Eye both the Persons, and Circumstances of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Renowned Action) shall be quite worn-out; or by
other fatal Accident, miscarry: I have therefore often wonder'd,
that so many Great Princes, and Noble <hi>Lords,</hi> to whom
that <hi>Ius Imaginum</hi> more especially belongs (divers of whose
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61438:84"/>
Ancestors are found in the Bordures of those Rich, and well
designed Pieces) should for about this Hundred years past;
neglect the having them so much as Accurately Copied-out,
and Publish'd by some skilful Graver: But much more,
that they have not yet been Painted in their full dimensions,
in the Galleries, and Romes of State of those Noble Persons
(Builders for Magnificence &amp;c.) instead of Idle <hi>Metamorphoses,</hi>
and other Fictions and fruitless stories, as have of late propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Walls of so many ample Apartments.</p>
            <p>Certainly, we might select as Choice, and Noble Subjects
perform'd by our own Nation (and in which none were so
much Concerned as the Progenitors of our Nobility) to
Decorate and Adorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pardon this Zeal and occasional Excursion.</p>
            <p>Of like Argument are those admirable Paintings of <hi>Holbein</hi>
in his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s <hi>Privy-Chamber</hi> at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> representing
the Persons of the Two famous <hi>Henries</hi> and their Wives;
together with those other Pieces (by the same hand) Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
that Expedition to <hi>Bullogn:</hi> The <hi>Iust,</hi> and Triumph at
the Congress with <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>First;</hi> The Juncture with

more August and Solemn, since the Triumphs of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> &amp;c.
with sundry more, whereof our <hi>Annals</hi> of former and latter

For who can Divine (as all things are in continual Flux in this

or when the Period of things, seemingly never so fixt and stable
may be? since we our selves have seen, daily read, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and Antient Empires, over-run by barbarous People,
who burnt and destroy'd all those goodly Monuments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of Learning and Ingenuous Arts, subject to such Deluges,
Invasions and Revolutions: I say, who can tell but <hi>Medals</hi> may
yet revive, survive and out-live the Generations and Ages to
come, as they have since done this of ours? For how many
obscure Passages of History, <hi>Geography</hi> and other parts of useful
Erudition have been, and still are illustrated and supplied from
<hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions</hi> alone! They have we see (and is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

and Rise of Illustrious Families, Brave and Heroical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Things as well Facinorous and Tragical, Events which
have escap'd the Teeth of Time, and surviv'd all its Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
they have given us the antient Names of many Cities, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of Countries, Rivers, Monuments, Temples, Solemn
Feasts, and a thousand other useful Notices, no where else to be
met with, or if nam'd, very corruptly, and so of divers <hi>Pontifs,</hi>
Governors and <hi>Proconsuls,</hi> &amp;c. not to be found in any Book: In

            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <head type="sub">OF INSCRIPTIONS.</head>
            <p>INSCRIPTIONS upon whatsoever <hi>Species,</hi> as they
pass'd for <hi>Money,</hi> and were only valu'd as such, were
doubtless, at first but very plain and simple things, bearing
only some Mark or Character denoting the Weight and Worth
of the Metal; but when ambitiously they began to set <hi>Heads</hi>
and <hi>Pictures,</hi> and to blaze their Actions on the <hi>Tables</hi> and
<hi>Reverses</hi> of them; it was then they became valuable, not only
for the intrinsic Worth of the <hi>Metal</hi> as <hi>Money,</hi> but for the Light
they afforded to the Learned; and that so much Superiour to
the other, that a small piece of Coin, or morsel of <hi>Copper</hi>
came to be estimated above its weight in <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver:</hi> This,
as we shew'd, being first begun by the <hi>Monetarii,</hi> and follow'd
by those Princes and Great Men who affected Glory; they often
present us with their Names, Families and Titles, even before
the <hi>Cesars</hi> durst so much as shew their Faces on a <hi>Medal;</hi> that
is, till the aspiring <hi>Iulius</hi> usurp'd the antient Government: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did the Flatterers of those who succeeded him so far
prevail, as that they used any <hi>Superscription</hi> about their <hi>Effigies,</hi>
save that of the bare <hi>Name</hi> (and that with Caution too) or
Quality of the Person for a considerable time.</p>
            <p>But here, before we pass any farther, there is an <hi>hypercriticism</hi>
started by the late <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Science,</hi> concerning the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Inscription</hi> and <hi>Legenda,</hi> as to Propriety and nice
Application; whether <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> (or rather
instead of <hi>Reverse</hi> where there is no Figure or Head at all) the
<hi>other</hi> to them both. The First (according to this Learned
Man) is properly where the Words or <hi>Epigraph</hi> are on the
<hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Reverse</hi> without any Figure or Emblem at all,
as in that <hi>Medal</hi> of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> (besides the <hi>Head side</hi>) COS. IIII
is all we can find on the <hi>Reverse;</hi> which nicely, and according
to our <hi>Critic,</hi> is a lawful <hi>Inscription:</hi> That only allow'd to be
the <hi>Legenda,</hi> where the Words are engraven about the <hi>Figure</hi>
and explain the Meaning. In this Sense every <hi>Medal</hi> then may
be said to have two <hi>Legends,</hi> one about the <hi>Head</hi> or Image,
and another about the <hi>Reverse.</hi> The First notifies the Person
by his proper or acquir'd Name, Office or Dignity; the Second
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61438:94"/>
proclaims his Virtues, Memorable Exploits and Glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
Such for Instance is another <hi>Medal</hi> of the same Prince,
with the same Title on the Head-side, <hi>Antoninus Augustus. Pius,
Pater Patriae. Trib. Pot.</hi> COS IIII: where we have his Name
and Quality: On the <hi>Reverse</hi> three Figures representing the
Emperor sitting, before whom stands a Woman holding an
Horn of Plenty, and a Tablet marked with four Points; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spreading her Lap in posture of Receiving; the <hi>Legenda,</hi>
LIBERALITAS QVARTA, intimating the Fourth Act of
Bounty confer'd by the <hi>Emperor</hi> on his Subjects, in distributing
certain Measures of Corn among them. By this it appears
that the Rule is not always constant, but that now and then,
both Office and Names are mingl'd and interchang'd, part on
the <hi>Front-side</hi> and part on the <hi>Reverse,</hi> with this Note, that the
Title of <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> is most usually on the <hi>Head-Table,</hi> or that
of <hi>Censor, Pontifex Maximus, Augur,</hi> &amp;c. on the Table of the
<hi>Reverse,</hi> together with the Symbols and Instruments of their
Dignity, as may be seen in a <hi>Reverse</hi> of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and other
Emperors. Nor are these Offices without their different Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Medals</hi> of Families, distinct from the <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi>
In <hi>Medals</hi> of the First occur the particular Charge and
Office only, whereas in the <hi>Imperial,</hi> mention is made of the
highest Office and Dignity, as Sacred and incommunicable to
any other, as we shall see anon. In the mean while the <hi>Legend</hi>
is then properly turn'd into an <hi>Inscription,</hi> when (as we said)
there fortunes to be a <hi>Reverse</hi> without any <hi>Head,</hi> as in that of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> struck in Memory of the Care he took in Re-edifying
certain Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> which had been subverted and ruined by
an Earthquake. Here we find that Emperor on his <hi>Curule</hi>
Chair, <hi>Civitatibus Asiae Restitutis;</hi> and upon the <hi>Reverse,</hi> a
simple <hi>Legend,</hi> without any Head, <hi>Tiberius Caesar Divi. Aug.
Filius. Augustus. Pont. Max. Tr. Pot.</hi> xxi.</p>
            <p>But these Examples indeed concern Imperial and Royal <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
only: Those of Cities or Provinces bear commonly the
Head of some <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Deity</hi> in particular Veneration among
them; the name of the Place, Magistrate, or both for the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend;</hi>
for the <hi>Reverse,</hi> some <hi>Emblem</hi> or <hi>Symbolum;</hi> and for the
rest, the worthiest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and most signal Action of the Person repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in it, whether by <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Device</hi> explained by the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,</hi>
and is therefore to be looked on as the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Type,</hi>
and as already we have shew'd in that of <hi>Trajans</hi> concerning the
<hi>Parthian</hi> King. <hi>Rex Parthis datus;</hi> or by the <hi>Emblem,</hi> as where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61438:94"/>
               <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Victories are symboliz'd by the <hi>Crocodile</hi>
with <hi>Aegypto Capta;</hi> the like by <hi>Trophies, Palms, Asia Subacta,</hi>
&amp;c. determin'd by the <hi>Legenda,</hi> celebrating their Singular Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Actions of the Person, and that in a short and concise
<hi>Mot,</hi> apposite to the Subject, proper and unaffected; yet Great,
Noble and as Comprehensive as may be, reserving the longer
ones for Publick Edifices, <hi>Columns,</hi> the Fronts of <hi>Temples, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arches,</hi> &amp;c. where they are in their proper places, but in
<hi>Medal</hi> would be impertinent, and instead of gracing, detract
from <hi>Roman</hi> Majesty. Thus we meet the Name of an <hi>Emperor</hi>
or <hi>Cypher</hi> only, and sometimes nothing more; other whiles that
of the Magistrate, as <hi>Q. Aemilius. M. Agrippa. Cos. designatus:</hi>

<hi>(in the Air)</hi> and <hi>Rochelle</hi> above all; in which Action, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
Mundi Elementa vicit.</hi> The Epigraph contains above Fifty
Lines of this Stuff, but to which it seems, somebody has made
an <hi>Antilogium</hi> with much more Truth. And now, tho' I do
not affirm this Vanity to be only <hi>French,</hi> since 'tis reported that
<hi>Francis</hi> the First, to whom <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth sent a Letter fill'd
with innumerable Royal and Imperial Titles (how many
Kingdoms and Mighty Territories he was Monarch of) began
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61438:95"/>

in all his Dominions) I know not whether were the more Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of the two.</p>
            <p>But however the Stile runs now a-days, it was then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
so they open'd the Meaning of the <hi>Type</hi> without
those horrid Sentences and Additions promiscuously used by
the <hi>Bas Empire,</hi> and for the most part among the very worst
of them <hi>(Commodus, Caracalla, Iulian,</hi> &amp;c.) with the most
flatttering <hi>Epithets, Publica Orbis &amp; Temporum felicitas,</hi> that
were the most unhappy and pernicious to the Ages they liv'd
in: Of this sort are those with <hi>Saeculum aureum,</hi> &amp;c. comparing
them to <hi>Bacchus, Hercules, Serapis, Alex. Magnus,</hi> &amp;c. but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least Title to those Vertues which render Princes truly

still the <hi>Praenomen</hi> as we noted) as being deriv'd from the
Place, Exploit, Vertue or what other Accident or Circumstance
happen'd: Thus TITVS. QVINTVS. PVBLIVS, &amp;c. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Binomen,</hi> as SCIPIO AFRICANVS, who was the
first that assum'd a <hi>Surname,</hi> affected and follow'd afterwards
by others, as that of GERMANICVS by <hi>Commodus;</hi> by <hi>Severus</hi>
PARTHICVS; and tho' rarely after this singly and alone, yet
in <hi>Medals</hi> seldom or never exceeded three: But above all was
the Name CAESAR AVGVSTVS taken up by all the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Emperors as a <hi>Dignity,</hi> and AVGVSTA by their Wives,
nor <hi>(more veterum)</hi> for any Noble Action or Vertue extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
but by whatever Art or Policy they obtain'd the Power,
and since of Custom retain'd to this day. As to the Name of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> one is sometimes to consider it as Successor to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
sometimes as <hi>Cognomen,</hi> and again, as denoting only the
Family; and so <hi>Titus Caesar</hi> differs from IMP. <hi>Caesar Vespasian
Aug.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After these came the Offices and Dignities frequently annex'd
to the Family, as III. VIRI: <hi>Monetarii.</hi> A. A. A. F. F. <hi>Aediles,
Quaestor</hi> distinguishing them from the <hi>Imperial,</hi> in which we only
meet the most Eminent and Considerable, PONT. MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS.
IMPERATOR. TRIBVNITIA POTESTAS. CEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOR.
PATER PATRIAE, which last was introduc'd with
the Orator <hi>Cicero,</hi> upon his detection of the <hi>Catiline</hi> Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
tho' given at first to <hi>Iupiter</hi> only as Chief of the <hi>Gods:</hi>
So COS. or COSS. <hi>Consul, Consules.</hi> Lastly, as to <hi>Families,</hi> we
may not forget, that they often put the <hi>Effigies</hi> of some <hi>Emperor,</hi>
as in that of <hi>Gentis Corneliae, Arriae</hi> and others, stamp'd by
their Friends in Honor of their Relations.</p>
            <p>They had also their <hi>Cognomina,</hi> not only as an Adjunct, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from some more conspicuous and superlative Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as was that of PIVS given to <hi>Antoninus;</hi> the Clemency,
Moderation and pacific Disposition of other Princes, honoring
them with those <hi>Epithets,</hi> as did that worthy saying of his,
<hi>Malle se unum Civem servare, quam mille hostes occidere,</hi> which was
indeed the brave <hi>Scipio</hi>'s before him, as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> tells us.</p>
            <p>And in this manner were distinguish'd the <hi>Imperial Medals</hi>
by their <hi>Legenda,</hi> from such as bare the Images of the Gods;
to whom yet (as we shew'd) even some of the Emperors would
be joyn'd: Others we have expressing their Devotion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions
to them as Patrons and Protectors: Hence that of
<hi>Gordian</hi> IOVI STATORI. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like among the <hi>Empresses</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Inscriptions</hi> of Fortresses, Provinces, Rivers, and the

Reigns exceeding that number, tho' in their <hi>Muchios Annios,</hi>
VOTA X. MVLTIS, and Acclamations, they flatter'd them
with abundance more, of all which, consult the Learned
Monsieur <hi>Cange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like sort the <hi>Consular</hi> (whilst that Wise and Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
flourish'd) are known not only by their <hi>Heads, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>Reverses,</hi> but by the mention of their respective
Charges and Employments in the <hi>Legend.</hi> TRIVMVIR. AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DILE.
QVAESTOR. PROCONSVL, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, whilst the
Republick flourish'd, and some short time afterwards, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
during the two first Emperors <hi>Iulius</hi> and his Successor; for
so long they retain'd indeed some sort of Credit, but soon it
became a Title of Courtesie, till they quite lost them both.
Great Light in the mean time would the Dates of the <hi>Consulates</hi>
afford both to <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Chronology;</hi> and it were desirable <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries</hi>
had oftner given us the <hi>Heads</hi> as well as the <hi>Reverses,</hi>
since it is on that side is frequently found the Marks of <hi>Consulate,</hi>
which reached down as far as to <hi>Iustinian:</hi> But this may be
much supplied and assisted out of our Countryman <hi>Thomas
Lydiat</hi>'s <hi>Series Summorum Magistratuum, &amp; Triumphorum Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi>
or by the <hi>Tribunitia potestas,</hi> which does not seldom
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61438:96"/>
make up the defect, by shewing the Year of the Emperors who
since <hi>Tiberius</hi> usually assum'd the <hi>Title.</hi> I say usually, because
not always, some for Years only, others refusing it, or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it on others, yet for the most part, taking it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so as one may reckon the <hi>Tribunitial</hi> Power to keep even
pace with the Years of the <hi>Emperor.</hi> Thus <hi>Vespasian</hi> gave it
to his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> with the addition of <hi>Augustus,</hi> two Years after
he was made <hi>Emperor,</hi> and so X or XI. TRIB. POT. tho' he
Reign'd but three Years after his Father. Other Examples
occur in <hi>M. Aurelius, Caracalla, Geta,</hi> &amp;c. mention'd by the
Learned both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Medals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have already shew'd how tenacious these Princes were
of whatever venerable Title created any distinction, as that of
<hi>High Priest, Censor, Tribunitial Power</hi> tho' usurp'd from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
as the other from the <hi>Consuls,</hi> reducing that once Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Character to a Cipher only; and yet with what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
they at first seem'd to take them up, especially that of
<hi>King (nomen invisum)</hi> and odious only but to Name, and
therefore wisely contenting themselves with that of <hi>Emperor,</hi>
as then signifying no more than General of the Forces, till the
Successors of <hi>Iulius,</hi> insensibly, and by little and little, assum'd
all those Dignities and Degrees without controul: <hi>Augustus</hi> yet
himself appear'd at first with <hi>Caesar Divi Filius</hi> only, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Imperator,</hi> and by Degrees, <hi>Triumvir Reip.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
being both the first and last who stiled himself <hi>Censor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuus,</hi>
and none before <hi>Aelianus</hi> or <hi>Aurelianus</hi> using that of
<hi>Dominus,</hi> thence descending to <hi>Basileus</hi> of the <hi>Greek Emperors,</hi>
who also afterwards omitted it, or very rarely bore any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Title, or so much as the Sculps of their own <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
to give place to that of JESUS CHRISTUS, or to some
peculiar <hi>Saint,</hi> first begun by <hi>Zemiscus</hi> already mention'd.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Medals</hi> of the later Emperors of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> we read,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which (like that of <hi>Seignior</hi> or <hi>Dominus</hi>) was
certainly an abatement and decadence from that of <hi>King,</hi> as
in a manner answering what the Name of <hi>Caesar</hi> did to that
of <hi>Augustus.</hi> For albeit the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave antiently the Title <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sileus</hi>
to the <hi>Caesars,</hi> yet they would no more indure the Name
of <hi>Rex,</hi> than that of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> (which was at first a Glorious
Title) to shew what malevolent Influence the abuse of Power
has upon the best of things: Notwithstanding some they yet
flatter'd with the most blasphemous Titles of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61438:97"/>
which tho' 'tis said <hi>Augustus</hi> did not like, yet
proceeded they to that height of Insolence and Pride, as
that some of the <hi>Greeks</hi> would be call'd <hi>Kings of Kings, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patores,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Saviours</hi> (as in some <hi>Medals</hi> with <hi>Apollo</hi> and

               </gap> 
               <hi>Gods;</hi> arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with <hi>Thunderbolts,</hi> and other Symbols of <hi>Deity</hi>
as already we have shew'd. With the same Adulation to the
<hi>Romans</hi> (when under their Dominion) we find <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
with the Monster <hi>Nero,</hi> and tho' more frequently <hi>Divus</hi> only,
yet seldom read we <hi>Deus</hi> in the <hi>Latin,</hi> tho' they often made
too bold with his <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> as <hi>Magnus, Maximus, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victus,
Iustus, Felix, Beatissimus,</hi> &amp;c. In summe, nothing was
more false than the slavish and flattering <hi>Eulogies</hi> attributed to
some of the very worst and most abandon'd <hi>Emperors</hi> and
<hi>Empresses,</hi> auguring long and happy Reigns and many Years
to them, whom they wish'd dead a thousand times, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
them <hi>Chast, Pious, Iust,</hi> &amp;c. who of all others were
the most vicious and impiously wicked, and this towards some
of the later Emperors especially, whilst with more modesty the
very <hi>Pagans</hi> were content with that of <hi>Pius,</hi> first us'd by that
most excellent Prince <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and their Empresses, with <hi>Pia,
Felix, Augusta,</hi> tho' by some indeed who were not of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
nor was yet that well deserved Surname given and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
upon him by the <hi>Senate,</hi> granted to his Successor on the
same account, but as a peculiar Honor to him alone, as was
<hi>Optimus</hi> to <hi>Trajan:</hi> The Name of <hi>Pius Felix</hi> usurp'd by <hi>Commodus</hi>
and those who follow'd, being a mere Title only, and as such
affected by their Wives, without the least Merit or Right to it.</p>
            <p>Other exorbitant Titles were <hi>Iulia Genetrix Orbis, Mater Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus;</hi>
and as <hi>Pater,</hi> so would they be also <hi>Matres Patriae</hi> too.
In the lower Empire V. N. M. R <hi>Venerabilis noster Mater,</hi> we
find on a <hi>Medal</hi> of an <hi>Apotheosis</hi> or Consecration, Coin'd by
those of <hi>Naples</hi> in Honor of <hi>Constantine,</hi> with the <hi>Effigies</hi> of his
Mother <hi>Helena:</hi> Nor indeed were Mothers honor'd in <hi>Medals</hi>
only, but Kindred, Friends and Alliances, as in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
<hi>Ariobarzanes, Philopator, Philadelphus,</hi> &amp;c. The Names of <hi>Pater,
Mater, Filius, Filia, Soror, Cognatus,</hi> &amp;c. of no small light to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>And here we may observe how the same Person now and
then quitted their adopted Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for some other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation:
Instance of this we have in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s taking that of
<hi>Nerva</hi> (who indeed first advanced him) and not long after
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61438:97"/>
leaving that off again; the like did <hi>Hadrian.</hi> Others ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affected Titles of such as had them both. Thus the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name of <hi>Antoninus</hi> was usup'd by no fewer than six Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
even down to <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and the Monster <hi>Elagabalus;</hi>
that of <hi>Trajan</hi> assum'd by <hi>Decius,</hi> &amp;c. which not seldom
creates no small Difficulty among our <hi>Latin Medalists,</hi> as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
neither Date or <hi>Epoch</hi> to direct them, which one does
commonly among the <hi>Greek,</hi> religiously exact in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and it is indeed of great Importance, since but for that,
all History would be imperfect, and hardly would Authors
have distinguish'd the <hi>Antiochus's, Ptolomees,</hi> and other Princes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
found in them, without this Assistance to give Instance
in no other.</p>
            <p>Of this, and much more which I am yet to say (as in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the Names of <hi>Magistrates</hi> both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin
Medals)</hi> Authors afford plentiful Accounts. One thing as to
<hi>Families</hi> (which I had almost forgotten) is to be observ'd, that
among the latter <hi>Greeks, Comnenus</hi> and the following Emperors
took the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from that splendid
Apartment or Chamber in the Royal Palace, which was pav'd
and curiously inlay'd with that precious Marble, and in which
it seems the <hi>Empresses</hi> were brought to Bed; the <hi>Heir</hi> when
born being also wrap'd in purple Mantles.</p>
            <p>We have already noted, that the Title of <hi>Princeps Iuventutis,</hi>
belonged to the young <hi>Heir Apparent,</hi> or so design'd, from the
time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> tho' not found in the more antient <hi>Medals:
Caesar</hi> with <hi>Augustus</hi> was afterwards taken up by the Emperors
themselves; but neither <hi>Caesar</hi> given as a Title, but a Name
only, 'til <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Adoption of <hi>Aelius Verus.</hi> The young <hi>Philip
Augustus</hi> was stiled <hi>Nobilis Caesar,</hi> a Title given afterwards to
those who had part of the Government committed to them,
such as were those four <hi>Caesars</hi> which <hi>Dioclesian</hi> created; much
of which may be illustrated by that Noble <hi>Medal</hi> in which we
find <hi>Adventus Severi &amp; Filiorum,</hi> after the Conclusion of the
<hi>Parthian</hi> War, in which their several Faces may easily be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
tho' in so small a Volume, as they sit Galloping
in a Posture of Commanding, and tho' unarm'd; <hi>Severus</hi> in
the middle, <hi>Caracalla</hi> on his right side <hi>Laureated</hi> as principal in
the Expedition, and acknowledge'd Partner in the Empire; <hi>Geta</hi>
on the left hand, with the Name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> bare-headed.</p>
            <p>Now as they were Concise and Frugal of the <hi>Legend</hi> on <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses,</hi>
in like manner were they no less sparing in the <hi>Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61438:98"/>
about <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies,</hi> so as in some (and those no very
modern ones neither) a <hi>Monogram</hi> oftentimes serv'd the turn,
as we find in those of <hi>Martianus, Placidia, Valentinian</hi> and the
<hi>Labrum</hi> of the Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> with divers of the lower Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
especially from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (who 'tis said, could
not so much as write his own Name) and thence down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
tho' 'tis not always to be taken for a single Letter only,
but many time for the <hi>Cipher</hi> or Character of the Prince (as
now our <hi>Merchants</hi> use to mark their Goods and <hi>Embalments</hi>)
as may be seen in some of <hi>Trajan;</hi> but of this,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 11. c. 10.</note>

            <p>In this manner we meet the <hi>Greek</hi> Ω in the <hi>Coins</hi> of the

compendiously signifie the Name of the <hi>Monetaries,</hi> as <hi>Chrestus,
Chrysogonus, Chremes, Chrysippus</hi> or the like, and yet be
afterwards made use of for the Venerable Character of our
<hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> who first took away the Ignominy of the
<hi>Cross;</hi> there being likewise several other things profan'd by the
<hi>Pagans,</hi> which were afterwards introduc'd among the <hi>Christian</hi>
Rites and Usages. Thus the <hi>Cross</hi> it self <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> (decussated at
Right Angles) forming a <hi>Stigma</hi> of Infamie (abrogated since
by the same <hi>Constantine</hi>) and commonly branded on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
or Collars of fugitive <hi>Slaves,</hi> with the Names of their
Patrons and Masters to whom they belong'd (as do now our

<hi>Hawks</hi> and Dog-Collars) is now exalted to the sublimest part
of the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown.</p>

Families, and in the Lower Empire xxx. xxxx<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xxxxv. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
none hitherto clearly explained. Lastly, Whilst we speak of
<hi>Numbers,</hi> the Gift of <hi>Largesses</hi> and <hi>Congiaries</hi> in Provisions of
Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appearing in the <hi>Reverses</hi> of those bountiful Princes,
by Figures specifying how often the People had been thus sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
<hi>Congiarium</hi> and <hi>Liberalitas Aug.</hi> II. III. IIII. V, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
is the true Reading: In like sort where one meets COL. AN.
X. <abbr>XII.</abbr> 
               <abbr>XIII,</abbr> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> denoting how many Years that <hi>Colonie</hi> had
been supplied under the Emperor named.</p>
            <p>In some <hi>Greek Medals,</hi> Letters are now and then plac'd <hi>sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorsum,</hi>
like the <hi>Phoenician;</hi> and in other <hi>Roman</hi> we sometimes
find the <hi>Legend</hi> varied as to place: For Example, that of <hi>Optimo
Principi</hi> in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s is not constantly in the same <hi>Table:</hi> That
of <hi>Felix Pius</hi> in <hi>Commodus</hi>'s (which his Successor took up) is
ever on the <hi>Head</hi> side: And such as betoken Victory over
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61438:99"/>
Provinces, as <hi>Britannicus, Dacicus, Germanicus,</hi> &amp;c. we meet
sometimes on the <hi>Head,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Reverse;</hi> but such
as denote Grandeur and Power, always on the <hi>Reverse,</hi> as
<hi>Genio Populi Rom. Restitutori Orbis Terrarum,</hi> &amp;c. found in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Medals,</hi> unless it happen to be where the other Sex is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
as <hi>Genetris Orbis</hi> in that of the young Lady <hi>Faustina,
Mater Patriae,</hi> &amp;c. of which we have already spoken. The
same alteration of <hi>Locality,</hi> may be also taken notice of in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
of <hi>Consecration,</hi> where we read <hi>Divus, Diva; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriae
aeternae,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>We have likewise shew'd how the Title of <hi>Imperator</hi> was
given, or wisely taken up by <hi>Caesar</hi> and his Successors as a
<hi>Surname,</hi> to decline the odious Name of <hi>King</hi> (tho' we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
find <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) since it did the business as effectually as
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which is <hi>tant a mount Augustus,</hi> and Soveraign
Power; albeit, given now and then by way of Acclamation,
or otherwise, as <hi>Cognomen</hi> to a great Captain after some signal
Victory, without other <hi>Epithete</hi> or Addition. The distinction
to be heeded on this account is, by observing the Locality, and
placing such Titles as we find before and after the Name of
Emperor, and of the Figure or Number which often shews
how the same Person merited both the Titles: Thus IMP. II.
sometimes repeated in the same <hi>Inscription,</hi> speaks his having
been more than once saluted <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is further to be heeded, that the Position of the <hi>Legenda</hi>
distinct from the <hi>Superscription,</hi> is generally but since the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Nerva</hi> within the Grand Circle; beginning to read from
the left Hand to the right, which was usually the contrary in
those <hi>Medals</hi> of the first <hi>Caesars;</hi> some on the <hi>Exerge</hi> only,
others in parallel Lines one above the other beneath the Type,
and some few <hi>Salterwise;</hi> others in <hi>Pale,</hi> or at the side of the
Figure in the middle, and <hi>Fesse-point,</hi> (to speak in <hi>Heraldry</hi>
Language) cut as it were by the Head or Figure; some in
<hi>Bordure.</hi> In short, 'tis likely as pleas'd the Artist without any
invariable Rule; nay, some <hi>Medals</hi> were without so much as
any <hi>Legend</hi> at all, shewing an <hi>Head</hi> only, and consequently a
Body without a Soul; for such are not only met with among
the <hi>Consular,</hi> but <hi>Imperials,</hi> as before is noted. There are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses</hi>
likewise that are but half animated; several <hi>Augustus</hi>'s
bearing no <hi>Inscription,</hi> and a world there be of stark <hi>Mutes,</hi>
or speaking only the <hi>Mint-masters</hi> Name, or the simple S. C. of
which sort there are three or four very rare <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Pompeius,</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61438:99"/>
with very curious <hi>Reverses;</hi> two of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s, and others of
<hi>Galba,</hi> &amp;c. all of them charg'd with several remarkable Figures
and Historical Emblems: But the fatall'st Error is, when either
Letters or Numbers are mistaken, which causes great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
especially in <hi>Epoches,</hi> and only to be rectified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them with other <hi>Medals</hi> of the same Emperor: Those
in the <hi>Orthographie</hi> are not so dangerous and material, tho' H
be frequently omitted, as in <hi>Ercules, Abe</hi> for <hi>Aue, Bixit</hi> for
<hi>Vixit, Benus</hi> for <hi>Venus;</hi> for <hi>Valens, Balens; Iubentus</hi> for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus,
Renobatio</hi> for <hi>Renovatio, Fabe</hi> for <hi>Fave,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>The Capital REST, <hi>Restituit</hi> betokens some Renovation,
or the Memory of some Famous Predecessor, <hi>v. g. Claudius</hi>'s
restoring certain worn out <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Augustus: Nero, Titus,</hi> &amp;c.
those of almost all their Royal Ancestors; <hi>Gallienus</hi> (without
any <hi>Inscription</hi>) new Coining the <hi>Consecration Medals</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Emperors.</p>
            <p>Now as above it was observed of the <hi>Latin,</hi> so have we
likewise the Names of some <hi>Archon</hi> or Magistrate in <hi>Greek Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
(of whom<note n="*" place="margin">Marm. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundeliani terminus.</note> 
               <hi>Diognetus</hi> was the last among the <hi>Athenians</hi>)
as of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings <hi>Romulus, Quirinus, Ancus, Tullius:</hi> Those
of <hi>Mauritania, Numidia; Macedon; Philip Iuba, Iugurtha,</hi> and the
rest. But of</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nummi Iconici,</hi> such as represent <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> only,
without any History, and such as have neither <hi>Head</hi> nor
<hi>Name</hi> to shew (for such there are) the Collection is little
worth.</p>
            <p>In the Inscriptions of <hi>Christian</hi> Emperors of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
one is not seldom puzzled and perplex'd what to make of
them, where one meets <hi>Initials</hi> only, as in that <hi>Medal</hi> of
<hi>Constantinus Copronymus</hi> C. LEON. PAMVL. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>du Cange</hi> renders it; and in a <hi>Latin</hi> one of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi>
S. P. Q. R. A. N. F. F. <hi>Optimo Principi Pio;</hi> that is, <hi>Senatus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulusque
Romanus Annum Nonum Faustum, Felicem.</hi> Here also
note, that F standing with P, if in <hi>Elogie</hi> of some <hi>Legion,</hi> it
should be read <hi>Fidelis,</hi> as LEG. II. PART. VII. <hi>Pia</hi> VII.
<hi>Fidelis,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly,</p>
            <p>One thing more is to be observed in Reading of <hi>Greek Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi>
(not so in the <hi>Latin</hi>) that the Proper Names does for the
most part run in the <hi>Genitive,</hi> as if <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Effigies</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> of <hi>Alexander.</hi>

            <p>With abundance more, assistant to the Reading of such
and other <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> as either occur in <hi>Medals</hi> or antient
<hi>Marbles;</hi> for which may farther be consulted <hi>Goltzius, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,
Ursatus's</hi> Commentary <hi>de Notis Romanorum;</hi> or the
Abbreviation of him subjoin'd to the end of Mr. <hi>Prideaux's</hi>
Edition of the <hi>Marmora Oxon-Arundel.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But besides these, different are Languages and Inscriptions,
according to the several Countries and Nations where Coins
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61438:102"/>
and <hi>Medals</hi> receiv'd their Stamps and Impressions; especially
those of modern Times, whether <hi>Medals</hi> or Money, of which
there are some Persons as Curious in Collecting, as of the most
Antient; tho' they be by no means of equal Consequence to
the Learned upon that Account</p>
            <p>By the truly antient <hi>Medals</hi> (in what Countrey or Place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
struck) we find the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
as the most Dominant and Universal; and as first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by the <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> followed: and even after their
having subdued that Nation, yet they seemed to submit in this,
and do Honor to the <hi>Greek</hi> Language in their <hi>Medals,</hi> tho'
stamp'd in <hi>Italy</hi> it self, and other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> out of <hi>Greece.</hi>
It is true, we meet also with some Imperial <hi>Medals</hi> Coined
among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> too, wearing <hi>Latin Inscriptions,</hi>
but not frequently; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> in flattery to the Emperors,
and indeed before they were subdu'd, would often imitate the
<hi>Latin Inscriptions,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Concordia, Bona Fortuna, Providentia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Medals</hi>
are also found to speak the farthest Oriental Languages,
<hi>Hebrew, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. but such as are liable to great Exceptions,
as to their genuine Antiquity; tho' there may probably be
many, which might perhaps have course among those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Samaritan</hi> Letter, as upon the <hi>Shekel</hi>
and <hi>Half Shekel,</hi> and other Pieces of various Type, as already
we have shew'd. Those in <hi>Arabic</hi> are not so rare, some of
them bearing the Head of <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Sicily, Saladin,</hi> and
other Famous <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes wretchedly Insculp'd. But
the <hi>Punic</hi> and <hi>Carthaginian</hi> (altho' Minted in <hi>Spain,</hi> and among
the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> whose Inscription Characters
are much alike, and pity it is they are not legible) are not to
be rejected; some of them being of good Antiquity, Coin'd
by the <hi>Libyan</hi> Kings since <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> as that of <hi>Iuba,</hi> with a
<hi>Reverse</hi> in Characters, not yet revealed; and others in the
<hi>Punic Letter, as what we mention'd of Queen Dido,</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, Antiquaries are not yet agreed. We have also
spoken of the <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Gothic,</hi> whereof some do yet retain
obscure Footsteps of the <hi>Roman</hi> Majesty; as do those of
<hi>Theodosius, Athalaricus,</hi> and a few of the <hi>Vandal</hi> Kings reigning
in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Afric,</hi> of which see <hi>Ant. Augustinus.</hi> For the rest,
they are so frightful both in Figure and Letter, as betray an
extream Stupidity: Very odd Inventions and extravagant
Fancies we likewise sometimes meet with in divers of our
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61438:102"/>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> both <hi>Coins</hi> and <hi>Marbles;</hi> of the latter of which see
Copious <hi>Types</hi> in the late Edition of <hi>Cambden's Britannia</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> where you have the <hi>Runic</hi> and other
<hi>Alphabets</hi> out of <hi>Bouterovius,</hi> and an Account of <hi>Afred's</hi>
changing the Old <hi>Saxon</hi> Letter near the <hi>Roman</hi> as then in use.
Lastly, Those of the <hi>Turks</hi> struck since <hi>Mahomet,</hi> are by some
thought worth notice, as of use for the History of the <hi>Caliphs</hi>
and <hi>Saracen</hi> Emperors.</p>
            <p>And now tho' both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> did certainly
compose the most Noble, as well as the most Antient <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,</hi>
whether in respect to the Purity of the Language,
or to the Proportion and Elegancy of the Letter: Yet as there
is nothing under Heaven remaining long without change and
alteration, so these had their Turns, <hi>Acme</hi> and Decadence at
last also to a strange degeneracy. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (who as we
said, struck <hi>Medals</hi> before <hi>Rome</hi> had so much as a Name in
the World) us'd the large and ample <hi>Capital,</hi> without any
considerable Mutation: Indeed the Letter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was unwrinkl'd
into the smoother C after <hi>Domitian;</hi> but the Beauty of the
Character lasted down to <hi>Gallienus;</hi> albeit, afterwds not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so full and round. In some <hi>Medals</hi> we meet with
Mixtures of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as E for H. O for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Z for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<hi>è contra,</hi> and sometimes even in the <hi>Colonies</hi> of the High Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
we read SRF. for CP <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (of which the Illustrious
<hi>Spanheim)</hi> and therefore one is not always peremptorily to
condemn such Encounters.</p>
            <p>Since the Reign of <hi>Constantine,</hi> for the space of Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, they made use of the <hi>Latin</hi> only, tho' the <hi>Medal</hi>
were stamp'd in the City, bearing his Name; yet now and

and Barbarity in Shape and Character, but the very Words
and Language were corrupted: Not to insist on Orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Errors, because they are not always an infallible Sign
of a <hi>modern</hi> or uncultivated Age; since we frequently meet
with V for B. O for U. F for PH. as in <hi>Danuvius, Volcanus, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umfus,</hi>
&amp;c. all of antient use. <hi>Peireskius</hi> sent the <hi>Ectype</hi> of a <hi>Medal</hi>
to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> in which <hi>Britannia</hi> was with both a double

            <p>To <hi>Medal-Inscriptions</hi> of the several <hi>European,</hi> &amp;c. Nations both
of the present and latter <hi>Centuries,</hi> their most considerable Actions

(which usually have the <hi>Legend</hi> and <hi>Epigraph</hi> of the Language
and Letter where they are Coin'd) we have already spoken.
And of such of greater Antiquity, as have their Letters so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
defac'd, exeded and worn out by Tract of Time, or the
Nature of the Metal, or other Accidents; that they either are not
at all Legible, or with much Difficulty to be recover'd; there's
nothing more to be said, but to deplore the common Loss,
because there are many such; tho' there have been Attempts to
restore them by Cunning Artists, with the <hi>Puntion,</hi> the use of
<hi>Aquafortis</hi> and such like Corrosives; by the one to raise the
Letter a new, and by the other, to take off the roughness of
the Stroak, so as a Skilful <hi>Medalist</hi> shall not suddenly discover
it: But when all is done, they will by no means bear a thorough
Inspection, especially what they do by the <hi>Puntion.</hi> In the mean
time, it seems as if some <hi>Inscriptions</hi> (tho' I remember not to have
read of above one) have been very neatly Inlay'd, after the
manner of <hi>Dama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>king</hi> in <hi>Relievo,</hi> as they heretofore raised
Flowers and other Fancies upon our <hi>Spurs, Knives</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi>-Handles.
For such a Piece, bearing the <hi>Effigies</hi> of young
<hi>Augustus</hi> (when going under the Name <hi>Thurinus) Suetonius</hi>
seems to say he himself presented the Emperor, who received
it as a very precious Jewel; you may be sure he means to
the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> or <hi>Adrian,</hi> whose Secretary that Noble Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
was.</p>
            <p>And now how infinitely more easy had been the Reading
of those<note n="*" place="margin">It were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there were extant a yet better Alphabet of the various Characters and shapes of Letters met withal in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Manuscripts, Coins and <hi>Saxon</hi> Monuments, with an Explication of the Abbreviations.

               <hi>Inscriptions</hi> which succeeded the Antient ones, had

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61438:103"/>
the Barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> first deform'd both in their Coins, and
indeed wheresoever they left their Cruel Marks. Thus we
often meet the <hi>Micron</hi> or little o among the tallest <hi>Capitals,</hi>
and so of other Letters both on <hi>Metal</hi> and <hi>Stone;</hi> and as to
their Money (for one is to expect no <hi>Medal</hi> of Account from
them) we sometimes find an <hi>Head</hi> with a Fillet or Coronet,
without any Name at all, unless it be sometimes of the <hi>Mint:</hi>
The same shew also several of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Coins, together with
the Names of the Place, when struck, and Master of the Work,
whereof in the Chapter following the next. In the mean

            <head type="sub">Instructions how to Collect and Procure such Medals
as are Antique and Rare, and to Distinguish
the True from the False, for the Prevention
of Frauds and Impostures.</head>
            <p>AND thus we are almost arriv'd to the conclusive Part
of this Discourse, to which after one Chapter more
we shall put a Period, recommending here some brief and
necessary Directions how to procure such <hi>Medals</hi> as are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Charge and Pains of Collecting; what to <hi>Choose,

with some few other <hi>Observations</hi> not Impertinent to the
Subject</p>
            <p>For the First of these: The means of Procuring the most
Authentick and likeliest to be truly Antient, is frequently
from <hi>Countrey People,</hi> who Labour with Plow and Spade, and
such as are Employ'd in Digging about old Banks, Mounds,
High-ways, Foundations and Ruins, where happly Stations,
<hi>Castrametations</hi> have formerly been; where <hi>Legions</hi> have Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,

Erected, and the like. For as we noted, the <hi>Roman</hi> Wealth
was dispers'd thro' all their Conquests, and that not in drib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
and inconsiderable Sums as casually drop'd and lost, but
in vast Quantities: Full Jarrs, Urns and Vessels of large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
being often sound deeply buried in the Earth, or
left in places appearing more like deserted Caves, Vaults and
Magazins, which probably were heretofore, parts of Stately
Edifices, and where sometimes they might have Publick
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A</hi> Mint <hi>reported to be lately found at</hi> Valagnes
<hi>near a large</hi> Theatre, <hi>not far from the the Sea in</hi> Bas-Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, <hi>where was taken up a great Treasure of antient</hi> Medals, <hi>both</hi> Consular <hi>and</hi> Imperial, <hi>and abundance more, said to have been found in</hi> Denmark <hi>by Labourers this present Year.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mints,</hi> and Coin'd Money; abundance of their <hi>Flasks</hi> and
Casting-Moulds, made of the finest Clay, being not seldom
turn'd up among the Rubbish of such Places. There is hardly
City, Town or Castle, Port, Old <hi>Roman</hi> Fosse, Causeway
or Remarkable Eminency near them, whether now or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
standing and appearing in any County of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61438:104"/>
where <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Coins, Roman, Saxon, Runic, Norman,</hi> &amp;c.
have not been found, and are daily yet discover'd: Nay, I have
been told that in some such likely Places, they will give more
by the Acre for Land in purchase, in hope of some lucky
Chance.</p>
            <p>After this it will not be hard to satisfy some that I have
known to wonder, how such mighty quantities of Treasure
should be found thus buried here in <hi>Britain:</hi> It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
that the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon the <hi>Romans</hi> (nine
Years after the Sack of that dominant City) was so sudden,
with such a Flood, and so unexpected, that running away
into <hi>France</hi> with all the hast and speed imaginable, they
had no leisure to transport and carry away their Riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, and that which they could not carry, they
hid under Ground in several places, as carefully as the
time would permit, not without hope that they might
possibly one Day return again, as our <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle informs
us:<note place="margin">CHRON. <hi>Sax. Anno</hi> CCCC VIII,</note> 
               <hi>Hic Romani Thesauros omnes qui erant in Britannia (inventi)
coacervaverunt, quorum aliquot in terra occultarunt, nè quis homo
inde reperire possit, aliquot autem secum in Galliam abduxerunt,</hi> &amp;c.
I repeat this therefore, that Countrey People and Labourers
should be encouraged to bring to Gentlemen what ever of this
kind they commonly offer the next Market-day to the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith</hi>
of the Neighbouring Town, or to some <hi>Brasier,</hi> who
for a trifling piece of White current Money, gets now and
then a rich Prize under a rusty out-side. These poor People
seldom come to Curious and Learned Persons here, as they do
commonly in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Foreign Countries, more Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and abounding in <hi>Anticaglia</hi> of this Nature: <hi>Goldsmiths,</hi> and
other Shops, who expose Curiosities, and such as deal in <hi>Pawns</hi>
and <hi>Brokage; Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Founders</hi> are often to be visited.
Moreover, by Acquaintance and the Favour of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and
Assistance of such <hi>Factors</hi> and Travellers as reside at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
Smyrna, Aleppo, Alexandria, Cairo</hi> and other parts of the
<hi>Levant:</hi> But above all, Inquiry is to be made, where any
Cabinets or Collections of <hi>Medals</hi> are to be disposed of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Auction</hi> or privatly. Since by this means (as he who
would furnish his <hi>Library</hi> with excellent Books) more may
happly be procur'd at once, and at tolerable Price, than one
shall be able to find, and get together in many Years, by
Collecting them one by one. And there is likewise this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
that Traffic for <hi>Medals</hi> between Gentlemen and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61438:105"/>
the Curious, either by Money or Exchange, is ever esteem'd
an honorable Commerce. Now as among the most Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
the Choice and Rarity of a <hi>Medal</hi> consists in its Beauty,
(for it cannot, as one observes, be affirm'd of them; what the
<hi>Italians</hi> say of Military Ensigns, <hi>Quanto lacera più, tanto più
bella,</hi> the more torn and ragged, the more honorable;) so does
it in Excellency of the Design and Workmanship of the Person,
with its Historical <hi>Reverse, Legend</hi> and <hi>Inscription,</hi> whether
about the <hi>Figure,</hi> or upon the <hi>Exerge;</hi> some of which there
are yet so fresh and well preserv'd, as after so many Ages to
look as if but newly Minted, and who would not be glad to
see the <hi>Faces</hi> of those Famous <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Macedon, Syria, Aegypt,
Sicily, Pontus, Bithynia, Mauritania,</hi> &amp;c. of what use and utility,
see Monsieur <hi>Vaillant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One is also to consider the Composition well (or as <hi>Artists</hi>
and <hi>Painters</hi> call it, the <hi>Groupe</hi>) that it be with Judgment;
for the Antients do seldom crowd many <hi>Figures</hi> together, and
in Clusters, but as they might stand loose and easy by one
another, as one sees in <hi>Allocutions;</hi> where in one of <hi>Faustina's,</hi>
tho' indeed we meet no fewer than twelve Persons, yet they
are plac'd without the least Confusion. Such another is that

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we so often meet withal in <hi>Medals,</hi> frequently taken
for those Assemblies usually resorting to the Temple of some
famous and peculiar <hi>Deity:</hi> Such, for Instance, as was that

of their Emperors with, where Conventions, Feasts, Publick

and the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was granted as Guardians
of those <hi>Shrines</hi> and Holy Places (as now our <hi>Ladies</hi> at

               </note> Pomp and Magnificence
imaginable, and with the most exquisite Sculpture: But this
by the way only.</p>
            <p>With this of the <hi>Groupe,</hi> it is also requisite that a just <hi>Decorum
(le Costume,</hi> as <hi>Italians</hi> call it) be duely observed, as, that the
Persons represented be properly Arm'd and Vested after the
Guise and manner of the Age: For Example, setting forth an
<hi>Adlocution,</hi> or any such signal and solemn Occasion, that the
<hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>Tribune</hi> have on the <hi>Paludamentum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> that <hi>Amazons</hi>
be Arm'd with their <hi>Pelta</hi> and <hi>Bipennis,</hi> and as these are clad,
so that <hi>Genii</hi> be always represented naked and unclothed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has now been spoken above concerning the
Number of Figures in <hi>Medal,</hi> our best <hi>Painters</hi> (and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
the Famous <hi>Annibal Carraci</hi>) would seldom or never
represent above Twelve Persons in a Table or Picture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
such an History as the Rape of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> or some
Battel, rarely I think, met withal in <hi>Medal. Painters</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should be skill'd in these Antiquities, as well for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateness
of the Design and Draught, as that both these Arts
were almost <hi>Coevous</hi> in Perfection and Decadence; the one,
long before the <hi>Caesars,</hi> at its height in <hi>Greece;</hi> the other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
totally extinguish'd, till within little more than Two
Hundred Years, after it had so barbarously been abus'd and
neglected for above a Thousand.</p>
            <p>Moreover, a perfect <hi>Medal</hi> has its <hi>Profile</hi> and out-stroaks
sharp <hi>(Nummus asper)</hi> and by no means rugged; the <hi>Figures</hi>
clean and well polish'd; the <hi>Contours</hi> neatly trimm'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
round and carefully preserv'd; that the Extancy and
<hi>Relievos</hi> correspond with the Ingraving, and have not suffer'd
in <hi>Percussion;</hi> in all which, there is a certain Spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Excellency to be discern'd in Antient <hi>Medals</hi> almost
inimitable.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as some are with greater Difficulty to be
met withal than others, 'tis to be observ'd, that those in <hi>Gold</hi>
are most Estimable, not only for the Matter and intrinsic
Value of the Species (which if truly Antique, is ever the
more refin'd) but that almost universally, they are the best
and rarest <hi>Medals,</hi> especially if the larger Size; those of <hi>Silver</hi>
are more frequent, yet neither in abundance; for the <hi>Greeks</hi>
being under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, were very sparing of the more

precious Metals, whereas there are plenty of <hi>Copper</hi> in the
smaller Volume, and of the ordinary Form and Size innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
especially of the latter Empire down to <hi>Gratian,</hi> of
which, store are daily found meanly sculp'd, not so thick
and substantial, well finish'd and exactly round, as in the
antient <hi>Medal,</hi> by any comparison.</p>
            <p>Of this sort, namely of the smaller Size, most of all <hi>Rare</hi>
and Estimable (that we may give a Tast of some few) are
the <hi>Greek,</hi> of which those are to be reckon'd, as bear the <hi>Heads</hi> of
their own Emperors with <hi>Greek</hi> Inscriptions, equal, if not in

that Excellent Prince, without the least Title to his Vertues.

In a word, such abundance as <hi>Lazius</hi> affirms himself to have
seen, and counted no fewer than 700000 in his time; but this
is without doubt a <hi>Cifer</hi> at least too much.</p>
            <p>And now after all this Travel and Diligence, Cost and
Caution in this (as in most things else) one is perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in danger of being deceiv'd, and imposed on by Cheats,

Piece of Forgery, related by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> (now Lord
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>) in his Travels thro' <hi>Germany;</hi> that at the
Siege of <hi>Bonne,</hi> clearing the Ground to plant a Battery, was
found in a Vault, a Cart full of <hi>Medals</hi> (or <hi>Medalions</hi> rather)
of <hi>Gold,</hi> to the Value of One Hundred Thousand Crowns, so
big and ponderous, as one of them weigh'd Eight Hundred
<hi>Dolars</hi> of the finest <hi>Ducat-Gold,</hi> bearing Impression of <hi>Roman
Medals,</hi> but done so Coursly, as every body pronounc'd them
Counterfeits; those which seem'd Truest, were <hi>Greek Medals.</hi>
It is the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Reflection (as well it might) what should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Man to make a Forgery upon such precious <hi>Metal,</hi> in so
vast a quantity, and then to bury them under Ground? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
in an Age in which <hi>Gold</hi> was near Ten-times the present
Value; it being judged to have been done Four or Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years since.</p>

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61438:110"/>We have mention'd Enquiry after Countrey-People, Day-Labourers,
and such as dig about Old Foundations, that by

many supposed very Antient Coins of the <hi>Iews</hi> which have
been melted down by the <hi>Christians.</hi> But to return to <hi>Roman</hi>
again, Counterfeit are <hi>Gordianus</hi> of <hi>Africa, Pescennius</hi> or <hi>Maximus</hi>
of <hi>Gold:</hi> There's no <hi>Plotinus, Matidia, Didia Clara</hi> of the <hi>middle
Copper;</hi> no more than <hi>Otho's</hi> with certain <hi>Reverses</hi> of that Size
and Metal, and suspicious are those even of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> of
this Emperor, where they find not the Hair of his Head so
compt and elegant: For tho' indeed one meets with one such
Coin'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> they may yet be Authentic and True, unless
one happens on a <hi>Padoan,</hi> who has so exactly imitated them
on the larger <hi>Copper.</hi> It is therefore worth the while taking
notice of both <hi>Metal</hi> and <hi>Size</hi> in <hi>Medals</hi> of so great Value and
Price as are those of this Emperor.</p>
            <p>All Antient <hi>Medals</hi> of Gold, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> that are not of
the very best <hi>Alloy,</hi> are to be counted Impostors, excepting some
since <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and a few Old <hi>Gothic</hi> and <hi>Punic:</hi> To
these add such as borrow the <hi>Head</hi> of an Emperor with some
fantastick <hi>Reverse,</hi> or enigmatical Inscription, which has no
relation to the Person, or that appertain to some other, or seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Historize some New and Extravagant Thing, never
heard nor read of in any good Author before; such also as
present us tedious <hi>Inscriptions</hi> without <hi>Abbreviations,</hi> or that in
<hi>Profections</hi> specifie the Place whither the Emperor is marching,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But those with the Labours of <hi>Hercules</hi> are not all to be
condemn'd, many of them having been struck in the Reigns
of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and very often after that incomparable <hi>Statue</hi>
of <hi>Glycon,</hi> yet extant in the <hi>Farnesian</hi> Palace of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, I say, and such like, are generally to be suspected,
and such we frequently encounter in <hi>Medals</hi> of the Lower Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and about the Dominion of the <hi>Thirty Tyrants,</hi> agreeable
enough to the Disorder and Confusion of those Times: And
accordingly they now and then struck some New and Strange
<hi>Head</hi> to an Old <hi>Reverse,</hi> which had no manner of relation to
it; the Person in Authority being so often chang'd and displac'd,
as there was no Care taken of New and fitting Ornament, every
body doing what they pleas'd, as they ever do under all <hi>Anarchical</hi>
giddy and unconstant Government, till they come to be sober
and settled again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:61438:111"/>
               <hi>Apocrypha</hi> are likewise <hi>Medals</hi> in <hi>Bust,</hi> and Effigies of any
<hi>Popes</hi> before <hi>Sixtus Quartus;</hi> or of the Modern Emperors, Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France</hi> it self (what ever they Vaunt) before the
Father of <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Philip</hi> I. and <hi>Charles</hi> VII. the rest being all
false, and yet greedily Collected by the Credulous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary:
Nay, and not seldom by the Curious and Knowing,
to fill up (as we said) what may be wanting to perfect their
Cabinets, until they light upon such as are unquestionably
Antique. 'Tis true, that by the help of such <hi>Medals</hi> (or <hi>Money</hi>
rather) one might procure a Succession even from <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>Great</hi> to this very time. Nay, <hi>Strada</hi> has begun his Collection
from <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> without Interruption, but not without some
(as 'tis thought) of his own Invention.</p>
            <p>And now, what if there be some so <hi>Nasute</hi> and of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in their great Sagacity above others, as to undertake
the discrimination of Antient <hi>Medals</hi> by the very <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
only? (for such we may read of) they should add all the
rest of the <hi>Senses</hi> too, and all of them hardly sufficient. But
to pass these fanciful Pretenders, <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Copper</hi> truly <hi>Antient</hi>
(besides other Indications) frequently distinguish themselves
from the <hi>Modern</hi> (as we said of Graving) by a certain and
altogether (I think) inimitable <hi>Vernish</hi> and Politure, <hi>Green</hi> as
the <hi>Emerald,</hi> and some of more <hi>Turcois Blue;</hi> others of a <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
Brown,</hi> or <hi>Bronze</hi> Colour; but most estimable is the
<hi>Greenish Blue:</hi> These whether Artificial, or Contracting that
hue by long continuance of Time in certain <hi>Earths,</hi> is not
yet determin'd; but an Antient <hi>Roman</hi> Sword here lately found,
where it had been deeply interr'd, colour'd, and exactly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
like to the Vernish we describe; and that upon tough sort
of <hi>Copper</hi> mixture (for of such was the <hi>Romans,</hi> and such is the
<hi>Metal</hi> of this Weapon, as is plainly discoverable by the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which in Digging, the Mattoc or Spade has caus'd, by
breaking the Blade in two Pieces) makes it very Evident; the
rest being intire, and wanting only the Cross-bar and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
of the <hi>Capulum.</hi> This Polish so perfectly resembling
that best of <hi>Vernishes,</hi> does almost command my Belief; that
what we so Admire, is only the Effect of Age and Burial,
which all our <hi>Falsaries</hi> are not able to accomplish with their
<hi>Sal Armoniacs, Vinegar, Paper seinging</hi> and other Applications
and Compositions hitherto attempted. There is indeed a <hi>Green
Vernish</hi> ordinary enough, and very pretty, and only applicable
to <hi>Brass,</hi> but it is so quick and fierce, that it betrays it self:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61438:111"/>
What of this sort they lay on <hi>Silver,</hi> serves only to Rust and
Canker it the sooner, and is therefore to be cleans'd and gotten
off with the Juice of <hi>Lemons,</hi> or well rectified Spirit of <hi>Vinegar;</hi>
the Truth is, all other <hi>Vernishes</hi> succeed much alike, and very
rarely hit.</p>
            <p>One is also to take notice of the Quality of the <hi>Metal:</hi> For
instance, in those but lately mention'd of <hi>Gordian</hi> or <hi>Pescennius,
Maximus,</hi> &amp;c. For a <hi>Medal</hi> (as we have shew'd) shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in <hi>Gold,</hi> which shall be very rare in <hi>Brass,</hi> and another rare
in <hi>Silver,</hi> yet very common in <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Copper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like sort for <hi>Stamp,</hi> an <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Reverse</hi> shall be very
rare in one <hi>Species,</hi> and in another nothing more ordinary:
Those <hi>Medals</hi> of the so much celebrated <hi>Corinthian Brass</hi> (not
much unlike to our <hi>Prince</hi>'s-<hi>Metal</hi>) and so call'd, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for being a certain fortuitous Mixture of several <hi>Metals</hi>
accidentally meeting together at the Conflagration of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb
and Costly <hi>Ephesine</hi> Temple, are generally suspected; or
if any true, very few. There were indeed many exquisitely
wrought Vessels said to be of that precious <hi>Melange,</hi> but some
expert in Separation, have ingenuously confessed, they never
could discover one Grain of <hi>Gold</hi> in any of them, tho' <hi>Plutarch</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. Defect. Orac.</note>
affirms there was.</p>
            <p>Several other sorts both of <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Copper</hi> made use of for
<hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Medals,</hi> are easily distinguish'd of the Skilful by their
Colour, as <hi>Red</hi> in <hi>Medals</hi> of ordinary Size; those of the larger,
by the <hi>Yellow Bronze;</hi> and some that have been stamp'd upon
two different <hi>Coppers,</hi> discoverable now and then by the depth
of the <hi>Inscription,</hi> especially in some <hi>Medalions</hi> of <hi>Commodus,
Hadrian,</hi> &amp;c. But of <hi>Medals</hi> of the pure unmix'd Metal, there
are many very Antient and Valuable, and of several other
sorts of <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Copper Money</hi> there are enough, whereof
some we find are <hi>Silver'd</hi> over, or <hi>Laminated</hi> only with a thin
Foil of richer Metal, after they have first receiv'd the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and of these some since <hi>Posthumius,</hi> or less Antient from
the first <hi>Caesars,</hi> hardly discoverable without Incision, or a very
nice and accurate Inspection, especially about the <hi>Rims</hi> where
certain Notches usually appear: And for the better effecting
this, <hi>Monetaries</hi> have melted old Coins, and taking a slight
Proportion of <hi>Silver,</hi> cover'd the <hi>Copper,</hi> and new stamp'd it;
these among <hi>Medalists</hi> are called <hi>Plated,</hi> or <hi>Furr'd Medals.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
by Clefts, Rifts and lesser Cracks, one shall not perceive
them, so insensibly and by degrees top terminate and loose
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61438:112"/>
themselves in such curiously Small, and as it were <hi>Capillaries,</hi>
hairy Lines and tender Rays, as in the genuine <hi>Antique,</hi> which
may proceed from the force of the Hammer in the Percussion
and Coining; but all such Accidents happening in Authentic
<hi>Medals,</hi> are not for that to be presently rejected, provided the
<hi>Type</hi> be tolerably Fair: Besides, 'tis good Indication that the
<hi>Medal</hi> is not <hi>Moulded.</hi> There are likewise some <hi>Silver</hi> Pieces
<hi>(Serrata Numismata)</hi> indented as it were, which Challenge
good Antiquity among the <hi>Consular</hi> to <hi>Augustus,</hi> but rarely
after.</p>
            <p>The track of the <hi>File</hi> is another Care, and which they are
forc'd to use for the better smoothing of the Edges, which
would else appear stain'd and slubber'd after they have been
newly Cast, whereas a true <hi>Medal</hi> is either curiously <hi>Crennell'd,</hi>
or finely indented and Cover'd over with a Polish that seems
to be natural: Indeed a <hi>Medal</hi> may be found a little abated
with the File, to adapt and fit it to the Nest of the Cabinet,
and yet prove a good <hi>Medal</hi> still; but one had better widen
and inlarge the place, than render such a <hi>Medal</hi> suspected, for
an unnecessary piece of Nicety.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Moulding; Medals</hi> are certainly more easily
Counterfeited by casting off in the <hi>Flask,</hi> or in the Mould, if
the Work-man be his Craft-Master, and have Judgment to
Trim and Repair them well; giving the <hi>Profiles</hi> and <hi>Contours</hi>
that Spirit, Life and Sharpness, which the Antients express'd
in theirs, together with that <hi>Morbidezza</hi> and Tenderness, which
we find in the truly Antient; neither can they be polish'd so
accurately, but one shall detect some Freckles, which the finest
Sand they can be moulded in, is apt to leave, and which, tho'
they endeavour to hide and cover with Varnish, is nothing so
hard, and consequently not so smooth, as the more durable
Antient: And in case they polish the <hi>Fund</hi> with any Tool,
'twill then seem to have been trimm'd with more Niceness
and Formality than is Genuine, which has a certain Firmness
joyn'd with the Polish that distinguishes it: But this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
and indeed peculiar Address, and so is the making
them to hold Weight according to their appearing Substance,
which is another <hi>Criterion.</hi> For they are commonly more lax
and porous, and less close and pond'rous than what have pass'd
the Stamp and Stroke of the <hi>Sledge</hi> or <hi>Press,</hi> which renders
the Metal more compact: Nay, the very Counterfeit stamp'd,
do seldom answer the Weight; some giving the Modern Pound
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61438:112"/>
or Ounce weight to the Antient <hi>Roman,</hi> between which there is
a considerable difference. There are yet some Antient <hi>Medals</hi>
thought to have been Moulded and Cast originally in their
<hi>Matrices;</hi> from all which 'tis evident, how difficult a thing it is,
to light upon a <hi>Virgin Medal,</hi> and that never has been vitiated or
re-touch'd.</p>
            <p>One shall now and then meet with <hi>Gilded</hi> Pieces, but they
are usually such, as tho' haply Antient, are spoil'd and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth: But by a like Fraud, were the <hi>Caracallae Nummi</hi>
utter'd, with which that Emperour cheated the <hi>Senators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost as little valued are those also (tho' true as to their
Antiquity) which the unsteadiness of the <hi>Die</hi> or Stamp has
made, representing Two <hi>Heads</hi> for One; confounding and
disordering the <hi>Inscription</hi> by the jumbling of the Letters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
such as we frequently find among the <hi>Gothic</hi> Coins: We
likewise meet with some <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> both <hi>Consular</hi> and
<hi>Imperial,</hi> which bear some emboss'd <hi>Effigies</hi> on the <hi>Reverse,</hi> and
are as hollow as if they were a kind of Moulds to Cast in; and
this happens when in working with the <hi>Balance,</hi> or other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
of pressure, the <hi>Operator</hi> has forgotten to take and remove
that away, which has already receiv'd the Stamp, and slid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in between, which makes <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Relievo</hi> Convex; the
<hi>other</hi> inward, and so become Concave. Lastly, There are
<hi>Medals</hi> (if so I may call them) that are quite plain, the Field

Thus we find N.P.R.O.B.M. <hi>Nota Probatae Monetae,</hi>
N.C.A.P.R. <hi>Nota Cusa à Populo Romano,</hi> &amp;c. Others there
be, which what they signify is not indeed so perspicuous; and
some whose Countersign is some one Emperor's Head or more;
others with the <hi>Amalthaean</hi> Horn.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there are as we noted, <hi>Medals</hi> both of <hi>Block-Tin,</hi>
and of baser <hi>Lead,</hi> which being skin'd or incrusted rather with
a sort of fine <hi>Varnish</hi> or harder <hi>Laccar</hi> (compos'd perhaps with
some dissolution of <hi>Mastic</hi> or <hi>Amber</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> as they
do their <hi>Iapan Work</hi> nearty laid on) have deceived not a few.
Others, one shall perceive to have been fil'd away, and abated
at one of the sides so low, as to make it capable of receiving
some other <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Reverse</hi> new moulded and embossed upon

the old, and so closely adhering, as not soon to be espied:
Nay, they will now and then Raise and Carve another <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>'s
<hi>Effigies</hi> out of some other Antique <hi>Head;</hi> for Example,
an <hi>Otho</hi> out of <hi>Nero</hi>'s; <hi>Pertinax</hi> or <hi>Pescennius</hi> out of a <hi>Severus</hi>'s;
and so <hi>Families,</hi> as of the <hi>Aemilii</hi> in <hi>Grand Bronze,</hi> they will
usually disguise by the <hi>Philips,</hi> whose Countenance much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
them, and extreamly inhaunces their Value: And what
thus they do on <hi>Heads,</hi> they also as dextrously practise upon
<hi>Reverses,</hi> by substituting some new and rarer Figure: Thus a
<hi>Titus</hi> with a <hi>Reverse</hi> of his Father <hi>Vespasian; Diocletian</hi> with an
<hi>Allocution;</hi> nay, beyond all this, they have the address to slit
and divide asunder two several <hi>Medals,</hi> and with a certain te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
<hi>Cement,</hi> joyn the <hi>Reverses</hi> of one to the <hi>Head</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so repair and trim the Edges, that 'tis almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to discover the ingenious Fraud; yea, they can take off
part only of a <hi>Relievo,</hi> and apply it to another by the same
Artifice and Dexterity; as the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Science</hi> gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in a <hi>Domitian</hi> in <hi>aere magno,</hi> where the <hi>Reverse</hi> was in that
manner separate, to make room for the Insertion of an <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater,</hi>
taken clearly off from one of <hi>Titus</hi>'s; tho' a very saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Eye might perhaps espy some small disproportion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misure,
or upon suspicion, examine where they joyn by the
point of a <hi>Burine</hi> or some fit Instrument.</p>
            <p>They are likewise able if need be, to alter and change the
<hi>Title,</hi> especially where there happen to be but few Letters to
accommodate them; thus a young <hi>Gordian</hi> has been <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd</hi>
into a <hi>Gordian</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> by giving a little Beard to the
Chin, and by altering P.F. into AFR. or AFR instead of
PIVS. which being all of them precious and rare <hi>Medals,</hi> many
are deceived by, only the AVG on the <hi>Reverse,</hi> not at all
agreeing with the <hi>Africanus</hi> (which is ever marked with GG.)
is apt to betray the Cheat to the more knowing <hi>Medalists;</hi> so
<hi>Aeternitas Aug. Aequitas Aug. Adlocutio, Securitas Aug.</hi> ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
the <hi>Gordians</hi> of <hi>Africa.</hi> In this the Skilful <hi>Seguin</hi> was
himself impos'd on by an <hi>Otho</hi> that had been form'd out of a
Copper <hi>Nero,</hi> by turning NER. into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, which one would
think not so easily done, as in those <hi>Sororiae Literae</hi> (Sister-Letters
as one calls them) C into G. M into N. P. R <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which consist of half rounds, or down-right Stroaks.</p>
            <p>They have farther, the Art, not only of Repairing as we
said, new Raising <hi>detrite</hi> and worn-out Letters, but of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Inscriptions,</hi> where no Letters were at all remaining, by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61438:113"/>
resuscitating new ones, <hi>Masticking</hi> them over very Artificially,
and polishing the <hi>Funds,</hi> that is, in defect of <hi>Metal</hi> sufficient
(eaten away by the contracted Rust) to elevate both the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Letters with the <hi>Vernish;</hi> nor is this soon detected
without some sharp and well pointed Tool, which upon trial,
they'll find to be softer and more brittle than the <hi>Metal:</hi> Besides,
one shall perceive some places ruggeder, others deeper, and not
of an equal evenness; but indeed, the too accurate forming
of the Letters themselves does not seldom discover it; for the
Antient Letters had their Stems less strait, and were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
so beautiful as <hi>M</hi> for M, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> informs us (and that truely) how industrious
the <hi>Iews</hi> (the best experienc'd at all Impostures) have been to
put off such false Ware, and make Advantage of all these kinds
of Frauds; but after all this, there's one Diminution, from
which <hi>Medals</hi> are happily exempted, and for ever safe (but to
which <hi>Current Money</hi> is at present more than ever, the most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
and shamefully expos'd) and that is, from <hi>Clipping,</hi>
which utterly marring the Rotundity, and injuring the <hi>Legenda</hi>
and <hi>Inscription,</hi> they cannot put in practice without discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and quite abating of the reputed Value and due Estimation
of a <hi>Medal</hi> above the intrinsic Worth, of which more in the
Chapter following.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgotten to speak of some who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to promote their Frauds by burying <hi>Medals</hi> on purpose,
and out of Design, near the Ruins of some <hi>Roman</hi> Works, and
then pretend to have found them there by Chance, and dug
them up again, as 'tis reported a certain <hi>Statuary</hi> did, who cut
that <hi>Pseudo-Hercules,</hi> yet standing in the <hi>Peristyle</hi> of <hi>Farnese's</hi>
Palace (where the true <hi>Hercules</hi> is since placed by it) and
Sold at a great Price, before this last so justly admired Statue
was discover'd; whether the Tradition be True or not, I do
not warrant: That the other is no infrequent Practice, I do
no more question, than I do that which I remember Monsieur
<hi>Felibien</hi> mentions in the Life of the Famous <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi>
It seems that Noble <hi>Sculptor</hi> (as well as <hi>Painter</hi> and <hi>Architect</hi>)
to try how far he could impose upon the Curious in that Art,
and Judges of Antiquity, made the <hi>Statue</hi> of a <hi>Cupid,</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off one of the Arms from the Shoulder, and burying the
rest of the Body under a certain Ruin, where they were wont to
dig in search of Marbles, which accordingly found, past among
the most Learned <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> and Skilfullest <hi>Statuaries</hi> for an
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61438:114"/>
Authentic and Unvaluable Piece of Antient Art, till <hi>Michael</hi>
himself (after they all had spent their Verdict) produc'd and
shew'd them the <hi>Arm</hi> which he had purposely broken off, and
so exactly fitted the Fracture, as convinc'd them of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(and how fallible the most confident and assured may
sometimes be) to his great Renown.</p>
            <p>To conclude, 'Tis the Opinion of some Skilful <hi>Medalists,</hi>
that it is almost impossible to meet with Two <hi>Medals</hi> of the
same Stamp, which has not its <hi>Counterfeit</hi> attending it; nay,
that when Two <hi>Medals</hi> of the same Impression be in every part
alike, without any apparent Difference, one of them must be
False, if not both, and that every Stamp was made by a several
Workman, or particular Print; but I conceive (besides the
vast Expence) this is not constant, there being so often found
such great number of <hi>Medals</hi> of the very same Person and Coin,
buried as we have shewed, in places where <hi>Old Banks</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
Magazines</hi> and <hi>Mints</hi> have formerly been establish'd, and
Treasure hidden. For Instance, above Two Thousand <hi>Silver
Medals</hi> of <hi>Sabina</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hadrian</hi> found at one time in
<hi>Germany;</hi> besides, the very quality of the Metal it self, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> impregnated with <hi>Niter</hi> and other Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives,
in which they have lain bedded in so many Ages (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that which had not been put into Jarrs and Pots accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
close) must needs have considerably alter'd some of
them more than others; and perhaps from the <hi>Gravers</hi> repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them afterwards, the sharpness being worn off; but what
ever they be of truely <hi>Antique,</hi> provided any one of the <hi>Tables</hi>
representing <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Reverse</hi> be tolerable, a rusty and exeded
<hi>Medal</hi> would not be utterly rejected: but such indeed as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

neither Figure, Letter or History undefac'd, are fitting only
for the <hi>Tinker,</hi> but the smaller the blemish and defect is, the
better.</p>
            <p>Here now might I set down some pretty <hi>Mechanical</hi> ways
for the taking off any <hi>Medal</hi> or <hi>Relievo,</hi> hollow or extant, which
(tho' Curious, and might happly Gratify the <hi>Virtuosi</hi>) I was
thinking to omit; but since it may at one time or other be of
Use to supply a <hi>Series</hi> from some <hi>Medal</hi> or like precious <hi>Intaglia</hi>
(which one may sooner borrow of a Friend than purchase) I
set down such as I have been taught.</p>

               <p>CUT thin shreads of <hi>Parchment,</hi> steep them in fair water
during twenty four hours, then wash them very clean, and put them
into a clean Pipkin over a gentle Fire, till it become a clear and

for two Days, and mingle it with the other over a soft Fire, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

it on a small piece of Board, or wooden Trencher, and make a
Bordure of Clay of an Inch high, and half thickness about the Medal,
the Glew being gently melted, pour upon it to the brim of the Circle,
and cover it with a Paper to preserve it from cleaving to any
thing else; then place it where it may leasurely dry, but by no means
in the Sun, and it will become very hard; the <hi>Medal</hi> slipping out,
you will find (if on an <hi>In-cut</hi>) imboss'd, if upon an <hi>Out-cut,</hi>

to Methodize and Dispose of Medals for the

            <p>AMONGST the many admirable and useful Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Antients, the loss of the Mechanical Part of
the <hi>Mint</hi> is to be deplor'd; but more, that since the breaking in
of those barbarous People who were the Cause of this Loss,
and of that glorious Empire, it was not restor'd to any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Form or Regulation by any more honest and skilful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,
than such as were first Employ'd about the Money,
especially in these Northern Parts, and here in <hi>England,</hi> at that
time so little polish'd and so very ignorant, as not to discern
how greatly they were abused and imposed on, whilst they
totally committed the Coynage and Management of the <hi>Mint</hi>
to certain cunning and avaritious <hi>Iews, Genoeses</hi> and crafty <hi>Italians</hi>
not at all inferior to the <hi>Iews</hi> in all the Arts of knavery and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest
Gain.</p>
            <p>It was by these that Princes were universally circumvented,
and under pretence of bringing vast Advantages to the Publick,
persuaded to admit of these many Alterations, Debasement of
the <hi>Species</hi> and Advancement of the Coin above its genuine and
universal Value, which never ended without the Loss, Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
and Ruin of their Subjects, whilst those Miscreants
grew excessively Rich by their Frauds and Extortions. It must
therefore be confess'd, that we know little more of the Antient
<hi>Mint, Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman;</hi> than that every Capital City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
had commonly their respective <hi>Mints,</hi> and some of them
two or three (as OF. II. III. IIII. &amp;c.) besides other peculiar
Marks. For those of Old, the place of <hi>Minting</hi> we frequently

abounding in that Country.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Monetariae Officinae</hi> had their <hi>Praefecti Aerarii</hi> (Instituted
by <hi>Augustus) Quaestors,</hi> Treasurers and other Officers belonging
to them; but the Great and Paramount Superintendent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
of them all, was the <hi>Triumvir,</hi> Master indeed of the <hi>Mint,</hi>
and of all the <hi>Flandi, Feriundi periti,</hi> having the sole Fabrication
of all the three Metals, and was of such high Authority, that he
frequently stamp'd <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Medals,</hi> bearing his own Head and
Effigies, Names and Titles like a King; but this Priviledge was
exceedingly abated by that Emperor, who after he had divided
the Government of the Provinces between him and the Senate,
leaving to them the Coining of <hi>Copper</hi> only, reserved that of
<hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> as Royal Metals to himself; wherefore very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or never, find we any of their Names after <hi>Tiberius,</hi> tho'
the <hi>Roman</hi> Coin was a long time after current here. Those of
<hi>Silver</hi> therefore, in which we sometimes meet the <hi>Triumvir,</hi> S.C.
or in those <hi>Copper</hi> with TRIB. POTEST, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may look
upon as struck before <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>The like Offices we are told by <hi>Cambden</hi> were settled here at
<hi>London</hi> by the Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> who, as appears, Coin'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

with the glorious Title of <hi>Praepositus Thesaur. Augustensium
in Britannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the Decadency of the Empire, the Antient Money bare
ordinarily the Prince's Head, sometimes his Name only, and
upon the <hi>Reverse</hi> a blunt Cross or like Figure, with notice of
the Place where it was Coin'd, and in others, the Name of the
<hi>Monetarie</hi> and none else (<hi>Triumvir</hi>-like) very frequent in our
<hi>Saxon</hi> Coins, and those of the <hi>Franks,</hi> with sometimes a <hi>Me fecit,</hi>
which perhaps might be that of the <hi>Graver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Procopius</hi> tells us that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> did not set their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
at all upon their Money, till they had first obtain'd Leave
of the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> tho' <hi>le Blanc</hi> denies it; and even with

us, when most of the great and considerable Payments were
made <hi>Honestly</hi> (that is by <hi>Weight</hi>) it was without any Head or
Effigies, whether <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver.</hi>

            <p>As in <hi>France,</hi> where they still employ divers <hi>Mints,</hi> Capital
Letters A. B. C. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (without altering the Inscription) shew
the place of Coining, as <hi>Paris, Lions, Tholouse, Aix, Amiens,
Nants, Bourdeaux, Poitiers,</hi> &amp;c. In like manner with us in
<hi>England,</hi> there were divers Countries and Cities (besides <hi>London</hi>)
where Money was Stamp'd; some upon Occasion for a Time
only; others that had <hi>Ius Monetae,</hi> by peculiar Priviledge. We

Exceter, Chester,</hi> &amp;c. and as <hi>Cowell</hi> tells us, there were
<hi>Mints</hi> erected all over the Kingdom, and wherever the King's
Council thought convenient; for those numerous Fabricks
were always very chargeable and highly prejudicial to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

restrained them to as few, and as soon as possibly they could.

as I believe) which as to the matter, I have somewhere read,
was heretofore a certain Portion of the <hi>Bullion;</hi> and in <hi>France</hi>

Abuse of it, by that cursed Race and Swarms of <hi>Clippers,</hi> and
their Associates in Iniquity, who with an Insolence unparallel'd,
and such as perhaps no Age or Record of History (that of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>'s excepted, yet not coming up to this Degree)
ever mention'd, persist and go on still to justify their Practice (as
if it were no Crime at all) tho' one of the most wicked, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and diabolical Villanies Men can be guilty of. For (as a
Learned Person shews) <hi>Money</hi> being the common Pledge and
Pawn between Man and Man,<note place="margin">

               </gap>s, for a just and reasonable Compensation. For as
to the Effigies and Image of the Prince, it ought not to be look'd
upon as merely stamp'd for Ornament or Honor, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
and set forth Titles only, where or when they Reign'd,
but as publick Vouchers of the real and intrinsic Value of the
Species and Matter according to the constant and general Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the World; the Prerogative being in such manner
concredited by the Subject to the Supream Magistrate and Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Power, and to none else whatsoever, upon Trust and
Confidence of his Justice and Integrity; so as he that either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes
or sophisticates it,<note place="margin">Cornelia Lex falsi, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Coins.</hi>

the King as great a Cheat and Impostor as himself, by (as

which no Punishment seems too great to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>Indeed so scrupulously delicate were they of Old, to prevent
these Practices, that to protect it from the least Diminution, and
to shew how Sacred a Thing it was; the publick Treasures
were usually kept in their Temples, as both at <hi>Delphi</hi> in <hi>Greece,

            <p>As to the <hi>Engine, Mill, Balance</hi> and <hi>Press</hi> now in use (by

their Practice in <hi>France</hi>) whether arrogated or justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
by Monsieur <hi>le Blanc,</hi> to have been the Invention of his
Country Men, I undertake not positively to determin; since
I find <hi>Hierom Cardan,</hi> speaking of one at <hi>Venice</hi> (where that
Noble <hi>Mint,</hi> the <hi>Zeccha</hi> is Establish'd) who long since (he says)
devised an Engine, which both <hi>Stamp'd, Cut</hi> and <hi>Rounded</hi> Money
by one Operation only, for which he was Rewarded by the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61438:118"/>
State (as well he deserv'd) with an ample Pension: But that
it was first of all set up, and practised here with us, before the
<hi>French,</hi> is ingeniously acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>The Combination of those concern'd, was it seems so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as to engage, not only the <hi>Hammer-men,</hi> but the very <hi>Court</hi>
of <hi>Monyers</hi> it self to decry and damn the Invention, so that
Monsieur <hi>Briot,</hi> who pretends to be the Author, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
given so many convincing Proofs of the perfections of it
(superior to all others for preventing the Mischief of Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
being discourag'd, and despairing of Success, came over
into <hi>England,</hi> where he set up his Machine, and made the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Money in the World: Nor had <hi>France,</hi> perhaps till this
day, used the Invention, if (out of meer shame of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
and Reproach) their Great Chancellor <hi>Seguier</hi> had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
them to re-call, and at the same instant erect it at <hi>Paris,</hi>
which was about the Year 1645. when first they began in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to leave the <hi>Hammer,</hi> and fell to stamping their <hi>Golden
Lovises,</hi> and since that, to imitate our <hi>Circumscription</hi> about the
Edge, of which I have already spoken.</p>
            <p>But this Abuse of Coin was it appears so universal, that in
the time of <hi>Charlemain</hi> (tho' at no time so notoriously scandalous,
as with us at this day) the Emperor order'd that no Money
should thenceforth be made, but in his own Court (and there
is a Piece inscrib'd <hi>Palatina Moneta</hi>) so as wheresoever the
Prince removed, the <hi>Mint</hi> with all its Instruments and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
followed; which calls to mind, how in almost the like
Circumstance the late <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. did not think his
<hi>Mint</hi> secure from these wicked Practices, until he had hous'd
it in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> which that great and worthy Minister and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoso,
Monsieur <hi>de Noyers,</hi> plac'd in the same Apartment with
the <hi>Royal Printing-House;</hi> that (as my<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> Freart.</note> Author adds) he
might allie together Two of the most universal and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Monuments of Kings, <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Money,</hi> spreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
over all Nations, and remaining for many Ages. The
excessive Abuses found in the Years 1635 and 39. both in the
<hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> of the greatest part of the <hi>Coin</hi> (as well of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Countries as <hi>France</hi>) which had been changed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
stood in need of timely Reformation: Nor was it
possible to remedy it on the sudden, without putting Commerce
into very great Disorder, and was therefore for a while conniv'd
at. But as this dexterous and <hi>publick-spirited States-man</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it, he well knew how to derive the greatest Advantage
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61438:118"/>
to the Benefit of the People, and Honor of the King, by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly
permitting, and indeed authorizing the Abuse, which
could not else have been so easily encounter'd; whilst in the
mean time, it invited those of all the neighbouring Countries
and States in hope of Gain, to Transport into <hi>France</hi> all their
Light <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> which they had, and which remained
there, by reason of its being decried a few Months after, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> of <hi>Lewis le Iust,</hi> by
that noble Conversion which he order'd to be made of it.</p>
            <p>Whilst this strange Matter was united to ours, he also sought
out and discover'd prompt and easy Expedients of giving it that
excellent Form which since it bears, Curing at the same instant,
and by the same Remedy, both the present Inconvenience, and
that to come. Thus we see that its just and equal <hi>Roundness,</hi>
the <hi>Grenetis</hi> which is about it, and the <hi>Politure</hi> which is on the
<hi>flat</hi> of every Piece, not only defends it from the <hi>Clipping,</hi> the
<hi>File,</hi> and Operation of <hi>Strong-Waters,</hi> but even renders its Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in a manner impossible to our <hi>False Coiners;</hi> so as we
may affirm of this <hi>Money,</hi> that it is the most Artistly contriv'd,
and the most commodious that was ever us'd in Commerce,
there being stamp'd in less than four Years time, above an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Twenty Millions,</hi> and that after fifteen or sixteen Years
that the War had lasted, and the Kingdom seemed to have been
utterly exhausted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Perhaps this Passage, of which I gave Account more than

might have been taken notice of, the Instance being so pregnant,
and so like our present Case</p>
            <p>But as some Kings and Emperors were Famous for their Care
in reforming these Abuses (<hi>Aurelianus</hi> calling in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Money, and giving out New, to obviate the growing
Mischief and Confusion) so there were others as Infamous for
their not only neglecting it, but for doing worse, in not only
conniving at them, but who did themselves vitiate and debase
their own Coin. Such of old among the <hi>Romans</hi> (after the
Age of <hi>Commodus,</hi> whose excesses had so debauch'd the People)
were those from <hi>Gordian</hi> to the <hi>Posthumi,</hi> when they began to
pervert the Standard, which so long as that Wise and Glorious

that the most Barbarous Nations at vast distance held friendly
Commerce and Correspondence with the <hi>Romans,</hi> looking
upon them as just and worthy People from the constant Value,
Goodness and Integrity of their Money. But no sooner did
they once give way to the adulteration or raising of their
Money beyond its real worth; but the Government it self grew
degenerate, and soon fell after it; <hi>Nor is there a more fatal
Symptom of Consumption in a State, than the Corruption and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the Coin;</hi> under which denomination I comprehend all
other Practices on the Species, however dignified by Names and
Character. The very Truth is, to put a King's Title or Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
to unweighty Money, and not of authentic Value, is (as
we said) to render the Prince himself a <hi>Faux Monoyeur,</hi> or as the
Learned<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Pasquiers</hi> Expression is, <hi>donner un souflet au Roy,</hi> and

by the mean and beggarly Shift of <hi>Alchymy</hi> and other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistications,
endeavour'd to supply his Extravagances, as after
him another profuse <hi>Henry</hi> of ours, until his Renouned Daughter
(by more wholsome Counsel reforming it) reduc'd the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
to the Purity of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth.</hi> But it was our <hi>First
Edward,</hi> who first of all establish'd the <hi>English Sterling</hi> from its
ambulatory and uncertain Motion and Value, and which all
the wiser States of Christendom did imitate afterwards. This
calls to mind another <hi>Edward</hi> (that most hopeful and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Prince the <hi>Sixth</hi> of that name) who having as yet hardly
arriv'd to the Thirteenth Year of his Age (upon Consideration
of the miserable Plight to which his profuse Father had brought
the Coin) took such Care and Pains to inform himself of the
State and Condition of the <hi>Mint,</hi> Exchange and Value of Money,
and to Regulate those Matters, as (by turning over the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Original in the</hi> Cotton <hi>Library, and now publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hist. Reformat.</hi> Book II. Part II.</note> 
               <hi>Iournal</hi>
written in his own Hand) I find among other grave and serious
Remarks he did, so far exceeding either the usual Capacity or
Years of an Age so Immature, as it reproaches those who being
much more Advanc'd, minded nothing but trifling, childish or
vicious Diversions.</p>
            <p>To step a little back again to the History of these depraved
Customs abroad; It was about the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Simple,</hi>
that most of the Great ones (especially Governours of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Castles and principal Cities) took on them to Coin, and
looked upon the Priviledge as it were hereditary and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(for so did they sometimes here in <hi>England</hi> too, tho' it
lasted not long) but the Mischief became so insupportable by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61438:119"/>
reason of the Corruption, that when the King would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
the cause of the Abuse, he found it so very difficult,
that he was fain to give it over, and content himself with a
small proportion to discharge the <hi>Mintage,</hi> and this was thought
not a little Progress. 'Tis in the mean time evident (as to that
of <hi>France</hi>) they might thank themselves and their perpetual
Quarrels with <hi>England,</hi> from the very Reign of their Famous
St. <hi>Lewis</hi> (and above all, that of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> IX.
when we endanger'd <hi>France,</hi> as it now does us) which mov'd
them to debase, and yet to inhance the Value of their Coin, to
the unspeakable loss of the Publick, and dishonor of the Prince
and Government; the mixtures being two third-parts of <hi>Copper</hi>
to one of <hi>Silver,</hi> so as three <hi>Deniers</hi> of the New Money, was
not worth above one of the Old, and the Effect was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
namely, an universal Decay of Trade throughout the
Nation; and so very odious was the Practice, that within little
above an Age past, there being but a very small part of Coin
decried in <hi>Aquitain;</hi> the Detriment was so grievously resented
by the People, that they no more computed from the Year of
the Lord, but from their <hi>Decurtata Moneta,</hi> and debasement of
the Coin. What prodigious Confusion this unworthy Shift,
and false <hi>Polity</hi> of <hi>Raising</hi> and <hi>Sinking</hi> has several times wrought
in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> (notwithstanding all that affluence of
immense Treasure from both the <hi>Indies</hi>) the lamentable and
astonishing sudden Ruin of that late formidable Monarchy
shews, as well as of many private Persons within our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and may in great part be imputed to it; whilst their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
Avarice, Ambition, Cruelty and Injustice, may and
ought to be a <hi>Document</hi> to other Princes and Potentates, who
think to establish their Grandeur by indirect Policies, however
for a time, they seem to flourish and carry all before them. But
to return to those Corrupters once more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> began to Reform this Evil, but
soon they relaps'd, until the Father of the present King attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Regulation, and at last (not without exceeding Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and seditious Commotions) hardly, and with difficulty,
effected it. We meet indeed with some fair Pieces of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>Second</hi> (by some Invention imitating the Press) which were
Coin'd in the <hi>Iardin des Estuves,</hi> An. 1553. But it never arriv'd to
perfection, till Mons. <hi>Varin, Intendant</hi> of the <hi>Mint</hi> (whom I knew,
and who was himself the most Excellent Artist any Age since
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> has I think produc'd) took in hand, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61438:120"/>
us'd the Mill effectually, as we had in some sort before, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
those Pieces of our <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and his Glorious Sister
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which we may esteem as <hi>Medals:</hi> And happy,
happy I pronounce that State and Kingdom, whose Princes
(as both these, especially the latter) make it their early Care to
preserve the Standard, intrinsically valuable, by a Law as Sacred
and Inviolable as that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> This <hi>le Blanc</hi>
himself acknowledges to have been done in <hi>England</hi> only of all
the Kingdoms, not of <hi>Europe</hi> alone, but of all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
And undoubtedly, Money, (which is All things in
Power and Effect) should be made as near as is possible, of
such proportion of <hi>Alloy, Weight, Value</hi> and Security from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,</hi>
as the Species is worth in Metal, what 'tis pretended
to be in Payment, exclusive to the Fabrick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as near as
may be, and as when of old, it was cut from the solid <hi>Lingot;</hi>
and then let Men in God's Name traffick freely with it, as
with other Commodities, it will never prejudice the State.
Where this is <hi>honestly</hi> observ'd, there will ever be most plenty
of Money, and that State and Kingdom the most flourishing:
What People then would defile their Fingers with their <hi>Monnoy
Noire,</hi>

blanch'd with adulterate Mixtures, or endure the genuine Metal
should be stretch'd beyond its real Value? The pernicious
Consequences of which, is abundantly made out, by that our
Learned and Judicious Antiquary, the late Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> both
before Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and the Lords
of the Council; and since by Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> whose <hi>Catechism</hi>
(as I beg leave to call it) and Thoughts about this Matter,
coincident with that of Sir <hi>Christopher Wren,</hi> and lately (since
the writing of this) the incomparably Judicious and Learned
Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> with the worthy Author of the <hi>Review,</hi> I prefer to
any thing I have hitherto met with, pretending to answer the
present ill-boding Exigences under which we suffer.</p>
            <p>It were easie to deduce the Original and Cause, State and
Progress of Money it self, from the Rising, Culminating and
Meridian, to its decline and almost setting in our <hi>Hemisphere,</hi>
as to Goodness and Integrity: For so it first shone brightest in
the <hi>East,</hi> as we learn from Sacred Writ, when they dealt by

other both high, subordinate and Inferior Offices and Officers
relating to Money; the Consultations of the most politick

for whatsoever else falls under this ample Subject, in I think
all the possible Difficulties which usually arise, incident to this
imortant Branch and Nerve of the Power, Justice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of a Nation, Historically deduc'd, and that with <hi>German
Industry.</hi> But as it suits not altogether with my purpose to
compile a pompous Volume out of so many Authors, as have
discuss'd this Argument (and which were easie to do by Men
of leisure) so should I not have nam'd them here, but for this
Observation, that by the universal Suffrage of them all (I am
sure, of the most Learned, Judicious and Able of them all, I
dare appeal to all the <hi>Politicks</hi> from <hi>Aristotle</hi> to <hi>Bodin,</hi> and so forth
for Two Thousand Years) the raising of the Value of Money
at any time beyond its real Worth, has been almost equally
decried and condemned with the very worst of Sophistications,
Debasing and Diminution of it, and from the constant Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the fatal and destructive Consequences which have ever
attended it: One needs but to read the Story of <hi>Livius Drusus,</hi>
the Disorder caus'd by those Practices until <hi>Marius Gratidianus,</hi>
who had his Statue erected by the Commons, to which in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
they burnt Incense, for his Care and Regulation about
the <hi>Mint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, how foul a Stain it left on the very best
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes, as oft as they yielded to these false Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
their best Historians have acquainted us; nor indeed
was it at all to their Credit, that even in their greatest Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the <hi>Punic</hi> War, they had recourse a while to this ignoble
Shift; seldom or rarely practised but by Tyrants, the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
vicious and profuse of all that Government, and never
failing fore-runners of Calamities ensuing both in the <hi>West</hi>
and <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire also, from these <gap reason="foreign">

Let us but compare the Times, Periods and Revolutions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Schisms and other Circumstances of this <hi>Degenerate, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi>
and <hi>Self-Interess'd</hi> Age; and how little of generous and

there is among us, with the Causes and Accidents of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
in the <hi>Eastern World</hi> (subject to that once Glorious
Empire) and see if ever any Age did more resemble it, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
something like to <hi>Turcism</hi> (besids <hi>Coffee</hi>) do not at last
emerge and spring from this <hi>Cataclysis</hi> and Medly of Opinions
abounding among us, and no <hi>Religion:</hi> Not let us imagine or
flatter our selves with an Impossibility of falling into the like
Circumstances. Those who lived in those yet flourishing
Countries and brighter Days, among the most polish'd <hi>Greeks,</hi>
doubtless as little dreamt it possible that the Successors of the
<hi>Paaeologi, Cantacuzeni,</hi> Noble and High-born <hi>Porphyrogeneti</hi> should
from their Illustrious Race (Heirs of Crowns and Scepters)
literally now be keeping <hi>Sheep</hi> and feeding <hi>Camels</hi> in barren
and sandy Deserts; that the whole Posterity of that once proud
and conquering People should lose both their <hi>Religion, Country,
Laws, Liberty, Ease</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> nay, their very <hi>Language</hi> and
Native <hi>Tongue</hi> (the most Learned, Copious and Universal
under Heaven) in far shorter time than any Nation we ever
read, or I think, heard of under it!</p>
            <p>Nor am I much departed from my <hi>Text</hi> by this Preachment
or Prophecy (call it which you please) whilst I shew what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Confusions naturally flow from, and attend the supine Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence
of so long suffering this Diminution of our Treasure
(which a more timely Care and Thought might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented)
and extream difficulty of redressing and recovering it
to its pristine Course and Value. <hi>Obsta Principiis</hi> is as infallible

            </p>
            <p>In order to this, I was glad to find that so many able Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
had by the Prudence of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Treasury,</hi> been
encourag'd to take this Article into their serious Thoughts, and
by the Search and Recital of many antient and pertinent Records
(we should hardly ever have else inspected) given us the

               <hi>History</hi> of our <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Coins;</hi> whilst tho' I own the great
Satisfaction I received in Reading their Judicious Remarks, I
must at the same time acknowledge, that I always wish'd there
might some Expedient be found, which might (if possible)
supply the Necessity of altering the Value and Estimation of
the <hi>Species</hi> beyond its intrinsic Worth, which has (as I have
shewed) in all Ages and Exigences proved so mischievous in the
Event.</p>
            <p>In short, whatever pretends to add or detract from the Value
of Money, must of necessity Influence, and insensibly Affect
all that's necessary, not only to the well-being, but to the very
<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of a Kingdom. All Pacts and Covenants,
Bargains, Obligations, Estates, Rents, Goods, Credit and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondences
whatsoever (becoming dubious and uncertain)
must sink and be at an end: If once People want wherewith
to purchase <hi>Bread</hi> (which includes and comprehends all other
Necessaries) the <hi>Fisque</hi> and publick Treasure supplied by the
People suffers in all its Branches and Relations, as the most
flourishing Tree does from its wither'd and dried up Roots;
and that State and Nation becomes Defence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>France</hi> (as formidable as now it seems) be Instance; in
the often named <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi>'s Reign, when it lay so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
expos'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that of early Days, even here in <hi>England,</hi> such
things had been done: <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>First</hi> corrupted the Coin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Six Hundred Years since; and that after <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi>
the <hi>First Edward</hi> (a Wise and Prudent King) had in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
fixt the <hi>Standard,</hi> and settled uniformity of Money; and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61438:122"/>
that Noble and Renowned Prince <hi>Edward</hi> III. stating its Value,
did raise it also <hi>aliquousque;</hi> and that it has since frequently been
vitiated, especially by the incontinent King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth;</hi>
but all this while, to the infinite Detriment and Dishonour of
the Nation, until (as we shewed) that Fortunate and well-consulted
Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> intirely restor'd it to its genuine
Value and antient Dignity. And here again 'tis worthy
Remark, that the most prosperous and glorious Potentates, and
most beloved, were even those who took the greatest Care to
preserve the <hi>Species</hi> chast and intemerate; Instances we have in
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> in whose time the Western Empire was in its
highest Ascendant since the <hi>Roman Caesars;</hi> as on the contrary,
how prodigiously it sunk and languish'd, as often as they fell

               <hi>Peller</hi> (sadly complaining, for
want of timely Remedy, suffering such wretched <hi>Leaches,</hi> that
as with us, still persisted to abuse the Publick) breaks out into
this pathetic Exclamation (and so may we) <hi>Morbum ipsum
Deus curet</hi> (the Lord have Mercy on us) <hi>&amp; ille qui eum in
terris representat:</hi> For if his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and those in Power did
not speedily take the <hi>Cure</hi> into their Hands, <hi>Conclamatum est,</hi> our
Condition would be desperate, and the Nation ruined. What
<hi>France</hi> has suffer'd we have shew'd in <hi>Philip,</hi> and from him till
their <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> and therefore call'd the <hi>Wise</hi> for his Care
in re-settling his <hi>Mint</hi> on a firmer Base; but after which it hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
relaps'd in <hi>Charles</hi> VII. and IX. and frequently since; but
never without its pernicious and natural Consequences.</p>
            <p>But now since we are fall'n into this sore Calamity, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
is, how to heal the Wound, supply the present Deficiency,
and not only seek whence to derive a timely Stream equivalent
to that which is issued out, but to remove the Dams and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
that obstruct the flowing Current, till which, to be
sure, it must and will continually be sinking, and the very
dregs and pittance of what rests, be raised, to a yet greater loss,
be the prohibitions what Superiors please.</p>
            <p>There was a time (not long since) when spirited with
Zeal and wanton Ease, the <hi>abused</hi> People, and of all degrees,
spontaneously brought in their <hi>Plate:</hi> Many massively great
and other Pieces of curiously wrought Vessels, I my self beheld,
batter'd and defac'd to flatness, by the rude Sledge and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the Melting-pots in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> (which was fill'd to
to the Roof almost) upon the Credit of the <hi>publick Faith,</hi> to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61438:122"/>
ruin the best establish'd <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> under Heaven; and
I little question, but would they do so now to preserve what
God has since restor'd and save from the Danger it is in, by a
free and generous Oblation of it, without any future expectation
of being re-imburs'd by so insupportable a Tax, as will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to answer the mention'd Loss (but which must at last
come out of their own Purses and Estates) it would almost,
if not altogether, heal the gastly Wound: And who that were
touch'd with a true Zeal and Affection to his Native Country,
would not be ready chearfully to part with the most splendid
Superfluities, and eat and drink with more Content and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in Earthen-Dishes and Wooden-Cups (as the brave
<hi>Romans</hi> did whilst they were truly brave) rather than in the
brightest <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> to support a sinking Nation? Were
this and all the imprison'd and undiminish'd Money produc'd,
and none of it suffer'd to be <hi>Hoarded, Cull'd, Clipp'd,</hi> privately
<hi>Melted down</hi> or <hi>Transported,</hi> or what is false <hi>Imported,</hi> upon
any unjustifiable Account; and all Commodities necessary to
human Life, Decency, and of daily Use, rated in some tolerable
proportion to the present Exigences, and by no means left in
an Arbitrary manner to be inhaunced by the Ingrosser and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer,
as inevitably it must, and will be unless prevented; and
that Money rise not beyond its real Value (what ever Laws
or Edicts be provided against it) it would go a very great way
to our Relief in the present Circumstances. But if this be too
hard a Chapter, and look more like a <hi>Platonic</hi> Notion, than pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
in this self-Interess'd and degenerate Age, let us acquiesce
and leave it as becomes us to Superiors, and to Expedients justified
by such solid <hi>Funds,</hi> as the collective Wisdom of the Nation
shall think proper and most effectual, which upon no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Stress or Occasion whatever, less than immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
imminent and inevitable Ruin, ought to be diverted,
much less invaded. In a word, were there a round Imposition

<hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> (yet with distinction of Qualities) as
it would create a marvellous Change, and for the better, so
would it soon compensate the parting with the want of many
unnecessary and costly Trifles, which minister to our Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,
and make Men eager to obtain them at any Price. Better,
far better were it that a few Shops of Voluptuary Arts
and Traders in <hi>Modes</hi> and fantastic Dresses, as well as—
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61438:123"/>
and other <hi>Publicans,</hi> with the whole Tribe of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and
the <hi>Crafts-men</hi> were reduc'd or confin'd to their former Shop-Trade
only (and would in some States, and such Exigences
be obnoxious) who evidently obstruct, garble and drain the
very Vital of the Nation. I say, better they were totally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
suppress'd and broken, than a whole Nation be undone,
as unavoidably it must be, if such, and other unsatiable <hi>Gulphs</hi>
be not stopp'd; and that God Almighty raise not up some
Wise and publick spirited Patriots, to stand in the Breach, and
set their Hands and Heads to prevent it, with all imaginable
diligence. In the mean while, let these worst of Men (and
as one calls them, <hi>Ultima Satanae Excrementa)</hi> beware the Fate
of <hi>Stephen Barbet</hi> and his Fellows, who from the like sordid
Gains (and from nothing of Family or conspicuous Vertue)
rais'd themselves to <hi>Estates</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> in so short a space, and
by unknown <hi>Extorsions</hi> and <hi>Depredations</hi> on the <hi>Publick,</hi> made
<hi>vast Purchases,</hi> rose to mighty Fortunes, and <hi>built sumptuous
Palaces</hi> in the Reign of the so often mention'd <hi>Philip.</hi> The
deserved Justice inflicted on him and his Complices, may be a
timely Warning; that ill-advis'd and unhappy Prince, sadly,
but too late, and on his Death-bed, attributing all his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
and the loss of his Subjects Affection (the greatest
Jewel on a Prince's Crown) to his remissness in this Important
Concern. Farther Instances might be produced of the like <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophes</hi>
(besides what befel in <hi>Turkey</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Amurath</hi>
the <hi>Fourth,</hi> Brother to <hi>Osman</hi>) in other States of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
But I am tedious and beg Pardon for the Liberty I have taken,
with good Intention, since 'tis hoped we may, and shall find
great Effects from his Majesty's great Care, the present and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the Consultations of those Gentlemen of
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trade.</hi> But to look for, and to carry it on, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
must be restored, and the Reputation of our <hi>Exchequer</hi> by
protecting of our ships and Mercantile Commerce abroad,
which can only bring home those Effects to replenish it, and
which would be of infinitely more Advantage to us (and far
less chargeable) than all our Efforts on <hi>France,</hi> enrich'd by so
many <hi>Thousands</hi> of our <hi>Vessels,</hi> and <hi>Millions</hi> of Treasure taken
from us. And now after all, tho' I should expect but little
Thanks of some for what I have said, yet, I comfort my self
with the Sense and Suffrage of all, to whom the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>solid
Interest</hi> of the Nation is dearer than their Lives. And if I
fore-tell that what I have predicted spring from the natural
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61438:123"/>
Consequences of the Premises; it is what I have fortified with
undeniable Instances and irrefragable Truths, unless all
<hi>Europe,</hi> and all the negotiating World besides, agree to Reverse
all that their most prudent Ancestors have upon the long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of so many Ages and Turns of Governments, settled and
built on, as the most reasonable and lasting, since there would
otherwise be no boundary or end of Raising, Depressing and
Cheating, till all fell to the Ground.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, of <hi>This</hi> I am morally certain, and must
adhere to as a steady <hi>Maxim;</hi> that the only <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous
Expedient</hi> must be to make our Money of equal <hi>Fineness</hi> and
<hi>intrinsic Value,</hi> under whatsoever Denominations or Shifts we
can devise as to smaller Pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to serve the present Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

Money truly valuable to all intents and purposes. This
effected, and Money reduced to its Primitive Institution (when
Mankind dealt <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> with one another) we may
hope for a <hi>Blessing</hi> from <hi>Almighty God.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>Mints</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> to <hi>Medals</hi> again, come in the Names
of the most celebrated and experienc'd Artists who have not
only approach'd, but almost exceeded the Antients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cavino,</hi> the famous <hi>Padoan</hi> and <hi>Parmesano</hi> were of those who
did Wonders in this kind with New Stamps: The first with
great Force, the latter with more of the Delicate and Tender.
They were these who skill'd to impress a New-cut Stamp
upon an Old <hi>Medal,</hi> so as hardly to be discern'd from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
unless it were that their Works, tho, full of Spirit, yet
the <hi>Relievo</hi> not altogether so bold and <hi>extant,</hi> render'd some
of them the sooner suspected. Such in fine they were, as to
this Day, and ever will impose sometimes upon the most
confident and knowing, and such it seems as in Veneration of
their Excellency, have their graving Tools and Instruments
kept as great Rarities, amongst the Curiosities of the Library
of St. <hi>Genevieve</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> for so are those of the <hi>Parmegiano</hi> as
<hi>Reliques</hi> of no small Value.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Class</hi> was the <hi>Vincentino, Bellas, Leon Leoni,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who, as I am told, being for a Capital Crime at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:61438:124"/>
adjudged to suffer Death, is said to have pleaded, and obtain'd
his Pardon, thro' the Favour of a certain extraordinary and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Law, that whatever Criminal can prove himself to be
the most excellent and consummate Work-man in any useful
Art or Mystery (like some <hi>Felons</hi> here with us, obnoxious to
the like Punishment, are indulg'd their Book in <hi>Favorem Vitae,</hi>
and to incourage Learning) may Challenge (some Crimes
excepted only, as in particular <hi>False Money</hi>) the Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in <hi>Favorem Artis,</hi> for the first Fault. Nor were the Antients
without ingenious Counterfeits, injurious to the Public, since
<hi>Pliny</hi> reports it of one who had Honors done him for his Sagacity
in detecting Frauds of this nature.</p>
            <p>The best and choicest <hi>Medals</hi> for the Workmanship (<hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver</hi>) were such as had been graven at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> with
S. C. by Order of the <hi>Senate,</hi> or upon the Place in the time of
the Great <hi>Augustus:</hi> Nor were they in much less perfection
when the Noble <hi>Hadrian</hi> caus'd <hi>Medals</hi> to be stamp'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Sculpture, and after him <hi>Commodus</hi> and other of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi>
for Presents and Largesses, of which already. The rest
Coin'd in the remoter Provinces and Dominions, did nothing
resemble the Originals, and became therefore the more easily
discover'd; besides, that they frequently dress'd them in some
odd unusual Habits or Ornaments not properly <hi>Roman,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by the Substance and Fabric of the Pieces themselves, some
of them being deeper, some shallower, nor in the same Metal.
<hi>Roman Medals</hi> are more easily distinguish'd by their universal
accurateness; the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> by their Edges; those of <hi>Syria</hi> by
their thickness, as the <hi>Spanish</hi> by the contrary, shallow and slight
Relieve.</p>
            <p>We have in <hi>George Vasaries</hi>'s Lives of the most Famous <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
(wherein he mentions <hi>Sculptors</hi>) the <hi>Mechanic</hi> Part of
<hi>Medal-cutting</hi> in any sort of Metal or Precious Stones, together
with the Temper of the Matter;<note place="margin">

to insculp and prepare the Mould and <hi>Matrices,</hi> but
which is since exceedily improv'd by Monsieur <hi>Felibien</hi> whom we
have already mention'd.</p>
            <p>There were some who thought that <hi>Medals</hi> were first Cast,
and afterwards had the Stamp applied to make the Work deeper;
but how this could be effected in Cast and molted Metal,
which renders it exceeding brittle, I cannot well conceive.</p>
            <p>To return then to our <hi>Masters,</hi> Excellent in their kinds at
present, are, if living, <hi>Hameranus, Bossier, Goujon, Carteron,</hi> and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61438:124"/>
above all <hi>Varin,</hi> of all the <hi>French</hi> Modern, the rarest Master,
both for his Art and Improvement of the <hi>Mint</hi> whilst he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
it. Engravers among us were <hi>Symons, Rawlins</hi> (already
nam'd) and now Mr. <hi>Haris, Christian,</hi> &amp;c. laudable for many
Productions of their Skill and Ingenuity; whilst Mons. <hi>Rotie</hi>
and his Sons continued their Fathers Travel, who have given
the World such proof of their Abilities in performances of this
kind, as may rightly paragon them with many of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Antients. After all,</p>
            <p>For the Honor of our Countrey-men, I cannot here omit
that Ingenious Trial of Skill which a commendable Emulation
produc'd in a <hi>Medal</hi> I have seen perform'd with extraordinary
accuracy, by one I lately mention'd, who having been deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
imploy'd in the <hi>Mint</hi> at the <hi>Tower,</hi> was not willing to
be supplanted by Foreign Competitors. To make this good,
I need have given no other Description, if the following Type

               <hi>Thomas Simon</hi> most humbly prays your Majesty to compare
this his <hi>Tryal-Piece</hi> with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and if more truly Drawn
and Emboss'd, more Gracefully order'd, or more accurately Ingraven,
to Relieve him.</p>
            <p>This laudable Contention was it seems in the Year, 1663.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:61438:125"/>
Of this Rank and Form (besides <hi>Giovanni del Cavino,</hi> and a
Son of his; <hi>Gellini, Leone Aretino, Iacopo da Tresso, Fred. Bonzaga</hi>
and the incomparable <hi>Giovanni Iacopo) Gio: del Cornivole</hi> comes
in, who was so call'd for his rare Talent of working in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelian,</hi>
improv'd by the <hi>Milaneze Cameo,</hi> who first recovered
the Art of <hi>Intaglio</hi> in the <hi>Onyx</hi> and other precious Stones, after
the Antient manner had been lost and neglected 1500 Years.
Next to these <hi>Pietro Maria de Pescia, Marmida</hi> and his Son
<hi>Lodovic, Valerio Vincentino</hi> (already nam'd) who had been in
<hi>England</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and left a <hi>Sardonyx,</hi>
which I think he cut here, representing the Head of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<hi>Heroine,</hi> inferior to none of the Antients. There was
likewise <hi>Michelino,</hi> who with <hi>Lodovic</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> had gotten
such Fame for Counterfeiting antient <hi>Medals;</hi> and such another
was <hi>Luigi Arichini</hi> and <hi>Alessandro Caesari</hi> call'd the <hi>Greek,</hi> so highly
Celebrated for that Noble <hi>Medalion</hi> of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the <hi>Third;</hi> and
the Head of <hi>Phocion</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> which he cut in an <hi>Onyx,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
by universal Suffrage to any of the Old Masters. To
these might be added <hi>Antonio de Rossi, Cosimo de Trezzo, Fran.
Raibolini, Philip Negarolo, Gaspar</hi> and <hi>Gerolamo Misaroni, Pietro
Paulo Galeotto, Pastorino di Sienna;</hi> not omitting the Renowned
<hi>Pharodoxus</hi> of <hi>Milan. Fran. Furnius, Severus</hi> of <hi>Ravenna, Trecia</hi> of
<hi>Milan</hi> also, who is said to be the First, who with wonderful
Success, cut the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Arms on a goodly <hi>Table Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
no Man hitherto having adventur'd to encounter that
unconquer'd Stone.</p>
            <p>From what has been said, I shall only observe, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
one that would be an accomplish'd <hi>Medalist,</hi> not only
to be well acquainted with these great Masters, and their way
of Design, but to be able also to perform something in the
<hi>Manual</hi> part it self. For such were those <hi>Virtuosi</hi> and Ingenious
Spirits, the Illustrious <hi>Giovanni Baptista</hi> of <hi>Sienna, Rosso Giugni</hi> of
<hi>Florence,</hi> Gentlemen of Note; as at present, the no less Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Monsieur <hi>Morelli,</hi> who both Designets and Ingraves the
<hi>Medals</hi> which he publishes.</p>
            <p>But of this as to <hi>Gravers,</hi> I have long since given a fuller
Account in my History of <hi>Chalcographie,</hi> to which add the
Preface of <hi>Molinet,</hi> who has Recorded the Names of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrated
<hi>Medal Cutters</hi> and others, for near these Two Hundred
Years past, and by whom they were reform'd from <hi>Casting</hi> to
<hi>Stamping</hi> after the Antient manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61438:125"/>
And now since to the perfect Understanding of <hi>Medals,</hi> not
only in respect to the Beauty and Elegancy of the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and discovery of Frauds and Impostures; but (for what
this Discourse is principally intended) the Use and Benefit to
be deriv'd from them; nothing can more conduce than the
Study and Direction of such Authors as have with greatest
Judgment and Success written on, and cultivated this Subject:
I shall here present the Studious with the Names of the most
reputed Authors and instructive <hi>Nomismatographi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>du Choule,</hi> a Noble, Curious and Learned <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
did about an Hundred Years since, publish a Discourse
of the <hi>Religion of the Antient</hi> Romans, worthy perusal, as giving
singular Light to this useful Science, which seemed almost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
neglected till within about half a Century before, when
certain Learned Persons in <hi>Italy,</hi> especially of the Illustrious
House of <hi>Medices</hi> (as <hi>Bigotius</hi> tells us) began to cultivate and
review the Study of <hi>Medals;</hi> chief among these were <hi>Andreas
Fulvius Ursinus</hi> (augmented lately by Dr. <hi>Patin</hi>) for the
<hi>Consulars</hi> and <hi>Roman Families,</hi> and above all, as most accurate
of any for likeness to the original <hi>Sculps</hi> and Design. And for
<hi>Institution,</hi> the most Industrious <hi>Hubert Golzius,</hi> whom we find
dignified with the Honor of being made a <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for
his extraordinary Talent in that his laborious and useful Work,
for the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities especially, and for the Elements of this
Study, as explain'd by <hi>Nonius;</hi> where also of the <hi>Fasti</hi> and
<hi>Roman Triumphs,</hi> &amp;c. Likewise <hi>Anthony de Pois, Gorlaeus, Wolfangus
Lazius;</hi> the Dialogues of <hi>Augustinus</hi> (another fit Author to
begin with) <hi>George Sambucus, Tristan à St. Amante,</hi> one of
the first who treated of the <hi>Greek Imperials</hi> Learnedly; but in
this to blame, that he fill'd Defects with some <hi>Medals</hi> design'd
from such as were imperfect and drawn by Fancy, <hi>Possevin,
Cuperus; Hemalarius</hi> of <hi>Antwerp</hi> for most of those in <hi>Gold,</hi> as
<hi>Patin</hi> those of <hi>Silver; Falconerius, Peter Bellorius, Oyselius</hi> and
<hi>Gevartius</hi> for ordinary <hi>Medals, Tenzelius</hi>'s <hi>Selecta Numismata,</hi>
&amp;c. or as <hi>Alphabetically</hi> recited by <hi>Suaresius,</hi> not forgetting
Monsieur <hi>Toynard,</hi> the late Dr. <hi>Spon</hi> (Companion in Travel
and Inclination to these laudable Studies, with the worthy
Sir <hi>George Wheeler</hi>) whose Learned <hi>Researches</hi> on this and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other useful Productions have exceedingly oblig'd the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
To these add <hi>Hulsius's</hi> Twelve <hi>Caesars, Panvinius</hi>'s <hi>Fasti,
Savotius</hi> for the <hi>Metal, Weight, Value, Type, Argument,</hi> &amp;c. with
such as have explain'd any particular <hi>Medals:</hi> As that Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61438:126"/>
of <hi>Chiflet de Othonibus aereis; Falconerius de Nummo Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensi;
De Camps</hi> upon a <hi>Greek Medal</hi> of <hi>Ant. Caracalla; Segui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
de Nummo Britannico; Gronovius de Sestertiis; Conringius</hi> of
the <hi>Iewish Shekle,</hi> &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Patin, de Nummo Hor. Coclitis,</hi> and
of that where the Emperor <hi>Augustus</hi> is with <hi>Plato,</hi> which minds
me of the abovementioned <hi>Chiflet</hi>'s <hi>Socrates, sive de Gemmis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculp'd
with the Image of that Philosopher, <hi>&amp;c. Io. Macarius</hi>'s
<hi>Abraxas de Gemmis Basilidianis,</hi> and such others as have written
Learnedly upon <hi>Intalia</hi> in Seals and Stones of Price, <hi>Iacobus de
Wild</hi> his <hi>Nummi Regum,</hi> and of the Kingdoms, Regions and
Cities illustrated by <hi>Medals;</hi> to these I add <hi>Albertus Rubens</hi> (Son
of that late famous Painter) who has publish'd a Dissertation
in <hi>Latin</hi> concerning <hi>Medals; Adolphus Occo's Imperials,</hi> with the
<hi>Count Mezza Barba:</hi> The first, namely <hi>Occo,</hi> Alphabetically and
Elegantly enough explained, of so universal use as may no
more be wanting to a <hi>Medalist,</hi> than a <hi>Dictionary</hi> to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Language. Besides, we have in that Industrious Work
an Account and <hi>Series</hi> from the Great <hi>Pompey</hi> to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> which
is as long as any <hi>Medals</hi> were tolerable, together with a just
Character of their Persons, and a succinct History of their
Lives and signal Actions out of the most approv'd Authors,
with <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Chronological</hi> Notes, the Year when struck,
and upon what occasion; in short, a Work acceptable to the
Curious, and such as may serve for an ample Repertorie on
many Occasions; 'tis pity we had not what was expected from
him of the <hi>Greek.</hi> Since these, Authors of the first Class (and
which are not to be pass'd by without a thorough Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
are Monsieur <hi>Vaillant</hi>'s <hi>Seleucidarum Historia</hi> and <hi>Latin
Colonies: Cange</hi>'s <hi>Byzantine</hi> History and for those of the <hi>Bas
Empire:</hi> The Jesuite <hi>Hardouin</hi>'s <hi>Antirrhetic,</hi> and other Pieces on
this Subject to be reckon'd amongst the most Learned that have
written; together with the illustrious <hi>Spanheim,</hi> of whose
absolute and incomparable <hi>Dissertation de praestantia &amp; usu Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mismatum,</hi>
nothing can be said too much to recommend it for
Fruit and the Advantages which it shews may be gathered from
the Culture of this noble and useful Study. In expectation still
of Monsieur <hi>Morelli</hi>'s so long promised Work, an Account of
which we have in his late <hi>Specimen,</hi> and of his wonderful Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
to the delineation of no fewer than <hi>Twenty Thousand</hi> several
<hi>Medals</hi> Rare and Antique, preserved or any where to be found
in the <hi>Cabinets</hi> and Collections of the greatest Princes and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons of <hi>Europe,</hi> and this above Twelve Years since;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61438:126"/>
How many then certainly by this time! All of them drawn and
design'd by his own Hand, with the greatest accuracy, which
is a peculiar Talent and Address, hardly to be found among
our skilfulest <hi>Painters</hi> themselves, <hi>Medal Figures</hi> having a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Air of Antique, free and easy, different from other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,

in the naked <hi>Contour,</hi> without <hi>hatching</hi> to set them off; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the <hi>Medals</hi> in this Discourse have suffer'd to please
the <hi>Bookseller,</hi> who was so much charm'd with the <hi>Hollandia
Metallica,</hi> that I could not prevail with him to spare that Cost,
during my almost continual absence whilst they were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving;

bringing up the Rear; there will be left little more behind to
the full and intire <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of this part of <hi>Erudition.</hi> It
is yet most true (after all we have spoken of those Excellent
Authors for Knowledge and Direction) there have been
mistakes sometimes made: <hi>Golzius, Occo, Mezza Barba</hi> and
others not excepted, tho' perhaps in fewer Instances; and
therefore worthy is the Undertaking of Monsieur <hi>Morelle</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
the suspected <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Golzius</hi> and the rest, from the
genuine and truly Antique: But as it were next impossible,
that among so many Heaps and Numbers, the most Sagacious
should not sometimes Err and be imposed on, so may it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the most circumspect and critical <hi>Medalist</hi> in examining
all the Circumstances hitherto mention'd, and that it requires
no slight Industry and Skill as well as Learning and Modesty,
before one does too confidently adventure to Build or Support
any part of the serious History, or other weighty Matter upon
the Reputation of <hi>Medals</hi> only; tho' of all Records (trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to us antient things) they prove the most Authentic
and certain Reporters, preferable to any other, whether <hi>Titles,
Inscriptions, Fasti</hi> or <hi>Memories</hi> whatsoever; since albeit, these
were also very numerous, set up and expos'd in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
Parts and Provinces of that Vast and Extensive Empire;
<hi>Medals,</hi> for being chiefly struck at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Capital City, and
Mistress of the known World (to which from all its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
the knowledge of the greatest and most renowned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
came and were examin'd) must needs be of the greatest
Credit and Estimation. I have only one more to mention
(highly deserving for what he has lately published on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument)
and that is the Learned Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> whose Book,
tho' printed some Years after this was first written, might
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61438:127"/>
well have answer'd all that was necessary to the knowledge of
this <hi>Science,</hi> had not this been engag'd to the <hi>Stationer,</hi> and in
the <hi>Printer</hi>'s Hands before.</p>
            <p>There now remains those of the <hi>Modern,</hi> whereof <hi>Luckius</hi> is
one of the first, who set forth his <hi>Sylloge</hi> of many Illustrious
Persons of the last <hi>Century; Typotius, Molinet</hi> and <hi>Bossier, Medals</hi>
of the <hi>Popes, Cardinals</hi> and Ecclesiasticks; <hi>Iaques de Bie, la France

taken any considerable notice of <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>States</hi> Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to what is wanting, besides the <hi>Abbot Bizot</hi> and his Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuator,
in that of the <hi>Republic</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> by a single instance,
and of which we have already given a large Account. Some
others there may be, but these I suppose may suffice to furnish
the <hi>Metalic Library,</hi> and serve for Direction; in the mean time,
as to the rest, such as travel abroad, will not neglect visiting
the several <hi>Cimeliarcha</hi> and <hi>Repositories</hi> of those Noble Persons
and others, whose Curiosity and Genius has inclin'd them to
to the Cultivation and Adornment of so gentile a Study and
Diversion, taking along with them the Advice and Directions
of the Learned and Industrious <hi>Patin,</hi> (with Sir <hi>George Wheeler</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Spon</hi>'s Voyage into the <hi>Levant</hi>) who has given the
Publick an Account of the Royal <hi>Gazas</hi> and Pricely Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to be any where met with of this kind thro' all <hi>Europe,</hi>
For such Eminent Collectors have been <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth, Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
and indeed all the <hi>German</hi> Emperors since to this Day;
<hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> Queen <hi>Christina</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the late
<hi>Charles</hi> Prince Elector, Prince <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and all of the

<hi>Alexander</hi> his Unkle; the Cardinal <hi>C. Barberini,</hi> the Counts
<hi>Soderini, de Maximis, Mascardi, Morosini,</hi> and <hi>Garzoni; Lazara</hi>

learned Person in <hi>Italy,</hi> who have to their <hi>Libraries,</hi> Cabinets
richly furnished with <hi>Medals</hi> and the like Antiquities. So in
<hi>France,</hi> especially among the great Officers and Ministers of
State, not for Ostentation, but some of them as Knowing as
Curious; such as <hi>Lomenie,</hi> Count <hi>de Brienne</hi> Secretary of State,
<hi>Harlaeus</hi> Procurator General, Chancellor <hi>Seguire,</hi> the late Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Colbert,</hi> the <hi>Abbe Seguin,</hi> with others innumerable, which
has caused the <hi>French</hi> King (who is doubtless Master of the
greatest and best Collection of <hi>Medals</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi>) among other
his <hi>indeed</hi> laudable Munificences for the encouragement and
promoting of Letters, to erect an <hi>Academy</hi> where the <hi>Medalists,

            <p>Now albeit among our own Country-men we are but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thin of <hi>Writers</hi> on this part of <hi>Erudition;</hi> yet had we,
and still have many Worthy and Illustrious Persons both Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Earl Marshal of <hi>England</hi> (that Great <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of all the politer

in the steps of that Illustrious Person, is still augmenting the
unvaluable Treasure of <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> obliging the
Learned World by his Generous Communication of what has
been so left, and is so improv'd by him. What singular Use
our Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> (whom next I am to mention) made of
his Collection,<note place="margin">Notae ad Brit. Numis.s</note> to justify and adorn his <hi>Britannia,</hi> is to be seen
every where in that Glorious Work, as also in that of Mr. <hi>Speed.</hi>
Add to these Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> and <hi>Spelman,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon d Ewes,</hi> our
Learned <hi>Selden,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Marsham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Greaves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>

And that even the <hi>Ladys</hi> may not be defrauded of the Honor
due to the Favourers of this Noble Diversion, the Lady <hi>Ann
Boynton</hi> (Daughter to <hi>Iohn</hi> late Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi>) who I am
told, has not only made a Curious <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Medals,</hi> but is
herself very Knowing in them.</p>
            <p>There are doubtless many others whom I have not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of being known to, and should have enrich'd this <hi>Catalogue</hi>
with their Names and Merits; always reserving a more distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Recognition, with infinite and particular Obligation
to the present <hi>Earl</hi> of CLARENDON, whose most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>Collection</hi> of the most Noble <hi>Medals,</hi> and Glorious <hi>Medalions,</hi>
both for Number and Choice (together with what of <hi>Modern</hi>
he has contributed to the <hi>Type</hi> here exhibited) is worthy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reckoned amongst the most <hi>Illustrious,</hi> and his Lordship
for many other singular Favours, to be ever mentioned by me
with the greatest Regard.</p>
            <p>Nor may I (on this account) forget Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi> of the
<hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> without signal Ingratitude and want of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who has (besides a Glorious Collection and Universal
<hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Rarest Medals</hi>) a Cabinet of other Natural and
Artificial Curiosities, far exceeding for Choice and Perfection
any that I have met withal <hi>Abroad,</hi> or believe will easily be
found in <hi>Europe</hi> besides. To which let me add, not only his
extraordinary Knowledge of the <hi>Treasure</hi> he possesses, but the
Obligingness and great Civility of a most Generous Person.</p>
            <p>I conclude this <hi>Recension</hi> where indeed I ought to have begun,
when I mention'd the Great and most Illustrious Persons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(emulating the most celebrated Cabinets of the Greatest
<hi>Princes</hi> of other <hi>Countries</hi>) namely, that <hi>Royal Collection</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, begun by that Magnanimous and Hopeful
Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and exceedingly augmented and improved by his
Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> from the Testimony of his own
Learned Library-keeper <hi>Patrick Iunius</hi> (in his <hi>Notes</hi> on

To which add,<note place="margin">Car. Patin Famil. Rom.</note> that of another Learned <hi>Medalist, Carolus Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

               <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> but even since, thro' the Negligence of others, is
of deplorable Consideration; if any hopes yet remain of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival
again to some tolerable degree of Lustre and Repair, we
must be oblig'd to the indefatigable Industry of the late Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor,
the obliging and universally Learned (whilst he lived
my excellent Friend) and lately deceas'd Monsieur <hi>Iustel;</hi> and
from hence forward to the no less accomplish'd (in all solid
Learning and severer Studies) Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> his worthy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</p>
            <p>This for the <hi>Books</hi> and Manuscripts, among which there are
still many Choice and Inestimable Volumes, besides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and Venerable <hi>Alexandrian Greek Bible</hi> of <hi>St. Tecla;</hi> but
the <hi>Medals</hi> have been taken away and purloin'd by <hi>Thousands,</hi>
and irrecoverable. Their late Majesties had yet a very rich
and ample <hi>Collection,</hi> which I well remember were put in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Methodiz'd by Mr. <hi>Ashmole,</hi> soon after the Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, which I hope, and presume
may be still in being and to be recovered.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore reproach our Country, look or speak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisingly
of <hi>Medals</hi> (those <hi>Immortales Chartae</hi> and <hi>Perennial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi>)
<hi>as Pieces of Canker'd Brass</hi> and <hi>Rusty <hi>Copper,</hi> without</hi>
that Regard and Veneration due to Antiquity, and what the
greatest <hi>Emperors, Kings</hi> and Famous Persons, Knowing and
Learned Men have honour'd and cultivated with so much Cost
and Industry for the Public Good: But (as of old, those who
could shew the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Busts</hi> of Renowned Ancestors) let
us rather call the Lovers and Improvers of this so Noble Study
(and with as much Right) <hi>Homines multarum In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iginum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reproach, and being brought upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>And now in the last place something should be said concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Ranging, Marshalling</hi> and <hi>Placing</hi> of this
Learned Treasure.</p>
            <p>In Order to this, one may consider the several Sizes and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes;
those of the <hi>Grand Bronze</hi> or <hi>Maximi Moduli</hi> ever in the
first place, as excelling all the rest for the Excellency of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and Historical <hi>Reverse;</hi> among which some yet thrust in
those of a less Size, and on the contrary (according as they Fancy)
ranging the larger among the <hi>Medii aeris</hi> for the sake of a rare
<hi>Otho, Antoninus,</hi> a <hi>Drusus</hi> or <hi>Germanicus;</hi> every <hi>Size</hi> deriving its
Estimation from the Learning and Instruction of the <hi>Reverse,</hi>
preferable to the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Effigies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:61438:129"/>
Those of the second and next Model, take the next place as
much more fruitful in variety of <hi>Reverses, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
&amp;c. than those of the first; and those of the very least Size,
have their peculiar Value, as they greatly serve to supply the
<hi>Chasms</hi> and <hi>Interstices</hi> of the other two, especially of the lower
Empire.</p>
            <p>A Series of the first Volume in <hi>aere magno</hi> (as we long since
noted) hardly reaches below <hi>Posthumus,</hi> and such as do are
exceeding Rare, and as meanly wrought: But of the second
Model, the Collection is not difficult, even as low as to the
lowest <hi>Occidental Roman Empire,</hi> and Oriental <hi>Paleologues,</hi> or
as far as down to <hi>Heraclius;</hi> not but that there were more <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
of them, but that Men did not care to enquire after things
so wretchedly design'd.</p>
            <p>A consequence of the small Copper and <hi>minimae formae,</hi> is
yet more common and easily procur'd to furnish the lower Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
even to the last of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but from <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
where usually they did begin (namely to the <hi>Posthumi</hi>) 'tis hard
to compleat a <hi>Series,</hi> and in a manner, impossible from <hi>Theodosius</hi>
to the <hi>Palaeologi,</hi> without a mixture of <hi>Gold, Silver</hi> and some <hi>ex
aere Medio:</hi> In short, were it to be compassed, one should
chuse not to mingle <hi>Sizes,</hi> or indeed any that were of different
<hi>Metal.</hi> But this is a Curiosity for Great <hi>Princes</hi> to accomplish,
and that with Difficulty too, as well as Charge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advisable to aim rather at a <hi>Series</hi> of either <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
by themselves, and of what <hi>Metal</hi> soever in case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
with these Insertions as occasion offers, and take them as
they come to hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> is common in all Volumes and Sizes, so the <hi>Colonies</hi>
in the <hi>middle Bronze</hi> (for they struck no <hi>Medalions</hi>) and are
with others rare in the <hi>Greater;</hi> and thus assisted by them all, a
Curious and Industrious Person may be Master of a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Cabinet of <hi>Medals,</hi> without any considerable Interruption
from the Period of that Glorious and Renowned <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
by the ambitious <hi>Iulius,</hi> to almost the present Age, and Justify
the History of near <hi>Two Thousand Years,</hi> which is more than
any profane <hi>Historian</hi> or good Author extant, pretends to do
upon the score of his own Authority.</p>
            <p>You now will ask, in what <hi>Method</hi> it were best to place this
Learned and Venerable Assembly? Doubtless, the most <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
according to their <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> beginning with
<hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:61438:129"/>
Now <hi>Heads</hi> (as our Authors shew) may be considered
under <hi>Five</hi> Capacities. As first, <hi>Kings, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> in
general or particular, of which we have given us the History
of some, and of their Successors, as in that Excellent Account
of the <hi>Seleucian</hi> Potentates by Monsieur <hi>Vaillant:</hi> Under this
Head come in others of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and even of the <hi>Iews, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,
Punic, Parthian, Armenian, Arabs, Spanish, French, Goths</hi>
and <hi>Barbariaus,</hi> all of them useful for Illustration in their
turns.</p>
            <p>After these the <hi>Cities, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> also, as well before as
after the Foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to the number of
above two Hundred only <hi>Greek:</hi> Here enter those <hi>Colonies</hi> and
<hi>Municipia</hi> which give such Light to the antient <hi>Geography.
Golzius,</hi> the above, named <hi>Vaillant,</hi> and especially the very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hardovin</hi> on <hi>Pliny</hi> may be consulted, who gives us this
Note; That the <hi>Heads</hi> upon these <hi>Medals</hi> (for some have none
at all) are either the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Place, or some <hi>Deity</hi> which
they had in Veneration there; but of this I think, I have spoken
already.</p>
            <p>Under the Third <hi>Head</hi> are ranked the <hi>Consular</hi> or <hi>Roman
Families,</hi> of which there be at present 1500 <hi>Medals.</hi> The
<hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Roma,</hi> some <hi>Deity</hi> or <hi>Charrioted Victory</hi> on the <hi>Reverse,</hi>
did first appear upon their <hi>Money.</hi> But after these (which are
not considerable for their Erudition) entred the <hi>Monyers</hi> and
their Relations who took their Liberty, as did the <hi>Triumvirs</hi>
and others, to stamp what they pleased without control, until
<hi>Iulius</hi> as we shewed, put an end to their freedom and antient
Government, and set his own <hi>Effigies</hi> on the <hi>Coin.</hi> Here our
Collector may have recourse to <hi>Ursinus</hi> and his Continuator
Dr. <hi>Patin,</hi> who marshals them <hi>Alphabetically.</hi> Whatever else
the number of these may be, there are counted a Thousand of
Silver only.</p>
            <p>Next these come the <hi>Imperial,</hi> especially from the first <hi>Caesar</hi>
as far as to the <hi>thirty Tyrants,</hi> thence to <hi>Constantine,</hi> and down
even to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> decaying in <hi>Sculpture</hi> with the decadence of
the <hi>Empire:</hi> For these see <hi>Occo</hi> improv'd by Count <hi>Mezzabarba.</hi>
Noting, that they may be continued with both the <hi>Orient</hi> and
<hi>Occidental</hi> Emperors, almost to the present, amounting to a vast
number. Last of all succeeded the <hi>Deities</hi> in <hi>Head, Bust</hi> and
whole Figures with their proper <hi>Symbols</hi> and Attributes, and
these followed by the <hi>Heros, Heroines,</hi> and other Brave and
Renowned Persons <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> accompanied by the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61438:130"/>
Famous <hi>Legislators, Philosophers, Mathematicians, Physicians, Poets,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>In seating them according to their <hi>Reverses</hi> (which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the most Instructive and fullest of Learned Variety) they
appear'd at first as meanly as their <hi>Heads:</hi> But no sooner did
the <hi>Monetaries</hi> and Masters of the <hi>Mint</hi> begin to Illustrate and
Adorn their <hi>Medals</hi> with their own Exploits (as sometimes)
or of their Ancestors and Relations; but the <hi>Reverses</hi> became
considerable, and sought after by the Curious <hi>Antiquary,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as afterwards the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors themselves and
their Flatterers caused to be Ingraven and Stamped with utmost
Art, expressing the most signal Actions and Passages of their
Lives, to the great Advantage of the Learned.</p>
            <p>Now these may be ranged either as they belong to their
respective <hi>Emperors,</hi> according to order of time discoverable
by the <hi>Consulate</hi> or <hi>Tribune;</hi> or as <hi>Oiselius</hi> has perhaps by a better
method plac'd them, and more agreeably as they suit in some
peculiar Curiosity and Variety of Subject.</p>
            <p>The Author whom last we named, in his <hi>Selectorum Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mismatum
Antiquorum Thesaurus</hi> (by way of <hi>Adversaria</hi> and
Common Place) seems to have taken in and comprehended all
in a very useful <hi>Sylloge,</hi> from <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> down to <hi>Constantine</hi>
the <hi>Great,</hi> for the ready and expeditious finding out the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
and most useful part of the <hi>Reverses</hi> under <hi>Ten Localities,</hi>
which I conceive may suffice,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. The</hi> Heads <hi>of the</hi> Emperors. <hi>II.</hi> Reverses <hi>of</hi> Regions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
Cities, Colonies, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c. for</hi> Geographical <hi>Light.
III.</hi> Deities <hi>and</hi> Genius<hi>'s. IV.</hi> Virtues, Moral, Symbols <hi>and</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems.

Utensils <hi>and thing belonging to</hi> Religion. <hi>X.</hi> Miscellanies
that cannot so aptly be placed under any of these Chapters.</p>
            <p>I conclude with the <hi>Specimen</hi> of Monsieur <hi>Morelle,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may appear more agreeable, by placing them according
to their several <hi>Sizes,</hi> and which doubtless is most Beautiful,
I say not the most Instructive without some proper <hi>Index.</hi>
For this, see what he has exhibited in <hi>Sixteen Tables.</hi> Lastly,
what I have lately been shewed of Mr. <hi>Wanley</hi>'s Disposition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61438:130"/>
for the <hi>Medals</hi> belonging to the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> I cannot but much commend as very comprehensive
and Ingenious.</p>
            <p>Thus, or by any other <hi>Method</hi> prescribed by Learned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalists,</hi>
a Collection may be ranged and usefully disposed of
for the prompt and easy finding out what one has at any time
occasion for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi>'s Cabinet of <hi>Medals</hi> (who has doubtless
one of the very best and most glorious Collections in the
World) consists of no fewer than <hi>Twenty Thousand,</hi> which yet
is no such mighty Boast, compared to what <hi>Peter de Medices</hi>
had collected an Age since, which as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> tells us,
amounted to an <hi>Hundred Thousand</hi> of all the <hi>Metals,</hi> all which
he yet lost at once, when he was Banished. Nay, and <hi>Scaliger</hi>
says, <hi>Gorlaeus</hi> (a very ordinary Man, and far from being a <hi>Prince</hi>)
had above <hi>Thirty Thousand</hi> rare <hi>Medals,</hi> whereof above <hi>Four
Thousand</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> which exceeded the <hi>French-King</hi>'s Collection
by <hi>Ten Thousand.</hi> They are ranked according to the Dates,
and kept in Cabinets of <hi>Cedar,</hi> the Drawers elegantly Gilt and
Titled: Nor are his very <hi>Counters</hi> (which concern any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Notice relating to <hi>History,</hi> as many do) neglected, or
deemed unworthy of a distinct Repository.</p>
            <p>It will not I suppose be necessary (after all that has been
said) to acquaint the Lovers of this sort of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
some competent Knowledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
Tongues is to the Studious, and those who would indeed be
profound in this Noble Science; tho' (to discourage no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Ingenious Person) we find by <hi>Hub. Golzius,</hi> and the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Gorlaeus</hi> (both ignorant of either Tongue) how far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Industry, Affection, and Application may attain to and
arrive. To this appertains likewise some Skill in the antient
<hi>Geography, History, Chronology,</hi> Pagan <hi>Mythology;</hi> Assistant to which
of the Modern, may <hi>Rhodiginus, Rosinus, Ortelius</hi> be; <hi>Panci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollus</hi>'s
<hi>Notitia, Caesar Ripa</hi>'s <hi>Iconologia,</hi> and such as Treat of the
Images of the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> with other Subsidiaries.</p>
            <p>But I have now done as soon as I have shewed you how to
prevent the often handling of your choicest <hi>Medals,</hi> as well as
to facilitate the taking any of them out of their respective <hi>Nests</hi>
and <hi>Localities</hi> (in which they are placed) by what I observed
of Mr. <hi>Charleton</hi>'s, who has very Ingeniously fasten'd one end
of a small and narrow Label of <hi>Velume,</hi> or piece of <hi>Ribbon</hi> to
the bottom of every <hi>Nich,</hi> so far under the <hi>Medal,</hi> as that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61438:131"/>
taking up the loose end of the Parchment or Ribbon (which is
purposely left to appear a little beyond the edge of the <hi>Nest</hi>)
one easily raises up the <hi>Medal,</hi> so as either to see the <hi>Reverse</hi> or
<hi>Head,</hi> or take it quite out without pinching or digging it forth
with one's Nails, which is inconvenient, and often sullies it.
Upon every such <hi>Label,</hi> there is also (as I remember) noted
with a Pen, what <hi>Medal</hi> it is, which being extreamly neat and
ready, I recommend for others imitation.</p>
            <p>I had propos'd to conclude this Institution with a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
(by way of <hi>Specimen</hi>) of both Antient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman
Medals,</hi> for the Ease and Benefit of <hi>Tyros,</hi> and such as are not
yet accustomed, and so ready to Decipher their <hi>Inscriptions</hi> after
the Method of Monsieur <hi>Baudelot,</hi> beginning with the <hi>Roman,</hi>
and (after the <hi>Consular</hi>) with him, to whom after the decretal
Battel at <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> permitted the Dignity of having
the Victor's <hi>Effigies</hi> stamped on his Coin, and which (as we
Read) render'd his own <hi>Sacred,</hi> and was indeed the most tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Mark of Honor they could flatter him withal. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self prevented by that large and useful Account which
Mr. <hi>Obed. Walker</hi> has already published; I wholly omit it, with
the Addition only of those who succeeded <hi>Iovianus</hi> (where
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has left off) who, tho' nothing so considerable as
his Predecessor Emperors; yet since to assist that Collection,
some may happly desire an Account of such as follow'd (and
that there was any sort of Civility or tolerable Art remaining)
I shall recite them down to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> which happen'd to be
about the Second <hi>Century</hi> from <hi>Valens,</hi> the Seventy Third <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
about the Year 364 after the <hi>Incarnation.</hi>

            <p>For after this, there's little worth Collecting, or at least very
rarely; tho' now and then, and by Chance, one may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
light upon something which may serve to explain
and fill up some part of later <hi>History</hi> in those dark Ages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
which will best be discovered by the Fabric of the
<hi>Medal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I have but a Word to add before I come to
<hi>FINIS:</hi> And it is the Earnest Recommending to such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

and other Rare and Curious <hi>Antiquities,</hi> Collections and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Treasure of Princes and Great Men (such as were King
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> the illustrious Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the rest
we have named) the Entertaining of some Learned and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Person, who with the <hi>Library</hi> might have the Charge and
Keeping of their <hi>Cabinets, Nummi Phylacia,</hi> and <hi>Curiosities</hi>
of this Nature, and be qualified to Discourse pertinently upon,
as well as shew them to Learned Strangers and others, whom
the Fame of such Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ities may invite with a Decency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Learned Men; and not (as too usually) leave and
abandon them to the Custody of a <hi>Valet-de-Chambre,</hi> or some
Ignorant <hi>Mercenary,</hi> who knows neither how to Value, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
or shew them as they ought, and to the Credit and
Honor of their <hi>Masters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were this reformed, we should then, as in <hi>Italy, France,
Germany,</hi> (and other Polite and Learned Nations) have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Catalogues</hi> of what were most <hi>Rare</hi> yet extant, and
in being of <hi>Antient</hi> and Useful <hi>Erudition,</hi> derivable from
these Precious <hi>Remains</hi> in the <hi>Cabinets</hi> and <hi>Archives</hi> of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and of which the Learned <hi>Keepers</hi> of such <hi>Repositories</hi>
would give Notice, and Exercise their Talents by publishing
something of Use and Advantage to the <hi>Republic</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> as
so many <hi>Antiquaries</hi> and Knowing Persons have done Abroad
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61438:133"/>
to the Honor of their Countries (spreading the Reputations
of those Generous and Noble Persons to whom they belong)
for the Benefit of the Learned World, and not keep them so
wholly to themselves, as few or none are the better for
them.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Heads and Effigies in Prints and Taille-douce:
Their Vse as they Relate to Medals.</head>
            <p>I Have for these many Years been much importuned, and
by many, to Publish a second and more ample Edition
of my <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Chalcography,</hi> which indeed (being the very
first of that Subject, written that I know of in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
I might have exceedingly and usefully Improved:
But having of a long time given over these Diversions, I
cannot now oblige the Curious with any considerable Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to my own Collection: The Lovers of <hi>Taille-douce</hi>
may yet find wherewith to satisfy the utmost Curiosity, by
consulting that large and ample Catalogue which has been
published (since mine) of what the late Abbot <hi>Maroles</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with to the <hi>French</hi> King some Years since, and which
are now in his Library at <hi>Paris</hi> in divers large Folios, to the
Value of many Thousand Crowns.</p>
            <p>Nor perhaps would it at all be difficult to add what may
have since been set forth worthy the Collecting by our best
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61438:133"/>
Artists and Ingravers, especially in <hi>Mezzo Tinto</hi> (as they call
it) of which I gave the first intimation to the World, and
which is now arrived to that height of perfection for its tender
and delicate touch, as does sometimes contend with, and not
seldom seem to exceed the Pencil of the most Excellent <hi>Minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Chair-'Oscuro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which I would chiefly bespeak to the Curious of
<hi>Prints,</hi> should amongst the rest be a Collection of the <hi>Heads</hi>
and <hi>Effigies</hi> of Famous and Illustrious Persons, such as were
either done Originally from the Life, or from the best Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that were so; and I do in particular recommend it to the
Studious of <hi>Medals,</hi> as what may in great Part, and with no
great Expence, supply what one cannot hope to procure and
obtain in more rich and lasting Materials; as also in as much
as besides the <hi>Heads</hi> and Pourtraits, they seldom or never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
without Inscriptions of the Names, Qualities, Virtues,
most signal Works and Actions of the Persons whom they
represent, which makes up the defect of <hi>Reverses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Order to this, I had taken the Pains of Collecting the
Names of the most Renowned, Famous and Illustrious of our
own, and other Nations worthy the Honor of <hi>Medal,</hi> or at least
of some Memory, as might in any sort upon one occasion or
other, possibly contribute to the History of the Times and
Persons under the Titles of</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scholars</hi> and <hi>Divines; Historians, Chronologers; Antiquaries, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians,
Grammarians; Critics, Orators, Poets,</hi> and extraordinary
<hi>Wits; Philologers, Philosophers; Physicians</hi> and <hi>Naturalists; Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
Botanists; Mathematicians, Musicians; Iuris-Consults</hi> and
<hi>Lawyers;</hi> Great <hi>Travellers</hi> and <hi>Discoverers;</hi> Worthy <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;</hi>
Persons Famous, or Pretenders to Curious Arts; <hi>Painters,
Sculptors</hi> and <hi>Mechanitians</hi> of all Sorts; <hi>Sectaries, Enthusiasts,
Impostors, Conspirators;</hi> bold <hi>Usurpers</hi> and Famous for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
<hi>Villany</hi> of either Sex, Virtuous, Learned or Lewd; <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians,
Mountebanks, Iuglers</hi> and other Persons Remarkable
for any Extraordinary Accident of <hi>Age, Stature, Strength, Shape,</hi>
&amp;c. but especially (and which indeed I should have named
in the first place) the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Effigies</hi> of <hi>Emperors, Kings,
Princes</hi> and other renowned Persons, conspicuous for their
Birth, Title, Courage, Counsel and Policy, or any Famous and
Heroic Exploits by Sea or Land; in Church or State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which amounted to a very considerable number of Prints,
well chosen and properly dispos'd of in <hi>this,</hi> or some other
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61438:134"/>
Method, and in Books; to which might be farther added, short
Notes pertinent to the Persons.</p>
            <p>Whilst I am on this <hi>Topic</hi> (and for Reasons hereafter not to
be contemn'd) give me leave to call over the Names of some
of those Famous and Illustrious Persons, both of our own and
other Nations, as I had Collected them for the Design I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;

Reproach or insnaring Vows; tho' under such Restraint and
Religious Rules, as could not but have been approved by the
most averse to <hi>Popery</hi> or Superstition, and as I have heard, is
at this Day practised amongst the <hi>Evangelical Churches</hi> in
<hi>Germany.</hi> And what should still forbid us to promote the
same Example, and begin such Foundations, I am to learn
more solid Reasons for, than any I confess, as yet I have. But
whilst I am speaking of the Ladies,</p>

<hi>Nicolas Barbadicius,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Trevisanus,</hi> who so Nobly
contended to die for one another. To whom add, <hi>Ioannes de

Ohm</hi> of <hi>Rhenish.</hi> And now we speak of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Boars,</hi>
I read of a <hi>Boor</hi> or Country-Fellow of that Nation, who upon
a Wager, devoured an entire <hi>Hog,</hi> Entrails and all, raw and
alive, beginning at the Tail. Other <hi>Athletic</hi> and <hi>Gigantic</hi> Men

<hi>Barbara</hi> the hairy Maid, whose Picture we have from
the Life by <hi>Hollar,</hi> and the <hi>Cornuted</hi> Woman; the little <hi>Manikin</hi>

this Class belong extraordinary <hi>Zanis</hi> and <hi>Farcers, Scaramuccios,
Trivelin, Harlequin, Pulchinello</hi> and such as excel in slight of
hand; the late Famous <hi>Funamble Turk, Iack-Adams,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch-Woman</hi>
Tumbler; by no means forgetting our late <hi>Proteus Clark,</hi>
who tho' gross enough of Body, was of so flexible and subtile
a Texture, as to contort his Members into several disfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to put out of joynt almost any Bone or <hi>Vertebra</hi> of
his Body, and to re-place it again. Lastly, <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>German,</hi>

(witness <hi>De Cartes, Salmasius, Blondel, Bochartus, Vossius</hi>

Talents to be celebrated here especially, both for her Glorious

Skilful; <hi>Donna Maria Zaxas;</hi> Madam <hi>Guillaum,</hi> who has

               <p>We would now bring up this glorious Proceeding with

this last, has newly been proposed, and admitted Solemnly
into the <hi>Academy</hi> of the <hi>Ricovrati</hi> of <hi>Padoa:</hi> I say, I would
close this (tho' long) shining <hi>Paragraph,</hi> with this diverting
and extraordinary Wit; but for <hi>Mademoiselle d'Acier</hi> (Daughter

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61438:149"/>
her, <hi>feminarum quot sunt, quot fuere doctissima</hi>) worthily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
her from any, I suppose, this Age is likely to produce
among her bright Sex; not for incapacity of either equaling,
or exceeding her; but for want of Application.</p>
               <p>Not but as Foils to set them off, and make them shine in
greater Lustre, should I so much as vouchsafe to name the
wanton <hi>Sempronia,</hi> the debauched <hi>Thais,</hi> the amorous <hi>Sappho,</hi>
the shrew <hi>Zantippe, Iane</hi> Queen of <hi>Naples;</hi> no, not the most

Thalestris,</hi> who went so far to Court the Great <hi>Alexander;
Artemisia, Penthesilea, Hippolita, Semiramis, Theomiris, Cleopatra,</hi> &amp;c.
tho' I could be content to posses any true <hi>Medal</hi> of the Chast
<hi>Penelope, Lucretia, Marpessa, Clelia;</hi> much more of <hi>Debora, Iael,
Iudith, Susanna;</hi> the Magnificent Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
so far a Country to hear the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon;</hi> the
Prophetic <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and the rest of those Sacred <hi>Heroines;</hi> not
forgetting the Famous <hi>Alcestis, Clara Cerveda, Petrarch</hi>'s beloved
<hi>Laura, Valdura, Hildegardis, Irene,</hi> and such as like these, have
excelled in Conjugal Love and Affection. I have seen a good
Picture of <hi>Catharine de Boren</hi> Wife of the Famous <hi>Luther,</hi> for
whom she left her <hi>Sanctimonia; Medals</hi> there are more than
enough of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> (tho' one exactly resembling were
inestimable) St. <hi>Ann</hi> her Mother; of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and other
Scripture Saints, pretended to be copied from Originals, painted
by St. <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> by those who have a mind to be
deceived. Lastly, Of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi>'s Head, there were
many Coined during the <hi>Bas Empire;</hi> until <hi>Isaac Comnenus</hi> left
it off, for which <hi>Zonarus</hi> is much displeased: But of this enough.
Those who would enlarge, and amplify this Catalogue with
more Illustrious Names, Persons, and their Characters, may
turn over <hi>Plutarch, Laertius, Paulus Iovius, Thevet, Gesner, Philip

<hi>Leland, Balaeus</hi> and <hi>Pits</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Biographers</hi>
Antient and Modern, and yet perhaps not find such an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</p>
               <p>And now I confess it may be wonder'd, why I should call
over so extravagant a List of <hi>Names,</hi> and what my meaning
is? since it were madness but to fancy that there should be
found <hi>Medals</hi> of the hundredth part of all this <hi>Bead-roll;</hi> or
that after all this, I would prostitute the Dignity of <hi>Medal</hi> (so
much celebrated) with the <hi>Effigies</hi> of every rich Clown, or
impertinent, who was able to be at the Charges of a <hi>Stamp;</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:61438:149"/>
tho' I find (as <hi>Damasippus</hi>) they did of old <hi>insanire veters statuas
emendo</hi> and were universally so ambitious of <hi>Inscriptions,</hi> that they
set them up, and left their <hi>Marble Titles</hi> in every Corner; as at this
day upon the Marriage, Birth of Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every <hi>Brewer,</hi> rich
<hi>Burgher</hi> and even <hi>Mechanic</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> usually strikes a <hi>Medal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer, my Meaning is very far from it; but by
this <hi>Recension,</hi> I endeavour to point out, how some of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
signal for any Thing or Action extraordinary, and
that possibly may enter into any part of History, may at some
time, or upon some occasion or other, fetch Matter and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
proper for Use, out of an universal Stock of <hi>Medals</hi> and
<hi>Stamps,</hi> tho' they be not all <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Reverses</hi> of <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let my Reader therefore know, that it is for their sakes who
are making <hi>Collections</hi> of <hi>Prints</hi> in <hi>Taille douce,</hi> and would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
themselves with the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Pourtraits</hi> of Famous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which in <hi>Medals</hi> they never hope to obtain.</p>
               <p>The great Amasser of this innocent and useful Curiosity

               <p>Next to this Curious Man, <hi>Cornelius Beughen,</hi> has (upon a like

an Account of them, and of the Excellent Order he has marshal'd
them in, with this Introduction as it relates to <hi>Medals:</hi>

non meum erit haec multis Encomiis referre, quippe qui in praesens,
non Oratorem sed Collectorem agere constitui,</hi> &amp;c. Doubtless, says he,
the Images and Pourtraits of Persons Famous, and Conspicuous as
well for Arms, as Arts, do not a little contribute to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and Understanding of <hi>Medals</hi> and good <hi>History:</hi> How

               <p>To these add <hi>Lorenzo Crasso, Galeazzo, Gualdo Priorato, Boissardi

in those above named, the <hi>Effigies</hi> of all the Learned, as well

has in <hi>Taille-douce,</hi> the Pourtraits of the Twelve <hi>Roman Caesars,</hi>
together with many of their Relations; and with great accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness,

But above all (besides what is already published of <hi>Leonardus

Curious may expect, from the Incomparable <hi>Gronovius,</hi> of the
Heads, and Effigies of the most Illustrious <hi>Greeks,</hi> possibly to be

Engraven with their <hi>Elogies,</hi> and that from the best Originals
he can any where procure; and gets many to be designed and
drawn by Stealth, and Privately, from several to whom he is
not known, and that know nothing of his intended Work; as
in particular, the <hi>Effigies</hi> of the so much talked of <hi>Varillas,</hi>
who would never suffer his Picture to be taken, ashamed
perhaps to shew his Face to the World, which he has egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
abused by his <hi>Romantic</hi> Histories and Mercenary Pen;
as the late more worthy Monsieur <hi>Menagius</hi> acquaints us, whose
Pourtrait, with abundance of other Learned Men, we shortly
may expect; together with the two pompous <hi>Folios,</hi> said to be
already finished by Monsieur <hi>Perault,</hi> upon a like design.</p>
               <p>Among those of our Nation that have made this any part
of their search, and for the same purposes, I know of none

the mean Proportion (as in all things else) is best.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Fore-head,</hi> that <hi>Templum Pudoris</hi> (and as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls

above the rest; that tho' the common saying be <hi>Fronti

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61438:152"/>
than from the structure, and shape of the <hi>Fore-head;</hi>
that it being too much swelling, fleshy and <hi>Ox</hi>-like, it betokens
Hebetude; the lean more Subtilty; the over-narrow, Indocile;
the too round, Unsteady; the convex and <hi>Asinine,</hi> Folly; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
Effeminate; the square and ample <hi>Lion</hi>-like, Courage:

like a <hi>Dog</hi>'s, for Sagacity above others; and that such
was <hi>Plato</hi>'s, a little Gibbous before, and behind moderately
pressed towards the Ears, and rather oblong than round; and
that so was <hi>Pericles</hi> Dog-headed and never the worse; that

            <p>But speaking here of <hi>Dogs,</hi> and their Capacity by the various
Structure of their Heads (applicable on this occasion) brings
to mind what I have sometimes heard from the Mouth of the
late <hi>Queen</hi> (Mother to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>) who exceedingly
delighting in those <hi>Melitenses</hi> and little <hi>Bolognian Spaniels,</hi> had
made many, not vulgar Observations of them. She had some,
which her Majesty told me, were stark Fools and Idiots, that
would be taught nothing in comparison with others, which
were wonderful docile and apprehensive; and this she imputed
to the Depressions, which they usually make in their tender
Skulls, by flatting of their Noses when Puppies; in which the
<hi>Ladies</hi> (who have these Animals in <hi>deliciis</hi>) take to consist their
Beauty, tho' in my Opinion, quite the contrary; and sure I
am, it corrupts their Breath, and renders it very unsavory. But
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61438:153"/>
I must go no farther on this familiar Animal; tho' (were it
not foreign to my Discourse of Humane Countenances only) I
have good Authority from <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, who not only
brings in; but all along compares this <hi>Theriologic Physiognomy,</hi>
and resemblance of <hi>Brutes,</hi> to the Heads and Faces of <hi>Men,</hi> as
a secundary part of the Science, and which some extend even
to things inanimate also, by the Doctrine of <hi>Signatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our Conjecture of <hi>Foreheads,</hi> modify'd by the
more conspicuous wrinkles and furrows, which if long ways,
go for a Mark of Eloquence and Judgment; such was <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi>'s, and that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as may be seen in all their <hi>Statues.</hi>
If curv'd and bending, of Wrath and Displeasure. If ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Arch-wise, Pride and Disdain. Over early wrinkles in
Youth, betoken serious Cogitation; to have none at all, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Care and Perturbation; and such is by <hi>Sidonius Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris,</hi>
attributed to the Philosopher <hi>Epicurus.</hi> If the stroaks
decussate and cross one another, a solicitous <hi>Tristitiam.</hi> The
chearful Forehead is <hi>explicit</hi> and smooth, such as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells
us was that of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> always Serene. In a word,
moulding of the Head, like that of a <hi>Ship,</hi> equally built for
Stowage and Sailing, Capacious, and Nimble (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of that Model) is of that vast Importance to the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
and other Abilities; that <hi>Mid Wives,</hi> and <hi>Nurses</hi> are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
admonished and instructed how in their Operations, they

diving into, and discovering the Intentions of Men by their
Countenances, that he could shrewdly guess at the very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of their Negotiation; so as King <hi>Iames</hi> the First
made no small use of that his extraordinary Talent on
the first arrival of Ambassadors at Court. To this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

Seasons and Indications of the present Disposition, and
of the very Will it self; and therefore a number of old, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and crafty Persons, whose Eyes dwell upon the faces

to their own Advantage, as being a main part of their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

there is a great discovery of Dissimulation in another, and a
principal Direction for the chusing of Seasons and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of approaching to Persons; which <hi>(as he observes)</hi> is not
the meanest part of Civil Prudence. But let no Man think
that such a dexterity may somewhat perhaps avail in respect
to some particular Persons, but cannot be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any certain Rule; for we all laugh, and weep, and blush,
and frown much after the same manner; and so for most part
in other more subtle Motions.</q> Thus far my<note n="*" place="margin">

the little <hi>Audectus,</hi> a Child he was so infinitely fond of,
for the Sweetness of his Countenance; but which he never
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61438:157"/>
used to look on without trouble and emotion. This his Lady
taking notice of, with much Importunity, he plainly told her
it would be over-laid, as it unhappily came to pass; tho'to
prevent it, they took it immediately from the <hi>Nurse,</hi> weaned,
and committed it to the Care of a young Maid, in whose
Bosom it was soon after found dead with its Mouth on the

            <p>Now as to Passions and natural Inclinations, there is no doubt
but much may be conjectured, and that upon a <hi>Physical</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as both <hi>Theophrastus, Galen</hi> and others frequently shew;
and therefore the Study of it, especially recommended to those
of their Profession. 'Tis storied of the Famous <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
that one day passing by a brisk young Maid, he saluted her
by the Name of fair <hi>Virgin,</hi> whom meeting again the Morning
after, he bid good morrow <hi>Woman,</hi> discovering by her looks
she had play'd the Wanton, and been vitiated the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But as to these and the like Encounters and Instances of
Prediction, fore telling particular Events, there seems more in
the Artist than one would think should be detected by bare
inspection of the Countenance only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> is indeed very peremptory in what he says of <hi>Cheraea,</hi>
impleading his Client <hi>Roscius,</hi> from what he observed in his
Face: <hi>Nonne ipsum</hi> (says the Orator) <hi>Caput, &amp; supercilia illa

he spied Knave in his very Looks. The like we find him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

say, to be able to tell of future Events, and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
one in his Life, if not beyond the Skill of <hi>Metoposcopie,</hi>
is certainly very Extraordinary; and therefore tho' when we

I might have produced many other Examples, but to shew
that these were not the Observations of <hi>Heathens</hi> only, but of
<hi>Christians</hi> too; and among other, one of the greatest Fathers
of the Church;<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. 2 cont. Gent.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> fore-telling of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<hi>Iulian,</hi> from something remarkable in his Looks and
Meen (which he had observed) what a Plague he should
prove to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Such, 'tis likely were the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
found in the Countenance of the short-Chin'd <hi>Nero,</hi>
and the narrow <hi>Maximinus; Iuba</hi> was cruel; but above all the
Modern, that merciless and truculent <hi>Moscovite, Iohn Basilides,</hi>
described by <hi>Oderborn,</hi> who has published the Life of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Tyrant; and such was the fierce, and austere <hi>Bajazet</hi> the
<hi>First, Tamerlan, Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, much we confess is to be attributed to
Age, Infirmities, cruciating Pains, macerating Studies and Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations;
hard, and bodily Labour; to outward Losses and
Afflictions; inward Remorse, religious Severities; to Want,
Poverty; much to Diet, and other Usages: All of them Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in these Conjectures, and without prejudice to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and worthy Inclinations of many Persons, whose Looks
may seem to bear the Characters of vitious and immoral
Men; when all this while, they spring only from Impressions
caused by unavoidable Accidents; besides such adscititious
Habits, as may possibly be contracted by Institution, Discipline
and Custom: One is therefore first to inquire into the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
Education, Condition, and other Circumstances of their
Lives; before we give hasty Sentence of their Natures and
Dispositions. Every hard-favoured Man should not presently
be concluded a Cruel and Ill-natur'd Person; since the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
even of <hi>Majesty,</hi> and such as create both Love and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
tho' there be something of more reserv'd and less
tender; are yet extreamly different from those of Fierce and
Cruel, as was observed in <hi>Titus Vespasian,</hi> and is seen in the
<hi>Medals and Statues</hi> of <hi>Trajan, Antoninus, Severus;</hi> and in the
Modern Emperors, the two first <hi>Maximilians, Radulphus;</hi> and
more remarkable yet. in the Countenance of our late King
<hi>Charles the Second;</hi> wherein serious Majesty was attemper'd
with such strokes of <hi>Debonaire,</hi> as won Love, and Reverence
from all who approached him, by a certain rare, and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Interposition of qualifying Lines. The same Modifications
of otherwise Stern and Severe, are also plainly conspicuous, and
to be seen in his Brave, and Heroic Grand-father, <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61438:158"/>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> than whom, never were two Princes more
resembling one the other, comparing their Pictures, abating the
<hi>Beard</hi> and <hi>Peruke</hi> only.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported of <hi>Ismael</hi> the <hi>Persian Sophy,</hi> that he had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Marks in his Face, of a Great and Noble Soul, endow'd
with many Virtues, quite contrary to those of <hi>Solyman</hi> the
<hi>Magnificent</hi> (of both which we have seen <hi>Medals</hi> and Pictures)
who had all the Signs of Haughtiness and Cruelty; such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
Strokes, and Figures there are Ingraven in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
For as we have noted in our <hi>Charles,</hi> Majesty does
not consist in a grim and crabbed Look, such as perhaps might
be <hi>Sylla's,</hi>

I confess pleased me.</p>
            <p>And thus have we briefly shewed, how the Proportion,
Harmony, and Discord of Parts, variously configur'd and
dispos'd, give notice of our Inclinations, and support the
Conjectures by frequent Examples. What likewise our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

But when once he began to speak, there was nothing so fluent,

            <p>I met (says <hi>Seneca)</hi> my old School-Fellow <hi>Claranus,</hi> whom
of a long while before I had not seen: I suppose I need not
say an Old Man: But in good Earnest, Spriteful and Vigorous,
striving to get the better of his little Boy. Nature I confess,
has dealt a little unkindly with him, in lodging so great a
Soul in so homely a Cottage, unless perhaps it be to shew
us, that the greatest, and happiest Wit, may lie under any
the coursest out-side. In the mean time, he has overcome all
Impediments, and by vanquishing first himself, triumphs over
all things else; so as methinks he's mistaken who said,
<q>Virtue's more graceful in a beautious Body.</q>
Certainly, she needs no becoming dress, who is an ornament
to herself, and renders her very Body a consecrated Place:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61438:159"/>
Really, I began to look earnestly upon him, and to me he seem'd
as amiable, and upright in Body, as he is in Mind: A great
Man I see, may come forth of a little Hovel, and a bright and
magnanimous Soul, from a mean, and ill-fram'd Body. Thus
Nature seems to bring forth some on purpose, to shew, that
Vertue may be born any where, and that if it were possible to
produce Souls stark naked, she would have done it: She has
now done a greater thing, brought forth some clogg'd with
Body, that yet surmount, and break thro' all impediments:
<hi>Claranus,</hi> I think, was born on purpose to let us know, that
the Soul contracts no sullage from the deformity of the Body;
but on the contrary, that the Body becomes much more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by a fair, and vertuous Soul. So true is that of <hi>Avicen,
Natura supplet ingenio, ubi deficit corpus:</hi> The great Apostle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> is described little of Stature; <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> nay the great
<hi>Alexander.</hi> himself, and his Learned <hi>Praeceptor, Aristotle,</hi> were
but little Men; the innate and vital Spirits, becoming more
close and vigorous (as having a more easy and quick inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by the nearness of the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Brain)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Naturalists observe <hi>Bees, Ants, Spiders</hi> and minutest Insects
to be the most Ingenious.</p>
            <p>Abating for these, and some other Accidents, it must be
confess'd, that the Countenance is not always an infallible
Guide, no more than a gilded, and finely graved Dial-plate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
the Goddess of the Motion, and Contrivance within a
Watch: <hi>Plumbed machara in aurea vagina;</hi> whilst the unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
Pride of <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> was plainly seen thro' his tattered
Mantle. Many who appear like Angels of Light, have cloven
Feet; and such were the <hi>Sirenes,</hi> and <hi>Harpies,</hi> those <hi>Volucres
Puellae</hi> that had <hi>Fishes</hi> Tails, and <hi>Vultures</hi> Tallons. But this
does not prohibit that a great regard should be had to remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Externals, to which <hi>Apuleius</hi> attributes so much; that (as
if some Divinity were to lodge in it) he thought the most
beautiful Youths were to be chosen, as most proper for Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> was in all his Ages from a Child, to his End,
of incomparable Beauty; and so was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<hi>Plutarch</hi> describes to consist of such a charming mixture
of Gravity, and Mansuetude, Serious and Sweet, as no <hi>Painter</hi>
could ever express; and indeed the Charms of Beauty are so
Powerful and attractive, that as <hi>Socrates</hi> calls it, <hi>brevem tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidem;</hi>
so where joyned with Virtue, and Knowledge (as in
some of these it was) it is a transcendent near Perfection,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61438:160"/>
such were <hi>Alexander, Cyrus, Hiero, Scipio Africanus,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi>
of old; Persons (tho' not without their Faults) of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;
and of our latter Age, that <hi>Phoenix</hi> (of perfection
both of Mind and Body) the Illustrious <hi>Picus</hi> Prince of <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula;</hi>
but they are rare. And after all, it has been much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that very beautiful Persons have seldom met with lucky
Destinies; hence the <hi>Tragedian,</hi> in <hi>Hipp. Rara forma Viris (saecula
prospice) Impunita fuit;</hi> of which might be produc'd divers
Instances of our own Country, beside the great Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Son <hi>Francis;</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and
others, of which, see <hi>Muretus, Cantarus,</hi> &amp;c. In the mean
time, where we meet with an ample Head, a spacious Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
a fulness about the Temples; the Eyes, Nose, Mouth,
rather large than contracted; the Features in general Manly,
and Serious, and the rest of the Parts well proportion'd; there
seldom failes a strong, and capacious Memory, solid Judgment,
with a stock of Industry and Prudence, <hi>in rebus agundis.</hi> In a
word, very serious, and thinking Persons, have commonly
serious and composed Looks; and the Light, the Trifling,
and the Wanton, is discovered in the Face, whilst not the
Fair and Effeminate; but <hi>that</hi> the noblest Beauty in Man,
which creates neither Contempt, nor Wonder.</p>

and fewer deform'd than the Plains and Vallies, which
as they are situated low, or near the Marsh, vary both in
Colour, Growth, Shape and Constitution; to Pale, Low,
Fleshy, Weak and Effeminate. <hi>Imperialis</hi> (who of all the
<hi>Peripatetics,</hi> has best discussed this Subject) attributes all to
the degrees of Heat and Cold, Dry and Wet. That in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
hot Countries, the Inhabitants are commonly foolish,
or of no great reach; Heat dissipating the Spirits, as Cold
on the contrary, hinders them from due Motion. Moisture
obnubilates, and condenses Humors, and is inimicous to all
Ingenuity, great and heroic Thoughts: of such Consequence
is the <hi>Clime,</hi> and Situation to the Disposition of a People.
The Sea-Air being warm and dry, thro' the freer Operation
of the Sun-beams, drawing up the cherishing Vapour; the
bordering Dwellers are usually more crafty than others about
them; as was observed of those of <hi>Carthage, Calabria, Sicilia,</hi>
and so generally near the <hi>Southern</hi> Islands, where the Heat is
benigne, and not so intense. Hence, <hi>Insulanos esse malos, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilianos

is over-thickned with Cold, 'tis followed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Effects. In like manner Diet, and Nourishment by
Meats and Drinks is to be consider'd; and therefore great
Care should especially be had of it, as to young Children,
and to the Manners and Disposition of <hi>Nurses.</hi> 'Tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Puppies which have been suckl'd with Milk of Bitch-<hi>Wolves,</hi>
or <hi>Foxes,</hi> become abundantly more fierce, and Crafty
than other Dogs. <hi>Scotus</hi> tells of a Boy, nourished with the
Milk of a <hi>Sow,</hi> that could never be reclaimed from running
into Ditches and dirty Puddles; and of another to whom a
<hi>Goat</hi> gave suck, that instead of walking, was always leaping

and climbing. The Stories of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus, Lycaste,
Parrhasia, Telephus,</hi> &amp;c. are well known, and therefore curious
Hunts-men take great Care, not only of the Breed, but of the
Diet of their youug Whelps; How much more ought we

with horrid Oaths, and Storming where ever their Souldiers
come. In short, that their Humors are so widely different
one from the other; as one would almost question, whether
they issued the same way out of their Mother's Womb: In
a word, that a <hi>French man</hi> is a <hi>Spaniard</hi> Revers'd, turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
outward.</q> And certainly, much of this is true, as to
their natural Temper, resulting from those Causes; whilst ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd
by Arts, and good Education (in both which they are
extreamly happy) no Nation exceeds them for Wit, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Invention, Diligence, and Conduct in Affairs; Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Courtesie, Gallantry and the Noblest Atchievements.</p>
            <p>And thus our <hi>Physiognomones</hi> is throughout, and all along to

how nearly they approach to the Ferity, and other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of those brute Animals, naturally bred among them: But

Mark of his Kindness on our Nation too, for our excessive
Eating and Devouring; tho' our Country he confesses, breeds
no greedy, or Voracious Animal whatsoever: That those of
<hi>Savoy, Swisserland,</hi> and many parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> which abound
in <hi>Foxes,</hi> &amp;c. are the dullest, simplest, and most uncautelous of
all their Neighbours; not considering, as to our Country, that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61438:163"/>
the Plenty, and Hospitable Nature of the <hi>English</hi> above all
other People, deserved a civiler Character; and that tho' there
be not so many <hi>Foxes</hi> in those other Countries, there are <hi>Bears,</hi>
and <hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Wild Boars</hi> among those Stern, tho' less Crafty
Inhabitants he mentions.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that in <hi>Liguria,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> which
rarely breed any <hi>Foxes,</hi> the People are the suttlest, cunning,
and over-reaching in the World; and thinks that Nature or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd

where Trees take but slender, and shallow Roots, or the

all <hi>Italy;</hi> and where the Trees are most profoundly rooted;
magnifying the Steadiness, excellent Temper, and other Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities

Storms; and so the <hi>Circassians, Thracians, Macedonions</hi> and other

cause these pretended Verticities; for that <hi>ex mistione fit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi>

            <p>Nor is it all this while to be understood, that where ever
we observe any eminent Resemblance of an exotic Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
(suppose an acuminate Head, narrow Eye, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Fore-head) the Person must needs be as subtle as a
<hi>Genoeze;</hi> since with us the copped Pate is look'd on as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Sign, or foolish, and faithless as the <hi>Negro,</hi> because the
Nose is flat; or that the <hi>Eagle</hi>-shap'd, and <hi>Persian</hi>-nos'd are
all of them <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s and alike magnanimous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> since we
every day find Persons of the most unpromising Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
Men of extraordinary Talents, and no less Virtuous,
as has been instanc'd in <hi>Claranus. Diogenes</hi> says, <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had narrow Eyes, and no very advantageous Looks; and
others, that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Head was of the smallest Size, supported
with a long and slender Neck. But of the Wise <hi>Socrates</hi>
'tis said, that People could hardly forbear laughing in his Face,
he was of so odd a Figure; <hi>Simis naribus, recalva fronte, pilosis
humeris, &amp; repandis cruribus,</hi> as St. <hi>Herom</hi> describes him. And
so others of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whose Pictures hung in the

               <hi>Prytaneum</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> with <hi>Aratus, Zeno, Epicurus, Xenophon,
Chrysippus, Cleanthes,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Sidonius</hi> reports. This as to the
Person; but what is meant here is to shew, that every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has for the most part, certain evident Characters, and
Impressions on their Countenance, by which they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable
from others, peculiar to, and generally reigning
among them, which frequently dispose them to those
different <hi>Pathemata,</hi> and Inclinations we have spoken of. In
a word, so various, and uncertain are the Effects of <hi>Climats,</hi>
that 'tis observed, People of the same Latitude and Distance
from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> nay even of the same City, as the Ground

make them governable. And no doubt, <hi>Alpestral,</hi> hilly, and
barren Countries, obnoxious to cold and turbulent Winds,
hardening fierce People, gives them great advantage over those
who being bred in the rich, more benign, and milder Climes,
are more dispos'd to Ease and Luxury, which renders them
unactive and effeminate, and fitter for the Study of Arts and
Sciences, than for Arms and painful Expeditions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seldom make they any Conquests which they hold. Thus
<hi>Philosophy, Mathematics,</hi> and contemplative Studies first began,
and came to us from the warm, and more Southern <hi>East.
Mechanical</hi> Inventions, and such as require more Patience, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Application, than Speculation, flourish among the
<hi>Germans,</hi> and Northern Climes; whilst the depths of Policy,
<hi>Iurisprudence, Eloquence, Oratory, Logic,</hi> and the Arts of Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61438:165"/>
(by which the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Demagogues</hi> pretend they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
and subdued the World) <hi>Aristotle</hi> attributes to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the middle Situation of his Country, between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> which 'tis confessed, is the most
likely to compose a benign, and harmonious Temper, and
might contribute to their good Fortune, whilst Wise Men
governed. And yet for all this, we find, that what at any
time they got by their Craft, and Arts of Policy; the ruder,
undisciplin'd, ignorant and unarmed <hi>North,</hi> soon over-ran,
vanquish'd and subdu'd both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> (fortified as
they were, with the strongest Holds, and armed Legions)
possessing their goodly Countries to this day; so as they are
no more what they were, either as to their Persons, or Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
such an Ascendent has the change of <hi>Climat. Comines</hi>
indeed does well observe, that what the <hi>English</hi> obtain'd by
Battel of the <hi>French,</hi> they lost again in Treaty; and the same
Advantage had the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> who being of a more
Melancholy, Contemplative and Sedate Temper, still out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
the <hi>Bilious,</hi> and Impatient <hi>French;</hi> who all upon the
spur, staid not to digest Matters as the other did: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we have seen, that being <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to what a
low and despicable pass, they have now reduc'd that late
formidable, and redoubted Nation. Nor do I question, but
did the <hi>English</hi> heartily Unite, and vigorously make Use of
those Advantages, the Site and Nature of our Country affords
both by Sea and Land, she might yet answer their Politics,
and encounter all their Stratagems, by which they aspire to
an universal Monarchy. It must be granted, that the <hi>French</hi>
are a brisk, active, and industrious People: But I know not
whether amongst other their <hi>Encomiasts,</hi> they are much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to their Country-man <hi>Bodin,</hi> when he tells us, that <hi>Italy,</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> swarm with them, to perform those servile Offices
among them, which it seems, they are too Proud and Lofty
to condescend to themselves, how poor soever.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, when all is said, I find Writers are so Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to their own Countries, and that <hi>Nescio qua natale solum</hi>—
so governs and prevails upon our Judgments, that 'tis hard to
meet an Ingenuous Character among us all, when it once comes
near our home. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> magnifies the <hi>Greeks; Cicero,</hi> the
<hi>Romans; Iulius Scaliger, Italy;</hi> the Lawyers, <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>Contius,
France,</hi> &amp;c. Nor are we more Just in imputing Vices, or
Virtues to the Nature and Constitution of the People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

considering the accidental Causes. Continence, less Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy,
Abstinence and Temperance in Eating and Drinking,

of Heat and Cold, and such other Qualities, as more or less
incite, or bridle the sensual Appetite, and make the Person
more Liberal, Indulgent to his Palate and Inclination: And
accordingly, an <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> (much more any further

they so much boast of (to the reproach of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern

Vertue, abstracted from those Causes; but from what we have
alledged; wherefore Inhabitants dwelling near Maritime Coasts,
observed to be more <hi>salacious,</hi> perfidious, crafty and over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than other People farther off (and therefore no fit Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

than such adventitious Causes; namely from the irritation of
a <hi>saline</hi> Air; their continual huxtering with cunning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
(and such as frequent Sea-Ports for Gain and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic)
rather than from any Vice inherent in the Person, as above
is noted. We have already spoken of the Effects of <hi>Institution,
Philosophy, Poetry, Painting, Musick,</hi> and other voluptuary Arts
of the warmer, and more genial Countries: Nor after all, are
we wholly to regard these Contrarieties, without great respect
to a Wise and peculiar Providence, whereby is kept an even
(at least a tolerable) Balance among all the Nations of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
World; that the Crafty, and Circumventing (who
would else Usurp, and get all by their Wit and Policy) may
receive a Check, by the Plain, Honest Force and Courage of
others; and the Progress of the Insolent, prevented, by the
more Prudent, tho' inferior, and less in Power: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
'tis worth observing, that God does commonly so
order this Oeconomy, that the Wisest Kings and Princes,
reign much at the same time; and those of weaker Parts, and

            <p>'Tis not is the mean time to be denied, that the <hi>Climate,</hi>
insulary and unconstant Air (tho' seldom in excess) does
generally dispose to Commotion, Melancholy, Moroseness,
and a certain peculiar Strangeness, which often sowers the
Conversation, mistaken oft for Pride: But then the Plenty,
the Freedom, our just and easie Laws, correct, sweeten and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61438:167"/>
reconcile again, which else would be very inconvenient. The
sole, and indeed, the only <hi>Desiderate</hi> therefore to be wish'd for,
to render us the most consummately happy People, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Under Heaven (since we cannot all be <hi>Angels</hi>) were (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
Circumstances with the rest of the World about us) a
<hi>constant Steadiness, and a true Discernment when we are Well, and
at our Ease, to endeavour to keep our selves so:</hi> But this must
be the Effect of Sound and Steady Religion, more public
Spirit, solid and united Counsels, and acquir'd Virtue; and not
to be expected from the Nature, and Temper of the <hi>Clime,</hi> and
Elevation of the <hi>Pole,</hi> which are evidently averse, and less
benign.</p>
            <p>But I am straid too far again, and to enlarge much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on this Subject, would require as large Discourse, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not be so agreeable. What I have produc'd being only
to shew, that the Art of Divination from the Countenance, is
a <hi>Science</hi> of as large, and wide Extent, as the Face of the Earth,
which we inhabit, and is not to be confin'd to one Part, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or people of the World, but to All in general; establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi> upon more than Fancy, or mere
Conjectures only; namely (as all along we have shewed)
upon the Conjugation and Concurrence of divers serious
Causes.</p>
            <p>It may after all this perhaps be said, that these are only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Opinions, or if true, are yet but such as you confess
are drawn from the Effects of the several <hi>Climes,</hi> and Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Countries; as Men happen to dwell nearer to, or
more remote from those powerful Influences, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intend, or remit their Operations on the Inhabitants, as to
Colour, Feature, Stature and those other Inclinations you have
mention'd. But still you tell us nothing upon what <hi>Principle</hi>
(as every Art requires) you advance, and ground you Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Particulars; and how it comes to pass, that the same
Country, nay almost every Family, produces Persons so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and unlike to one another? For 'tis suppos'd you will
not affirm, that the being Born in the Garret, middle, or lower
Floor of the House, signifies any thing to the Structure of the
Body, or Elegancy of the Countenance.</p>
            <p>To take off this Objection, I was once beginning to frame
a Table of Proportions, drawn (as from <hi>Polycletus</hi>'s <hi>Canon</hi>)
not only from the <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Alexander, Hiero, Pompey</hi> the
Great, <hi>Augustus, Germanicus,</hi> &amp;c. but likewise from their <hi>Statues,</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:61438:167"/>
as those of the <hi>Medicean Venus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consule Guil. de Regn. Dissertat. de Physiog.</note> Cleopatra, <hi>Apollo, Antinous, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager</hi>
and other, famous (and yet extant) for their exact Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
and signals Beauty, as their Measures Stand in that very
Curious, tho' little Piece, publish'd about forty Years since,
by <hi>Abraham Bosse</hi> a <hi>French Chalcographer;</hi> compared with those
of <hi>Albert Durer, Lomatius, Leon Baptista Alberti,</hi> and other
Artists of the Moderns. And according as the most conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Parts of Men's Countenances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remarkably deflecting
from these standard Proportions; subjoyn'd the natural Causes
of their unconformities; as near as might be to the Rules,
and <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Physiognomists;</hi> taking in the Assistance of
<hi>Sigismund Elsholt,</hi> who has in his <hi>Anthropometria,</hi> done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this Nature with extraordinary accuracy of Judgment;
to shew, that their Sentiments were far from being the bare
Conjectures, and Speculations of Men of more Leisure than
Judgment; but the Results of Rational, as well as Natural
Causes.</p>
            <p>Every Body will consent I presume, that an ample, and
well form'd Head, which is neither too great, nor too little;
(broad, round, square, flat or too copped and turbinated) has
likely the Advantage of the rest we have mention'd, as well
in regard to the due Situation of the Ventricles of the Brain,
and intercourse of spirits, Animal, and Vital; whether carried
thither from the Heart, by the <hi>Carotides</hi> and Arteries of the
Neck; or degenerated, and exalted in that Receptacle, which
being over-much compressed, straitned, dilated, or otherwise
obstructed, must needs have influence upon the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faculties, and other Functions of the Body also.</p>
            <p>But how then happens it (say they) that you judge of
those Effects and Habitudes from such other Irregularities, as
have less Commerce with the more Vital, and Nobel Parts?
For what has the long, or shorter Nose; full or narrow Eyes;
thin, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>more fleshy Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may accidentally be
lost, quite cut off, or mutilated (without the loss or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
to the Understanding, in the least) to do in this
Case?</p>
            <p>I might once for all, Answer to this Question, with the
constant Doctrine, for near Two Thousand Years, of the
Great <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> Famous <hi>Physicians, Peripatetics;</hi> the
whole <hi>Turba Philosophorum</hi> of old, building their <hi>Hypotheses</hi>'s
on the various Temperaments, and Humors arising from the
natural Actions, and Passions of <hi>Prime</hi> and <hi>First Qualities,</hi> and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61438:168"/>
their Effects; according as they happen to be equally mixt,
or predominate in the Body, more eminently visible in the
Countenance, Upper Regions, and inner Man of the Head:
So as He, in whom those Perfections are found <hi>ad Pondus,</hi> as
they speak (which is Proportion <hi>Arithmetical</hi>) or what is nearest
to it, <hi>ad Iustitiam</hi> (which is the <hi>Geometrical)</hi> where neither
Cold nor Moist, Hot nor Dry domineer, but amicably meet
in equal Poise and Measure, or at least in Temperament suitable
to the several Functions; that blessed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> must needs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the happy Person, as Beautiful in Mind as in Body: For
every Part being furnish'd with so just and benign a mixture
of Heat and Moisture, perfectly contemper'd, giving motion,
and spritefulness to the Blood; a due, and just proportion of
the whole must of necessity accompany it, with Vivacity in
the Eyes, Colour in the Cheeks and Lips, a decent Elevation
of the Nose, and more prominent Parts; a smooth, and serene
Forehead, chearful composure of the Mouth, a tender plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Visage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in short, where nothing is in excess,
nothing deficient in the outward Structure; there will be found
a natural Affability, Generosity, Courage with Discretion;
quickness of Apprehension, great Ingenuity and Invention;
Eloquence in the Tongue; a facetious Easiness in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with aptness to the softer Passions of Love and Friendship,
and a sincere Candor in all his Actions. On the contrary,
where any of these (vulgarly nam'd) <hi>Humors,</hi> jar, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to disagree,<note place="margin">1. Met.</note> and as in the Poets <hi>Chaos</hi>

                  <l>Mollia cum duris—</l>
               </q>
are at Variance with one another, notice will soon be given
of it by the contrary Effects; as (to speak with the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetics)</hi>
where <hi>Choler,</hi> Heat and Driness domineer over the Cold
and Moist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Parts are apt to be distended, and thrust
out, as more conspicuously in the Nose, Forehead, Chin and
other eminences of the Face; as <hi>Subterranean</hi> Fires and Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
raise <hi>Pics,</hi> and inequalities on the Surface of the Earth:
And such are commonly Slender, Lean and Tall; their Heads
and Faces oval; their Veins large, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> naturally Iracund, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
Contumacious, Conceited, Prompt, Vigilant, Subtile,
Curious, Impatient, little Constant, and sometimes Petulant;
unless corrected with some Quality attempering the <hi>Bilious</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:61438:168"/>
Heat with a due Moisture, which makes a wonderful altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
turns Ambition to a Generous Courage, and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Mind; Resolution, to a steady Prudence; Reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to Deliberation in Affairs; with Temperance, Modesty,
and all other Heroic Virtues.</p>
            <p>And as here these Characters in the Face, are remarkably
stronger and higher; so, where we find them notoriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
and shrunk; for Instance, the Nose less vaulted, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in, shorter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Eyes narrow, the Skins corrugated;
Cold and Dry are in excess, and they betray it in the sadness
of the Countenance, by a <hi>Saturnine,</hi> silent, monkish, morose Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor;
they are Passionate, Peevish, Envious, Suspicious; not
easily reconciled, yet Friendly and Chearful by fits; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative,
extreamly Fansiful, and full of odd Imaginations;
in short, <hi>Deus aut Daemon:</hi> But being a little spirited with
the brisk and airy <hi>Sanguine,</hi> allaying its adust Mordacity, as
of all Tempers soonest affected with the rest of the Humors;
so we see it alter both the Shape, and Inclinations according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and sometimes to that degree, as none become more
Active, Modest, Abstemious, Discreet; less Splenetic; Jocund,
and better Company. <hi>Melancholici</hi> (says <hi>Cicero,</hi> and he out of
<hi>Aristotle) omnes ingeniosi: Plato, Socrates, Seneca</hi> the gravest, and
greatest Philosophers of them all, Politicians, Wits, and Poets
were obliged to a more than ordinary dash of this otherwise,
unsociable Humor.</p>
            <p>We might proceed to the <hi>Pituitous,</hi> pallid, <hi>Phlegmatic</hi> and
very worst of Constitutions, rendring the parts Obtuse, Fleshy
and Gross, thro' the want of a generous discussing Warmth;
so as where this is Ascendent, it disposes to Sloth, Drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Timidity, Despondency, Unactivity, and an whole Train
of other Infirmities, supported with great Patience, and an
over-Easiness of Nature: And might here inlarge into an
ample, and spacious Field of Qualities, by repeating what
<hi>Iohn Baptista Porta</hi> has so copiously written concerning the
natural Causes of all these Effects, under their several Titles,
scatter'd thro' his Treatise, and summ'd up in his <hi>Fourth Book</hi>
upon this Subject; besides the Suffrages of innumerable more,
as Famous for their profound Knowledge, as the World has
any, if Number, and mighty Names would carry it.</p>
            <p>But now comes a set of <hi>New Philosophers,</hi> introducing as
New a <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Primordia,</hi> which plainly overthrow all

separated Substances, as constituent, integral Parts of that pure
<hi>Elixir</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> variously denominated in their Doctrine of
<hi>Humors,</hi> according to its Consistence: And all this at once,
by that happy, and noble Discovery of its <hi>Circulation,</hi> substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
a Consistence but of one <hi>Homogeneous,</hi> simple Humor;
and attributing all those Causes, Effects, and Operations (we
have been so long question'd about) to the Motion, Figure,
Texture, various <hi>Schematisms</hi> and other Modifications, and
Mechanical Affections of the parts of Matter only.</p>
            <p>To these, I cannot say as <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> (but still agreeing in
their design of destroying the old <hi>Humorists)</hi> come in a Troop
of <hi>Spagirits,</hi> with their <hi>Sal, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> which tho'

upon this account it is, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are said to allow a

               <hi>Whet</hi> of <hi>Brandy</hi> to their Sea-men, and others, previous to a
solemn Engagement with an Enemy. It brings at least to
mind, what I have been told of an <hi>English</hi> Merchant residing
(if I mistake not) at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who having a bold, but just
Complaint to make to the <hi>Bacha,</hi> offered his Interpreter a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Reward to carry it to him; <hi>I dare not attempt it
Sir,</hi> says he, <hi>for my Head.</hi> Tempted yet at last with the
Money, and after many persuasions taking a <hi>Dose</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi>
he comes to the Merchant again: <hi>Now Sir</hi> (says he) <hi>I am
ready to serve you, and not only to tell the</hi> Bacha <hi>what you say,
but to give him a Box o'th Ear too, if you command me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this then the effect of <hi>Choler</hi> only, or his Refusal and
Fear from <hi>Phlegm</hi> or <hi>Melancholy,</hi> as a peculiar and <hi>Heterogenous</hi>
Quality? Certainly not at all, but purely from the Motion
and Modification we have assigned, putting him into a temper
apt to incline and excite the Undertaking of a bolder Action,
than naturally he was disposed to: Nor does this give the least
incouragement to Intemperance, but to that just Mediocrity,
which between Extremes, is the Seat, and Soul of all the <hi>moral
Virtues,</hi> as the <hi>Ethics</hi> teach us. Other Examples, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of no small Weight, might be produced; but let these
suffice. Nothing here is dangerous, but what is so in all
things else, whilst the most <hi>Golden Temper,</hi> and even all that's
Great, and Good in our Actions, is in a sort acquirable from
the just Constitution, and Harmony of this single <hi>Principle;</hi>
call it <hi>Humor,</hi> or what you please. And therefore whatever
it be, which begets any of those pernicious, and ill Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the Universal <hi>Vehicle;</hi> (diffus'd by the <hi>Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
through the whole Body, by <hi>Adustion,</hi> acrimonious <hi>Gall,</hi>
sharp, or acid Juices; feculent and slimy Dregs, or other
noxious excrementitious Matter, which manifestly obstructs,
or any ways disorders and impedes its Function; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Animal and other Spirits become degenerate, slow, or
over-Active and ungovernable.) It may justly be imputed
to what they still continue to call, the <hi>Four first Qualities,</hi> as
producing the like Effects and Symptoms, hitherto (tho'
falsly) attributed to them; and taking Denomination from
the several Degrees of Motion, instead of Composition, and
so all Parties reconcil'd. Lastly,</p>
            <p>To these there are others who are calling in the Assistance
of <hi>Genitures,</hi> and erecting <hi>Schemes</hi> (which would also fain

            <p>
               <hi>Fortitude</hi> (as in <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Cocks,</hi> and other generous <hi>Animals)</hi>
consists in Heat, moderated with an allay of <hi>Pituite</hi> and
<hi>Phlegm;</hi> and therefore 'tis observed, that true Courage does
not so much proceed from pureness and spritefulness of the
Blood (as Wit and Fancy do) but from that which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fibrous, disposing to a more compos'd and steady
Temper; whence it is<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Honoratus Niquetius</hi>'s Physiog. human. <hi>Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Niquetius</hi> thinks those of the <hi>North,</hi>
so much exceed those of the <hi>South</hi> in Valor. Lastly,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61438:171"/>
               <hi>Temperance,</hi> the result of a drier Composition, is of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious
Nature, necessary for the moderation of Appetite;
and therefore <hi>Melancholy</hi> being Cold and Dry, quickned with
a dash of <hi>Sanguine,</hi> (which is hot -and moist) inspirits it
with a decent Activity, which indeed ought to be an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in all other Virtues. In all these still (as has all along
been said) understanding the several <hi>Aetiologies,</hi> Causes and
Effects; not as proceeding from any disparate, contrary, or
opposite Substances and <hi>primary Qualities,</hi> as they are call'd:
But as the Operations of the various Texture, and Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Matter, which according to its Motion and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
disposes to those several Passions, Virtues, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
by impressing them with the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Imagination,
whereby they insinuate themselves into the <hi>Brain,</hi> &amp;c. as we
have already shewed.</p>
            <p>And thus one sees from what Indications Judgment is made
concerning all Moral Actions, and Dispositions, Habits, and
inconvenient Customs; by applying such Remedies as are
to be found in the Conversations, and Discourses of <hi>Divines,
Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Physicians;</hi> by which the perversest Natures,
and greatest Difficulties are, and have been surmounted and
overcome. Other Advantages might be likewise made, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
what <hi>Calling,</hi> or <hi>Profession</hi> one should chuse, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
ones self to, by considering what Quality is most apt to
bear the sway. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was so profound a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> would
perhaps have made but a bungling <hi>Sculptor;</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> who was
so excellent a <hi>Poet,</hi> not so good a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> to which Profession
his Parents design'd him; it being so extreamly difficult to
eradicate Habits, or the bent and ply of Nature so perfectly,
but that it will incline, and now and then recur, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Watchfulness and Resolution. Those therefore who
are of a drier Constitution, commonly emerge in the Studies
of <hi>Theology, Mathematics,</hi> and the abstruser Sciences; others of
more Heat, succeed in <hi>Eloquence, Poetry, Music;</hi> others of
colder Tempers, prosper in <hi>Mechanics, &amp; sic de caeteris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, 'twas the saying of <hi>Menander,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that it was not so well
said by the Wise Man, <hi>Know thy self,</hi> as <hi>Know others.</hi> Yet
certainly, if that be the best <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which best teaches us
to know our selves (without which it is impossible to know,
or do any thing as we should) the Study of that which
instructs us to know both our selves, and others, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61438:171"/>
to all other, and to be esteem'd no inconsiderable part
of <hi>Moral Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me conclude all, with the Suffrage of the Learned
Dr. <hi>Gwither</hi> (<hi>Philos. Transact. Num.</hi> 20.) discoursing on this
Subject: <q>That whatever Impostors, and ignorant Pretenders
may have done to the prejudice of this Doctrine; a sober
and diligent Artist, he doubts not, but may discover suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Truth in <hi>Physiognomie,</hi> which may be useful to the well
solving of all its <hi>Phaenomena</hi> intelligibly. Soft Wax, says he,
cannot receive more numerous and various Impressions, than
are printed in Mens Faces, by Objects moving the Affections;
and not only the Objects themselves have the Power, but
their very Images and <hi>Ideas</hi> also, <hi>viz.</hi> any thing that puts
the Animal Spirits into the same Motion, that the present
Object did, will have the same Effect with the Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
To prove the first, Let one observe a Man's Face looking
on a pitiful Object, then a ridiculous, then a strange, then
a terrible or dangerous Object, and the like. Or for the
second, That <hi>Ideas</hi> have the same Effect with Objects real,
our Dreams confirm too often, and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Verse can in a
little time make one's Face represent Shame, Fear, Love,
Anger, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Animal Spirits being moved in the
sensory by an Object, continuing their Motion in the Brain,
and propagating it to this, or that part of the Body, as is
most suitable to the Design of its Creation; having first
made an alteration in the Countenance by its Nerves, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Pathetic</hi> and <hi>Oculorum motorii,</hi> actuating its nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Muscles, as the Dial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>plate to that stupendious Piece of
Clock-work, which shews what is to be expected from the
striking part; not that he thinks the Motion of the Spirits
in the Sensory continued in the Impression of the Object
all the way, as from a Finger to the Foot (as being too weak,
tho' the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enseness of the Nerves favour it) but as effected
in the <hi>Medulla</hi> of the Brain, where the common Stock of
Spirits reside, as in an Organ, whose Pipes being opened
and uncovered, admit the rushing Air, until the Keys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dismiss'd and let go again, they are stopp'd and silent.
Thus by repeated Acts, or frequent Entertaining of the
<hi>Ideas</hi> of a favorite Passion or Vice, which natural Temper
hurried, or Custom dragged one to; the Face is so often
put into that Posture, which attends such Acts, that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits find such open, and easy Passage into the Nerves,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61438:172"/>
that it is sometime unalterably fixt (as the Religious <hi>Indians</hi>
are by continuing their strange Postures in their <hi>Pagods:)</hi>
But most commonly such an Habit is contracted, as to fall
insensibly into that Posture, when-ever some present Object
does not obliterate that more natural Impression by a new
one, or some dissimulation hide it. Hence it is, we see great
<hi>Drinkers</hi> with Eyes generally set towards the Nose; the <hi>addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Muscles</hi> being often employ'd to shew them their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Liquor in the Glass whilst they are drinking, and
therefore called <hi>Bibitory.</hi> Lascivious Persons are remarkable
for the <hi>Oculorum mobilis petulantia,</hi> as <hi>Petronius</hi> calls it. From
this also we may solve the <hi>Quakers</hi> expecting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Face, awaiting
the pretended Spirit, and the melancholy Face of <hi>Sectaries;</hi>
the studious Countenance of Persons of great application of
Mind; revengeful and bloody Men like Executioners in the
Act, and tho' silence in a sort may a while pass for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
yet sooner or later, Sir <hi>Martin</hi> peeps thro' the Disguise
to undo all: Not that what has been said, is always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception; great, and virtuous Souls absconded now
and then under unpromising externals, like to that of <hi>Claranus</hi>
in <hi>Seneca;</hi> but speaking for the most part, and as commonly
it falls out.</q> Thus far the Learned Doctor.</p>
            <p>And thus have we at last gon thro' the Causes, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the <hi>Physiognomical Divination,</hi> as they concern the <hi>Face</hi>
and external Countenance (our Artists peculiar Province)
deducible not only from <hi>Effigies,</hi> in <hi>Taille-Douce</hi> and <hi>Prints,</hi>
but from antient <hi>Medals</hi> also; as <hi>Samuel Fuchsius</hi> has in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
exemplified in his <hi>Metoposcopie,</hi> from that of <hi>Pertinax, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi>
and others, without expatiating upon <hi>Colours</hi> and <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions</hi>
as they call them; the <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
whether tender, hard, coarse, fair or swarthy; and
so of the <hi>Hair,</hi> as to its being gentle, harsh, thick or thin, not
so perfectly discernable, whilst yet the long and prolixer Beard
was ever a mark of Gravity and Wisdom in Men; but a <hi>Woman</hi>
with an hairy Chin, was saluted as a Monster, by a Peal of
Stones at her. Of the thin and whey-colour'd Beard, 'twas
usually said, <hi>Poco barba, è men colore, Sotto'l cielo non è peggiore.
Dares</hi> says, <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Hair was curl'd, and ever a sign of Courage,
so was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s; but the <hi>leviter inflexa</hi> was that of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
Depressed and flat to the Fore-head, a mark of Cruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
those manly Distinctions being now no more the <hi>Mode,</hi> chang'd
universally into the <hi>Peruke;</hi> our <hi>Physiognomist</hi> goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61438:172"/>
tho' it must (I think) be acknowledged, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Covering was not given to be used altogether as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
but ordained for a natural, decent, and becoming
Discrimination; let us hear St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> elegantly, <hi>Caesaries reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda
est in Senibus, veneranda in Sacerdotibus, terribilis in Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus,
decora in Adolescentibus, compta in Mulieribus, dulcis in
Pueris.</hi> Hair (says the Holy <hi>Bishop)</hi> is reverend in old Men,
venerable in Priests, terrible in Soldiers, becoming in young
Men, elegant in Women, sweet and lovely in Children.</p>
            <p>But of these Accessaries only in <hi>Medals,</hi> and <hi>Picture</hi> in <hi>Prints;</hi>
tho' a <hi>Physiognomist</hi> can take little notice, so as to make any
certain Judgment, for want of <hi>Colour;</hi> they may yet from
other likensses, make almost the same Conjectures, as from
the Life it self; as 'tis reported of that <hi>Artist,</hi> who from a
Picture only drawn by the great <hi>Apelles,</hi> predicted by what
Accident the Original should perish. And I have been told,
of the famous <hi>Architect</hi> and <hi>Statuary,</hi> the late <hi>Chevalier Bernini,</hi>
who cut that rare <hi>Bust</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> in white
Marble, from a Picture painted by <hi>Van Dyke</hi> (yet extant, and
to be seen in one of His Majesty's Apartments) that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
something of funest and unhappy, which the Countenance
of that Excellent Prince fore-boded. We have said nothing
of the <hi>Voice,</hi> the Object of another Sense, whether shrill, loud,
hoarse, broken, small, harmonious and agreeable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which
much might be discover'd, as appears by that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who,
tho' so skilful in <hi>Metoposcopie,</hi> bid the <hi>Boy</hi> (whom they brought
him) to <hi>speak,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eloquere ut te videam.s</note> that he might see what was in the Youth:
This, I know, was meant of the Wit and towardliness of the
Boy; But what if the Voice alone assist the discovery of that
too? and yet even without the Voice, <hi>Et fronte, &amp; vultu,
etiam in ipso oris silentio natura sequitur,</hi> as <hi>Adamantius.</hi> For
tho' <hi>Picture</hi> be not vocal, the Eyes and Countenance often
supply the Tongue, and speak the very Passions, and interior
of the Soul; to which add that of <hi>Porta, Est enim similitudo,
Pictus sermo, &amp; Pictura loquens, quae quovis sermone, quibusve
notis valentior.</hi> And now we mention Picture, since the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
or Stroak of one single Line, does often discover the
Regnant Passion; <hi>De Frenay</hi> (so elegantly published by
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>) forgets not to recommend the Art of <hi>Physiognomy</hi>
to the study of <hi>Painters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more (whilst we are discoursing of <hi>Heads</hi> and
<hi>Faces</hi>) who can but take notice of that Wise, and Wonderful
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61438:173"/>
Providence, which has ordain'd such variety of Looks, and
Countenances among Men, whilst the other Parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our Bodies are in comparison so little different, much
less the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Faces</hi> (as I may also call them) of other
Creatures, of the same <hi>Species?</hi> since were it otherwise, and
that Men had been made all like one another, the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Politie of the World, must long since have
run into Confusion and sad Disorder. For who could have
distinguish'd the <hi>True-man</hi> from the <hi>Thief?</hi> There would be
promiscuous <hi>Amours,</hi> and innocent <hi>Adulteries</hi> as well as injurious:
For the Wife could not know her Husband (so like <hi>Alcumena</hi>
in <hi>Amphitryo</hi>) the Son would mistake his Father,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVii. 22.</note> the Father his
Son; the Friend his Friend, and there would be no more Justice,
no more Commerce, no more Living in the World: For
Evil Men would deny their Crimes, and Good Men be often
punished for the Faults of the wicked. For tho' in a Flock

for Faults they did not commit; but which neither their

a poor <hi>Hedger</hi> and Day-Labourer of mine, so extreamly
like the renowned Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, as no Flesh could
be more, if the best Pictures of that Mighty Prince, be truly
represented by the best <hi>Painter,</hi> that perhaps has ever been,
the Famous <hi>Titian. Erythraeus,</hi> says the Poet <hi>Stephanius,</hi> was
like <hi>Virgil; Antoninus Pius,</hi> resembling <hi>Numa Pompilius;</hi> and
the Great Chancellor of <hi>France Mic. Hospitalis,</hi> in Countenance
like <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But as these happen rarely, so a <hi>Physiognomist</hi>'s
Judgment is not at all ingaged to pronounce of their Fortune
or Advancement, referring various Events to the bold <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger;</hi>
or rather indeed, to the Providence of <hi>God</hi> alone; and
as to Qualities, to their different Education, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
In short, so has the Wise <hi>Creator</hi> tempered and

as very probable only, temporal and transitory, others almost
infallible, fixt and inherent) and the Reasons they exhibite,
upon the long Experience, and diligent Observations of Learned
Men from the Countenance, and from the Structure, Symmetry,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61438:174"/>
and Composure of those Parts and Members the most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in the <hi>Face,</hi> exposed to sight. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his
Books on this subject, divides the Body into three <hi>Regions,</hi>
and the Notes, and Characters of this Art to be chiefly
gathered from the most conspicuous and principal Parts,

they those <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which shew
<hi>the most likely marks of Wisdom and Beauty,</hi> together with these
Attributes given them upon all their <hi>Semiotics</hi> and <hi>Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as well to discover the Affections, Passions, and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Mind, as the <hi>Crasis,</hi> and Constitution of the Body.
Not yet as the same Author well admonishes (and as already
noted) that one is to pronounce any sudden or rash Sentence,
denominate the whole, from any one single or solitary Mark
(unless when it happens to prove some notorious, generally
over-ruling one) but by collating, and duely comparing the
several Notes together, how they consent, agree with, or
thwart one another, or over-vote in number and weight.
And therefore we determine nothing <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> but as they
use to speak of <hi>Constellations,</hi> that <hi>tho' they Compel not, they
shrewdly Dispose;</hi> where (as we said) Education, Religious
Principles, and Virtuous Habits do not timely interpose,

(denominated <hi>Passions</hi>) as far as they agitate and concern

belie the Heart, the Face commonly betrays the Tongue;
and our Passions are almost as well discovered in the Eye, and
Air of the Countenance, as in the Soul her-self, were they as

            <p>In the Noble Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> painted by <hi>Van Dyke,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
by <hi>Lucas Vosterman,</hi> a steady, serious, and judicious
Countenance.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, painted by <hi>Holbein,</hi> a close, dry, wise,
and careful Effigies, as in that of his Predecessor <hi>Richard</hi> the
Third; a twisted Face, and not a Line but what bespeaks
Hypocrisie, Craft and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>In that of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, by the Hand of
<hi>Titian,</hi> a stout, hardy, resolute, wise and determin'd Prince, as
that of a stiff, bigotted, and formal Look in his Son <hi>Philip</hi>
the Second.</p>
            <p>In the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> of whom there are a Thousand Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
(not on <hi>Medals</hi> only, but upon every <hi>Iugg-Pot</hi> and <hi>Tabacco-Box</hi>)
shewing a most malicious, stern, and merciless Apect,
fringed with a prolix and squalid Beard, which draws down
his meager and hollow Cheeks, Emblems of his Disposition.</p>
            <p>In Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> (which I have seen well painted, and
in Stamp) Craft, with a certain pert, and piercing Air, as lying
upon the Catch, not much unlike to the late Lord Treasurer
<hi>Cottington;</hi> but with a greater mixture of morose, and warines
in the latter.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Erasmus</hi> (of <hi>Holbein</hi>) Quickness, with an easie, pleasant
facetiousness, and honest Gravity.</p>

a steady and ingenuous Mind, an extraordinary Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>In my Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon;</hi> a spacious Fore-head, and
piercing Eye, always (as I have been told by one who knew
him well) looking upward; as a Soul in sublime Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
and as the Person, who by standing up against <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matists,</hi>
was to emancipate, and set free the long and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

Conquests in the <hi>Territories</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>

a most candid, ingenuous, and agreeable Nature, with a

            <p>Those who remember Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> as I perfectly do (and
whose Pictures are perfectly like him) might discover in his

very Looks, a supercilious, Saturnine <hi>Opiniatrety,</hi> pleased with
himself: as on the contrary, in the famous Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi>
(whose Picture etched by <hi>Hollar,</hi> and placed before his <hi>Clavis,</hi>
extreamly resembles him) that calm and placid Composure,
which seemed to proceed from, and be the result of some happy
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and Invention; such as was that of <hi>Archimedes,</hi>
when he discovered the adulterate mixture in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Prince's
<hi>Crown;</hi> or that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> demonstrating the equality between
the sides of a <hi>rectangular Triangle,</hi> and the <hi>square</hi> of its <hi>Base,</hi>
for Joy whereof, he paid an <hi>Hecatomb</hi> to the Gods. And
such another was that of our Renowned <hi>Harvey</hi>'s, but with
stroaks of more serious and application. I will end in the
late Lord Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> of whom (tho' I
cannot say, I ever saw Picture so like him, as I wish) all who
knew him, must acknowledge to find in him a judicious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
Gravity, tempered with extraordinary sweetness; a
serene calmness, and openness of Countenance, becoming the
freedom and great Ingenuity of Nature and Disposition. The

            <p>Several others I might shew you, but I confine my self to
such alone, whose <hi>Effigies</hi> I have seen breathing-like, and
painted by the most celebrated and skilful Pencils; and many
more are there yet before me, and in my Eye, of our own
Country, whose Countenances justify this <hi>Paragraph:</hi> But I
speak of such as are no more among us, save in their Works,
Merits, and profitable Inventions, leaving Argument of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Fame. For to have enumerated such as at present
flourish and remain, trace and pursue the Progress daily made
by those great <hi>Genius's,</hi> in some part or other of the <hi>universal

for Him, who shall one day write the <hi>History</hi> of this <hi>Age
of Wonders.</hi> Were, I say, my Talent rich enough to be their
<hi>Encomiastes,</hi> there are many (<hi>quibus ego nominibus semper assurgo)</hi>
in my ken, of extraordinary Merit, for what they have
written, published, and improved of the most useful, <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
Learning;</hi> and which (after all a-do) is really, and
indeed, of all human Knowledge, the only true, and valid
Learning. Persons, I say, of equal Desert, with any which
past, and former Ages have produc'd. In a word, we have
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61438:176"/>
had some as great, and conspicuous Subjects, fit to have
been stamp'd, and worn in <hi>Medals</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and carv'd in
<hi>Marble,</hi> as ever <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or any present ambitious
Potentate had any where, for extending their Dominions by
Slaughter, Blood, Fire, and Desolation, which disturbs the
Fruits and Labours of the most useful Studies. The great
<hi>Archimedes</hi> (whom but now we mentioned) was barbarously
stain by a rude and common Soldier, in the midst of his
Speculations, whose Life was of more Value, than a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
