         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beeing forgetfull of that Law receaved from
his excellent Mother, which should haue added to
his head, favour both with <hi>GOD</hi> and Man; in
lyke manner, hee beeing forgetfull of the Oath so
oftentymes by him reiterate, whereby, both these
who are to be promoted thorow everie degree, as
also these who are newlie made Doctours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the custome and institution of that Order,
vse to binde themselues; yet miserablie contrarie
therevnto hee fallen into that <hi>perverse sect of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists;</hi>
which amongst other Sectes, in expresse
words, he had formerlie condemned: whereby he
hath acquired, vnto himselfe, destruction from
<hi>GOD,</hi> disgrace amongst men, and a curse from
both; being made a foolish sonne, and the griefe of
his Mother; while as by a perfidious prevarication
(abjuring the true doctrine of the <hi>Catholicke, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke,</hi>
and <hi>Romane Church)</hi> hee hath openlie, and
avowedlie, fled to the societie of <hi>Heretickes,</hi> and
hath given vp his name to impietie and lies.</p>
            <p>But what is the cause of his being so bent vnto
so great and headlongs a destruction? But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
pryde of his mynd, and his vnbrydled lust,
wherewith he was ever seene by them who knew
him best, to be inflamed, with an vndaunted bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
whence being blinded, and according to his
lustes, beeing still kindeled, having shaken off the
sweet yoke of Christ, hee hath become the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19074:5"/>
of <hi>Heresie;</hi> which of all sinnes, is the verie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment.</p>
            <p>Seeing, therefore, (as Christian Emperours doe
speak) that, that which is done agaynst divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is an injurie done vnto all; by farre greater
right, then, hath that sacred Facultie esteemed that
contumelie done by a degenerated sonne agaynst
Christ, and the fayth of Christ, to be done agaynst
her; and, that so it belongeth vnto her, according
to the grievous &amp; great haynousnes of the cryme,
by her censures, to chastise the same, &amp; by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
detestation, to remoue the same from her. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
it is not to bee feared, that these bastard plants
will root deeplie, or haue anie stable fastening.</p>
            <p>Woe vnto thee, then, who hath proven a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sonne, and back-slyder, that thou should <hi>take
counsell, but not of me,</hi> and thou <hi>should begin a web, but
not by my spirit;</hi> that so thou may joyne sinne vnto

<hi>is taught by the precepts of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai 29. 13</note> but Doctor CUPIF knoweth
that hee consulted not with flesh and blood therein,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16</note> which if hee
had done, hee had remained as yet in the bosome of the Romane
Church.</p>
               <p>6 Hee also knoweth that the holie Scripture (as sayeth <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome)</hi> is the <hi>most exact ballence,</hi>

<hi>Ireneus</hi> speaketh) the <hi>inflexible rule of trueth,</hi> and by this rule hee
knoweth hee is bound to holde, and therevnto whollie doeth
submit himselfe.</p>
               <p>7 As for his <hi>Scandalezing of all the godlie,</hi> there is a scandall
which is given, and another which is taken, If the Pharisees were
scandalized having heard Christs speach, <hi>they are to bee let alone,
because they are blind themselues,</hi>

therein.</p>
               <p>8 Such also as are truelie the <hi>enemies of the Crosse of Christ,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <hi>and whose
glorie is their shame, caring for earthlie thinges.</hi> And who these bee, the
thing it selfe speaketh: for surelie that cannot bee ascrybed to him,
who, that hee might follow Christ, hath denyed himselfe, and hath
cast away from him the Revenewes of these Benefices which hee
enjoyed,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9</note> that hee might giue vp his name to Him, who <hi>when Hee
was rich, became poore for our sake that by His povertie wee might bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched:</hi>
