            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MY Duty, as well to the Publick as to the Memory of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> has obliged me to procure, with my utmost diligence, that these Tracts should come forth with the most correct exactness.</p>
            <p>I am compell'd by the force of Truth to declare, how much both the World, and the Name of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> have been abus'd by the several spurious Editions of the History of the Civil Wars; wherein, by various and unskilful Transcriptions, are committed above a thousand faults, and in above a hundred places whole Lines left out, as I can make appear.</p>
            <p>I must confess Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> upon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, was averse to the publishing thereof; but since it is impossible to suppress
<pb facs="tcp:56428:4"/>
it; no Book being more commonly sold by all Booksellers, I hope I need not fear the Offence of any Man, by doing Right to the World and this Work. Which I now Publish from the Original Manuscript, done by his own Amanuensis, and given me by himself above twelve years since.</p>
            <p>To this I have joyn'd the Treatise against Arch-Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> to prevent the like prejudice, which must certainly have faln on it, (there being so many false Copies abroad) if not thus prevented; as also the Discourse of Heresie from a more correct Copy; and have likewise annex'd his Physical Problems, as they were translated by himself, and presented to His Majesty, with the Epistle prefix'd, in the Year <hi>1662.</hi> at the same time they came forth in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things premis'd, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to wish for my self good sale, to the Buyer much pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

                        <p>In the Year 1640. the Government of <hi>England</hi> was Monarchical, and the King that reigned, <hi>Charles</hi> the first of that name, holding the Sovereignty, by right of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent continued above 600 years, and from a much longer descent, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from the time of his Ancestors <hi>Henry</hi> the second, King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Man that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no vertue, either of Body or Mind; nor endeavour'd any thing more, than to discharge his Duty towards God, in the well governing of his Subjects.</p>

                        <p>If those Soldiers had been (as they and all other of his Subjects ought to have been) at his Majesties command, the Peace and Happiness of the three Kingdoms had continued, as it was left by King <hi>James</hi>; but the People were corrupted generally, and disobedient persons esteemed the best Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But sure there were Men enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those, that were ill-affected, to have made an Army sufficient to have kept the People from uniting into a Body able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him.</p>

                        <p>Truly I think, if the King had had Money, he might have had Soldiers enough in <hi>England</hi>; for there were very few of the Common People that cared much for either of the Causes, but would have taken any side for pay and plunder; but the Kings Treasure was very low, and his Enemies that pretended the Peoples ease from Taxes, and other specious things, had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Purses of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and of most Cities and Corporate Towns in <hi>England,</hi> and of many particular persons besides.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But how came the People to be so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? and what kind of People were they that did so seduce them?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Seducers were of divers sorts. One sort were Ministers, Ministers (as they call'd themselves) of Christ; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their Sermons to the People, God's Ambassadors, pretending to have a right from God to govern every one his Parish, and their Assembly the whole Nation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, there were a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, though not comparable to the other, which notwithstanding that the Popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>England,</hi> both Temporal and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical had been by Act of Parliament abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did still retain a belief, that we ought to be governed by the Pope, whom they pretended to be the Vicar of Christ, and in the Right of Christ to be the Governour of all Christian People; and these were known by the Name of Papists, as the Ministers I mentioned before were commonly called Presbyterians.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There were not a few, who in the beginning of the Troubles were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but shortly after declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for a Liberty in Religion, and those of different Opinions one from another; some of them (because they would have all Congregations free and independent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another) were called Independents: Others that held Baptism to Infants, and such as understood not into what they are baptized to be ineffectual, were called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56428:6"/>
Anabaptists. Others that held that Christ's Kingdom was at this time to begin upon the Earth, were called Fifth-monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-men; besides divers other Sects, as Quakers, Adamites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose Names and peculiar Doctrines I do not well remember; and these were the Enemies which arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesty from the private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scripture, exposed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's scanning in his Mother-Tongue.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There were an exceeding great number of Men of the better sort, that had been so educated, as that in their Youth, having read the Books written by famous Men of the ancient Grecian and Roman Common-wealths, concerning their Politie, and great Actions; in which Books the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government was extoll'd by that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name of Liberty, and Monarchy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by the Name of Tyranny, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereby in love with their Forms of Government; and out of these Men were chosen the greatest part of the House of Commons; or if they were not the greatest part, yet by advantage of their Eloquence, were always able to sway the rest.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The City of <hi>London,</hi> and other great Towns of Trade, having in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the prosperity of the Low-Countries, after they had revolted from their Monarch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56428:7"/>
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were inclin'd to think, that the like change of Government here, would to them produce the like prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, There were a very great number that had either wasted their Fortunes, or thought them too mean for the good Parts they thought were in themselves, and more there were that had able Bodies, but saw no means how honestly to get their Bread: These long'd for a War, and hoped to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves hereafter by the lucky choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a Party to side with, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did, for the most part, serve under them that had greatest plenty of Money.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, The People in general were so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their duty, as that not one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of 10000 knew what right any man had to command him, or what necessity there was of King or Common-wealth, for which he was to part with his Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, but thought himself to be so much Master of whatsoever he possess'd, that it could not be taken from him upon any pretence of common safety without his own consent. King they thought was but a Title of the highest Honour which Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Knight, Baron, Earl, Duke were but steps to ascend to, with the help of Riches, and had no Rule of Equity, but Presidents and Custom, and he was thought wisest and fittest to be chosen for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56428:7"/>
that was most averse to the granting of Subsidies, or other publick Payments.</p>

                        <p>In such a constitution of People, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the King is already outed of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so as they need not have taken Arms for it; for I cannot imagine how the King should come by any means to resist them.</p>

                        <p>There was indeed very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the business; but of that Point you will be better inform'd in the pursuit of this Narration.</p>

                        <p>But I desire to know first the several Grounds of the Pretences, both of the Pope, and of the Presbyterians, by which they claim a Right to govern us, as they do, in chief, and after that from whence, and when crept in the Pretences of that long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Democracy.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>As for the Papists, they challenge this Right from a Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and other like Texts, according to the old Latin Translation in these words. <hi>And he that out of pride shall refuse to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of that Priest, which shall at that time minister before the Lord thy God; that Man shall, by the Sentence of the Judge, be put to death.</hi> And because, as the Jews were the People of God then, so is all Christendome the People of God now; they infer from thence, that the Pope,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56428:8"/>
whom they pretend to be the High-Priest of all Christian People, ought also to be obeyed in all his Decrees, by all Christians, upon pain of death. Again; whereas in the New Testament Christ saith, <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth; go therefore and teach all Nations, and baptize them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and teach them to observe all these things that I have commanded you.</hi> From thence they infer, that the Command of the Apostles was to be obeyed, and by consequence the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were bound to be govern'd by them, and especially by the Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his Successors the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>For the Text in the Old Testament, I do not see how the Commandment of God to the Jews to obey their Priests, can be interpreted to have the like force in the Case of other Nations Christian, more than upon Nations Unchristian; for all the World are Gods People; unless we also grant, that a King cannot of an Infidel be made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, without making himself subject to the Laws of that Apostle, or Priest, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister that shall convert him. The Jews were a peculiar People of God, a Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Kingdom, and bound to no other Law, but what first <hi>Moses,</hi> and afterwards every
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56428:8"/>
High-Priest did go and receive immediately from the mouth of God in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the Tabernacle of the Ark, and in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of the Temple. And for the Text in St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> I know the Words in the Gospel are not <hi>Go teach,</hi> but <hi>Go and make Disciples</hi>; and that there is a great difference between a Subject and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple, and between Teaching and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding. And if such Texts as these must be so interpreted, why do not Christian Kings lay down their Titles of Majesty and Sovereignty, and call themselves the Popes Lieutenants? But the Doctors of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church seem to decline that Title of Absolute Power, in their distinction of Power Spiritual and Temporal; but this distinction I do not very well understand.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>By Spiritual Power they mean the Power to determine Points of Faith, and to be Judges in the Inner Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, of Moral Duties, and of a Power to punish those Men that obey not their Precepts by Ecclesiastical Censure, that is, by Excommunication: and this Power, they say, the Pope hath immediately from Christ, without dependence upon any King, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Assembly, whose Subjects they be that stand Excommunicate. But for the Power Temporal, which consists in judging and punishing those Actions that are done
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56428:9"/>
against the Civil Laws, they say, they do not pretend to it directly, but only indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is to say, so far forth as such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions tend to the hindrance or advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion and good Manners, which they mean when they say, <hi>in ordine ad spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia.</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What Power then is left to Kings, and other Civil Sovereigns, which the Pope may not pretend to be his <hi>in ordine ad spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia?</hi>
                        </p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>None, or very little: and this Power the Pope pretends to in all Christendome, but some of his Bishops also in their several Diocesses, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Christ, without deriving it from the Pope.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But what if a Man refuse obedience to this pretended Power of the Pope and his Bishops? What harm can Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation do him, especially if he be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of another Sovereign?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Very great harm; for by the Pope's or Bishop's signification of it, to the Civil Power, he shall be punish'd sufficiently.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>He were in an ill Case then, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to write, or speak in defence of the Civil Power, that must be punish'd by him, whose Rights he defended; like <hi>Vzza</hi> that was slain, because he would needs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, put forth his Hand to keep the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56428:9"/>
Ark from falling. But what if a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should revolt from the Pope at once? what effect could Excommunication have upon the Nation?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, they should have no more Mass said, at least by any of the Popes Priests: Besides, the Pope would have no more to do with them, but cast them off, and so they would be in the same Case, as if a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be cast off by their King, and left to be governed by themselves, or whom they would.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This would not be taken so much for a punishment to the People, as to the King; and therefore when a Pope Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a whole Nation, methinks he rather Excommunicates himself, than them. But I pray you tell me, what were the Rights that the Pope pretended to in the Kingdoms of other Princes?</p>

                        <p>Fifthly, A Power of absolving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Duties, and of their Oaths of Fidelity to their lawful Sovereigns, when the Pope should think fit, for the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heresie.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This Power of absolving Subjects of their Obedience, as also that other of being Judge of Manners and Doctrine, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute a Sovereignty as is possible to be, and consequently there must be two Kingdoms in one and the same Nation, and no Man be able to know which of his Masters he must obey.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>For my part I should rather obey that Master that had the Right of making Laws, and of inflicting Punishments, than him that pretendeth only to a Right of making Canons, that is to say, Rules, and no Right of Co-action, or otherwise punishing, but by Excommunication.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But the Pope pretends also that his Canons are Laws; and for punishing, can there be greater than Excommunication; supposing it true (as the Pope saith it is) that he that dies Excommunicate is damn'd? Which supposition, it seems, you believe not, else you would rather have chosen to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56428:10"/>
obey the Pope, that would cast you Body and Soul into Hell, than the King that can only kill the Body.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>You say true; for it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable in me to believe, that all <hi>English</hi> men (except a few Papists) that have been born and called Hereticks, ever since the Reformation of Religion in <hi>England</hi> should be damn'd.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But for those that die Excommunicate in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at this day, do you not think them also damn'd?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Doubtless he that dies in sin without repentance, is damn'd, and he that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for disobedience to the Kings Laws, either Spiritual or Temporal, is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for sin; and therefore, if he die Excommunicate, and without desire of reconciliation, he dies impenitent. You see what follows; but to die in disobedience to the Precepts and Doctrines of those Men that have no Authority or Jurisdiction over us is quite another Case, and bringeth no such danger with it.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But what is this Heresie which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so cruelly persecutes, as to depose Kings that do not, when they are bidden, turn all Hereticks out of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Heresie is a word, which when it is used without passion, signifies a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56428:11"/>
So the different Sects of the old Philosophers, Academians, Peripateticks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picureans, Stoicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were called Heresies: but in the Christian Church there was in the signification of that word comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a sinful opposition to him that was chief Judge of Doctrines, in order to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mens Souls; and consequently He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie may be said to bear the same relation to the Power Spiritual, that Rebellion doth to the Power Temporal, and is suitably to be persecuted by him that will preserve a Power Spiritual and Dominion over Mens Consciences.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>It would be very well (because we are all of us permitted to read the Holy Scriptures, and bound to make them the Rule of our Actions, both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) that Heresie were by some Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and the particular Opinions set forth, for which a man were to be condemned and punished as a Heretick; for else, not only Men of mean capacity, but even the wisest and devoutest Christian may fall into Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie without any will to oppose the Church; for the Scriptures are hard, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations different of different men.</p>

                        <p>The meaning of the word Heresie is by Law declared in an Act of Parliament in the first year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> wherein it is ordain'd, That the persons who had by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56428:11"/>
the Queens Letters Patents the Authority Spiritual (meaning the High Commission) shall not have Authority to adjudge any Matter or Cause to be Heresie, but only such as heretofore have been adjudged to be Heresie by the Authority of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures, or by the first four Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, or by any other General Council, where the same was declared He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie by the express and plain words of the said Canonical Scriptures, or such as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall be adjudged Heresie by the High Court of Parliament of this Realm, with the Assent of the Clergy in their Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>It seems therefore if there arise any new error that hath not yet been declared Heresie, (and many such may arise) it cannot be judged Heresie without a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; for how foul soever the error be, it cannot have been declar'd Heresie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Scriptures, nor in the Councils, because it was never before heard of, and consequently there can be no error (unless it fall within the compass of Blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, or Treason against the King) for which a man can in Equity be punished. Besides, who can tell what is declared by the Scripture, which every man is allowed to read and interpret to himself? Nay more, what Protestant, either of the Laity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56428:12"/>
or Clergy, (if every General Council can be a competent Judge of Heresie) is not already condemned? for divers Councils have declared a great many of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be Heresie, and that (as they pretend) upon the Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>

                        <p>What are those Points that the first four General Councils have declared He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>The first General Council held at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi> declared all to be Heresie, which was contrary to the Nicene Creed, upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heresie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> which was the denying the Divinity of Christ. The second General Council held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Heresie the Doctrine of <hi>Macedonius</hi>; which was, that the Holy Ghost was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The third Council assembled at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> condemned the Doctrine of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> that there were two Persons in Christ. The fourth held at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> condemned the error of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> that there was but one Nature in Christ. I know of no other Points condemned in these four Councils, but such as concern Church-Government, or the same Doctrines taught by other Men in other words: and these Councils were all called by the Emperors, and by them their Decrees confirmed, at the Petition of the Councils themselves.</p>

                        <p>I see by this, that both the calling of the Council, and the Confirmation of their Doctrine and Church-Government had no obligatory force, but from the Authority of the Emperor. How comes it then to pass, that they take upon them now a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power, and say their Canons are Laws? That Text, <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and Earth,</hi> had the same force then as it hath now, and conferred a Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power on the Councils, not only over Christian Men, but over all Nations in the World,</p>

                        <p>They say no; for the Power they pretend to is derived from this, that when a King was converted from Gentilisme to Christianity, he did by that very submission to the Bishop that converted him, submit to the Bishops Government, and became one of his Sheep; which Right therefore he could not have over any Nation that was not Christian.</p>

                        <p>I believe not; for it is likely enough, if he had told him so plainly, or but made him suspect it, he would either have been

                        <p>But, if he did not tell him so, and that plainly, it was foul play, not only in a Priest, but in any Christian; and for this derivation of their Right from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors consent, it proceeds only from this, that they dare not challenge a Legislative Power, nor call their Canons Laws in any Kingdom in Christendome, farther than the Kings make them so. But in <hi>Peru,</hi> when <hi>Ataba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipa</hi> was King, the Frier told him, that Christ being King of all the World, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the disposing of all the Kingdoms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the Pope, and that the Pope had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Peru</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi>th,</hi> and requir'd <hi>Atabalipa</hi> to resign it; and for refusing it, seized upon his person by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army there present, and murdered him; you see by this how much they claim, when they have power to make it good.</p>

                        <p>After the Inundation of Northern People had overflowed the Western parts of the Empire, and possessed themselves of <hi>Italy,</hi> the People of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves, as well in Temporals as Spirituals to their Bishop; and then first was the Pope a Temporal Prince, and stood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56428:13"/>
no more in so great fear of the Emperors which lived far off at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In this time it was that the Pope began, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Power Spiritual, to encroach upon the Temporal Rights of all other Princes of the West, and so continued gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, till his Power was at the highest in that 300 years or thereabout, which passed between the 8<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, that is, between the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third, and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third.

Shortly after, the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> having recover'd their Estate, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great retook it, and gave it to the Church again, and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third made <hi>Charles</hi> Emperor.</p>

                        <p>But this Gift of the Empire was in a more special manner, in such a manner as <hi>Moses</hi> had the Government of <hi>Israel</hi> given him, or rather as <hi>Joshuah</hi> had it given him, to go in and out before the People, as the High-Priest should direct him; and so the Empire was understood to be given him, on condition to be directed by the Pope; for when the Pope invested him with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ornaments, the People all cried out, <hi>Deus dat,</hi> that is to say, 'tis God that gives it; and the Emperor was contented so to take it. And from that time all, or most of the Christian Kings, do put into their Titles the words <hi>Dei gratia,</hi> that is, by the Gift of God, and their Successors use still to receive the Crown and Scepter from a Bishop.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis certainly a very good Custom for Kings to be put in mind, by whose Gift they Reign; but it cannot from that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom be inferr'd, that they receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by mediation of the Pope, or by any other Clergy: for the Popes themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Papacy from the Emperor. The first that ever was elected Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> after Emperors were Christians, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Emperors consent, excused himself by Letters to the Emperor with this; That the People and Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> forced him to take it upon him, and prayed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56428:14"/>
to confirm it; which the Emperor did; but with reprehension of their proceedings, and prohibition of the like for the time to come: The Emperor was <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and the Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the first.</p>

                        <p>You see by this the Emperor never acknowledged this Gift of God was the Gift of the Pope, but maintained, the Popedom was the Gift of the Emperor, but in process of time, by the negligence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, (for the greatness of Kings makes them that they cannot easily descend into the obscure and narrow Mines of an ambitious Clergy) they found means to make the People believe, there was a Power in the Pope and Clergy, which they ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto, rather than to the Commands of their own Kings, whensoever it should come into controversie. And to that end devised and decreed many new Articles of Faith, to the diminution of the Authority of Kings, and to the disjunction of them and their Subjects, and to a closer adherence of their Subjects to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Articles either not at all found in, or not well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Scriptures. As first; that it should not be lawful for a Priest to marry.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Do you not see, that by this the King must of necessity either want the Priesthood,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56428:15"/>
and therewith a great part of the Reverence due to him from the most religious part of his Subjects, or else want lawful Heirs to succeed him: by which means, being not taken for the Head of the Church, he was sure in any Controversie between him and the Pope, that his Subjects would be against him.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Is not a Christian King as much a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop now, as the Heathen Kings were of old; for among them <hi>Episcopus</hi> was a Name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Kings? Is not he a Bishop now, to whom God hath committed the charge of all the Souls of his Subjects, both of the Laity and the Clergy? And though he be in relation to our Saviour, who is the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, but a Sheep, yet compared to his own Subjects, they are all Sheep, both Laique and Clerique, and he only Shepherd. And seeing a Christian Bishop is but a Christian endued with power to govern the Clergy, it follows, that every Christian King is not only a Bishop, but an Arch-bishop, and his whole Dominion his Diocess. And though it were granted, that Imposition of Hands is necessary from a Priest, yet seeing Kings have the Government of the Clergy, that are his Subjects, even before Baptism; the Baptism it self wherein he is receiv'd as a Christian, is a sufficient Imposition of Hands, so that whereas before he was a Bishop, now he is a Christian Bishop.</p>

                        <p>For my part I agree with you: This Prohibition of Marriage to Priests came in about the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the first King of <hi>England</hi>; by which means the Pope had in <hi>England,</hi> what with Secular, and what with Regular Priests, a great many lusty Batchelors at his service. Secondly, That Auricular Confession to a Priest was necessary to Salvation. 'Tis true, that before that time, Confession to a Priest was usual, and performed for the most part (by him that confessed) in writing, but that use was taken away about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and Priests com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take Confessions from the Mouth of the Confitent: and Men did generally believe, that without Confession and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution before their departure out of the World, they could not be saved; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Absolution from a Priest, that they could not be damn'd. You understand by this, how much every Man would stand in awe of the Pope and Clergy, more than they would of the King; and what Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience it is to a State for their Subjects to confess their secret Thoughts to Spies.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, as much as Eternal Torture is more terrible than Death; so much they would fear the Clergy more than the King.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>And though perhaps the <hi>Roman</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy will not maintain, that a Priest hath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56428:16"/>
power to remit sins absolutely, but only with a condition of repentance, yet the People were never so instructed by them; but were left to believe, that whensoever they had Absolution, their precedent sins were all discharged, when their Penance, which they took for Repentance, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. Within the same time began the Article of Transubstantiation; for it had been disputed a long time before in what manner a Man did eat the Body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jesus Christ, as being a Point very difficult for a Man to conceive and imagine clearly; but now it was made very clear, that the Bread was transubstantiated into Christs Body, and so was become no more Bread but Flesh.</p>

                        <p>It seems then that Christ had many Bodies, and was in as many places at once, as there were Communicants.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56428:16"/>
and thereby at the hour of death to save their Souls.</p>

                        <p>Besides these and other Articles tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the upholding of the Popes Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they had many fine Points in their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Politie, conducing to the same end; of which I will mention only such as were established within the same time. For then it was the Order came up of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friars, that wandred up and down with power to preach in what Congregation they pleased, and were sure enough to instil into the People nothing that might lessen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but on the contrary, whatsoever might give advantage to it against the Civil Power. Besides, they privately insinuated themselves with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Men of weak Judgment, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their adherence to the Pope, and urging them in the time of their sickness, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to it by contribution of Money, or building Religious Houses, or Pious Works, and necessary for the remission of their sins.</p>

                        <p>I do not remember that I have read of any Kingdom or State in the World, where liberty was given to any private Man to call the People together, and make Orations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56428:17"/>
frequently to them, or at all, without first making the State acquainted, except only in Christendome. I believe the Heathen Kings foresaw, that a few such Orators would be able to make a great Sedition. <hi>Moses</hi> did indeed command to read the Scriptures, and expound them in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day; but the Scriptures then were nothing else but the Laws of the Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them by <hi>Moses</hi> himself; and I believe it would do no hurt, if the Laws of <hi>England</hi> also were often read and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the several Congregations of <hi>English</hi>-men, at times appointed, that they may know what to do; for they know already what to believe.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>I think that neither the preaching of Friers nor Monks, nor of Parochial Priests, tended to teach Men what, but whom to believe: for the Power of the Mighty hath no foundation, but in the opinion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the People; and the end which the Pope had in multiplying Sermons, was no other, but to prop and enlarge his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all Christian Kings and States.</p>
                        <p>Within the same time, that is, between the time of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> began their second Politie, which was to bring Religion into an Art, and thereby to maintain all the Decrees of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56428:17"/>
Church by disputation; not only from the Scriptures, but also from the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> both Moral and Natural; and to that end the Pope exhorted the said Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by Letter to erect Schools of all kinds of Literature, and from thence began the Institution of Universities; for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Universities began in <hi>Paris</hi> and in <hi>Oxford.</hi> It is true, that there were Schools in <hi>England</hi> before that time, in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the instruction of Children in the Latin Tongue, that is to say, in the Tongue of the Church; but for an University of Learning, there was none erected till that time; thoogh it be not unlikely there might be then some that taught Philosophy, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and other Arts in divers Monasteries, the Monks having little else to do, but to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. After some Colledges were built to that purpose, it was not long time before many more were added to them, by the devotion of Princes and Bishops, and other wealthy Men: and the Discipline therein was confirmed by the Popes that then were, and abundance of Scholars sent thither by their Friends to study, as to a place, from whence the way was open and easie to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment both in Church and Common-wealth. The profit the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> expected from them, and in effect receiv'd, was the maintenance of the Popes Doctrine,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56428:18"/>
and of his Authority over Kings, and their Subjects, by School-Divines, who striving to make good many Points of Faith incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, and calling in the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle</hi> to their assistance, wrote great Books of School-Divinity, which no man else, nor they themselves were able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; as any man may perceive that shall consider the Writings of <hi>Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> or of him that wrote Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon him, or of <hi>Suarez,</hi> or any other School-Divine of later times; which kind of Learning nevertheless hath been much admir'd by two sorts of Men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prudent enough; the one of which sorts were of those that were already devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and really affectionate to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: for they believed the Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but admir'd the Arguments because they understood them not, and yet found the Conclusions to their mind. The other sort were negligent Men, that had rather admire with others, than take the pains to examine. So that all sorts of People were fully resolv'd, that both the Doctrine was true, and the Pope's Authority, no more than what was due to him.</p>

                        <p>First, the Priests, Monks and Friars being in the heighth of their power, were now for the most part grown insolent and licentious, and thereby the force of their Arguments was now taken away by the scandal of their Lives, which the Gentry and Men of good Education easily perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Parliament consisting of such persons, were therefore willing to take away
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56428:19"/>
their Power; and generally the Common People, which from a long Custom had been in love with Parliaments, were not displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. Secondly, the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> beginning a little before, was now by a great many men of the greatest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so well received; as that there was no hope to restore the Pope to his Power by Rebellion. Thirdly, the Revenue of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and all other Religious Houses falling hereby into the Kings Hands, and by him being disposed of to the most Eminent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in every County, could not but make them do their best to confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the possession of them. Fourthly, King <hi>Henry</hi> was of a Nature quick and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the punishing of such as should be the first to oppose his Designs. Lastly, (as to Invasion from abroad) in case the Pope had given the Kingdom to another Prince, it had been in vain; for <hi>England</hi> is another manner of Kingdom than <hi>Navarre.</hi> Besides, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces were employed at that time one against another: and though they had been at leisure, they would have found perhaps no better success, than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found afterwards in 1588. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the Insolence, Avarice and Hypocrisie of the then Clergy, and notwithstanding the Doctrine of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> if the Pope had not provoked the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56428:19"/>
King by endeavouring to cross his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his second Wife, his Authority might have remained in <hi>England,</hi> till there had risen some other quarrel.</p>

                        <p>Did not the Bishops that then were, and had taken an Oath, wherein was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things, that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain the Regal Rights of St. <hi>Peter</hi>; the words are, <hi>Regalia Sancti Petri,</hi> which nevertheless some have said are <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Sancti Petri,</hi> that is to say, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Rules or Doctrine; and that the Clergy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward did read it (being perhaps written in Short-hand) by a mistake to the Pope's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <hi>Regalia:</hi> Did not I say the Bishops oppose that Act of Parliament against the Pope, and against the taking of the Oath of Supremacy?</p>

                        <p>No, I do not find the Bishops did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them oppose the King; for having no power without him, it had been great imprudence to provoke his anger. There was besides a Controversie in those times between the Pope and the Bishops, most of which did maintain, that they exercised their Jurisdiction Episcopal in the Right of God, as immediately as the Pope himself did exercise the same over the whole Church. And because they saw that by this Act of the King in Parliament they were to hold their Power no more of the Pope, and never
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56428:20"/>
thought of holding it of the King, they were perhaps better content to let that Act of Parliament pass. In the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> had taken so great root in <hi>England,</hi> that they threw out also a great many of the Popes new Articles of Faith; which Queen <hi>Mary</hi> succeeding him restored again, together with all that had been abolished by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> saving (that which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored) the Religious Houses; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Clergy of King <hi>Edward</hi> were partly burnt for Hereticks, partly fled, and partly recanted: and they that fled betook themselves to those places beyond Sea, where the Reformed Religion was either protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not persecuted; who after the decease of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> returned again to favour and preferment under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the Religion of her Brother King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> And so it hath continued till this day, excepting the Interruption made in this late Rebellion of the Presbyterians and other Democratical Men. But though the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion were now cast out by the Law, yet there were abundance of people, and many of them of the Nobility, that still retained the Religion of their Ancestors, who as they were not much molested in Points of Conscience, so they were not by their own Inclination very troublesome to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56428:20"/>
the Civil Government; but by the secret practice of the Jesuites and other Emissaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they were made less quiet, than they ought to have been; and some of them to venture upon the most horrid Act that ever had been heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I mean the Gunpowder-Treason. And upon that account, the Papists of <hi>England</hi> have been looked upon as Men that would not be sorry for any disorders here, that might possibly make way to the restoring of the Popes Authority; and therefore I named them for one of the distempers of the State of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of our late King <hi>Charles.</hi>

                        <p>It is manifest they did perceive it. How else durst they make War against the Pope, and some of them take him out of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and carry him away Prisoner? But if they would have freed themselves from his Tyranny, they should have agreed together, and made themselves every one
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56428:21"/>
(as <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> did) Head of the Church within their own respective Dominions; but not agreeing, they let his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, every one hoping to make use of it (when there should be cause) against his Neighbour.</p>

                        <p>This Controversie between the Papist and the Reformed Churches, could not choose but make every man, to the best of his power, examine by the Scriptures which of them was in the right; and to that end they were translated into Vulgar Tongues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the Translation of them was not allowed, nor any Man to read them, but such as had express licence so to do: for the Pope did concerning the Scriptures the same that <hi>Moses</hi> did concerning Mount <hi>Sinai: Moses</hi> suffered no man to go up to it to hear God speak, or gaze upon him, but such as he himself took with him; and the Pope suffered none to speak with God in the Scriptures, that had not some part of the Pope's Spirit in him, for which he might be trusted.</p>

                        <p>Certainly <hi>Moses</hi> did therein very wisely, and according to God's own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>

                        <p>No doubt of it, and the event it self hath made it since appear so: for after the Bible was translated into <hi>English,</hi> every Man, nay every Boy and Wench, that could read <hi>English,</hi> thought they spoke with God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and understood what he said, when by a certain number of Chapters a day, they had read the Scriptures once or twice over, the Reverence and Obedience due to the Reformed Church here, and to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastors therein, was cast off, and every Man became a Judge of Religion, and an Interpreter of the Scriptures to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

                        <p>I confess this Licence of Interpreting the Scripture was the cause of so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects as have lain hid, till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the late Kings Reign, and did then appear to the disturbance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But to return to the Story; those persons that fled for Religion in the time of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56428:22"/>
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> resided, for the most part, in places where the Reformed Religion was profess'd, and governed by an Assembly of Ministers, who also were not a little made use of (for want of better States-men) in Points of Civil Government, which pleased so much the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Protestants that lived amongst them, that at their return they wished there were the same Honour and Reverence given to the Ministry in their own Countries; in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (King <hi>James</hi> being then young) soon (with the help of some of the powerful Nobility) they brought it to pass. Also they that returned into <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> endeavoured the same here; but could never effect it, till this last Rebellion, nor without the help of the <hi>Scots:</hi> and it was no sooner effected, but they were defeated again by the other Sects, which, by the preaching of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and private Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, were grown numerous.</p>

                        <p>I know indeed, that in the beginning of the late War, the Power of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians was so very great, that, not only the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were, almost all of them, at their devotion, but also the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of all other Cities and Market-Towns of <hi>England.</hi> But you have not yet told me by what Art and what Degrees they became so strong.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>It was not their own Art alone that did it, but they had the concurrence of a great many Gentlemen that did no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Popular Government in the Civil State, than these Ministers did in the Church: and as these did in the Pulpit draw the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their Opinions, and to a dislike of the Church-Government, Canons, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, so did the other make them in love with Democracy by their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues in the Parliament, and by their Discourses and Communication with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Country, continually extolling of Liberty, and inveighing against Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, leaving the People to collect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that this Tyranny was the present Government of the State; and as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians brought with them into their Churches their Divinity from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, so did many of the Gentlemen bring their Politicks from thence into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but neither of them did this very boldly in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And though it be not likely that all of them did it out of malice, but many of them out of error; yet certainly the Chief Leaders were ambitious Ministers and ambitious Gentlemen; the Ministers envying the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Bishops, whom they thought less learned; and the Gentlemen envying the Privy-Council, whom they thought less
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56428:23"/>
wise than themselves. For 'tis a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Men who do all think highly of their own Wits (when they have also acquired the Learning of the University) to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that they want any ability requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the Government of a Common-wealth, especially having read the glorious Histories, and the sententious Politiques of the ancient popular Governments of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> amongst whom Kings were hated, and branded with the name of Tyrants, and Popular Government (though no Tyrant was ever so cruel as a Popular Assembly) passed by the Name of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Presbyterian Ministers, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did not (because they durst not) publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach against the Discipline of the Church; but not long after (by the favour perhaps of some great Courtier) they went abroad preaching into most of the Market-Towns of <hi>England,</hi> as the preaching Friars had formerly done, upon working days in the Morning: in which Sermons these, and others of the same Tenets, that had charge of Souls, both by the manner and matter of their preaching, applyed themselves wholly to the winning of the People to a liking of their Doctrines, and good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their persons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56428:23"/>And first for the manner of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they so framed their countenance and gesture at the entrance into the Pulpit, and their pronuntiation, both in their Prayer and Sermon, and used the Scripture phrase, whether understood by the People or not, as that no Tragoedian in the World could have acted the part of a right godly Man better than these did; in so much as a Man unacquainted with such Art, could never suspect any ambitious plot in them, to raise Sedition against the State, (as they then had design'd) or doubt that the vehemence of their Voice, (for the same words with the usual pronuntiation had been of little force) and forcedness of their Gesture and Looks, could arise from any thing else, but zeal to the Service of God. And by this Art they came into such credit, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men used to go forth of their own Parishes and Towns, on working-days, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Calling, and on <hi>Sundays,</hi> leaving their own Churches to hear them preach in other places, and to despise their own, and all other Preachers that acted not so well as they: and as for those Ministers that did not usually preach, but in stead of Sermons did read to the People such Homilies as the Church had appointed, they esteemed and called them Dumb Dogs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56428:24"/>Secondly, For the matter of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, because the anger of the People in the late <hi>Roman</hi> Usurpation, was then fresh, they saw there could be nothing more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious with them, than to preach against such other Points of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, as the Bishops had not yet condemned; that so receding farther from Popery than they did, they might with glory to themselves leave a suspicion on the Bishops, as Men not yet well purged from Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Before their S<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ons, their Prayer was, or seem'd to be <hi>extempore,</hi> which they pretended to be dictated by the Spirit of God within them, and many of the People believed, or seemed to believe it: for any man might see, that had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they did not take care before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what they should say in their Prayers. And from hence came a dislike of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book, which is a set form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated, that Men might see to what they were to say <hi>Amen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, They did never in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or but lightly inveigh against the Lucrative vices of Men of Trade or Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft; such as are Feigning, Lying, Cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hypocrisie, or other uncharitableness, except want of Charity to their Pastors and to the Faithful; which was a great ease to the generality of Citizens, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56428:24"/>
of Market Towns, and no little profit to themselves.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, By preaching up an Opinion, that Men were to be assured of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Testimony of their own private Spirit, meaning the Holy Ghost dwelling within them. And from this Opinion the People that found in themselves a sufficient hatred towards the Papists, and an ability to repeat the Sermons of these Men at their coming home, made no doubt but that they had all that was necessary, how fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and spightfully soever they behaved themselves to their Neighbours that were not reckoned amongst the Saints, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to those also.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, They did indeed with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness and severity inveigh often against two sins, Carnal Lusts, and Vain Swearing, which without question was very well done: but the common People were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inclin'd to believe, that nothing else was sin, but that which was forbidden in the Third and Seventh Commandment: for few Men do understand by the name of Lust any other concupiscence, than that which is forbidden in that Seventh Commandment; for Men are not ordinarily said to lust after another Man's Cattle, or other Goods, or Possessions, and therefore never made much scruple of the Acts of fraud and malice,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56428:25"/>
but endeavoured to keep themselves from uncleanness only, or at least from the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of it. And whereas they did, both in their Sermons and Writings, maintain and inculcate, that the very first motions of the mind, that is to say, the delight Men and Women took in the sight of one another's Form, though they checked the proceeding thereof, so that it never grew up to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, was nevertheless a sin, they brought young men into desperation, and to think themselves damn'd, because they could not (which no Man can, and is contrary to the constitution of Nature) behold a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Object without delight: and by this means they became Confessors to such as were thus troubled in Conscience, and were obeyed by them as their Spiritual Doctors in all Cases of Conscience.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, divers of them did preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently against oppression.</p>

                        <p>'Tis true, I had forgot that: but it was before such as were free enough from it, I mean the common People, who would easily believe themselves oppressed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Oppressors. And therefore you may reckon this amongst their Artifices to make the People believe they were oppressed by the King, or perhaps by the Bishops, or both; and incline the meaner sort to their Party afterward, when there should be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56428:25"/>
But this was but sparingly done in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose fear and jealousie they were afraid of. Nor had they as yet any great power in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House, whereby to call in question her Prerogative by Petitions of Right, and other Devices, as they did afterwards, when Democratical Gentlemen had receiv'd them into their Councels, for the design of changing the Government from Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to Popular, which they called Liberty.</p>

                        <p>Who would think that such horrible designs as these could so easily and so long remain covered with the Cloak of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: for that they were most impious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites is manifest enough by the War these proceedings ended in, and by the impious Acts in that War committed.

                        <p>As to the time of attempting the change of Government from Monarchical to Democratical, we must distinguish. They did not challenge the Sovereignty in plain terms, and by that Name, till they had slain the King, nor the Rights thereof alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by particular Heads, till the King was driven from <hi>London</hi> by Tumults, raised in that City against him, and retir'd for the security of his Person to <hi>York,</hi> where he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56428:26"/>
bad not been many days, when they sent unto him 19 Propositions, whereof above a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen were Demands of several Powers, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential parts of the Power Sovereign. But before that time they had demanded some of them (in a Petition which they called a Petition of Right) which nevertheless the King had granted them in a former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though he deprived himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not only of the Power to levy Money without their consent, but also of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revenue by Custom of Tonnage and Poundage, and of the Liberty to put into Custody such Men as he thought likely to disturb the Peace, and raise Sedition in the Kingdom. As for the Men that did this, 'tis enough to say they were the Members of the last Parliament, and of some other Parliaments in the beginning of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the end of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign; to name them all is not necessary, farther than the Story shall require. Most of them were Members of the House of Commons; some few also of the Lords; but all such as had a great opinion of their sufficiency in Politicks, which they thought was not sufficiently taken notice of by the King.</p>

                        <p>How could the Parliament when the King had a great Navy, and a great number of Train'd Soldiers, and all the Magazines
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56428:26"/>
of Ammunition in his power, be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the War?</p>

                        <p>The King had these things indeed in his right, but that signifies little; when they that had the Custody of the Navy and Magazines, and with them all the Train'd Soldiers, and in a manner all his Subjects, were by the preaching of Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and the seditious whisperings of false and ignorant Politicians, made his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And when the King could have no Money but what the Parliament should give him, which you may be sure should not be enough to maintain his Regal Power, which they intended to take from him.</p>
                        <p>And yet I think they would never have adventured into the Field, but for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky business of imposing upon the <hi>Scots</hi> (who were all Presbyterians) our Book of Common-Prayer; for I believe the <hi>English</hi> would never have taken well that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament should make War upon the King upon any provocation, unless it were in their own defence, in case the King should first make War upon them; and therefore it behooved them to provoke the King, that he might do something that might look like Hostility. It happened in the Year 1637. that the King by the Advice, as it is thought, of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent down a Book
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56428:27"/>
of Common-Prayer into <hi>Scotland,</hi> not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in substance from ours, nor much in words, besides the putting of the word Presbyter for that of Minister, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be used (for conformity to this Kingdom) by the Ministers there, for an ordinary Form of Divine Service: This being read in the Church at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a Tumult there, that he that read it had much ado to escape with his life, and gave occasion to the greatest part of the Nobility and others to enter by their own Authority, into a Covenant amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which impudently they called a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, to put down Episcopacy, without consulting with the King; which they presently did, animated thereto by their own confidence, or by assurance from some of the Democratical <hi>English</hi>-men, that in former Parliaments had been the greatest opposers of the King's Interest, that the King would not be able to raise an Army to chastise them without calling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which would be sure to favour them: For the thing which those Domocraticals chiefly then aimed at, was to force the King to call a Parliament, which he had not done of ten years before, as having found no help, but hinderance to his Designs in the Parliaments he had formerly called. Howsoever contrary to their expectation,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56428:27"/>
by the help of his better affected Subjects of the Nobility and Gentry, he made a shift to raise a sufficient Army to have reduced the <hi>Scots</hi> to their former obedience, if it had proceeded to battle: and with this Army he marched himself into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was also brought into the Field against him, as if they meant to fight: but then the <hi>Scoth</hi> sent to the King for leave to treat by Commissioners on both sides; and the King willing to avoid the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own Subjects, condescended to it. The Issue was peace, and the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon went to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and passed an Act of Parliament there to their satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                        <p>No, but yielded to the abolishing of it: but by this means the <hi>English</hi> were cross'd in their hope of a Parliament, but the said Democraticals, formerly opposers of the King's Interest, ceased not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour still to put the two Nations into a War; to the end the King might buy the Parliaments help at no less a price than So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty it self.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56428:28"/>
great Divines, as to know what was the true Church-discipline established by our Saviour and his Apostles; nor yet so much in love with their Ministers as to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd by them in the Government either Ecclesiastical or Civil; for in their lives they were just as other Men are, pursuers of their own Interests and Preferments, wherein they were not more opposed by the Bishops than by their Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>

                        <p>Truly I do not know; I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into other Mens thoughts farther than I am led by the consideration of Humane Nature in general: But upon this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I see first, that Men of ancient Wealth and Nobility are not apt to brook, that poor Scholars should (as they must when they are made Bishops) be their fellows. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That from the Emulation of Glory between the Nations they might be willing to see this Nation afflicted by Civil War, and might hope by aiding the Rebels here, to acquire some power over the <hi>English,</hi> at least so far as to establish here the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Discipline; which was also one of the Points they afterwards openly demanded. Lastly, They might hope for, in the War, some great Sum of Money, as a reward of their assistance, besides great booty, which they afterwards obtained. But whatsoever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56428:28"/>
was the cause of their hatred to Bishops, the pulling of them down was not all they aimed at: If it had, (now that Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was abolished by Act of Parliament) they would have rested satisfied, which they did not: for after the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Democraticals, by whose favour they had put down Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> thought it reason to have the assistance of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> for the pulling down of Bishops in <hi>England.</hi> And in order thereunto, they might perhaps deal with the <hi>Scots</hi> secretly, to rest unsatisfied with that Pacification, which they were before contented with. Howsoever it was, not long after the King was returned to <hi>London,</hi> they sent up to some of their Friends at Court a certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per containing (as they pretended) the Articles of the said Pacification, a false and scandalous Paper, which was by the King's Command burnt (as I have heard) pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; and so both parts returned to the same condition they were in, when the King went down with his Army.</p>

the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> a Man that wanted not either Valour or Judgment. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Battle, or to Treaty, was not in his power, but in the King's.</p>

                        <p>He was a Man of a most Noble and Loyal Family, and whose Ancestors had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given a great overthrow to the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their own Country, and in all likelihood he might have given them the like now, if they had fought.</p>

                        <p>He might indeed: but it had been but a kind of superstition to have made him General upon that account, though many Generals heretofore have been chosen for the good luck of their Ancestors in like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.

But in stead of taking the Kings business, which was the raising of Money, into their Consideration, they fell upon the redressing of Grievances, and especially such ways of levying Money as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56428:30"/>
in the late Intermission of Parliaments the King had been forced to use, such as were Ship-Money, for Knighthood, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vails (as one may call them) of the Regal Office, which Lawyers had found justifiable by the Ancient Records of the Kingdom. Besides, they fell upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of divers Ministers of State, though done by the King's own Command and Warrant; in so much, that before they were to come to the business for which they were called, the Money which was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this War (if they had given any, as they never meant to do) had come too late. It is true, there was mention of a Sum of Money to be given the King, by way of bargain, for the relinquishing of his Right to Ship-Money, and some other of his Prerogatives, but so seldom, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining any Sum, that it was in vain for the King to hope for any success; and therefore upon the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he dissolved it.</p>

                        <p>And the <hi>Scotch</hi> have their Parliaments, wherein their assent is requir'd to the Laws there made, which is as good. Have not many of the Provinces of <hi>France</hi> their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parliaments and several Constitutions? and yet they are all equally natural Subjects to the King of <hi>France</hi>: and therefore for my part, I think they were mistaken, both

                           <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> in calling one another Forreigners. Howsoever that be, the King had a very sufficient Army, wherewith he marched towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by that time he was come to <hi>York,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was drawn up to the Frontiers, and ready to march into <hi>England</hi>; which also they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently did, giving out all the way, that their March should be without damage to the Countrey, and that their Errand was only to deliver a Petition to the King, for the redress of many pretended Injuries they had receiv'd from such of the Court, whose Counsel the King most followed; so they passed through <hi>Northumberland</hi> quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till they came to a Ford in the River of <hi>Tine,</hi> a little above <hi>New-Castle,</hi> where they found some little opposition from a Party of the King's Army sent thither to stop them, whom the <hi>Scotch</hi> easily master'd, and as soon as they were over, seiz'd upon <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and coming farther on, upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and sent to the King to desire a Treaty, which was granted, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners on both sides met at <hi>Rippon.</hi> The Conclusion was, that all should be referr'd to the Parliament, which the King should call to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> on the third of <hi>November</hi> following, being in the same Year 1640. and thereupon the King return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>No; the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was to be defrayed by the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Duresme,</hi> and the King was to pay his own, till the disbanding of both should be agreed upon in Parliament.</p>

Therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to proceed with him like skilful Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; first to single him out by Men dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in all parts to drive him into the open Field, and then in case he should but seem to turn head, to call that a making of War against the Parliament.</p>

The King not protecting these, they proceeded to call in question some of the King's own Actions in his Ministers, whereof they imprisoned some, and some went beyond Sea.

equity he should depend on others for the means of performing it, or if he do, they are his Sovereign, not he theirs. And as for the Common Law contained in Reports, they have no force, but what the King gives them. Besides, it were more unreasonable, that a corrupt or foolish Judge his unjust Sentence, should by any time, how long soever, obtain the Authority and Force of a Law. But amongst the Statute Laws there is one called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Great Charter of the Liberties of <hi>English</hi>-men, in which there is one Article, wherein a King heretofore hath granted, That no Man shall be distrained, that is, have his Goods taken from him, otherwise than by the Law of the Land.</p>

And therefore the Light of that Doctrine has been hitherto covered, and kept under here by a cloud of Adversaries, which no private man's Reputation can break through, without the Authority of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities; but out of the Universities came all those Preachers that taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

                        <p>It seems, for the time, they began in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; before which time, I doubt not but that there were many Grammar Schools for the Latin Tongue, which was the natural Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, that is to say, Schools for the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in general, and especially for Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is manifest, that the Institution of them was recommended by the Pope's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and recommended farther by a Council held in his time, I think, at <hi>Chalon sur Saone</hi>; and not long after was erected an University at <hi>Paris</hi>; and the Colledge call'd <hi>Vniversity-Colledge</hi> at <hi>Oxford:</hi> And so by degrees seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bishops, Noble-men and Rich-men, and some Kings and Queens contributing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,

the Universities obtained at last their present splendor.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>What other design was he like to have, but what you heard before, the advancement of his own Authority in the Countries where the Universities were erected? There they learned to dispute for him, and with unintelligible distinctions to blind mens Eyes, whilst they incroached upon the Right of Kings; and it was an evident Argument of that Design, that they fell in hand with the work so quickly. For the first Rector of the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> as I have read somewhere, was <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> who first brought in them the Learning called School-Divinity; and was seconded by <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Duns,</hi> who lived in, or near the same time, whom any ingenious Reader, not knowing what was the Design, would judge to have been two the most egregious Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads in the World, so obscure and senseless are their Writings. And from these the School-men that succeeded, learnt the trick of imposing what they list upon their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and declining the force of true Reason by Verbal Forkes, I mean Distinctions that signifie nothing, but serve only to astonish the multitude of ignorant Men. As for the understanding Readers, they were so few, that these new sublime Doctors cared
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56428:37"/>
not what they thought. These School men were to make good all the Articles of Faith, which the Popes from time to time should command to be believ'd: amongst which there were very many inconsistent with the Rights of Kings, and other Civil Sovereigns, as asserting to the Pope all Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they should declare to be necessary, <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> that is to say, in order to Religion.</p>
                        <p>From the Universities also it was, That all Preachers proceeded, and were poured out into City and Country to terrifie the People into an absolute obedience to the Pope's Canons and Commands, which for fear of wakening Kings and Princes too much, they durst not yet call Laws.</p>
                        <p>From the Universities it was, That the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle</hi> was made an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Religion, as serving for a Salve to a great many of absurd Articles, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Christ's Body, and the Estate of Angels and Saints in Heaven; which Articles they thought fit to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, because they bring some of them profit, and others reverence to the Clergy, even to the meanest of them: for when they shall have made the People believe that the meanest of them can make the Body of Christ, who is there that will not both shew them reverence, and be liberal to them,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56428:38"/>
or to the Church, especially in the time of their sickness, when they think they make and bring unto them their Saviour?</p>

                        <p>Very much in questions concerning the Nature of God, and concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Man's Soul after death, in Heaven, Hell and Purgatory; by which you, and every man knows, how great obedience, and how much Money they gain from the Common People. Whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul of Man to be the first giver of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56428:38"/>
motion to the Body, and consequently to it self; they make use of that in the Doctrine of Free-will; what, and how they gain by that, I will not say.</p>
                        <p>He holdeth forth, that there be many things that come to pass in this World from no necessity of Causes, but meer Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Casualty and Fortune.</p>

                        <p>Methinks, in this they make God stand idle, and to be a meer Spectator of the Games of Fortune; for what God is the cause of must needs come to pass, and in my opinion, nothing else. But because there must be some ground for the Justice of the Eternal Torment of the damned; perhaps it is this, that mens Wills and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions are not (they think) in the Hands of God, but of themselves; and in this also I see somewhat conducing to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church.</p>

                        <p>This is not much, nor was <hi>Aristotle</hi> of such credit with them, but that when his Opinion was against theirs, they could slight him. Whatsoever he says is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in nature, they can prove well enough to be possible, from the Almighty Power of God, who can make many Bodies to be in one and the self-same place, and one Body to be in many places at the same time, if the Doctrine of Transubstantiation require it, though <hi>Aristotle</hi> deny it. I like not the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56428:39"/>
Design of drawing Religion into an Art, whereas it ought to be a Law; and though not the same in all Countries, yet in every Country undisputable; nor that they teach it not as Arts ought to be taught, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first the meaning of their Terms, and then deriving from them the truth they would have us believe; nor that their Terms are, for the most part, unintelligible, though to make it seem rather want of Learning in the Reader, than want of fair dealing in themselves: They are, for the most part, Latin and Greek words, wryed a little at the point, towards the Native Language of the several Countries, where they are used: But that which is most intolerable is, that all Clerks are forced to make as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them, if they mean to have any Church-preferment, the Keys whereof are in the Pope's Hands; and the Common People, whatsoever they believe of those subtile Doctrines, are never esteemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sons of the Church for their Learning. There is but one way there to Salvation, that is, extraordinary Devotion and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Church, and readiness for the Churches sake, if it be requir'd, to fight against their Natural and Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</p>

                        <p>I see what use they make of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Logick, Physicks, and Metaphysicks; but

                        <p>Nor I. It has (I think) done them no good, though it has done us here much hurt by accident: for men grown weary at last of the Insolence of the Priests, and examining the truth of these Doctrines that were put upon them, began to search the sense of the Scriptures, as they are in the learned Languages, and consequently stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Greek and Latin, became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Democratical Principles of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> and from the love of their Eloquence, fell in love with their Politicks, and that more and more, till it grew into the Rebellion we now talk of, without any other advantage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but that it was a weakening to us, whom since we broke out of their Net, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> they have continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recover.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What have they gotten by the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Ethicks.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>It is some advantage to them, that neither the Morals of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor of any other, have done them any harm, nor us any good. Their Doctrines have caused a great deal of dispute concerning Vertue and Vice, but no knowledge of what they are, nor any method of obtaining Vertue, nor of avoiding Vice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56428:40"/>The end of Moral Philosophy is to teach men of all sorts their duty, both to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and to one another. They estimate Vertue, partly by a Mediocrity of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men, and partly by that that they are praised; whereas it is not the Much, or Little Praise that makes an Action vertuous, but the Cause; nor much or little blame that makes an Action vitious, but its being unconformable to the Laws, in such men as are subject to the Law, or its being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable to Equity or Charity in all men whatsoever.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>It seems you make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ethicks of Subjects, and the Ethicks of Sovereigns.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>So I do. The Vertue of a Subject is comprehended wholly in obedience to the Laws of the Common-wealth. To obey the Laws is Justice and Equity, which is the Law of Nature, and consequently is Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law in all Nations of the World: and nothing is Injustice or Iniquity otherwise than it is against the Law. Likewise to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Laws is the Prudence of a Subject; for without such obedience the Common-wealth (which is every Subject's safety and protection) cannot subsist. And though it be prudence also in private men, justly and moderately to enrich themselves, yet crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to with-hold from the Publick, or defraud
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56428:40"/>
it of such part of their wealth, as is by Law requir'd, is no sign of prudence, but of want of knowledge of what is necessary for their own defence.</p>
                        <p>The Vertues of Sovereigns are such as tend to the maintenance of peace at home, and to the resistance of Forreign Enemies. Fortitude is a Royal Vertue, and though it be necessary in such private men as shall be Soldiers, yet for other men, the less they dare, the better it is, both for the Common-wealth, and for themselves. Frugality (though perhaps you will think it strange) is also a Royal Vertue: for it increases the Publick Stock, which cannot be too great for the Publick Use, nor any man too spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of what he has in trust for the good of others. Liberality also is a Royal Vertue: for the Common-wealth cannot be well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without extraordinary diligence and service of Ministers, and great fidelity to their Sovereigns, who ought therefore to be encouraged, and especially those that do him service in the Wars. In sum, all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Habits are to be esteemed good or evil by their causes and usefulness, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Common-wealth, and not by their Mediocrity, nor by their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: for several men praise several Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and that which is Vertue with one is blamed by others, and contrarily what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56428:41"/>
one calls Vice, another calls Vertue, as their present affections lead them.</p>

                        <p>Methinks you should have placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Vertues that, which in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the greatest of all Vertues, Religion.</p>

                        <p>I think you have not digressed at all: for I suppose your purpose was, to acquaint me with the History, not so much of those Actions that pass'd in the time of the late Troubles, as of their Causes, and of the Councels and Artifice by which they were brought to pass. There be divers men that have written the History, out of whom I might have learned what they did, and somewhat also of the Contrivance; but I find little in them of what I would ask. Therefore since you were pleas'd to enter into this discourse at my request, be pleased also to inform me after my own method: and for the danger of confusion that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from that, I will take care to bring you back to the place from whence I drew you; for I well remember where it was.</p>

                        <p>Well then: To your question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion; in as much as I told you, that all Vertue is comprehended in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of the Common-wealth, whereof Religion is one, I have placed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongst the Vertues.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Is Religion then the Law of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>There is no Nation in the World, whose Religion is not established, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not its Authority from the Laws of that Nation. It is true, that the Law of God receives no evidence from the Laws of Men; but because Men can never by their own wisdom come to the knowledge of what God hath spoken and commanded to be observ'd, nor be obliged to obey the Laws, whose Author they know not, they are to acquiesce in some Humane Authority or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that the Question will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man ought in matter of Religion, that is to say, when there is question of his duty to God and the King, to rely upon the preaching of their Fellow-Subjects, or of a Stranger, or upon the Voice of the Law?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>There is no great difficulty in that Point: for there is none that preach here, or any where else, at least ought to preach, but such as have Authority so to do from him, or them that have the Sovereign Power; so that if the King gives us leave, you or I may as lawfully preach as them that do; and I believe we should perform that Office a great deal better than they that preached us into the Rebellion.</p>

                        <p>The Church Morals are in many Points very different from these that I have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56428:42"/>
here set down, for the Doctrine of Vertue and Vice; and yet without any conformity with that of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the principal Vertues are to obey their Doctrine, though it be Treason, and that is to be Religious: To be beneficial to the Clergy, that is their Piety and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to believe upon their word that which a man knows in his Conscience to be false, which is the Faith they require. I could name a great many more such Points of their Morals, but that I know you know them already, being so well versed in the Cases of Conscience written by their School-men, who measure the goodness and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of all Actions, by their congruity with the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy.</p>

                        <p>I think I can recommend unto you the best that is extant, and such a one as (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few passages that I mislike) is very well worth your reading. The Title of it is, <hi>The whole Duty of Man laid down in a plain and familiar way</hi>; and yet I dare say, that if the Presbyterian Ministers, even those of them which were the most diligent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the late Sedition, were to be tryed by it, they would go near to be found Not Guilty. He has divided the Duty of Man into three great Branches, which are his Duty to God, to Himself, and to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. In his Duty to God he puts the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of him in his Essence and his Attributes, and in the believing of his Word: His Attributes are Omnipotence, Omniscience, Infiniteness, Justice, Truth, Mercy, and all the rest that are found in Scripture. Which of these did not those seditious Preachers acknowledge equally

with the best of Christians? The Word of God are the Books of Holy Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for Canonical in <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>Let us pass over all other Duties, and come to that Duty which we owe to the King, and consider whether the Doctrine taught by those Divines which adhered to the King be such, in that Point, as may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Presbyterians, that incited the People to Rebellion: for that's the thing you call in question.</p>

                        <p>They will say they did it in obedience to God, in as much as they did believe it was according to the Scripture: out of which they will bring Examples perhaps of <hi>David</hi> and his adherents, that resisted King <hi>Saul,</hi> and of the Prophets afterward, that vehemently from time to time preached
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56428:44"/>
against the Idolatrous Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah. Saul</hi> was their lawful King, and yet they paid him neither Active nor Passive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; for they did put themselves into a posture of defence against him, though <hi>David</hi> himself spared his Person; and so did the Presbyterians put into their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their General, that they should spare the King's Person. Besides, you cannot doubt but that they who in the Pulpit did animate the People to take Arms in defence of the then Parliament, alleadged Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, the Word of God for it. If it be lawful then for Subjects to resist the King, when he commands any thing that is against the Scripture, that is contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and to be Judge of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, it is impossible that the Life of any King, or the Peace of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kingdom can be long secure. It is this Doctrine that divides a Kingdom within it self, whatsoever the Men be, Loyal, or Rebels, that write or preach it publickly. And thus you see, that if those seditious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters be tryed by this Doctrine, they will come off well enough.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56428:45"/>
Minister, for the most part an Ignorant, though a ready Tongu'd Scholar, rather than the Laws that were made by the King, with the consent of the Peers and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Land.</p>

                        <p>Let us examine his words a little nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: First, Concerning Passive Obedience. When a Thief hath broken the Laws, and according to the Law is therefore executed, can any man understand, that this suffering of his is an obedience to the Law? Every Law is a Command to do, or to forbear, neither of these is fulfilled by suffering. If any Suffering can be called Obedience, it must be such as is voluntary; for no invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Action can be counted a submission to the Law. He that means that his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be taken for obedience, must not only not resist, but also not fly, nor hide himself to avoid his punishment; and who is there amongst them that discourses of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience, when his Life is in extream danger, that will voluntarily present himself to the Officers of Justice? Do not we see that all men when they are led to Execution are both bound and guarded, and would break loose, if they could, and get away? Such is their Passive Obedience. Christ saith, <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in</hi> Moses <hi>Chair; all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do,</hi> Mat 23.3.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56428:45"/>
which is a doing an Active Obedience: and yet the Scribes and Pharisees appear not by the Scripture to have been such godly men, as never to command any thing against the revealed Will of God.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Must Tyrants also be obeyed in every thing actively? Or is there nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a lawful King's Command may be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed? What if he should command me with my own hands to execute my Father, in case he should be condemn'd to die by the Law?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>This is a Case that need not be put. We never have read, nor heard of any King, or Tyrant so inhumane as to command it. If any did, we are to consider whether that Command were one of his Laws: for by disobeying Kings, we mean the disobeying of his Laws, those his Laws that were made before they were applyed to any particular person: for the King, though as a Father of Children, and a Master of Domestick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet he commands the People in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral never but by a precedent Law, and as a Politick, not a Natural Person. And if such a Command as you speak of were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd into a general Law, (which never was, nor never will be) you were bound to obey it, unless you depart the Kingdom after the Publication of the Law, and before the Condemnation of your Father.</p>

                        <p>Your Author says farther, in refusing Active Obedience to the King that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any thing contrary to God's Law, we must be very well assur'd that the thing is so contrary. I would fain know how it is possible to be assur'd?</p>

                        <p>I think you do not believe that any of those Refusers do, immediately from God's own mouth, receive any command contrary to the Command of the King, who is God's Lieutenant, nor any other way than you and I do, that is to say, than by the Scriptures. And because men do, for the most part, rather draw the Scripture to their own sense, than follow the true sense of the Scripture, there is no other way to know certainly, and in all Cases, what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or forbids us to do, but by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of him or them that are constituted by the King to determine the sense of the Scripture upon hearing of the particular Case of Conscience, which is in question. And they that are so constituted are easily known in all Christian Common-wealths, whether they be Bishops, or Ministers, or Assemblies that govern the Church under him, or them that have the Sovereign Power.</p>

                        <p>Some doubts may be rais'd from this that you now say: for if Men be to learn their Duty from the Sentence which other
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56428:46"/>
Men shall give, concerning the meaning of the Scriptures, and not from their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, I understand not to what end they were translated into <hi>English,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, not only permitted, but also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to read them. For what could that produce but diversity of opinion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently (as Man's Nature is) Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, breach of Charity, Disobedience, and at last Rebellion? Again, since the Scripture was allowed to be read in <hi>English,</hi> why were not the Translations such as might make all that's read understood even by mean Capacities? Did not the <hi>Jews,</hi> such as could read, understand their Law in the Jewish Language, as well as we do our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws in <hi>English?</hi> And as for such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture, as had nothing of the Nature of a Law, it was nothing to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether they were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood or not, seeing nothing is punishable, but the Transgression of some Law.</p>
                        <p>The same Question I may ask concerning the New Testament: for I believe, that those Men to whom the Original Language was natural, did understand sufficiently what Commands and Counsels were given them by our Saviour and his Apostles, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Disciples. Again; how will you answer that Question which was put by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John, Acts</hi> 4.19. when by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56428:47"/>
                           <hi>Annas</hi> the High Priest, and others of the Councel of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they were forbidden to teach any more in the Name of Jesus? Whether is it right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Case is not the same. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had seen, and daily conversed with our Saviour, and by the Miracles he wrought, did know he was God, and consequently knew certainly, that their disobedience to the High-Priests present Command was just. Can any Minister now say, that he hath immediately, from God's own Mouth, receiv'd a Command to disobey the King, or know otherwise, than by the Scripture, that any Command of the King, that hath the Form and Nature of a Law, is against the Law of God; which in divers places di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and evidently commandeth to obey him in all things. The Text you cite does not tell us, that a Minister's Authority, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Christian King's, shall decide the Questions that arise from the different Interpretations of the Scripture. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the King is Head of the Church, and by consequence (to omit, that the Scripture it self was not received, but by the Authority of Kings and States) Chief Judge of the rectitude of all Interpretations of the Scripture. To obey the Kings Laws and publick Edicts is not to disobey, but to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56428:47"/>
obey God. A Minister ought not to think, that his skill in the <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, if he have any, gives him a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to impose upon all his Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects his own sense, or what he pretends to be his sense of every obscure place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; nor ought he, as oft as he hath found out some fine Interpretation, not before thought on by others, to think he had it by Inspiration: for he cannot be assur'd of that; no, nor that his Interpretation, as fine as he thinks it, is not false; and then all his stubbornness and contumacy toward the King, and his Laws, is nothing but Pride of Heart and Ambition, or else Imposture. And whereas you think it needless, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hurtful to have the Scriptures in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> I am of another mind. There are so many places of Scripture easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that teach both true Faith, and good Morality, and that as fully as is necessary to salvation; of which no Seducer is able to dispossess the mind of any ordinary Readers, that the reading of them is so profitable, as not to be forbidden without great damage to them and the Common-wealth.</p>

                        <p>All that is requir'd, both in Faith and Manners, for Man's Salvation, is (I confess) set down in Scripture, as plainly as can be. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey your Parents in all things. Servants obey your Masters. Let all Men be subject to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56428:48"/>
Higher Powers, whether it be the King, or those that are sent by him. Love God with all your Soul, and your Neighbour as your self,</hi> are words of the Scripture, which are well enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: but neither Children, nor the greatest part of Men do understand why it is their Duty to do so. They see not that the safety of the Common-wealth, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their own, depends upon their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Every man by nature, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, does in all his Actions look upon, as far as he can see, the benefit that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to himself from his obedience. He reads that Covetousness is the root of all evil, but he thinks, and sometimes finds it is the root of his Estate. And so in other Cases the Scripture says one thing, and they think another, weighing the Commodities or Incommodities of this present life only, which are in their sight, never putting into the Scales the Good and Evil of the Life to come, which they see not.</p>

These are therefore they, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting the easie places, which teach them their Duty, fall to scanning only of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Religion; such as are, How it may be made out with wit, that there be three that bear Rule in Heaven, and those three but One? How the Deity could be made Flesh? How that Flesh could be really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in many places at once? Where's the Place, and what the Torments of Hell, and other Metaphysical Doctrines? Whether the Will of Man be free, or governed by the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56428:49"/>
Will of God? Whether Sanctity comes by Inspiration or Education? By whom Christ now speaks to us? Whether by the King, or by the Clergy, or by the Bible to every man that reads it and interprets it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or by a private Spirit to every private Man? These and the like Points are the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Curious, and the cause of all our late mischief, and the cause that makes the plainer sort of Men, whom the Scripture had taught belief in Christ, Love towards God, Obedience to the King, and sobriety of behaviour, forget it all, and place their Religion in the disputable Doctrines of these your wise Men.</p>

                        <p>This that you say looks (methinks) like an Advice to the King, to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone till he have gotten ready Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to levy and maintain a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then to fall upon them, and destroy them.</p>

I would have him have Money enough, readily to raise an Army able to suppress any Rebellion, and to take from his Enemies all hope of success, that they may not dare to trouble him in the Reformation of the Universities, but to put none to death without the actual committing such crimes, as are already made Capital by the Laws. The Core of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, as you have seen by this, and read of other Rebellions, are the Universities, which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56428:51"/>
nevertheless are not to be cast away, but to be better disciplin'd; that is to say, that the Politicks there taught be made to be (as true Politicks should be) such as are fit to make men know, that it is their Duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey all Laws whatsoever that shall by the Authority of the King be enacted, till by the same Authority they shall be repealed; such as are fit to make men understand, that the Civil Laws are God's Laws, as they that make them are by God appointed to make them; and to make men know, that the People and the Church are one thing, and have but one Head, the King; and that no man has Title to govern under him, that has it not from him. That the King owes his Crown to God only, and to no Man, Ecclesiastick, or other; and that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they teach there be a quiet waiting for the coming again of our Blessed Saviour; and in the mean time a resolution to obey the King's Laws, which also are God's Laws, To injure no man, to be in charity with all men, to cherish the Poor and Sick, and to live soberly and free from scandal. Without mingling our Religion with Points of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy, as freedom of Will, Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Substance, everlasting Nows, Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Hypostases, which the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, nor will ever care for. When the Universities shall be thus disciplin'd,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56428:52"/>
there will come out of them, from time to time, well principled Preachers, and they that are now ill principled from time to time fall away.</p>

                        <p>I think it a very good course, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only one, that can make our peace amongst our selves constant. For if men know not their Duty, what is there that can force them to obey the Laws? An Army you'l say; but what shall force the Army? Were not the Train'd-Bands an Army? Were they not the Janisaries, that not very long ago slew <hi>Osman</hi> in his own Palace at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople?</hi> I am therefore of your opinion, both that men may be brought to a love of obedience by Preachers and Gentlemen that imbibe good Principles in their Youth at the Universities, and also, that we never shall have a lasting Peace, till the Universities themselves be in such manner (as you have said) reformed; and the Ministers know they have no Authority but what the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Civil Power gives them; and the Nobility and Gentry know, that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a State is not an exemption from the Laws of their own Country, whether made by an Assembly, or by a Monarch; but an exemption from the constraint and insolence of their Neighbours.</p>

And now you may proceed, if it please you, to such other Artifices as they used to the same purpose.</p>

                        <p>After the Parliament had made the People believe, that the exacting of Ship-Money was unlawful, and the People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inclined to think it Tyrannical; in the next place, to increase their disaffection to his Majesty, they accused him of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to introduce and authorize the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in this Kingdom, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more hateful to the People; not because it was erroneous, (which they had neither Learning nor Judgment enough to examine) but because they had been used to hear it inveighed against in the Sermons
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56428:54"/>
and Discourses of the Preachers, whom they trusted to: and this was indeed the most effectual calumny to alienate the People's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him, that could possibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The colour they had for this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was first, that there was one <hi>Rosetti</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident (at and a little before that time) from the Pope, with the Queen, and one Mr. <hi>George Con</hi> Secretary to the Cardinal <hi>Francisco Barbarini,</hi> Nephew to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> sent over under favour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Queen (as was conceiv'd) to draw as many Persons of Quality about the Court, as he should be able, to reconcile themselves to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; with what success I cannot tell; but it is likely he gained some, especially of the weaker Sex, if I may say they were gained by him, when, not his Arguments, but hope of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the Queen in all probability pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them.</p>

                        <p>There was exception also taken at a Covent of Friers Capucins in <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> though allowed by the Articles of Marriage: and it was reported, that the Jesuits also were shortly after to be allowed a Covent in <hi>Clerkenwel:</hi> and in the mean time, the principal Secretary, Sir <hi>Francis Windebank,</hi>

was accused for having by his Warrant set at liberty some <hi>English</hi> Jesuits, that had been taken and imprison'd, for returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> after banishment, contrary to the Statute which had made it Capital. Also the resort of <hi>English</hi> Catholicks to the Queens Chappel gave them colour to blame the Queen her self, not only for that, but also for all the favours that had been shewn to the Cotholicks; in so much that some of them did not stick to say openly, that the King was govern'd by her.</p>

                        <p>To give the Parliament another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for their Accusation on foot of the King, as to introducing of Popery, there was a great Controversie between the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Presbyterian Clergy about Free-will. The Dispute began first in the Low Countries, between <hi>Gomar</hi> and <hi>Armin,</hi> in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> who foreseeing it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56428:55"/>
might trouble the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did what he could to compose the difference: and an Assembly of Divines was thereupon got together at <hi>Dort,</hi> to which also King <hi>James</hi> sent a Divine or two, but it came to nothing; the Question was left undecided, and became a Subject to be disputed of in the Universities here. All the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were of the same mind with <hi>Gomar,</hi> but a very great many others not, and those were called here Arminians, who because the Doctrine of Free-will had been explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Papistical Doctrine, and because the Presbyterians were far the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and already in favour with the People, were generally hated; it was easie therefore for the Parliament to make that calumny pass currently with the People, when the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> was for <hi>Arminius,</hi> and had a little before, by his Power Ecclesiastical, forbidden all Ministers to preach to the People of Predestination: and when all Ministers that were gratious with him, and hoped for any Church-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment fell to preaching, and writing for Free-will, to the uttermost of their power, as a proof of their ability and merit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they gave out some of them, that the Arch-bishop was in heart a Papist; and in Case he could effect a Toleration here of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, was to have a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56428:55"/>
Hat, which was, not only false, but also without any ground at all for a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>

                        <p>It is a strang thing, that Scholars, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure men, that could receive no clarity but from the flame of the State, should be suffered to bring their unnecessary Disputes, and together with them their quarrels, out of the Universities into the Common-wealth; and more strange, that the State should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in their Parties, and not rather put them both to silence. A State can constrain obedience, but convince no error, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mind of them that believe they have the better reason. Suppression of Doctrines does but unite and exasperate; that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease both the malice and power of them that have already believed them. But what are the Points they disagree in? Is there any Controversie between Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian concerning the Divinity or Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ? Do either of them deny the Trinity, or any Article of the Creed? Does either Party preach openly, or write directly against Justice, Charity, Sobriety, or any other Duty necessary to Salvation; except only the Duty to the King, and not that neither, but when they have a mind, either to rule, or destroy the King? Lord have mercy upon us! Can no body be saved that understands not their Disputations?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56428:56"/>
Or is there more requisite, either of Faith, or Honesty, for the Salvation of one man than another? What needs so much preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith to us that are no Heathens, and that believe already all that Christ and his Apostles have told us is necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and more too? Why is there so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preaching of Justice? I have indeed heard Righteousness often recommended to the People, but I have seldom heard the word Justice in their Sermons; nay, though in the Latin and Greek Bible the word Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice occur exceeding often; yet in the <hi>English,</hi> (though it be a word that every man understands) the word Righteousness (which few understand to signifie the same, but take it rather for Rightness of Opinion than of Action or Intention) is put in the place of it.</p>

                        <p>I confess I know very few Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies amongst Christians of Points neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to salvation. They are the Questions of Authority and Power over the Church, or of Profit, or of Honour to Church men, that for the most part raise all the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. For what man is he, that will trouble himself, and fall-out with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for the saving of my Soul, or the Soul of any other than himself? When the Presbyterian Ministers and others did so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously preach Sedition, and animate Men
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56428:56"/>
to Rebellion in these late Wars; who was there that had not a Benefice, or having one, feared not to lose it, or some other part of his maintenance by the alteration of the Government, that did voluntarily, without any eye to reward, preach so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly against Sedition, as the other Party preached for it? I confess, that for ought I have observed in History, and other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Heathens, Greek and Latin, that those Heathens were not at all behind us in Point of Vertue and Moral Duties, notwithstanding that we have had much preaching, and they none at all. I confess also, that considering what harm may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a liberty that men have upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Sunday,</hi> and oftner, to Harangue all the People of a Nation at one time, whilst the State is ignorant of what they will say, and that there is no such thing permitted in all the World out of Christendome, nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Civil Wars about Religion, I have thought much preaching an inconvenience, nevertheless I cannot think that preaching to the People the Points of their Duty, both to God and Man, can be too frequent; so it be done by grave, discreet and ancient Men that are reverenced by the People; and not by light quibling young men, whom no Congregation is so simple, as to look to be taught by, (as being a thing contrary to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56428:57"/>
nature) or to pay them any reverence, or to care what they say, except some few that may be delighted with their jingling: I wish with all my heart there were enough of such discreet and ancient men, as might suffice for all the Parishes of <hi>England,</hi> and that they would undertake it. But this is but a wish; I leave it to the Wisdom of the State to do what it pleaseth.</p>

                        <p>After the dissolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden in the Year 1627. and 1628. the King finding no Money to be gotten from Parliaments, which he was not to buy with the Blood of such Servants and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as he loved best, abstained a long time from calling any more, and had abstained longer, if the Rebellion of the <hi>Scotch</hi> had not forced him to it. During that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King made Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> a Baron, recommended to him for his great ability, which was generally taken notice of by the disservice he had done the King in former Parliaments, but which might be useful also for him in the times that came on; and not long after he made him of the Council, and after that again Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Place he discharged with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56428:59"/>
great satisfaction and benefit to his Majesty, and continued in that Office, till by the Envy and Violence of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of that unlucky Parliament of 1640. he dyed. In which Year he was made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the King's Forces against the <hi>Scots</hi> that then entred into <hi>England,</hi> and the Year before Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The Pacification being made, and the Forces on both sides disbanded, and the Parliament at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> now sitting, it was not long before the House of Commons accused him to the House of Lords for High-Treason.</p>

                        <p>There was no great probability of his being a Traitor to the King, from whose favour he had received his Greatness, and from whose Protection he was to expect his safety. What was the Treason they laid to his charge?</p>

                        <p>Many Articles were drawn up against him, but the sum of them was contained in these two. First, That he had traiterously endeavoured to subvert the fundamental Laws and Government of the Realm; and in stead thereof to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government against Law. Secondly, That he had laboured to subvert the Rights of Parliaments, and the ancient course of Parliamentary Proceedings.</p>

                        <p>Why then, if it were Treason, did not the King himself call him in question by his Attorney? What had the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to do, without his Command, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him to the House of Lords?

                        <p>Not that I ever heard of; nor do I understand how any thing can be Treason against the King, that the King hearing and knowing does not think Treason.

                        <p>Was there no particular instance of action, or words out of which they argued that endeavour of his to subvert the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of Parliament whereof they accused him?</p>

                        <speaker>A,</speaker>
                        <p>Yes; they said he gave the King counsel to reduce the Parliament to their Duty by the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, which not long before my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> himself had caused to be Levied there for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but it was never proved against him,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56428:60"/>
that he advised the King to use it against the Parliament.</p>

                        <p>What are those Laws that are called fundamental? for I understand not how one Law can be more fundamental than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except only that Law of Nature that binds us all to obey him, whosoever he be, whom lawfully, and for our own safety we have promised to obey; nor any other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law to a King, but <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the safety and well-being of his People.</p>

                        <p>This Parliament in the use of their words, when they accused any man, never regarded the signification of them, but the weight they had to aggravate their accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ignorant multitude, which think all faults hainous, that are express'd in hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous terms, if they hate the Person accus'd, as they did this man; not only for being of the King's Party, but also for deserting the Parliaments Party as an Apostate.</p>

                        <p>I pray you tell me also what they meant by Arbitrary Government, which they seemed so much to hate? Is there any Governour of a People in the World that is forced to govern them, or forced to make this and that Law, whether he will or no? I think not; or if any be, he that forces him does certainly make Laws, and govern arbitrarily.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>That's true; and the true meaning of the Parliament was, that not the King, but they themselves should have the Arbitrary Government, not only of <hi>England,</hi> but of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (as it appeared by the event) of <hi>Scotland</hi> also.</p>

                        <p>How the King came by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by descent from his Ancestors, every body can tell; but if the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Heirs should chance (which God forbid) to fail, I cannot imagine what Title the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> can acquire thereby to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those Nations.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes; they'l say they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd anciently by the <hi>English</hi> Subjects Money.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Like enough, and suitable to the rest of their impudence.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Impudence in Democratical Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies does almost all that's done; 'tis the Goddess of Rhetorick, and carries proof with it: for what ordinary man will not from so great boldness of affirmation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is great probability in the thing affirmed. Upon this Accusation he was brought to his Tryal in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the House of Lords, and found guilty, and presently after declared Traitor by a Bill of Attainder, that is, by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>It is a strange thing that the Lords should be induced, upon so light grounds, to give a Sentence, or give their Assent to a Bill so prejudicial to themselves and their Posterity.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>'Twas not well done, and yet (as it seems) not ignorantly; for there is a Clause in the Bill, that it should not be taken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for an example, that is, for a prejudice in the like Case hereafter.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>That's worse than the Bill it self, and is a plain Confession that their Sentence was unjust: for what harm is there in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of just Sentences? Besides, if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after the like Case should happen, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is not at all made weaker by such a Provision.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Indeed I believe that the Lords, most of them, were not of themselves willing to condemn him of Treason, they were awed to it by the clamor of Common People that came to <hi>Westminster,</hi> crying out Justice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; the which were caused to flock thither by some of the House of Commons that were well assur'd, after the triumphant welcome of <hi>Prin, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> to put the People into tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, upon any occasion they desir'd. They were awed unto it partly also by the House of Commons it self, which if it desir'd to undo a Lord, had no more to do, but to vote him a Delinquent.</p>

                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56428:61"/>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>A Delinquent; what's that? A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is't not? Did they mean to undo all Sinners?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>By Delinquent they meant only a Man to whom they would do all the hurt they could: but the Lords did not yet, I think, suspect they meant to cashiere their whole House.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>It's a strange thing the whole House of Lords should not perceive, that the ruin of the King's Power, and the weakening of it was the ruin, or weakening of themselves: for they could not think it likely, that the People ever meant to take the Sovereignty from the King to give it to them, who were few in number, and less in power than so many Commoners, because less beloved by the People.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>But it seems not so strange to me; for the Lords for their personal abilities, as they were no less, so also they were no more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Publick Affairs, than the Knights and Burgesses: for there is no reason to think, that if one that is to day a Knight of the Shire in the Lower House, be to morrow made a Lord, and a Member of the Higher House, is therefore wiser than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They are all of both Houses prudent and able Men as any in the Land, in the business of their private Estates, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing but diligence and natural Wit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56428:62"/>
to govern them; but for the Government of a Common-wealth, neither wit, nor pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor diligence is enough without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rules, and the true Science of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Justice.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>If this be true, it is impossible any Common-wealth in the World, whether Monarchy, Aristocratie or Democratie should continue long without change, or Sedition tending to change, either of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of the Governors.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis true; nor have any the greatest Common-wealths in the World been long free from Sedition. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had for a while their petty Kings, and then by Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came to be petty Common-wealths, and then growing to be greater Common-wealths, by Sedition again became Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and all for want of Rules of Justice for the Common People to take notice of, which if the People had known in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of every of these Seditions, the Ambitious Persons could never had the hope to disturb their Government, after it had been once setled; for Ambition can do little without hands, and few hands it would have, if the Common People were as diligently instructed in the true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Duty, as they are terrified and amazed by Preachers with fruitless and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrines concerning the Nature of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56428:62"/>
Man's Will, and many other Philosophical Points that tend not at all to the salvation of the Soul in the World to come, nor to their ease in this life, but only to the direction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Clergy of that Duty which they ought to perform to the King.</p>

                        <p>The King had heard all that passed at his Tryal, and had declared he was unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the Justice of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and (I think) notwithstanding the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56428:63"/>
danger of his own Person from the fury of the People, and that he was counsel'd to give way to his Execution, not only by such as he most relied on, but also by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> himself, he would have pardoned him, if that could have preserved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Tumult raised and countenanced by the Parliament it self, for the terrifying of those they thought might favour him: and yet the King himself did not stick to confess afterwards, that he had done amiss in that he did not rescue him.</p>

                        <p>'Twas an Argument of good Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the King; but I never read that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> acknowledged that he had done a fault in abandoning <hi>Cicero</hi> to the fury of his Enemy <hi>Antonius.</hi> Perhaps because <hi>Cicero</hi> having been of the contrary Faction to his Father, had done <hi>Augustus</hi> no service at all out of favour to him, but only out of enmity to <hi>Antonius,</hi> and out of love to the Senate, that is indeed out of love to himself that swayed the Senate; as it is very likely the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> came over to the King's Party for his own ends, having been so much against the King in former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                        <p>Why did the <hi>Scots</hi> think there was so much danger in the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury?</hi> He was not a Man of War, nor a Man able to bring an Army into the Field; but he was perhaps a very great Politician.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>That did not appear by any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event of his Counsels. I never heard but he was a very honest man for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and a very zealous promoter of the Church-Government by Bishops, and that desired to have the Service of God perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the House of God adorned, as sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably as was possible to the Honour we ought to do to the Divine Majesty. But to bring, as he did, into the State his former Controversies, I mean his squablings in the University about Free-will, and his stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Punctilio's, concerning the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book and its Rubricks, was not (in my opinion) an Argument of his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Affairs of State. About the same time they passed an Act (which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to) for a Triennial Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was Enacted, That after the present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament there should be a Parliament called by the King within the space of three years, and so from three years to three years, to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> upon a certain day na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Act.</p>

                        <p>But what if the King did not call it, finding it perhaps inconvenient, or hurtful
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56428:64"/>
to the safety or peace of his People, which God hath put into his charge? For I do not well comprehend how any Sovereign can well keep a People in order when his Hands are tied, or when he hath any other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, than the benefit of those he governs; and at this time, for any thing you have told me, they acknowledged the King for their Sovereign.</p>

                        <p>I know not; but such was the Act. And it was farther Enacted, That if the King did it not by his own Command, then the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Keeper for the time being, should send out the Writs of Summons; and if the Chancellor refused, then the Sheriffs of the several Counties should, of themselves, in their next County-Courts, before the day set down for the Parliaments meeting, proceed to the Election of the Members for the said Parliament.</p>

                        <p>What a great Progress made the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament towards the ends of the most sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Members of both Houses in so little time? They sate down in <hi>November,</hi> and now it was <hi>May,</hi> in this space of time, which is but half a year, they won from the King the adherence which was due to him from his People; they drave his faithfulest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from him; beheaded the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; imprison'd the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56428:65"/>
obtain'd a Triennial Parliament after their own Dissolution, and a continuance of their own sitting, as long as they listed; which last amounted to a total Extinction of the King's Right, in case that such a Grant were valid, which I think it is not, unless the Sovereignty it self be in plain terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, which it was not. But what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by way of Subsidy, or otherwise, did they grant the King in recompence of all these his large Concessions?</p>

                        <p>Yes; they desir'd the whole and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Sovereignty, and to change the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government into an Oligarchie, that is to say, to make the Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a few Lords, and about 400 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, absolute in the Sovereignty, for the present, and shortly after to lay the House of Lords aside: for this was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Presbyterian Ministers, who taking themselves to be by Divine Right the only lawful Governors of the Church,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56428:66"/>
endeavoured to bring the same form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into the Civil State. And as the Spiritual Laws were to be made by their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, so the Civil Laws should be made by the House of Commons, who as they thought would no less be ruled by them afterwards, than they formerly had been, wherein they were deceived, and found themselves out-gone by their own Disciples, though not in Malice, yet in Wit.</p>

                        <p>In <hi>August</hi> following, the King sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing he had now sufficiently obliged the Parliament to proceed no farther against him, took a Journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> to satisfie his Subjects there, as he had done here, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending perhaps so to gain their good Wills, that in case the Parliament here should Levy Arms against him, they should not be aided by the <hi>Scots</hi>; wherein he also was deceiv'd; for though they seemed satisfied with what he did, (whereof one thing was his giving way to the abolition of Episcopacy) yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they made a League with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and for Money (when the King began to have the better of the Parliament) invaded <hi>England</hi> in the Parliaments quarrel, but this was a year or two after.</p>

                        <p>It would be too long, and an useless digression to cite all the Ancient Authors that speak of the forms of those Common-wealths, which were amongst our first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and other <hi>Germans,</hi> and of other Nations, from whom we derive the Titles of Honour now in use in <hi>England</hi>; nor will it be possible to derive from them any Argument of Right, but only Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Fact, which by the Ambition of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Subjects have been oftner unjust, than otherwise. And for those <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Angles,</hi> that in Ancient times by several Invasions made themselves Masters of this Nation; they were not in themselves one Body of a Common-wealth, but only a League of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56428:67"/>
petty <hi>German</hi> Lords and States, such as was the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, without other obligation, than that which proceeded from their own fear and weakness. Nor were those Lords, for the most part the Sovereigns at home in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but chosen by the People for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Forces they brought with them. And therefore it was not without Equity, when they had conquered any part of the Land. and made some one of them King thereof, that the rest should have greater priviledges than the Common People and Soldiers, amongst which priviledges a man may easily conjecture this to be one; That they should be made acquainted, and be of Councel with him that hath the Sovereignty in matter of Government, and have the greatest and most honourable Offices, both in Peace and War. But because there can be no Government where there is more than one Sovereign, it cannot be inferr'd, that they had a Right to oppose the King's Resolutions by force, nor to enjoy those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Places longer than they should continue good Subjects. And we find that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did, upon every great occasion, call them together, by the name of discreet and wise Men of the Kingdom, and hear their Counsel, and make them Judges of all Causes that, during their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56428:67"/>
were brought before them. But as he summon'd them at his own pleasure, so had he also ever the power at his pleasure to dissolve them. The <hi>Normans</hi> also that descended from the <hi>Germans,</hi> as we did, had the same Customs in this particular; and by this means this priviledge of the Lords to be of the King's Great Councel, and when they were assembled to be the Highest of the King's Courts of Justice, continued still after the Conquest to this day. But though there be amongst the Lords divers Names or Titles of Honour, yet they have their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by the only Name of Baron, a Name receiv'd from the Ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> amongst whom that Name signified the King's Man, or rather one of his Great Men: By which it seems to me, that though they gave him Counsel, when he requir'd it, yet they had no Right to make War upon him, if he did not follow it.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56428:68"/>
Parliament for ought that I know, till the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, or the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, immediately after the misbehaviour of the Barons; and for ought any man knows were called on purpose to weaken that Power of the Lords, which they had so freshly abused. Before the time of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third the Lords were descended most of them from such as in the Invasions and Conquests of the <hi>Germans</hi> were Peers and Fellow-Kings, till one was made King of them all; and their Tenants were their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as it is at this day with the Lords of <hi>France:</hi> but after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Kings began to make Lords in the place of them whose Issue failed, Titulary only, without the Lands belonging to their Title; and by that means their Tenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer bound to serve them in the Wars, they grew every day less and less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a Party against the King, though they continued still to be his Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. And as their Power decreased, so the Power of the House of Commons increased; but I do not find they were part of the King's Councel at all, nor Judges over other men; though it cannot be denied, but a King may ask their advice, as well as the advice of any other; but I do not find that the end of their summoning was to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56428:68"/>
but only in case they had any Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for redress of Grievances, to be ready there with them, whilst the King had his Great Councel about him.</p>
                        <p>But neither they nor the Lords could present to the King as a Grievance; That the King took upon him to make the Laws; To choose his own Privy-Councellors; To raise Money and Soldiers; To defend the Peace and Honour of the Kingdom; To make Captains in his Army; To make Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Castles, whom he pleased; for this had been to tell the King, that it was one of their Grievances that he was King.</p>

                        <p>He came back the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and was welcomed with the Acclamations of the Common People, as much, as if he had been the most beloved of all the Kings that were before him, but found not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception by the Parliament answerable to it. They presently began to pick new quarrels against him out of every thing he said to them. <hi>December</hi> the second the King called together both Houses of Parliament, and then did only recommend unto them the raising of Succors for <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>None: but in order thereto, as they may pretend, they had a Bill in agitation to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56428:70"/>
assert the Power of Levying and Pressing Soldiers to the two Houses of the Lords and Commons; which was as much as to take from the King the Power of the Militia, which is in effect the whole Sovereign Power: for he that hath the power of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and Commanding of the Soldiers, has all other Rights of Sovereignty, which he shall please to claim. The King hearing of it called the Houses of Parliament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, on <hi>December</hi> the 14<hi>th,</hi> and then pressed again the business of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as there was need; for all this while the <hi>Irish</hi> were murdering of the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and strengthening themselves against the Forces they expected to come out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and withal told them, he took notice of the Bill in agitation for pressing of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and that he was contented it should pass with a <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> both for him and them, because the present time was unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to dispute it in.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Nothing. What's unreasonable is one question, what they quarrel'd at is another. They quarrel'd at this; That his Majesty took notice of the Bill, while it was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the House of Lords, before it was presented to him in the course of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and also that he shewed himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with those that propounded the said
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56428:70"/>
Bill: both which they declared to be against the Priviledges of Parliament, and petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the King to give them reparation against those by whose evil Counsel he was induced to it, that they might receive condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This was cruel proceeding. Do not the Kings of <hi>England</hi> use to sit in the Lords House when they please? And was not this Bill in debate then in the House of Lords? It is a strange thing that a Man should be lawfully in the company of Men, where he must needs hear and see what they say and do; and yet must not take notice of it, so much as to the same company: for though the King was not present at the Debate it self, yet it was lawful for any of the Lords to make him acquainted with it. Any one of the House of Commons, though not present at a Proposition, or Debate in the House, nevertheless hearing of it from some of his Fellow-Members, may certainly, not only take notice of it, but also speak to it in the House of Commons: but to make the King give up his Friends and Councellors to them, to be put to death, banishment or imprisonment for their good will to him, was such a Tyranny over a King, no King ever exercised over any Subject, but in Cases of Treason or Murder, and seldom then.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Presently hereupon began a kind of War between the Pens of the Parliament and those of the Secretaries, and other able men that were with the King: For upon the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they sent to the King a Paper called <hi>A Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom,</hi> and with it a Petition, both which they caused to be published. In the Remonstrance they complained of certain mischievous Designs of a Malignant Party then, before the beginning of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grown ripe; and did set forth what means had been used for the preventing of it by the wisdom of the Parliament, what rubs they had found therein, what course was fit to be taken for restoring and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the Ancient Honour, Greatness and Safety of the Crown and Nation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> And of these Designs the Promoters and Actors were, they said, Jesuited Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</p>
                        <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> The Bishops and that part of the Clergy that cherish formality as a support of their own Ecclesiastical Tyranny and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Councellors and Courtiers, that for private ends (they said) had engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to farther the Interests of some For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes.</p>

                        <p>It may very well be that some of the Bishops, and also some of the Court, may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56428:71"/>
have, in pursuit of their private Interest, done something indiscreetly, and perhaps wickedly; therefore I pray you tell me in particular what their crimes were: for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the King should not have conniv'd at any thing against his own Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Parliament were not very keen against them that were against the King; they made no doubt but all they did was by the King's Command, but accus'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Bishops, Councellors and Courtiers, as being a more mannerly way of accusing the King himself, and defaming him to his Subjects: For the truth is, the Charge they brought against them was so general as not to be called an Accusation, but Railing. As first, they said they nourished Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prerogative and Liberty between the King and his People, to the end that seeming much addicted to his Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they might get themselves into Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greatest Trust and Power in the Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>How could this be called an Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which there is no Fact for any Accusers to apply their Proofs to, or their Witnesses: for granting that these Questions of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative had been moved by them, who can prove that their end was to gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Friends the Places of Trust and Power in the Kingdom?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>A second Accusation was, That they endeavoured to suppress the purity and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Religion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>That's Canting; it is not in man's power to suppress the power of Religion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They meant that they suppress the Doctrine of the Presbyterians, that is to say, the very foundation of the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments treacherous pretensions.</p>
                        <p>A third; That they cherished Arminians, Papists, and Libertines, (by which they meant the common Protestants, which med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with Disputes) to the end they might compose a Body fit to act according to their Counsels and Resolutions.</p>
                        <p>A Fourth; That they endeavoured to put the King upon other courses of raising Money, than by the ordinary way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: Judge whether these may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Accusations, or not rather spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reproaches of the King's Government.</p>

                        <p>Methinks this last was a very great fault; for what good could there be in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King upon an odd course of getting Money, when the Parliament was willing to supply him as far as to the security of the Kingdom, or to the Honour of the King should be necessary?</p>

                        <p>But I told you before they would give him none, but with a condition he should cut off the Heads of whom they pleas'd, how
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56428:72"/>
faithfully soever they had serv'd him: and if he would have sacrificed all his Friends to their Ambition, yet they would have found other excuses for denying him Subsidies: for they were resolv'd to take from him the Sovereign Power to themselves, which they could never do without taking great care that he should have no Money at all. In the next place they put into the Remonstrance as faults of them whose Counsel the King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, all those things which since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the King's Reign were by them misliked, whether faults or not, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were not able to judge for want of knowledge of the Causes and Motives that induced the King to do them, and were known only to the King himself, and such of his Privy-Council as he revealed them to.</p>

                        <p>All this will go current with common People for misgovernment, and for faults of the King's, though some of them were misfortunes, and both the misfortunes and the misgovernment (if any were) were the faults of the Parliament, who by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give him Money, did both frustrate his Attempts abroad, and put him upon those extraordinary ways (which they call Illegal) of raising Money at home.</p>

other things; and say, that though they had contracted a Debt to the <hi>Scots</hi> of 2200 <hi>l.</hi> and granted six Subsidies, and a Bill of Pole-Money worth six Subsidies more, yet that God had so blessed the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this Parliament, that the Kingdom was a gainer by it: and then follows the Catalogue of those good things they had done for the King and Kingdom. For the Kingdom they had done (they said) these things.

That they suppress'd all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, which they reckoned above a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion yearly saved by the Subject. That they had quelled living Grievances, meaning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Counsellors and Actors, by the death of my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> by the flight of the Chancellor <hi>Finch,</hi> and of Secretary <hi>Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank,</hi> by the Imprisonment of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and of Judge <hi>Bartlet,</hi> and the Impeachment of other Bishops and Judges.

                        <p>Nay farther; They put to the King's Account the 300000 <hi>l.</hi> given to the <hi>Scots,</hi> without which they would not have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>England</hi>; besides many other things that I now remember not.</p>

                        <p>You have not observ'd the World long enough to see all that's ill. Such was their Remonstrance, as I have told you: With it they sent a Petition containing three Points. 1. That his Majesty would deprive the Bishops of their Votes in Parliament, and remove such Oppressions in Religion, Church Government and Discipline, as they had brought in. 2. That he would remove from his Council all such as should promote the Peoples Grievances, and employ in his Great and Publick Affairs such as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament should confide in. 3. That he would not give away the Lands Escheated to the Crown by the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                        <p>This last Point, methinks, was not wisely put in at this time, it should have been reserv'd, till they had subdued the Rebels, against whom there were yet no Forces sent over. 'Tis like selling the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Skin before they had kill'd him. But what answer was made to the other two Propositions?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>What answer should be made but a Denial? About the same time the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self exhibited Articles against six Persons of the Parliament, five whereof were of the House of Commons, and one of the House of Lords, accusing them of High Treason, and upon the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> went himself to the House of Commons to demand those five of them: but private notice having been given by some Treacherous Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King, they had absented themselves; and by that means frustrated his Majesties Intentions; and after he was gone, the House making a hainous matter of it, and a high breach of their Priviledges, adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves into <hi>London,</hi> there to sit as a General Committee, pretending they were not safe at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for the King, when he went to the House to demand those Persons, had somewhat more attendance with him (but not otherwise armed than his Servants used to be) than he ordinarily had: and would not be pacified, though the King did
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56428:76"/>
afterward wave the prosecution of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, unless he would also discover to them those that gave him Counsel to go in that manner to the Parliament House, to the end they might receive condign punishment, which was the word they used in stead of cruelty.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This was a harsh demand. Was it not enough that the King should forbear his Enemies, but also that he must betray his Friends? If they thus tyrannize over the King, before they have gotten the Sovereign Power into their hands; how will they ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over their Fellow-Subjects, when they have gotten it?</p>

                        <p>Not above two or three days, and then were brought from <hi>London</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament House by Water, in great triumph, guarded with a tumultuous number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Men, there to sit in security in despite of the King, and make traiterous Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, such, and as many as they list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and under favour of these tumults to frighten away from the House of Peers all such as were not of their own Faction. For at this time the Rabble was so insolent, that scarce any of the Bishops durst go to the House, for fear of violence upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56428:76"/>
in so much as twelve of them excused themselves of coming thither; and by way of Petition to the King remonstrated, That they were not permitted to go quietly to the performance of that Duty, and protesting against all Determinations, as of none effect, that should pass in the House of Lords du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their forced absence; which the House of Commons taking hold of, sent up to the Peers one of their Members to accuse them of High Treason; whereupon ten of them were sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> after which time there were no more words of their High Treason; but there passed a Bill by which they were deprived of their Votes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to this Bill they got the Kings Assent: and in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> after, they voted that the Bishops should have no more to do in the Government of the Church, but to this they had not the King's Assent, the War being now begun.</p>

                        <p>What made the Parliament so averse to Episcopacy, and especially the House of Lords, whereof the Bishops were Members? for I see no reason why they should do it to gratifie a number of poor Parish Priests, that were Presbyterians, and that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver likely any way to serve the Lords, but on the contrary to do their best to pull down their power, and subject them to their Synods and Classes.</p>

                        <p>For the Lords very few of them did perceive the intention of the Presbyterians, and besides that, they durst not (I believe) oppose the Lower House.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Because they meant to make use of their Tenents, and with pretended Sanctity to make the King and his Party odious to the People, by whose help they were to set up Democracy, and depose the King, or to let him have the Title only so long as he should act for their purposes: but not only the Parliament, but in a manner all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> were their Enemies upon the account of their behaviour, as being (they said) too imperious. This was all that was colourably laid to their charge; the main cause of pulling them down was the envy of the Presbyterians that incensed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against them, and against Episcopacy it self.</p>

                        <p>'Tis a hard Case, that there should be two Factions to trouble the Common-wealth, without any Interest in it of their own, other than every particular man may have, and that their quarrels should be only about Opinions, that is, about who has the most Learning, as if their Learning ought to be the Rule of governing all the World. What is it they are learned in? Is it Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Rules of State? I know it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Divinity, but I hear almost nothing preach'd but matter of Philosophy. For Religion in it self admits no controversie. 'Tis a Law of the Kingdom, and ought not to be disputed. I do not think they pretend to speak with God and know his Will by any other way than reading the Scriptures, which we also do.</p>

                        <p>Yes; some of them do, and give themselves out for Prophets by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inspiration; but the rest pretend only (for their Advancement to Benefices and Charge of Souls) a greater skill in the Scriptures than other men have, by reason of their breeding in the Universities, and knowledge there gotten of the Latin Tongue, and some also of the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, wherein the Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56428:78"/>

                        <p>As for the Latin, Greek and Hebrew Tongues, it was once (to the Detection of <hi>Roman</hi> fraud, and to the ejection of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Power) very profitable, or rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; but now that's done, and we have the Scripture in <hi>English,</hi> and preaching in <hi>English,</hi> I see no great need of Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

                        <p>First, what were the <hi>Druids</hi> of old time in <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>France</hi>? What Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity these had you may see in <hi>Caesar, Strabo</hi> and others, and especially in <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> the greatest Antiquary perhaps that

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which he calls <hi>Sarovides</hi>) in <hi>France,</hi> says thus. There be also amongst them certain Philosophers and Theologians, that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly honoured, whom they also use as Prophets; these Men by their skill in Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Inspection into the Bowels of Beasts sacrificed, foretel what is to come, and have the Multitude obedient to them. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after; It is a Custom amongst them, that no man may sacrifice without a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher; because (say they) men ought not to present their thanks to the Gods, but by them that know the Divine Nature, and are as it were of the same Language with them, and that all good things ought by such as these to be prayed for.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>I can hardly believe that those <hi>Druids</hi> were very skilful, either in Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy or Moral.</p>

                        <p>Nor I; for they held and taught the Transmigration of Souls from one Body to another, as did <hi>Pythagoras</hi>; which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether they took from him, or he from them, I cannot tell.</p>
                        <p>What were the <hi>Magi</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> but Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Astrologers? You know how they came to find our Saviour by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Star, either from <hi>Persia</hi> it self, or from some Countrey more Eastward than <hi>Judea.</hi> Were not these in great Authority
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56428:79"/>
in their Countrey? And are they not in most part of Christendome thought to have been Kings?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath been thought by many the most ancient Kingdom and Nation of the World, and their Priests had the greatest power in Civil Affairs, that any Subjects ever had in any Nation. And what were they but Philosophers and Divines? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom the same <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> says thus. The whole Countrey (of <hi>Aegypt</hi>) being divided into three parts, the Body of the Priests have one, as being of most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the People, both for their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the Gods, and also for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding gotten by Education; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after: for generally these men in the greatest Affairs of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, partly executing, and partly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and advising; foretelling him also (by their skill in Astrology, and Art in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of Sacrifices) the things that are to come, and reading to him out of their Holy Books, such of the Actions there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, as are profitable for him to know. 'Tis not there as in <hi>Greece,</hi> one man or one woman that has the Priesthood, but they are many that attend the Honours and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Gods, and leave the same em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to their posterity, which next to the King hath the greatest Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56428:79"/>Concerning the Judicature amongst the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> he saith thus: from out of the most eminent Cities <hi>Hieropolis, Thebes</hi> and <hi>Memphis</hi> they choose Judges, which are a Councel not inferior to that of <hi>Areopagus</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> or that of the Senate in <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> When they are met, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 30, they choose one from amongst themselves to be Chief Justice, and the City, whereof he is, sendeth another in his place. This Chief Justice wore about his Neck hung in a Gold Chain, a Jewel of pretious Stones, the name of which Jewel was Truth, which when the Chief Justice had put on, then began the Pleading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the Judges had agreed on the Sentence, then did the Chief Justice put this Jewel of Truth to one of the Pleas. You see now what power was acquir'd in Civil matters by the Conjuncture of Philosophy and Divinity.</p>
                        <p>Let us come now to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Was not the Priesthood in a Family (namely the Levites) as well as the Priesthood of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Did not the High Priest give Judgment by the Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Urim and Thummim? Look upon the Kingdom of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and <hi>Chaldaeans.</hi> Had they not Lands and Cities belonging to their Family, even in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, who dwelt (you know) in <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi>; of these the same
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56428:80"/>
Author says thus: The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> are a Sect in Politicks like to that of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests; for being ordained for the Service of the Gods, they spend the whole time of their life in Philosophy, being of exceeding great reputation in Astrology, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much also to Prophecy, foretelling things to come by Purifications and Sacrifices, and to find out by certain Incantations the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of harm, and the bringing to pass of good. They have also skill in Augury, and in the Interpretation of Dreams and Wonders, nor are unskilful in the Art of foretelling by the Inwards of Beasts sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and have their Learning, not as the <hi>Greeks:</hi> for the Philosophy of the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> goes to their Family by Tradition, and the Son receives it from his Father.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Assyria</hi> let us pass into <hi>India,</hi> and see what esteem the Philosophers had there. The whole Multitude (says <hi>Diodorus</hi>) of the <hi>Indians</hi> is divided into seven parts; whereof the first is the Body of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, for number the least, but for eminence the first; for they are free from Taxes, and as they are not Masters of others, so are no others Masters of them. By private men they are called to the Sacrifices, and to the care of burials of the dead, as being thought most beloved of the Gods, and skilful in the Doctrine concerning Hell,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56428:80"/>
and for this Employment receive Gifts and Honours very considerable. They are also of great use to the People of <hi>India</hi>; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken at the beginning of the year into the Great Assembly, they foretell them of great Drouths, great Rains, also of Winds and of Sicknesses, and of whatsoever is profitable for them to know before-hand.</p>
                        <p>The same Author concerning the Laws of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> saith thus: The Laws of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> seem very different from those of other Nations, and especially about the Election of their Kings: for the Priests propound some of the Chief Men amongst them, named in a Catalogue, and whom the God (which according to a certain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is carried about to Feastings) does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, him the Multitude elect for their King, and presently adore and honour him as a God, put into the Government by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence. The King being chosen, he has the manner of his life limited to him by the Laws, and does all other things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom of the Countrey, neither rewarding, nor punishing any man, otherwise than from the beginning is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished amongst them by Law; nor use they to put any man to death, though he be condemned to it, but to send some Officer to him with a Token of death; who seeing the Token, goes presently to his House, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56428:81"/>
kills himself presently after: But the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thing of all is, that which they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of their Kings: for the Priests that live in <hi>Meröe,</hi> and spend their time about the Worship and Honour of the Gods, and are in greatest Authority; when they have a mind to it, send a Messenger to the King, to bid him die, for that the Gods have given such order, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Immortals are not by any means to be neglected by those that are by Nature Mortal; using also other Speeches to him, which men of simple Judgment, and that have not reason enough to dispute against those unnecessary Commands, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing educated in an old and undelible Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, are content to admit of. Therefore in former times the Kings did obey the Priests, not as mastered by Force and Arms, but as having their reason mastered by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition. But in the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the second, <hi>Ergamenes,</hi> King of the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> having had his breeding in Philosophy after the manner of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> being the first that durst dispute their power, took heart as befitted a King, came with Soldiers to a place called <hi>Abaton,</hi> where was then the Golden Temple of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> killed all the Priests, abolished the Custom, and rectified the Kingdom according to his will.</p>

                        <p>It was so: but were not the Priests cruel to cause their Kings, whom a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they adored as Gods, to make away themselves? The King killed them for the safety of his Person; they him out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or love of Change. The King's Act may be coloured with the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; The Priests had no pretence against their Kings, who were certainly very god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or else would never have obeyed the Command of the Priests by a Messenger unarmed, to kill themselves. Our late King, the best King perhaps that ever was, you know, was murdered, having been first persecuted by War, at the incitement of Presbyterian Ministers, who are therefore guilty of the death of all that fell in that War, which were, I believe, in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> near 100000 persons. Had it not been much better that those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Ministers, which were not perhaps 1000, had been all killed, before they had preached. It had been (I confess) a great Massacre, but the killing of 100000 is a greater.</p>

they were Enemies to them that were in it.</p>

                        <p>But I intend not by these Quotations to commend either the Divinity, or the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of those Heathen People; but to shew only what the reputation of those Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can effect among the People. For their Divinity was nothing but Idolatry, and their Philosophy (excepting the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests, and from them the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> had gotten by long observation and study in Astronomy, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Arithmetick) very little; and that in great part abused in Astrology and Fortune-telling. Whereas the Divinity of the Clergy in this Nation, considered apart from the mixture (that has been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in part retained here) of the babling Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and other <hi>Greeks,</hi> that has no affinity with Religion, and serves only to breed disaffection, dissention, and finally Sedition and Civil War (as we have lately found by dear experience, in the differences between the Presbyterians and Episcopals) is the true Religion: but for these differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both Parties as they came in power, not only suppressed the Tenets of one another; but also whatsoever Doctrine look'd with an ill aspect upon their Interest, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all true Philosophy, especially Civil and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56428:82"/>
Moral, which can never appear propitious to ambition, or to an exemption from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience due to the Sovereign Power.</p>
                        <p>After the King had accused the Lord <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton,</hi> a Member of the Lords House, and <hi>Hollis, Haslerigg, Hampden, Pim</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> five Members of the Lower House, of High Treason; and after the Parliament had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the Bishops from the House of Peers; they pursued especially two things in their Petitions to his Majesty: The one was, That the King would declare who were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that advised him to go, as he did, to the Parliament House, to apprehend them, and that he would leave them to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive condign punishment; and this they did to stick upon his Majesty the dishonour of deserting his Friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying them to his Enemies. The other was, That he would allow them a Guard out of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>; for which they pretended they could not else sit in safety: which pretence was nothing but an upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Majesty for coming to Parliament better accompanied than ordinary, to seize the said five seditious Members.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>I see no reason in petitioning for a Guard, they should determine it to the City of <hi>London</hi> in particular, and the Command by name to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>; unless they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56428:83"/>
meant the King should understand it for a Guard against himself.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Their meaning was, that the King should understand it so, and (as I verily believe) they meant he should take it for an affront: and the King himself under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it so, denied to grant it; though he were willing, if they could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be satisfied, to Command such a Guard to wait upon them, as he would be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for to God Almighty. Besides this, the City of <hi>London</hi> petitioned the King (put upon it, no doubt, by some Members of the Lower House) to put the Tower of <hi>London</hi> into the Hands of persons of Trust, meaning such as the Parliament should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, and to appoint a Guard for the safety of his Majesty and the Parliament. This Method of bringing Petitions in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary manner by great multitudes of clamorous people, was ordinary with the House of Commons, whose Ambition could never have been served by way of prayer and request, without extraordinary terror.</p>
                        <p>After the King had waved the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the five Members, but denied to make known who had advised him to come in person to the House of Commons, they question'd the Attorney-General, who by the King's Command had exhibited the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles against them, and voted him a breaker
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56428:83"/>
of the Priviledge of Parliament, and no doubt had made him feel their cruelty, if he had not speedily fled the Land.</p>
                        <p>About the end of <hi>January,</hi> they made an Order of both Houses of Parliament to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the going over of Popish Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into <hi>Ireland</hi>; not so much fearing that, as that by this the King himself choosing his Commanders for that Service, might aid himself out of <hi>Ireland</hi> against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this was no great matter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a Petition they sent his Majesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time, that is to say, about the 27<hi>th</hi> or 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1641. wherein they desir'd in effect the absolute Sovereignty of <hi>England,</hi> though by the name of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they challenged it not, whilst the King was living: For to the end that the fears and dangers of this Kingdom might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and the mischievous designs of those who are Enemies to the peace of it, might be prevented, they pray; That his Majesty would be pleased to put forthwith, first, The Tower of <hi>London</hi>; 2. All other Forts; 3. The whole Militia of the Kingdom, into the Hands of such persons as should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him by both the Houses of Parliament. And this they stile a necessary Petition.</p>

                        <p>Were there really any such fears and dangers generally conceiv'd here? or did

                        <p>Yes: But no other fear of danger, but such as any discreet and honest man might justly have of the Designs of the Parliament it self, who were the greatest Enemies to the peace of the Kingdom that could possibly be. 'Tis also worth observing, that this Petition began with these words: <hi>Most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sovereign:</hi> So stupid they were as not to know, that he that is Master of the Militia, is Master of the Kingdom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently is in possession of a most absolute Sovereignty. The King was now at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> to avoid the Tumults of the Common People before the Gates of <hi>White-hall,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their clamors and affronts there. The 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> after he came to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court,</hi> and thence he went to <hi>Dover</hi> with the Queen and the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> his Daughter, where the Queen with the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> embarqued for <hi>Holland</hi>; but the King returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> whence he sent for the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and so went with them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>York.</hi>

                        <p>It appears so by the Title: but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they durst not but do it. The House
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56428:84"/>
of Commons took them but for a Cypher; Men of Title only without real Power. Perhaps also the most of them thought, that the taking of the Militia from the King would be an addition to their own power; but they were very much mistaken, for the House of Commons never intended they should be sharers in it.</p>

                        <p>I thought that he that makes the Law, ought to declare what the Law is; for what is it else to make a Law, but to declare what it is? So that they have taken from the King, not only the Militia, but also the Legislative Power.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They have so; but I make account that the Legislative Power (and indeed all power possible) is contained in the power of the Militia. After this they seize such Money as was due to his Majesty upon the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, and upon the Bill of Subsidies, that they might disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him every way they possibly could. They sent him also many other contumelious Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and Petitions, after his coming to <hi>York</hi>; amongst which one was; That whereas the Lord Admiral, by indisposition of Body, could not command the Fleet in person, he would be pleased to give Authority to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to supply his place; when they knew the King had put Sir <hi>John Pennington</hi> in it before.</p>

                        <p>To what end did the King entertain so many Petitions, Messages, Declarations and Remonstrances, and vouchsafe his Answers to them, when he could not choose but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, they were resolv'd to take from him
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56428:87"/>
his Royal Power, and consequently his Life? For it could not stand with their safety to let either him or his Issue live, after they had done him so great Injuries.</p>

                        <p>Besides this, the Parliament had at the same time a Committee residing at <hi>York,</hi> to spy what his Majesty did, and to inform the Parliament thereof, and also to hinder the King from gaining the People of that County to his Party: So that when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was courting the Gentlemen there, the Committee was instigating of the Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against him. To which also the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters did very much contribute: So that the King lost his opportunity at <hi>York,</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Why did not the King seize the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee into his Hands, or drive them out of Town?</p>

                        <p>I know not: but I believe he knew the Parliament had a greater Party than he, not only in <hi>York-shire,</hi> but also in <hi>York.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> the King, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Petition of the People of <hi>York-shire,</hi> to have the Magazine of <hi>Hull</hi> to remain still there, for the greater security of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, thought fit to take it into his own Hands. He had a little before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governour of that Town the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi>; but the Towns-men having been already corrupted by the Parliament, refused to receive him, but refused not to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56428:88"/>
receive Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> appointed to be Governour by the Parliament. The King therefore coming before the Town, guarded only by his own Servants, and a few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Countrey thereabouts, was denied entrance by Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> that stood upon the Wall: for which Act he presently caused Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Traitor, and sent a Message to the Parliament, requiring Justice to be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the said <hi>Hotham,</hi> and that the Town and Magazine might be delivered into his hands. To which the Parliament made no answer, but in stead thereof published another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, in which they omitted nothing of their former slanders against his Majesties Government, but inserted certain Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions declarative of their own pretended Right, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That whatsoever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be Law, ought not to be question'd by the King. 2. That no Precedents can be limits to bound their proceedings. 3. That a Parliament for the publick good may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of any thing, wherein the King or Subject hath a Right; and that they, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King, are this Parliament, and the Judge of this publick good, and that the King's Consent is not necessary. 4. That no Member of either House ought to be troubled for Treason, Felony, or any other Crime, unless the Cause be first brought
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56428:88"/>
before the Parliament that they may judge of the Fact, and give leave to proceed, if they see cause. 5. That the Sovereign Power resides in both Houses, and that the King ought to have no Negative Voice. 6, That the Levying of Forces against the personal Commands of the King, (though accompanied with his presence) is not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War against the King; but the Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of War against his Politick Person, <hi>viz.</hi> his Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. That Treason cannot be committed against his Person, otherwise than as he is entrusted with the Kingdom, and discharges that Trust; and that they have a power to judge whether he have discharged this Trust or not. 8. That they may dispose of the King when they will.</p>

                        <p>This is plain dealing, and without Hypocrisie. Could the City of <hi>London</hi> swallow this?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes; and more too, if need be. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> you know, has a great Belly, but no Pallat, nor Tast of Right and Wrong. In the Parliament Roll of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. amongst the Articles of the Oath the King at his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation took, there is one runs thus: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes just as Leges &amp; Consuetudines esse tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das; &amp; promittes per te eas esse protegendas, &amp; ad honorem Dei corroborandas, quas vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus elegerit.</hi> Which the Parliament urged for their Legislative Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56428:89"/>
interpret <hi>quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> which the People shall choose; as if the King should swear to protect and corroborate Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were made, whether they be good or bad; whereas the words signifie no more, but that he shall protect and corroborate such Laws as they have chosen, that is to say, the Acts of Parliament then in being. And in the Records of the Exchequer it is thus: <hi>Will you grant to hold and keep the Laws and rightful Customs which the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of this your Kingdom have, and will you defend and uphold them?</hi> &amp;c. And this was the Answer his Majesty made to that Point.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>And I think this Answer very full and clear: but if the words were to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in the other sense, yet I see no reason why the King should be bound to swear to them: for <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. came to the Crown by the Votes of a Parliament, not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in wickedness to this Long Parliament, that deposed and murdered their Lawful King; saving that it was not the Parliament it self, but the Usurper that murdered King <hi>Richard</hi> the second.</p>

                        <p>About a week after, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May,</hi> the Parliament sent the King another Paper, which they stiled the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition and Advice of both Houses, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 19 Propositions; which when you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56428:89"/>
shall hear, you shall be able to judge what power they meant to leave to the King, more than to any one of his Subjects. The first of them is this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Lords, and others of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Privy-Council, and all great Officers of State, both at home and abroad, be put from their Employments, and from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; save only such as should be approved of by both Houses of Parliament, and none put into their places, but by approbation of the said Houses. And that all Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors take an Oath for the due execution of their places, in such form as shall be agreed upon by the said Houses.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the great Affairs of the Kingdom be debated, resolved and transacted only in Parliament, and such as shall presume to do any thing to the contrary, be reserved to the censure of the Parliament, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of State, as are proper for his Majesties Privy-Council, shall be debated, and concluded by such as shall from time to time be chosen for that place by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, and that no publick Act concerning the Affairs of the Kingdom, which are proper for his Privy-Council, be esteemed valid, as proceeding from the Royal Authority; unless it be done by the Advice and Consent of the Major part of the Councel, attested under their Hands:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56428:90"/>
and that the Council be not more than 25, nor less than 15; and that when a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors place falls void in the Interval of Parliament, it shall not be supplied without the Assent of the Major part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and that such choice also shall be void, if the next Parliament after confirm it not.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the Lord High Steward of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Lord High Constable, Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord Treasurer, Lord Privy-Seal, Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal, Lord Admiral, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Chief Governour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Exchequer, Master of the Wards, Secretaries of State, two Chief Justices and Chief Baron be always cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen with the Approbation of both Houses of Parliament, and in the Intervals of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by the Major part of the Privy-Council.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the Government of the King's Children shall be committed to such as both Houses shall approve of, and in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Parliament, such as the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil shall approve of; that the Servants then about them, against whom the Houses have just exception, should be removed.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That no Marriage be concluded or treated of for any of the King's Children, without consent of Parliament.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56428:90"/>6. That the Laws in force against Jesuits, Priests and Popish Recusants be strictly put in execution.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That the Votes of Popish Lords in the House of Peers be taken away, and that a Bill be passed for the education of the Children of Papists in the Protestant Religion.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That the King will be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church-Government and Lyturgy in such manner as both Houses of Parliament shall advise.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. That he would be pleased to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that Course that the Lords and Commons have appointed for ordering the Militia, and recall his Declarations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations against it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. That such Members as have been put out of any Place, or Office, since this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began, may be restored, or have satisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That all Privy-Councellors and Judges take an Oath, the form whereof shall be agreed on, and setled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the maintaining the Petition of Right, and of certain Statutes made by the Parliament.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. That all the Judges and Officers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Approbation of both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, may hold their places <hi>quam diu bene se gesserint.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56428:91"/>13. That the Justice of Parliament may pass upon all Delinquents, whether they be within the Kingdom, or fled out of it; and that all persons cited by either House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may appear and abide the Censure of Parliament.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. That the General Pardon offered by his Majesty be granted with such Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as shall be advised by both Houses of Parliament.</p>

                        <p>What a spiteful Article was this! All the rest proceeded from Ambition, which many times well-natur'd men are subject to; but this proceeded from an inhumane and devilish cruelty.</p>

                        <p n="15">15. That the Forts and Castles be put under the Command of such persons as, with the Approbation of the Parliament, the King shall appoint.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. That the extraordinary Guards about the King be discharged; and for the future none raised, but according to the Law in case of actual Rebellion, or Invasion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Methinks these very Propositions sent to the King are an actual Rebellion.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p n="17">17. That his Majesty enter into a more strict Alliance with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and other Neighbour Protestant Princes and States.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. That his Majesty be pleased by Act of Parliament to clear the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56428:91"/>
the five Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in such manner as that future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be secur'd from the consequence of that evil President.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. That his Majesty be pleased to pass a Bill for restraining Peers made hereafter, from sitting, or voting in Parliament, unless they be admitted with consent of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>These Propositions granted; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to apply themselves to regulate his Majesties Revenue to his best advantage, and to settle it to the support of his Royal Dignity in Honour and Plenty; and also to put the Town of <hi>Hull</hi> into such Hands, as his Majesty shall appoint, with consent of Parliament.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Is not that to put it into such hands as his Majesty shall appoint by the consent of the Petitioners, which is no more than to keep it in their hands as it is? Did they want, or think the King wanted common sense, so as not to perceive that their promise herein was worth nothing?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>After the sending of these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the King, and his Majesties refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to grant them, they began, on both sides, to prepare for War. The King rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Guard for his Person in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and the Parliament thereupon having Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the King intended to make War
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56428:92"/>
upon his Parliament, gave order for the mustering and exercising the People in Arms, and published Propositions to invite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to bring in either ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Plate, or to promise under their hands to furnish and maintain certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Horse, Horse-men and Arms for the defence of the King and Parliament, (meaning by King as they had formerly declar'd, not his Person, but his Laws) promising to repay their Money with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of 8 <hi>l.</hi> in the 100 <hi>l.</hi> and the value of their Plate with 12 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce for the fashion. On the other side the King came to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there did set up his Standard Royal, and sent out Commissions of Array to call those to him, which by the Ancient Laws of <hi>England</hi> were bound to serve him in the Wars. Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there passed divers Declarations between the King and Parliament concerning the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of this Array, which are too long to tell you at this time.</p>

                        <p>Nor do I desire to hear any Mooting about this Question: for I think that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> and the Right of defending himself, against those that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him the Sovereign Power, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make legal whatsoever he should do, in order to the recovery of his Kingdom, or to the punishing of the Rebels.</p>

                        <p>In the mean time the Parliament rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Army, and made the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> General thereof; by which Act they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what they meant formerly, when they petition'd the King for a Guard to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the said Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>; and now the King sends out his Proclamations forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience to the Orders of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Militia; and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment send out Orders against the Execution of the Commissions of Array. Hitherto, (though it were a War before) yet there was no Blood shed; they shot at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing but paper.</p>

                        <p>I understand now how the Parliament destroyed the Peace of the Kingdom; and how easily by the help of seditious Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers, and of Ambitious Ignorant Orators, they reduced this Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anarchy: but I believe it will be a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Task for them to bring in Peace again, and settle the Government either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or any other Governor or form of Government. For granting that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Victory in this War, they must be beholding for it to the Valor, good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or Felicity of those to whom they give the Command of their Armies; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the General, whose good success will, without doubt, draw with it the Love and Admiration of the Soldiers; so that it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56428:93"/>
will be in his power, either to take the Government upon himself, or to place it where himself thinks good. In which case, if he take it not to himself, he will be thought a Fool; and if he do, he shall be sure to have the envy of his subordinate Commanders who look for a share, either in the present Government, or in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to it: for they will say, has he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this power by his own, without our Danger, Valor and Counsel? and must we be his Slaves whom we have thus raised? Or is not there as much Justice on our side against him, as was on his side against the King?</p>

                        <p>They will, and did; in so much that the reason why <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after he had gotten into his own hands the absolute power of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Name of Protector, did never dare to take upon him the Title of King, nor was ever able to settle it upon his Children. His Officers would not suffer it, as pretending after his death to succeed him; nor would the Army consent to it, because he had ever declared to them, against the Government of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle person.</p>

                        <p>'Tis true, the King had great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and yet by little and little he got a considerable Army, with which he so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered, as to grow stronger every day, and the Parliament weaker, till they had gotten the <hi>Scotch</hi> with an Army of 21000 Men to come into <hi>England</hi> to their Assistance.

                        <p>WE left at the Preparations on both sides for War: which when I consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my self, I was mightily puzled to find out what possibility there was for the King to equal the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such a course, and what hopes he had of Money, Men, Arms, Fortified pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Shipping, Councel and Military Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers sufficient for such an Enterprize against the Parliament, that had Men and Money as much at command, as the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Corporation Towns were able to furnish, which was more than they needed. And for the Men they should set forth for Soldiers, they were almost all of them spightfully bent against the King and his whole Party, whom they took to be either Papists, or Flatterers of the King, or that had designed to raise their Fortunes by the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56428:95"/>
plunder of the City, and other Corporation Towns. And though I believe, not that they were more valiant than other Men, nor that they had so much experience in the War, as to be accounted good Soldiers; yet they had that in them, which in time of Battle is more conducing to Victory than Valor and Experience both together, and that was spight.</p>
                        <p>And for Arms, they had in their hands the Chief Magazines, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides most of the Powder and Shot that lay in several Towns, for the use of the Train'd Bands.</p>
                        <p>Fortified places there were not many then in <hi>England,</hi> and most of them in the hands of the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The King's Fleet was wholly in their Command under the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Councellors they needed no more than such as were of their own Body; so that the King was every way inferior to them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were perhaps in Officers.</p>

                        <p>I cannot compare their Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for the Parliament the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (after the Parliament had voted the War) was made General of all their Forces, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whom all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders were to receive their Commissions.</p>

                        <p>What moved them to make General the Earl of <hi>Essex?</hi> And for what cause was the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> so displeased with the King, as to accept that Office?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>I do not certainly know what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to either of those Questions: but the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had been in the Wars abroad, and wanted neither Experience, Judgment nor Courage to perform such an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And besides that, you have heard, I believe, how great a Darling of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Father had been before him, and what Honour he had gotten by the Success of his Enterprize upon <hi>Cales,</hi> and in some other Military Actions. To which I may add, that this Earl himself was not held by the people to be so great a Favorite at Court, as that they might not trust him with their Army against the King. And by this you may perhaps conjecture the Cause for which the Parliament made choice of him for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But why did they think him discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Court?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>I know not that; nor indeed that he was so. He came to the Court as other Noble-men did, when occasion was, to wait upon the King, but had no Office, till a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before this time, to oblige him to be there continually: but I believe verily, that the unfortunateness of his Marriages had so
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56428:96"/>
discountenanced his Conversation with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the Court could not be his proper Element, unless he had had some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favour there to ballance that Calamity: but for particular discontent from the King, or intention of revenge for any supposed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, I think he had none, nor that he was any ways addicted to Presbyterian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or other Fanatick Tenets in Church or State; saving only, that he was carried away with the Stream (in a manner) of the whole Nation, to think that <hi>England</hi> was not an absolute, but a mixt Monarchy; not considering that the Supream Power must always be absolute, whether it be in the King, or in the Parliament.</p>

                        <p>But how could the King find Money to pay such an Army as was necessary for him against the Parliament?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Neither the King nor Parliament had much Money at that time, in their own Hands, but were fain to rely upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of those that took their parts. Wherein (I confess) the Parliament had a mighty great advantage. Those that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King in that kind were only Lords and Gentlemen, which not approving the proceedings of the Parliament, were willing to undertake the payment every one of a certain number of Horse, which cannot be thought any very great assistance, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that payed them being so few: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moneys that the King then had, I have not heard of any, but what he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Jewels in the Low Countries. Whereas the Parliament had a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contribution, not only from <hi>London,</hi> but generally from their Faction in all other places of <hi>England,</hi> upon certain Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (published by the Lords and Commons in <hi>June</hi> 1642. at what time they had newly voted, that the King intended to make War upon them) for bringing in of Money or Plate to maintain Horse and Horse-men, and to buy Arms for the preservation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, and for the defence of the King, and both Houses of Parliament: For the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56428:97"/>
re-payment of which Money and Plate they were to have the Publick Faith.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What Publick Faith is there, when there is no Publick? What is it that can be called Publick in a Civil War without the King?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Truth is, the Security was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, but served well enough to gull those seditious Blockheads, that were more fond of Change, than either of their Peace or Profit.</p>
                        <p>Having by this means gotten Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from those that were the well-affected to their Cause, they made use of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to force the like Contribution from others: For in <hi>November</hi> following they made an Ordinance for Assessing also of those, that had not contributed then, or had contributed, but not proportionably to their Estates. And yet this was contrary to what the Parliament promised and declar'd in the Propositions themselves; for they declar'd in the first Proposition, That no man's affection should be measured by the proportion of his Offer, so that he expressed his good will to the Service in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Besides this, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> following, they made an Ordinance to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy weekly a great Sum of Money upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry County, City, Town, Place and Person
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56428:97"/>
of any Estate almost in <hi>England</hi>; which weekly Sum (as may appear by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it self printed and published in <hi>March</hi> 1642. by Order of both Houses) comes to almost 33000 <hi>l.</hi> and consequently to above 1700000 <hi>l.</hi> for the year. They had besides all this the profits of the Kings Lands and Woods, and whatsoever was remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid of any Subsidy formerly granted him, and the Tonnage and Poundage usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the King; besides the profit of the Sequestrations of great Persons, whom they pleased to vote Delinquents, and the profits of the Bishops Lands, which they took to themselves a year or a little more after.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Seeing then the Parliament had such advantage of the King in Money, and Arms, and Multitude of Men, and had in their Hands the King's Fleet; I cannot imagine what hope the King could have, either of Victory, (unless he resigned into their Hands the Sovereignty) or subsisting: for I cannot well believe he had any advantage of them, either in Councellors, Conductors, or in the Resolutions of his Soldiers.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>On the contrary, I think he had also some disadvantage in that: for though he had as good Officers at least, as any then served the Parliament, yet I doubt he had not so useful Councel as was necessary; and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56428:98"/>
for his Soldiers, though they were men as stout as theirs, yet because their Valor was not sharpned so with malice, as theirs was of the other side, they fought not so keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as their Enemies did: amongst whom there were a great many <hi>London</hi> Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who for want of Experience in the War, would have been fearful enough of Death and Wounds approaching visibly in glistering Swords; but for want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment scarce thought of such death as comes invisibly in a Bullet, and therefore were very hardly to be driven out of the Field.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But what fault do you find in the King's Councellors, Lords, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality and Experience?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Only that fault, which was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the whole Nation, which was, that they thought the Government of <hi>England</hi> was not an absolute, but a mixt Monarchy; and that if the King should clearly subdue this Parliament, that his Power would be what he pleased, and theirs as little as he pleased, which they counted Tyranny. This opinion, though it did not lessen their en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavour to gain the Victory for the King in a Battle, when a Battle could not be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it weakned their endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him an absolute Victory in the War. And for this Cause, notwithstanding that they saw that the Parliament was firmly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56428:98"/>
resolv'd to take all Kingly Power whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of his Hands; yet their Counsel to the King was upon all occasions, to offer Propositions to them of Treaty and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and to make and publish Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which any man might easily have foreseen would be fruitless; and not only so, but also of great disadvantage to those Actions by which the King was to recover his Crown, and preserve his Life: for it took off the Courage of the best and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest of his Soldiers, that looked for great benefit by their Service out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Rebels, in case they could sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them; but none at all if the business should be ended by a Treaty.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>And they had reason: for a Civil War never ends by Treaty without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of those, who were on both sides the sharpest. You know well enough how things pass'd at the Reconciliation of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> but I thought, that after they once began to Levy Soldiers one against another, that they would not any more have return'd of either side to Declarations, or other Paper War, which if it could have done any good, would have done it long before this.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>But seeing the Parliament continued writing, and set forth their Declarations to the People against the Lawfulness of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56428:99"/>
King's Commission of Array, and sent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the King as fierce and rebellious as ever they had done before, demanding of him, That he would disband his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and come up to the Parliament, and leave those whom the Parliament called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents (which were none but the King's best Subjects) to their Mercy, and pass such Bills, as they should advise him; would you not have the King set forth Declarations and Proclamations against the Illegality of their Ordinances, by which they Levied Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers against him, and answer those insolent Petitions of theirs?</p>

                        <p>No; it had done him no good before, and therefore was not likely to do him any afterwards: for the common people, whose hands were to decide the Controversie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the Reasons of either Party; and for those, that by Ambition were once set upon the Enterprize of changing the Government, they cared not much what was Reason and Justice in the Cause, but what strength they might procure by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Multitude with Remonstrances from the Parliament House, or by Sermons in the Churches. And to their Petitions I would not have had any Answer made at all, more than this; that if they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band their Army, and put themselves upon his Mercy, they should find him more Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than they expected.</p>

                        <p>You may know by the Declarations themselves, which are very long and full of quotations of Records, and of Cases for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Reported; that the Penners of them were either Lawyers by profession, or such Gentlemen as had the Ambition to be thought so. Besides, I told you before, that those which were then likeliest to have their Counsel asked in this business, were averse to absolute Monarchy, as also to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Democracy or Aristocracy; all which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56428:100"/>
Governments they esteemed Tyranny, and were in love with Monarchy, which they used to praise by the Name of mixt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, though it were indeed nothing else but pure Anarchy. And those Men, whose Pens the King most used in these Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Law and Politicks, were such (if I have not been misinformed) as having been Members of this Parliament, had declaimed against Ship-Money, and other Extraparlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Taxes, as much as any; but when they saw the Parliament grow higher in their Demands, than they thought they would have done, went over to the King's Party.</p>

                        <p>When the business was brought to this height by Levying of Soldiers and seizing of the Navy, and Arms, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on both sides, that no man was so blind as not to see, they were in an estate of War one against another; why did not the King (by Proclamation or Message) according to his undoubted Right, dissolve the Parliament,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56428:100"/>
and thereby diminish, in some part, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Levies, and of other their unjust Ordinances?</p>

                        <p>You have forgotten that I told you, that the King himself by a Bill that he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the same time, when he passed the Bill for the Execution of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> had given them Authority to hold the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament till they should, by consent of both Houses, dissolve themselves. If therefore he had by any Proclamation, or Message to the Houses, dissolved them, they would, to their former defamations of his Majesties Actions, have added this, that he was a breaker of his word; and not only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him have continued their Session, but also have made advantage of it, to the increase and strengthening of their own Party.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Would not the King's raising of an Army against them be interpreted, as a purpose to dissolve them by force? And was it not as great a breach of promise to scatter them by force, as to dissolve them by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation? Besides, I cannot conceive, that the passing of that Act was otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than conditionally; so long as they should not ordain any thing contrary to the Sovereign Right of the King; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they had already by many of their Ordinances broken. And I think, that even
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56428:101"/>
by the Law of Equity, which is the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Law of Nature, a man that has the Sovereign Power, cannot, if he would, give away the Right of any thing which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for him to retain for the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Subjects, unless he do it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, saying, That he will have the Sovereign Power no longer. For the giving away that, which by consequence only draws the Sovereignty along with it, is not (I think) a giving away of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but an error, such as works nothing but an invalidity in the Grant it self. And such was the King's passing of this Bill for the continuing of the Parliament as long as the two Houses pleased. But now that the War was resolved on, on both sides; what needed any more dispute in writing?</p>

                        <p>I know not what need they had, but on both sides they thought it needful to hinder one another, as much as they could, from Levying of Soldiers? and therefore the King did set forth Declarations in print to make the People know, that they ought not to obey the Officers of the new Militia, set up by Ordinance of Parliament, and also to let them see the Legality of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of Array. And the Parliament on their part did the like to justifie to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the said Ordinance, and to make the Commission of Array appear unlawful.</p>

                        <p>When the Parliament were Levying of Soldiers, was it not lawful for the King to Levy Soldiers to defend himself and his Right, though there had been no other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for it, but his own Preservation, and that the Name of Commission of Array had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before been heard of?</p>

                        <p>For my part (I think) there cannot be a better Title for War, than the defence of a man's own Right; but the People, at that time, thought nothing lawful for the King to do, for which there was not some Statute made by Parliament. For the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, I mean the Judges of the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and some few others, though but Advocates, yet of great reputation for their skill in the Common Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>England,</hi> had infected most of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> with their Maxims and Cases prejudged, which they call Presidents; and made them think so well of their own knowledge in the Law, that they were very glad of this occasion to shew it against the King, and thereby to gain a Reputation with the Parliament of being good Patriots, and wise States-men.</p>

you to the History thereof written at large in <hi>English.</hi> I shall only make use of such a thread as is necessary for the filling up of such knavery and folly also, as I shall observe in their several Actions.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>York</hi> the King went to <hi>Hull,</hi> where was his Magazine of Arms for the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> to try if they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him.

                        <p>Their pretence was this, that neither this, nor any other Town in <hi>England</hi> was otherwise the King's, than in trust for the People of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>I cannot see the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We represent the People, <hi>ergo</hi> all that the People has is ours. The Major of <hi>Hull</hi> did represent the King; is therefore all that the King had in <hi>Hull</hi> the Major's? The People of <hi>England</hi> may be represented
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56428:103"/>
with Limitations, as to deliver a Petition or the like: Does it follow, that they who deliver the Petition have right to all the Towns in <hi>England</hi>? When began this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be a Representative of <hi>England?</hi> Was it not <hi>November</hi> 3. 1640.? Who was it the day before, that is <hi>November</hi> 2. that had the Right to keep the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and possess it for themselves? for there was then no Parliament.

                        <p>I think it was the King's, not only because it was called the King's Town upon <hi>Hull</hi>; but because the King himself did then and ever represent the Person of the People of <hi>England.</hi> If he did not, who then did, the Parliament having no being?</p>

                        <p>They might perhaps say, the People had then no Representative.</p>

                        <p>Then there was no Common-wealth; and consequently all the Towns of <hi>England</hi> being the Peoples, you and I, and any man else might have put in for his share.

                        <p>The King in the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> after he had summoned <hi>Hull,</hi> and tried some of the Counties thereabout, what they would do for him, sets up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham</hi>; but there came not in thither men enough to make an Army sufficient to give battle to the Earl of <hi>Essex.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where he was quickly furnished; and appointing the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> to be General, he resolved to march towards <hi>London.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was now at <hi>Worcester</hi> with the Parliaments Army, making no offer to stop him in his passage; but as soon as he was gone by, marched close after him.</p>
                        <p>The King therefore, to avoid being inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between the Army of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and the City of <hi>London,</hi> turned upon him, and gave him battle at <hi>Edgehill</hi>; where though he got not an entire Victory, yet he had the better, if either had the better, and had certainly the fruit of a Victory, which was to march on in his intended way
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56428:104"/>
towards <hi>London</hi>; in which, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he took <hi>Banbury</hi> Castle, and from thence went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thence to <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where he gave a great defeat to three Regiments of the Parliaments Forces, and so returned to <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                        <p>The Parliament upon the first notice of the King's marching from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> caused all the Train'd-Bands, and the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (which was so frighted as to shut up all their Shops) to be drawn forth; so that there was a most compleat and numerous Army ready for the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> that was crept into <hi>London</hi> just at the time to head it; and this was it that made the King retire to <hi>Oxford.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>February</hi> after, Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> took <hi>Cirencester</hi> from the Parliament with many Prisoners and many Arms: for it was newly made a Magazine.

                        <p>In the West the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> had the Employment of putting in execution the Ordinance of Parliament for the Militia; and Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> for the King executed the Commission of Array. Between these two was fought a Battle at <hi>Liscard</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> had the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and presently took a Town called <hi>Saltash</hi> with many Arms, and much Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and many Prisoners.

                        <p>In the North, for the Commission of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray my Lord of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the Parliament was my Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax.</hi> My Lord of <hi>New-Castle</hi> took from the Parliament <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> in which were a great part of the Parliaments Forces for that Country, and had made himself in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Master of all the North. About this time, that is to say, in <hi>February,</hi> the Queen landed at <hi>Barlington,</hi> and was conducted by my Lord of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and the Marquess of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and not long after to the King.

                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:56428:105"/>There happened also between the Militia of the Parliament, and the Commission of Array in <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> under my Lord <hi>Brook</hi> for the Parliament, and my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> for the King, great contention, wherein both these Commanders were slain; for my Lord <hi>Brook</hi> besieging <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>-Close, was killed with a Shot; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which they gave not over the Siege till they were Masters of the Close; but presently after my Lord of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> besieged it again for the King; which to relieve Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> and Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> advanced towards <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and were met at <hi>Hopton</hi> Heath by the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> and routed; the Earl himself was slain; but his Forces <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                        <p>But the Parliament had now a better Army; in so much, that if the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had immediately followed the King to <hi>Oxford,</hi> (not yet well fortified) he might, in all likelihood, have taken it: for he could not want either Men, or Ammunition, whereof the City of <hi>London</hi> (which was wholly at the Parliaments Devotion) had store enough.</p>

                        <p>I cannot judge of that; but this is manifest, considering the estate the King was in at his first marching from <hi>York,</hi> when he had neither Money, nor Men, nor Arms enough to put them in hope of Victory; that this year (take it all together) was very prosperous.</p>

                        <p>But what great folly or wickedness do you observe in the Parliaments Actions for this first year?</p>

                        <p>All that can be said against them in that Point, will be excused with the pretext of War, and come under one name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; saving, that when they summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Town, it was always in the name of King and Parliament, the King being in the contrary Army, and many times beating them from the Siege. I do not see how the right of War can justifie such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence as that. But they pretended that the King was always virtually in the two Houses of Parliament, making a distinction between his Person Natural and Politick, which made the Impudence the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the folly of it: for this was but an University quibble, such as Boys make use of in maintaining (in the Schools) such Tenents, as they cannot otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
                        <p>In the end of this year they solicited also the <hi>Scots</hi> to enter <hi>England</hi> with an Army,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56428:106"/>
to suppress the Power of the Earl of <hi>New-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> in the North: which was a plain Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that the Parliaments Forces were at this time inferior to the King's; and most men thought, that if the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> had then marched Southward, and joyned his Forces with the King's, that most of the Members of Parliament would have fled out of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the beginning of 1643. the Parliament seeing the Earl of <hi>New Castle</hi>'s Power in the North grown so formidable, sent to the <hi>Scots</hi> to hire them to an Invasion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and (to complement them in the mean time) made a Covenant amongst themselves, such as the <hi>Scots</hi> had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against Episcopacy, and demolished Crosses and Church windows (such as had in them any Images of Saints) throughout all <hi>England.</hi> Also in the middle of the year they made a solemn League with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was called the Solemn League and Covenant.</p>

                        <p>Are not the <hi>Scots</hi> as properly to be called Forreigners as the <hi>Irish?</hi> Seeing then they persecuted the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> even to death, for advising the King to make use of <hi>Irish</hi> Forces against the Parliament, with what face could they call in a <hi>Scoth</hi> Army against the King?</p>

                        <p>The King's Party might easily here have discerned their Design to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolute Masters of the Kingdom, and to dethrone the King. Another great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, or rather a bestial incivility it was of theirs, that they voted the Queen a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for helping the King with some Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and <hi>English</hi> Forces from <hi>Holland.</hi>

                        <p>Was it possible that all this could be done, and men not see that Papers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations must be useless; and that nothing could satisfie them but the deposing of the King, and setting up of themselves in his place?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes; very possible. For who was there of them, though knowing that the King had the Sovereign Power, that knew the Essential Rights of Sovereignty? They dreamt of a mixt Power of the King and the two Houses. That it was a divided Power, in which there could be no peace, was above their understanding. Therefore they were always urging the King to Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Treaties, (for fear of subjecting themselves to the King in an absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) which increased the hope and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Rebels, but did the King little good: for the People either understand not, or will not trouble themselves with Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in writing, but rather by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance and Messages go away with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

that the Parliament was likely to have the Victory in the War. Besides, seeing the Penners and Contrivers of these Papers were formerly Members of the Parliament, and of another mind, and now revolted from the Parliament, because they could not bear that sway in the House, which they expected, men were apt to think they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not what they writ.</p>
                        <p>As for Military Actions (to begin at the Head Quarters) Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingiam,</hi> a Garrison of the Parliaments. In <hi>July</hi> after the King's Forces had a great Victory over the Parliaments near <hi>Devizes</hi> on <hi>Roundway-down,</hi> where they took 2000 Prisoners, four Brass Pieces of Ordnance, 28 Colours, and all their Baggage; and shortly after <hi>Bristol</hi> was surrendred to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> for the King: and the King himself marching into the West, took from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament many other considerable places.</p>
                        <p>But this good fortune was not a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by his besieging of <hi>Glocester,</hi> which after it was reduced to the last gasp, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose Army was before greatly wasted, but now sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recruited with the Train'd-Bands and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices of <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>It seems, not only by this, but also by many Examples in History, that there can hardly arise a long or dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56428:107"/>

                        <p>Nay more; those great Capital Cities, when Rebellion is upon pretence of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, must needs be of the Rebel-party, because the Grievances are but Taxes, to which Citizens, that is, Merchants, whose profession is their private gain, are naturally mortal Enemies; their only glory being to grow excessively rich by the wisdom of buying and selling.</p>

                        <p>But they are said to be of all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the most beneficial to the Common-wealth, by setting the poorer sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on work.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>That is to say, by making poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sell their labour to them, at their own prizes; so that poor People, for the most part, might get a better Living by working in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> than by spinning, weaving, and other such labour, as they can do; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that by working slightly they may help themselves a little, to the disgrace of our Manufacture. And as most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are the first Encouragers of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, presuming of their strength; so also are they, for the most part, the first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, deceived by them that command their strength.</p>

                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56428:108"/>But to return to the War; though the King withdrew from <hi>Glocester,</hi> yet it was not to fly from, but to fight with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which presently after he did at <hi>Newbury,</hi> where the Battle was bloody, and the King had not the worst, unless <hi>Cirence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> be put into the Scale, which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had in his way a few days before sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized.</p>
                        <p>But in the North and the West the King had much the better of the Parliament, for in the North, at the very beginning of the year <hi>March</hi> 29<hi>th</hi> the Earls of <hi>New-Castle</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> defeated the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who commanded in those parts for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) at <hi>Bramham-Moore,</hi> which made the Parliament to hasten the assistance of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>June</hi> following, the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> routed Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> (Son to the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>) upon <hi>Adderton-Heath,</hi> and in pursuit of them to <hi>Bradford,</hi> took and kill'd 2000 Men, and the next day took the Town and 2000 Prisoners more, (Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> himself hardly escaping) with all their Arms and Ammunition. And besides this, made the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> quit <hi>Halifax</hi> and <hi>Beverly.</hi> Lastly, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Newark,</hi> besieged by Sir <hi>John Meldrun,</hi> for the Parliament, with 7000 Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 1000 were slain; the rest upon Articles
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56428:108"/>
departed, leaving behind them their Arms, Bag and Baggage.</p>
                        <p>To ballance in part this success, the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> whose Lieutenant-General was <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> got a Victory over the Royalists near <hi>Horncastle,</hi> of whom he slew 400, took 800 Prisoners, and 1000 Arms, and presently after took and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the City of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the West <hi>May</hi> 16<hi>th,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> at <hi>Stratton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> had a Victory over the Parliamentarians, wherein he took 1700 Prisoners, 13 Brass Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and all their Ammunition, which was 70 Barrels of Powder, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of their other Provisions in the Town.</p>
                        <p>Again at <hi>Landsdown,</hi> between Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and the Parliamentarians, under Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> was fought a fierce Battle, wherein the Victory was not very clear on either side; saving that the Parliamentarians might seem to have the better, because pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> followed Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to <hi>Devizes</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> though to his Cost; for there he was overthrown, as I have already told you.</p>
                        <p>After this the King in Person marched into the West, and took <hi>Exeter, Dorcester, Barnstable,</hi> and divers other places, and had he not at his return besieged <hi>Glocester,</hi> and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56428:109"/>
thereby given the Parliament time for new Levies, 'twas thought by many he might have routed the House of Commons. But the end of this year was more favourable to the Parliament; for in <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>March</hi> the first crossed the <hi>Tyne,</hi> and whilst the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> was marching to them, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> gathered together a considerable Party in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> from <hi>Lyn</hi> advanced towards <hi>York</hi>; so that the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> having two Armies of the Rebels behind him, and another before him, was forced to retreat to <hi>York,</hi> which those three Armies joyning presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged; and these are all the considerable Military Actions of the Year 1643.</p>
                        <p>In the same Year the Parliament caused to be made a new Great Seal. The Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had carried the former Seal to <hi>Oxford.</hi> Hereupon the King sent a Messenger to the Judges at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to forbid them to make use of it. This Messenger was taken, and condemn'd at a Councel of War, and hang'd for a Spy.</p>

Gentlemen at <hi>London</hi> receiv'd a Commission of Array from the King, to Levy Men for his Service in that City, being discovered, they were condemn'd, and some of them executed. This Case is not much unlike the former.</p>

                        <p>The Entrance of the <hi>Scots</hi> was a thing unexpected to the King, who was made to believe, by continual Letters from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that the <hi>Scotch</hi> never intended any Invasion. The Duke being then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the King (assur'd that the <hi>Scotch</hi> were now entred) sent him Prisoner to <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the Year 1644. the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> being (as I told you) besieged by the joynt Forces of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> the King sent Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to relieve the Town, and as soon as he could to give the Enemy battle. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> passing through <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and by the way having stormed that seditious Town of <hi>Bolton,</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56428:110"/>
taken in <hi>Stockford</hi> and <hi>Leverpool,</hi> came to <hi>York, July</hi> the first, and relieved it; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy being risen thence to a place called <hi>Marston-Moor,</hi> about four Miles off; and there was fought that unfortunate Battle, which lost the King in a manner all the North. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> returned by the way he came, and the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and thence with some of his Officers over the Sea to <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Honour of this Victory was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted chiefly to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> Lieutenant-General.) The Parliamentarians returned from the Field to the Siege of <hi>York,</hi> which not long after, upon honourable Articles, was surrendred; not that they were favoured, but because the Parliament employed not much time, nor many Men in Sieges.</p>

                        <p>It wat so: but amends was made him for it within five or six weeks after. For Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> (after the loss of his Army at <hi>Roundway-down</hi>) had another raised for him by the City of <hi>London</hi>; who for the payment thereof, imposed a weekly Tax of the value of one meals meat upon every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. This Army, with that of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> intended to besiege <hi>Oxford</hi>; which the King understanding, sent the Queen into
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56428:110"/>
the West, and marched himself towards <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi> This made them to divide again, and the Earl to go into the West, and <hi>Waller</hi> to pursue the King. By this means (as it fell out) both their Armies were defeated; for the King turned upon <hi>Waller,</hi> routed him at <hi>Copredy-Bridge,</hi> took his Train of Artillery and many Officers; and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently followed the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> into <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> where he had him at such advantage, that the Earl himself was fain to escape in a small Boat to <hi>Plimouth</hi>; his Horse brake through the King's Quarters by night; but the Infantry were all forced to lay down their Arms, and upon condition never more to bear Arms against the King, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to depart.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>October</hi> following was fought a second and sharp Battle at <hi>Newbury:</hi> for this Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, making no Conscience of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made with the King, being now come towards <hi>London,</hi> as far as <hi>Basingstoke,</hi> had Arms put again into their hands; to whom some of the Train'd-Bands being added, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had suddenly so great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that he attempted the King again at <hi>Newbury.</hi> And certainly had the better of the day, but the night parting them, had not a compleat Victory. And it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd here, that no part of the Earl's Army fought so keenly, as they who had laid down
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56428:111"/>
their Arms in <hi>Cornwal.</hi> These were the most important Fights in the Year 1644. and the King was yet (as both himself and others thought) in as good condition as the Parliament, which despair'd of Victory by the Commanders they then used.</p>
                        <p>Therefore they voted a new modeling of the Army, suspecting the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> though I think wrongfully, to be too much a Royalist; for not having done so much as they looked for in this second Battle at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Manchester</hi> perceiving what they went about, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily laid down their Commissions; and the House of Commons made an Ordinance, That no Member of either House should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any Office, or Command Military or Civil; with which oblique blow they shook off those that had hitherto served them too well: and yet out of this Ordinance they excepted <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> in whose Conduct and Valor they had very great confidence, (which they would not have done, if they had known him as well then as they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) and made him Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> their new made General. In the Commission to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> there was a Clause for preservation of his Majesties Person, which in this new Commission was left out; though the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (as well as the General) were as yet Presbyterian.</p>

                        <p>For my part I doubt it not. For a Rightful King living, an usurping Power can never be sufficiently secur'd.</p>
                        <p>In this same Year the Parliament put to death Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> and his Son, for tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> about the Rendition of <hi>Hull</hi>; and Sir <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> for endeavouring to deliver up <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> where he was Governour for the Parliament; and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> for nothing, but to please the <hi>Scots:</hi> For the general Article of going about to subvert the fundamental Laws of the Land, was no Accusation, but only foul words. They then also voted down the Book of Common-Prayer, and ordered the use of a Directory, which had been newly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by an Assembly of Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. They were also then, with much ado, prevailed with for a Treaty with the King at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> where they remitted nothing of their former Demands. The King had also at this time a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> consisting of such discontented Members as had left the Houses at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> but few of them had changed their old Principles, and therefore that Parliament was not much worth. Nay rather, because
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56428:112"/>
they endeavour'd nothing but Messages and Treaties, that is to say, defeating of the Soldiers hope of benefit by the War, they were thought by most men to do the King more hurt than good.</p>
                        <p>The Year 1645. was to the King very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate; for by the loss of one great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he lost all he had formerly gotten, and at length his life.</p>
                        <p>The new model'd Army, after Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether they should lay Siege to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> or march Westward to the relief of <hi>Taunton,</hi> (then besieged by the Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and defended by <hi>Blake,</hi> famous after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his Actions at Sea) resolved for <hi>Taunton,</hi> leaving <hi>Cromwel</hi> to attend the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King, though not strong enough to hinder him. The King, upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, drew his Forces and Artillery out of <hi>Oxford.</hi> This made the Parliament to call back their General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and order him to besiege <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King, in the mean time, relieved <hi>Chester,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> and coming back took <hi>Leicester</hi> by force; a Place of great Importance, and well provided of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and Provision.</p>
                        <p>Upon this Success it was generally thought, that the King's Party was the stronger. The King himself thought so, and the Parliament in a manner confess'd the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56428:112"/>
same, by commanding <hi>Fairfax</hi> to rise from the Siege, and endeavour to give the King battle: for the Successes of the King, and the Divisions and Treacheries growing now amongst themselves, had driven them to rely upon the fortune of one day; in which at <hi>Naseby</hi> the Kings Army was utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and no hope left him to raise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore, after the Battle, he went up and down, doing the Parliament here and there some shrewd turns, but never much encreasing his number.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fairfax,</hi> in the mean time, first recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Leicester,</hi> and then marching into the West subdued it all, except only a few Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; forcing, with much ado, my Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> (upon Honourable Conditions) to disband his Army, and with the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to pass over to <hi>Scilly,</hi> whence, not long after, they went to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1646. General <hi>Fairfax</hi> began to march back to <hi>Oxford.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> who besieged <hi>Woodstock,</hi> had it surrendered. The King therefore, who was now also returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> from whence <hi>Woodstock</hi> is but six Miles, not doubting, but that he should there by <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> be besieged, and having no Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, resolved to get away disguis'd to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army about <hi>Newark</hi>; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he came the fourth of <hi>May</hi>; and the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56428:113"/>
                           <hi>Scotch</hi> Army being upon remove home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, carried him with them to <hi>New-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> whither he came <hi>May</hi> 13<hi>th.</hi>

                        <p>Why did the King trust himself with the <hi>Scots?</hi> They were the first that rebell'd. They were Presbyterians, <hi>i. e.</hi> cruel; besides they were indigent, and consequently might be suspected, would sell him to his Enemies for Money. And lastly, they were too weak to defend him, or keep him in their Countrey.</p>

                        <p>What could he have done better? for he had in the Winter before sent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to get a Pass for the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and others, to bring them Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace: It was denied. He sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; it was denied again. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd he might come to them in Person: This also was denied. He sent again and again to the same purpose; but in stead of granting it, they made an Ordinance, That the Commanders of the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> in case the King should attempt to come within the Line of Communication, should raise what force they thought fit to suppress Tumults, to apprehend such as came with him, and to secure (<hi>i. e.</hi> to imprison) his Person from danger. If the King had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to come, and had been imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; What could the Parliament have done with him? They had dethron'd him by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56428:113"/>
their Votes; and therefore could have no security, whilst he liv'd, though in prison. It may be they would not have put him to death by a High Court of Justice publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but secretly some other way.</p>

                        <p>That had been from <hi>Oxford</hi> very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. Besides it was generally believ'd, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army had promised him, that not only his Majesty, but also his Friends that should come with him, should be in their Army safe; not only for their Persons, but also for their Honours and Consciences. 'Tis a pretty trick, when the Army, and the particular Soldiers of the Army are different things, to make the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers promise what the Army means not to perform.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>July</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi> the Parliament sent their Propositions to the King at <hi>New-Castle</hi>; which Propositions they pretended to be the only way to a setled and well grounded Peace. They were brought by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Earle,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hyppesly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi>; whom the King asked if they had power to Treat? and when they said no, why they might not as well have been sent by a Trumpeter? The Propositions were the same dethroning ones, which they used
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56428:114"/>
to send, and therefore the King would not assent to them. Nor did the <hi>Scots</hi> swallow them at first, but made some exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; only, it seems, to make the Parliament perceive, they meant not to put the King into their hands <hi>gratis.</hi> And so at last the bargain was made between them; and upon the payment of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> the King was put into the hands of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, which the <hi>English</hi> Parliament sent down to receive him.</p>

                        <p>By this time the Parliament had taken in all the rest of the Kings Garrisons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the last was <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle, whither Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> had been sent Prisoner by the King.</p>

                        <p>How were they subject to the <hi>English</hi> more than the <hi>English</hi> to the <hi>Irish</hi>? They were subject to the King of <hi>England</hi>; but so also were the <hi>English</hi> to the King of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                        <p>This Distinction is somewhat too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til for common Understandings. In <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Montrosse</hi> for the King, with a very few Men, and miraculous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, had over-run all <hi>Scotland,</hi> where many of his Forces (out of too much secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) were permitted to be absent for a while; of which the Enemy having Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, suddenly came upon them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to fly back into the Highlands to recruit; where he began to recover strength, when he was commanded by the King (then in the hands of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>New-Castle</hi>) to disband; and he departed from <hi>Scotland</hi> by Sea.</p>
                        <p>In the end of the same year 1646. the Parliament caused the Kings Great Seal to be broken; also the King was brought to <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and there kept by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Commissioners; and here was an end of that War, as to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not to <hi>Ireland.</hi> About this time also

                        <p>The Right was certainly in the King, but the Exercise was yet in no body; but contended for, as in a Game at Cards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting all the years 1647. and 1648. between the Parliament and <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> Lieutenant-General to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You must know, that when King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> abolished the Popes Authority here, and took upon him to be the Head of the Church, the Bishops, as they could not resist him, so neither were they discontented with it. For whereas before, the Pope allowed not the Bishops to claim Jurisdiction in their Diocesses <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is of Right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, but by the Gift and Authority of the Pope, now that the Pope was outed, they made no doubt but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right was in themselves. After this the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and divers other places beyond Sea, having revolted from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, set up Presbyteries for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their several Churches; and divers <hi>English</hi> Scholars that went beyond Sea, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the persecution in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were much taken with this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56428:115"/>
and at their return, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ever since have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, to the great trouble of the Church and Nation, to set up that Government here, wherein they might domineer, and applaud their own Wit and Learning: and these took upon them, not only a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, but also a Divine Inspiration: and having been connived at and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sometimes in their frequent preaching, they introduced many strange and many pernicious Doctrines, out-doing the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, (as they pretended, both of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>) receding from the former Divinity or Church-Philosophy, (for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is another thing) as much as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had receded from the Pope, and distracted their Auditors into a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sects, as Brownists, Anabaptists, Independents, Fifth-monarchy-men, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and divers others, all commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Fanaticks: in so much as there was no so dangerous an Enemy to the Presbyterians as this brood of their own hatching.</p>
                        <p>These were <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s best Cards, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had a very great number in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and some in the House, whereof he himself was thought one, though he were nothing certain, but applying himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the Faction that was strongest, was of a colour like it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:56428:116"/>There were in the Army a great number (if not the greatest part) that aimed only at rapine, and sharing the Lands and Goods of their Enemies; and these also, upon the opinion they had of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Valor and Conduct, thought they could not any way better arrive at their ends, than by adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him. Lastly, in the Parliament it self, though not the Major part, yet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number were Fanaticks, enough to put in doubts, and cause delay in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of the House, and sometimes also by advantage of a thin House, to carry a Vote in favour of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as they did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> For whereas on the fourth of <hi>May</hi> precedent the Parliament had voted that the Militia of <hi>London</hi> should be in the hands of a Committee of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whereof the Lord Major for the time being should be one; shortly after, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents chancing to be the major, made an Ordinance, by which it was put into hands more favourable to the Army.</p>
                        <p>The best Cards the Parliament had were the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Person of the King. The General, Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax,</hi> was right Presbyterian, but in the hands of the Army, and the Army in the hands of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but which Party should prevail depended on the playing of the Game. <hi>Cromwel</hi> protested still obedience and fidelity
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56428:116"/>
to the Parliament, but meaning nothing less, bethought him, and resolv'd on a way to excuse himself of all that he should do to the contrary upon the Army. Therefore he and his Son-in-law Commissary-General <hi>Ireton,</hi> as good at contriving as himself, and at speaking and writing better, contrive how to mutiny the Army against the Parliament. To this end they spread a whisper through the Army, that the Parliament, now they had the King, intended to disband them, to cheat them of their Arrears, and to send them into <hi>Ireland</hi> to be destroyed by the <hi>Irish.</hi> The Army being herewith enraged, were taught by <hi>Ireton</hi> to erect a Councel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, of two Soldiers out of every Troop, and every Company, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult for the good of the Army, and to assist at the Councel of War, and to advise for the Peace and safety of the Kingdom. These were called Adjutators, so that whatsoever <hi>Cromwel</hi> would have to be done, he needed nothing to make them do it; but secretly to put it into the head of these Adjutators. The effect of the first Consultation was, to take the King from <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and to bring him to the Army.</p>
                        <p>The General hereupon, by Letter to the Parliament, excuses himself, and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the Body of the Army, as ignorant of the Fact; and that the King came away wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56428:117"/>
with those Soldiers that brought him: assuring them withal, that the whole Army intended nothing but Peace, nor opposed Presbytery, nor affected Independency, nor did hold any licentious freedom in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

                        <p>By declaring directly for him, he might have had all the King's Party, which were many more now since his misfortune, than ever they were before: For in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it self there were many that had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Hypocrisie and private Aims of their Fellows. Many were converted to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56428:118"/>
their Duty by their own Natural Reason; and their Compassion for the King's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had begot generally an Indignation against the Parliament; so that if they had been by the Protection of the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my brought together, and embodied, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> might have done what he had pleas'd in the first place for the King, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for himself: but it seems he meant first to try what he could do without the King, and if that proved enough to rid his hands of him.</p>

                        <p>What did the Parliament and City do to oppose the Army?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>First, the Parliament sent to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to re-deliver the King to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners. In stead of an Answer to this, the Army sent Articles to the Parliament, and with them a charge against eleven of their Members, all of them active Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians: of which Articles these are some. 1. That the House may be purged of those, who by the self-denying Ordinance ought not to be there. 2. That such as abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and endangered the Kingdom might be disabled to do the like hereafter. 3. That a day might be appointed to determine this Parliament. 4. That they would make an Accompt to the Kingdom of the vast Sums of Money they had received. 5. That the eleven Members might presently be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56428:118"/>
sitting in the House. These were the Articles that put them to their Trumps, and they answered none of them, but that of the suspension of the eleven Members, which they said they could not do by Law, till the Particulars of the Charge were produced: but this was soon answer'd with their own proceeding against the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Parliament being thus somewhat awed, and the King made somewhat confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; he undertakes the City, requiring the Parliament to put the Militia of <hi>London</hi> into other hands.</p>

                        <p>I told you that the Militia of <hi>London</hi> was, on the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> put into the hands of the Lord-Major and other Citizens, and soon after put into the hands of other men more favourable to the Army; and now I am to tell you, that on <hi>July</hi> the 26<hi>th</hi> the violence of certain Apprentices and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Soldiers forced the Parliament to re-settle it as it was in the Citizens; and hereupon the two Speakers and divers of the Members ran away to the Army where they were invited, and contented to sit and vote in the Councel of War, in nature of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and out of these Citizens hands they would have the Militia taken away,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56428:119"/>
and put again into those hands, out of which it was taken the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Londoners</hi> manned their Works, <hi>viz.</hi> the Line of Communication, raised an Army of valiant Men within the Line, chose good Officers, all being desirous to go out and fight, whensoever the City should give them Order, and in that posture stood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Enemy.</p>
                        <p>The Soldiers in the mean time enter into an Engagement to live and die with Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax,</hi> and the Parliament, and the Army.</p>

                        <p>That's very fine. They imitate that which the Parliament did, when they first took up Arms against the King, stiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the King and Parliament, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the King was always virtually in his Parliament: So the Army now making War against the Parliament, called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Parliament and the Army: but they might with more reason say, that the Parliament (since it was in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Pocket) was virtually in the Army.</p>

                        <p>Withal they send out a Declaration of the Grounds of their March towards <hi>London</hi>; wherein they take upon them to be Judges of the Parliament, and of who are fit to be trusted with the business of the Kingdom, giving them the name, not of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56428:119"/>
the Parliament, but of the Gentlemen at <hi>Westminster.</hi> For since the violence they were under <hi>July</hi> the 26<hi>th,</hi> the Army denied them to be a Lawful Parliament. At the same time they sent a Letter to the Major and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> reproaching them with those late Tumults, telling them they were Enemies to the Peace, Treacherous to the Parliament, unable to defend either the Parliament or themselves, and demanded to have the City delivered into their hands, to which purpose they said they were now coming to them. The General also sent out his Warrants to the Counties adjacent, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning their Trained Soldiers to joyn with them.</p>

                        <p>Were the Trained Soldiers part of the General's Army?</p>

                        <p>No, nor at all in pay, nor could be without an Order of Parliament. But what might an Army do after it had mastered all the Laws of the Land? The Army being come to <hi>Hounsloe</hi>-Heath, distant from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> but ten Miles, the Court of Aldermen was called to consider what to do. The Captains and Soldiers of the City were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and well provided to go forth and give them battle: but a Treacherous Officer, that had charge of a Work on <hi>Southwerk</hi> side, had let in within the Line a small Party of the Enemies, who marched as far as to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56428:120"/>
the Gate of <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and then the Court of Aldermen (their hearts failing them) submitted on these conditions: To relinquish their Militia: To desert the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Members: To deliver up the Forts and Line of Communication, together with the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and all Magazines and Arms therein to the Army: To disband their Forces, and turn out all the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, <hi>i. e.</hi> all <hi>Essex</hi>'s old Soldiers: To draw off their Guards from the Parliament; all which was done, and the Army marched triumphantly through the principal Streets of the City.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis strange that the Major and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having such an Army, should so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield. Might they not have resisted the Party of the Enemy at the Bridge with a Party of their own; and the rest of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies with the rest of their own?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>I cannot judge of that: but to me it would have been strange, if they had done otherwise: for I consider the most part of rich Subjects, that have made themselves so by Craft and Trade, as Men that never look upon any thing but their present profit, and who to every thing not lying in that way are in a manner blind, being amazed at the very thought of plundering. If they had understood what vertue there is to preserve their Wealth in obedience to their Lawful
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56428:120"/>
Sovereign, they would never have sided with the Parliament, and so we had had no need of arming. The Major and Aldermen therefore being assured by this submission to save their Goods, and not sure of the same by resisting, seem to me to have taken the wisest course; nor was the Parliament less tame than the City; for presently, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> the sixth, the General brought the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Speakers and Members to the House with a strong Guard of Soldiers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed the Speakers in their Chairs; and for this they gave the General thanks, not only there in the House, but appointed also a day for a Holy Thanksgiving, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made him <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of all the Forces of <hi>England,</hi> and Constable of the Tower: but in effect all this was the advancement of <hi>Cromwel</hi>; for he was the usufructuary, though the property were in Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> For the Independents immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cast down the whole Line of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, divide the Militia of <hi>London, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> which were before united; displaced such Governours of Towns and Forts as were not for their turn, though placed there by Ordinance of Parliament, in stead of whom they put in Men of their own Party. They also made the Parliament to declare null all that had passed in the Houses from <hi>July</hi> the 26<hi>th</hi> to <hi>August</hi> the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56428:121"/>

                           <hi>Cromwel</hi> had power enough now to restore the King: Why did he not?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>His main end was to set himself in his place. The Restoring of the King was but a Reserve against the Parliament, which being in his Pocket, he had no more need of the King, who was now an Impediment to him. To keep him in the Army was a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; To let him fall into the hands of the Presbyterians had been a stop to his hopes; To murder him privately, (besides the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Act) now whilst he was no more than Lieutenant-General, would have made him odious without farthering his Design. There was nothing better for his purpose, than to let him escape from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> (where he was too near the Parliament) whither he pleased beyond Sea; for though <hi>Cromwel</hi> had a great Party in the Parliament House, whilst they saw not his ambition to be their Master, yet they would have been his Enemies, as soon as that had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To make the King attempt an escape, some of those that had him in custody, by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s direction, told him that the Adjutators meant to murder him; and withal caused a Rumor of the same to be generally spread, to the end it might
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56428:121"/>
that way also come to the King's Ear, as it did.</p>
                        <p>The King therefore in a dark and rainy night (his Guards being retir'd, as it was thought on purpose) left <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and went to the Sea-side about <hi>Southampton,</hi> where a Vessel had been bespoken to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport him, but failed; so that the King was forced to trust himself with Collonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> then Governour of the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi>; expecting perhaps some kindness from him for Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s sake, Brother to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, and his Majesties much favour'd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain: but it prov'd otherwise; for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel sent to his Masters of the Parliament to receive their Orders concerning him. This going into the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> was not likely to be any part of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Design, who neither knew whither, nor which way he would go, nor had <hi>Hammond</hi> known any more than other men, if the Ship had come to the appointed place in due time.</p>

                        <p>Yes much; just as they assisted his Son our present most Gracious Sovereign, who two years before fled thither out of <hi>Cornwal.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis methinks no great Politie in Neighbouring Princes to favour so often as they do one anothers Rebels, especially when they rebel against Monarchy it self. They should rather first make a League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Rebellion, and afterwards (if there be no remedy) fight one against another. Nor will that serve the turn amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sovereigns, till preaching be better look'd to, whereby the Interpretation of a Verse in the Hebrew, Greek or Latin Bible, is oftentimes the cause of Civil War, and the Deposing and Assassinating of God's Anointed: and yet converse with those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Disputers as long as you will, you will hardly find one in a hundred discreet enough to be employed in any great affair either of War or Peace. It is not the Right of the Sovereign, though granted to him by every man's express consent, that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to do his Office; it is the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Subject that must do that. For what good is it to promise Allegiance, and then by and by to cry out, (as some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters did in the Pulpit) <hi>To your Tents, O Israel!</hi> Common People know nothing of Right or Wrong by their own Meditation; they must therefore be taught the Grounds of their Duty, and the Reasons why Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ever follow Disobedience to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereigns. But to the contrary our
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56428:122"/>
Rebels were publickly taught Rebellion in the Pulpits; and that there was no sin, but the doing of what the Preachers forbad, or the omission of what they advis'd. But now the King was the Parliaments Prisoner, why did not the Presbyterians advance their own Interest by restoring him?</p>

                        <p>The Parliament, in which there were more Presbyterians yet than Independents, might have gotten what they would of the King, during his Life, if they had not by an unconscionable and sottish Ambition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed the way to their Ends. They sent him four Propositions to be signed and pass'd by him, as Acts of Parliament, telling him when these were granted, they would send Commissioners to treat with him of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles.</p>
                        <p>The Propositions were these. First: That the Parliament should have the Militia, and the Power of Levying Money to maintain it for 20 years, and after that Term, the exercise thereof to return to the King, in case the Parliament think the safety of the Kingdom concern'd in it.</p>

                        <speaker>B,</speaker>
                        <p>The first Article takes from the King the Militia, and consequently the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty for ever.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Second was: That the King should justifie the Proceedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament against himself; and declare void all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56428:123"/>
Oaths and Declarations made by him against the Parliament.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This was to make him guilty of the War, and of all the Blood spilt therein.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Third was: To take away all Titles of Honour conferred by the King, since the Great Seal was carried to him in <hi>May</hi> 1642.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth was: That the Parliament should adjourn themselves when and to what place, and for what time they pleas'd.</p>
                        <p>These Propositions the King refused to grant, as he had reason; but sent others of his own, not much less advantagious to the Parliament, and desir'd a Personal Treaty with the Parliament for the setling of the Peace of the Kingdom; but the Parliament denying them to be sufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, voted; That there should be no more Addresses made to him, nor Messages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him; but that they would set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Kingdom without him. And this they voted partly upon the Speeches and Menaces of the Army-Faction then present in the House of Commons: whereof one advised these Three Points.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To secure the King in some Inland Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle with Guards. 2. To draw up Articles of Impeachment against him. 3. To lay him by, and settle the Kingdom without him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:56428:123"/>Another said; That his denying of the four Bills was the denying Protection to his Subjects; and that therefore they might deny him subjection: and added, that till the Parliament forsook the Army, the Army would never forsake the Parliament. This was threatning.</p>
                        <p>Last of all, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself told them, It was now expected that the Parliament should govern and defend the Kingdom, and not any longer let the People expect their safety from a Man, whose Heart God had hardned; nor let those that had so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Parliament be left hereafter to the rage of an irreconcilable Enemy, lest they seek their safety some other way. This again was threatning; as also the laying his hand upon his Sword, when he spake it.</p>
                        <p>And hereupon the Vote of Non-Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was made an Ordinance; which the House would afterwards have recalled, but was forced by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to keep their word.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> were displeased with it, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because their Brethren the Presbyterians had lost a great deal of their power in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and partly also because they had sold the King into their hands.</p>
                        <p>The King now published a passionate Complaint to his People of this hard dealing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56428:124"/>
with him, which made them pity him: but not yet rise in his behalf.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>By no means. There were yet many obstacles to be removed. He was not Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Army. The Army was still for a Parliament. The City of <hi>London</hi> discontented about their Militia. The <hi>Scots</hi> expected with an Army to rescue the King. His Adjutators were Leavelers, and against Monarchy, who though they had helped him to bring under the Parliament, yet like Dogs that are easily taught to fetch, and not easily taught to render, would not make him King. So that <hi>Cromwel</hi> had these busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses following to overcome, before he could formally make himself a Sovereign Prince.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To be <hi>Generalissimo.</hi> 2. To remove the King. 3. To suppress all Insurrections here. 4. To oppose the <hi>Scots</hi>; and lastly, To dissolve the present Parliament. Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty businesses, which he could never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself to overcome; therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe he then thought to be King, but only by well serving the strongest Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which was always his main Politie) to proceed as far as that and fortune would carry him.</p>

                        <p>The Parliament were certainly no less foolish than wicked in deserting thus the King, before they had the Army at a better Command than they had.</p>

                        <p>In the beginning of 1648. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave Commission to <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (then made Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> together with some of the Doctors there, as good Divines as he) to purge the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, by vertue whereof they turned out all such as were not of their Faction, and all such as had approved the use of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book; as also divers scandalous Ministers and Scholars, (that is such as customarily and without need took the Name of God into their Mouths, or used to speak wantonly, or use the company of lewd Women:) And for this last I cannot but commend them.</p>

                        <p>So shall not I; for it is just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piece of piety, as to turn men out of an Hospital because they are lame.

                        <p>It may be the Parliament thought otherwise: for I have often heard the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of Parents, that their Children were debauched there to drunkenness, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, gaming, and other vices consequent to these: nor is it a wonder amongst so
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56428:125"/>
many Youths, if they did not corrupt one another in despite of their Tutors, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes were little elder than themselves. And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think the Parliament did not much reverence that Institution of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, as to the bringing up of young men to vertue, though many of them learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there to preach, and became thereby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of preferment and maintenance; and some others were sent thither by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to save themselves the trouble of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them at home, during that time wherein Children are least governable. Nor do I think the Parliament cared more for the Clergy than other men did: but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an University is an excellent Servant to the Clergy; and the Clergy, if it be not carefully look'd to, (by their Dissentions in Doctrines, and by the advantage to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their Dissentions) is an excellent means to divide a Kingdom into Factions.</p>

                        <p>The first Insurrection, or rather Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, was that of the Apprentices, on the ninth of <hi>April</hi>; but this was not upon the King's account, but arose from a Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Assembly of them for Recreation in <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> whence some zealous Officers of the Trained Soldiers would needs drive them away by force; but were themselves routed with Stones; and had their Ensign taken away by the Apprentices, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in the Streets, and frighted the Lord-Major into his House, where they took a Gun called a Drake, and then they set Guards at some of the Gates, and all the rest of the day childishly swaggered up and down: but the next day the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self marching into the City quickly disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them. This was but a small business, but enough to let them see that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ill belov'd of the People.</p>
                        <p>Next the <hi>Welch</hi> took Arms against them. There were three Collonels in <hi>Wales, Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, Poyer</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done the Parliament good service, but now were commanded to disband; which they refused to do; and the better to strengthen
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56428:126"/>
themselves, declared for the King, and were about 8000.</p>
                        <p>About the same time, in <hi>Wales</hi> also, was another Insurrection headed by Sir <hi>Nicholas Keymish,</hi> and another under Sir <hi>John Owen</hi>; so that now all <hi>Wales</hi> was in Rebellion against the Parliament, and yet all these were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a months time by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Officers; but not without store of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed on both sides.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>Presently after this, some of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Surrey</hi> sent a Petition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a personal Treaty between the King and Parliament; but their Messengers were beaten home again by the Soldiers that quartered about <hi>Westminster</hi> and the <hi>Mews.</hi> And then the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men having a like Petition to deliver, and seeing how ill it was like to be receiv'd, threw it away, and took up Arms. They had many gallant Officers, and for General the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and encreased daily by Apprentices and old disbanded Soldiers. In so much as the Parliament was glad to restore to the City their Militia, and to keep Guards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Thames</hi> side: and then <hi>Fairfax</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the Enemy.</p>

                        <p>And then the <hi>Londoners,</hi> I think, might easily and suddenly have mastered, first the Parliament, and next <hi>Fairfax</hi> his 8000, and lastly <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army; or at least have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Scots</hi> Army opportunity to march unfoughten to <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis true: but the City was never good at venturing; nor were they or the <hi>Scots</hi> principled to have a King over them, but under them. <hi>Fairfax</hi> marching with his 8000 against the Royalists, routed a part of them at <hi>Maidstone</hi>; another part were taking in of places in <hi>Kent</hi> farther off; and the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> with the rest, came to <hi>Black-heath,</hi> and thence sent to the City to get passage through it, to joyn with those which were risen in <hi>Essex</hi> under Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Lisle</hi>; which being denied, the greatest part of his <hi>Kentish</hi> Men deserted him. With the rest, not above 500, he crossed the <hi>Thames</hi> into the isle of <hi>Dogs,</hi> and so to <hi>Bow,</hi> and thence to <hi>Colchester. Fairfax</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, crossed the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Gravesend</hi>; and overtaking them, besieged them in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi> The Town had no defence, but a Breast-work, and yet held out upon hope of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army to relieve them, the space of two months. Upon the news of the defeat of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they were forced to yield. The Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> was sent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56428:127"/>
to <hi>London.</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Lisle,</hi> two Loyal and Gallant Persons, were shot to death. There was also another little Insurrection headed by the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> about <hi>Kingston</hi>; but quickly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and he himself taken Prisoner.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>Meerly, as it is said, for want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Their Army was led by Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> who was then set at liberty, when <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle, where he was Prisoner, was taken by the Parliamentarians. He entred <hi>England</hi> with Horse and Foot 15000, to which came above 3000 <hi>English</hi> Royalists. Against these <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched out of <hi>Wales</hi> with Horse and Foot 11000, and near to <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> in less than two hours defeated them: and the Cause of it is said to be, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they could not all come to the Fight, nor relieve their Fellows. After the defeat, they had no way to fly, but farther into <hi>England</hi>; so that in the pursuit they were almost all taken, and lost all that an Army can lose; for the few that got home, did not all bring home their Swords. Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was taken, and not long after sent to <hi>London:</hi> But <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched on to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and there by the help of the Faction, which was contrary to <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56428:127"/>
he made sure not to be hindred in his designs; the first whereof was to take away the King's Life by the Hand of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                        <p>Whilst these things passed in the North, the Parliament (<hi>Cromwel</hi> being away) came to it self, and recalling their Vote of Non-Addresses, sent to the King new Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, somewhat, but not much easier than formerly; and upon the King's Answer to them, they sent Commissioners to treat with him, at <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they so long dodged with him about trifles, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was come to <hi>London,</hi> before they had done, to the King's destruction. For the Army was now wholly at the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who set the Adjutators on work again to make a Remonstrance to the House of Commons, wherein they require first; That the King be brought to Justice. 2. That the Prince and Duke of <hi>York</hi> be summoned to appear at a day appointed, and proceeded with, according as they should give satisfaction. 3. That the Parliament settle the Peace and future Government, and set a reasonable period to their own sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and make certain future Parliaments Annual, or Biennial. 4. That a competent number of the King's Chief Instruments be executed. And this to be done, both by the House of Commons, and by a general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56428:128"/>
of the People testified by their Subscriptions. Nor did they stay for an Answer, but presently set a Guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at the Parliament-house-door, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soldiers in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> suffering none to go into the House, but such as would serve their turns. All others were frighted away, or made Prisoners, and some upon divers quarrels suspended. Above 90 of them, because they had refused to vote against the <hi>Scots</hi>; and others, because they had voted against the Vote of Non-Addresses; and the rest were an House for <hi>Cromwel.</hi> The Fanaticks also in the City, being countenanced by the Army, pack a new Common Councel, whereof any forty was to be above the Major; and their first work was to frame a Petition for Justice against the King, which <hi>Tichborne</hi> the Major (involving the City in the Regicide) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, with the like violence, they took the King from <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to <hi>Hurst</hi> Castle, till things were ready for his Trial. The Parliament in the mean time, to avoid perjury, by an Ordinance declared void the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance, and presently after made another to bring the King to his Trial.</p>

                        <p>This Ordinance contained first, a Summary of the Charge against the King, in substance this; That not content with the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56428:129"/>
Encroachments of his Predecessors upon the freedom of the People, he had designed to set up a Tyrannical Government, and to that end had raised and maintained in the Land a Civil War against the Parliament, whereby the Country hath been miserably wasted, the publick Treasure exhausted, thousands of people murdered, and infinite other mischiefs committed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, A Constitution passed of a High Court of Justice, that is, of a certain number of Commissioners, of whom any 20 had Power to try the King, and to proceed to Sentence according to the merit of the Cause, and see it speedily executed. The Commissioners met on <hi>Saturday Jan.</hi> 20<hi>th</hi> in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and the King was brought before them; where sitting in a Chair, he heard the Charge read, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to plead to it either Guilty or Not Guilty, till he should know by what Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority he was brought thither. The President told him; That the Parliament affirmed their own Authority, and the King persevered in his refusal to plead; though many words passed between him and the President, yet this was the substance of it all.</p>
                        <p>On <hi>Monday January</hi> 22, the Court met again, and the Solicitor moved, that if the King persisted in denying the Authority of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56428:130"/>
the Court, the Charge might be taken <hi>pro confesso:</hi> but the King still denied their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>They met again <hi>January</hi> 23, and then the Solicitor moved the Court for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereupon the King was requir'd to give his final Answer, which was again a denial of their Authority.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, They met again <hi>January</hi> 27, where the King desir'd to be heard before the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, and promising after that to abide the Judgment of the Court. The Commissioners retir'd for half an hour to consider of it, and then returning, caused the King to be brought again to the Bar, and told him, that what he proposed was but another denial of the Courts Jurisdiction; and that if he had no more to say, they would proceed. Then the King answering, that he had no more to say; the President began a long Speech in Justification of the Parliaments Proceedings, producing the Examples of many Kings kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or deposed by wicked Parliaments An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and other parts of the World: All which he endeavoured to justifie from this only Principle; That the People have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power, and the Parliament is the People. This Speech ended, the Sentence of death was read; and the same upon <hi>Tuesday</hi>
                           <pb n="253" facs="tcp:56428:130"/>
after <hi>January</hi> 30 executed at the Gate of his own Palace of <hi>White-hall.</hi> He that can delight in reading how villainously he was used by the Soldiers between the Sentence and Execution, may go to the Chronicle it self; in which he shall see what Courage, Patience, Wisdom and Goodness was in this Prince, whom, in their Charge, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that wicked Parliament stiled Tyrant, Traitor and Murderer.</p>
                        <p>The King being dead, the same day they made an Act of Parliament, that whereas several pretences might be made to the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is Enacted by this present Parliament, and Authority of the same; That no person presume to declare, proclaim or publish, or any way promote <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> commonly called Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person to be King of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Seeing the King was dead, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor barred; by what declar'd Authority was the Peace maintain'd?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They had in their anger against the Lords formerly declar'd, the Supream Power of the Nation to be in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and now on <hi>February</hi> 5<hi>th</hi> they vote the House of Lords to be useless and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. And thus the Kingdom is turned into a Democracie, or rather an Oligarchie: for
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56428:131"/>
presently they made an Act; That none of those Members, who were secluded for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Vote of Non-Addresses, should ever be re-admitted. And these were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the secluded Members, and the rest were by some stiled a Parliament, and by others the Rump.</p>
                        <p>I think you need not now have a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, either of the Vices, or of the Crimes, or of the Follies of the greatest part of them that composed the Long Parliament, than which greater cannot be in the World. What greater Vices than Irreligion, Hypocrisie, Avarice and Cruelty; which have appear'd so eminently in the Actions of Presbyterian Members, and Presbyterian Ministers? What greater Crimes than Blaspheming and Killing God's Anointed? which was done by the hands of the Independents; but by the folly and first Treason of the Presbyterians, who betrayed and sold him to his Murderers. Nor was it a little folly in the Lords, not to see that by the taking away of the King's Power, they lost withal their own Priviledges; or to think themselves either for number or judgment any way a considerable assistance to the House of Commons. And for those men who had skill in the Laws, it was no great sign of understanding, not to perceive that the Laws of the Land were made by the King, to oblige his Subjects to Peace and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56428:131"/>
Justice, and not to oblige himself that made them. And lastly and generally, all men are fools which pull down any thing which does them good, before they have set up something better in its place. He that would set up Democracie with an Army, should have an Army to maintain it; but these men did it, when those men had the Army, that were resolv'd to pull it down. To these Follies I might add the folly of those fine men, which out of their reading of <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> or other Antimonarchiques, think themselves sufficient Politiques, and shew their discontents, when they are not called to the management of the State, and turn from one side to another upon every neglect they fancy from the King, or his Enemies.</p>

                        <p>YOU have seen the Rump in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session (as they believ'd) of the Supream Power over the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Army their Servant, though <hi>Cromwel</hi> thought otherwise, serving them diligently for the advancement of his own purposes.

                        <p>Tell me first, how this kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under the Rump or Relique of a House of Commons is to be called?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis doubtless an Oligarchy; for the Supream Authority must needs be in one man, or in more. If in one, it is Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, the Rump therefore was no Monarchy. If the Authority were in more than one; it was in all, or in fewer than all. When in all, it is Democracy; for every man may enter into the Assembly, which makes the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56428:133"/>
Sovereign Court; which they could not do here. It is therefore manifest, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was in a few, and consequently the State was an Oligarchy.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Is it not impossible for a People to be well govern'd, that are to obey more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters than one?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Both the Rump, and all other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Assemblies, if they have but one Voice, though they be many Men, yet are they but one Person: for contrary Commands cannot consist in one and the same Voice, which is the Voice of the greatest part, and therefore they might govern well enough, if they had Honesty and Wit enough.</p>
                        <p>The first Act of the Rump was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of those Members of the House of Commons, which had been formerly kept out by violence, for the procuring of an Ordinance for the King's Tryal: for these men had appear'd against the Ordinance of Non-Addresses, and therefore to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because they might else be an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their future Designs.</p>

                        <p>Was it not rather, because in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of few, they thought the fewer the better, both in respect of their shares, and also of a nearer approach in every one of them to the Dignity of a King?</p>

                        <p>They could not do that without order from the House. After this they constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Councel of 40 persons, which they termed a Councel of State, whose Office was to execute what the Rump should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                        <p>When there was neither King, nor House of Lords, they could not call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Parliament; for a Parliament is a Meeting of the King, Lords and Commons, to confer together about the businesses of the Common-wealth.

                        <p>Men may give to their Assembly what name they please, what signification soever such Name might formerly have had; and the Rump took the Name of Parliament as most suitable to their purpose; and such a Name as being venerable amongst the people for many hundred years, had countenanced and sweetned Subsidies and other Levies of Money, otherwise very unpleasant to the Subject. They took also afterwards another name, which was <hi>Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Libertatis Angliae,</hi> which Titles they used only in their Writs issuing out of the Courts of Justice.</p>

                        <p>Their next work was to set forth a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration; That they were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to maintain the fundamental Laws of the Nation, as to the Preservation of the Lives, Liberties and Proprieties of the People.</p>

                        <p>Nothing but to abuse the people: for the only fundamental Law in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is, To obey the Laws from time to time, which he shall make, to whom the People have given the Supream Power. How likely then are they to uphold the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, that had murder'd him, who was by themselves so often acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Lawful Sovereign? Besides, at the same time that this Declaration came forth, they were erecting that High Court of Justice, which took away the Lives of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Capel.</hi> Whatsoever they meant by a fundamental Law, the erecting of this Court was a breach of it, as being warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no former Law or Example in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                           <pb n="261" facs="tcp:56428:134"/>At the same time also they Levied Taxes by Soldiers, and to Soldiers permitted Free quarter, and did many other Actions, which if the King had done, they would have said had been done against the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Subject.</p>

                        <p>What sort of people, as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are not of the common sort? The craftiest Knaves of all the Rump were no wiser than the rest whom they cozened: for the most of them did believe, that the same things which they imposed upon the generality, were just and reasonable; and especially the great Haranguers, and such as pretended to Learning: for who can be a good Subject in a Monarchy, whose Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are taken from the Enemies of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, such as were <hi>Cicero, Seneca, Cato,</hi> and other Politicians of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> who seldom spake of Kings, but as of Wolves, and other ravenous Beasts? You may perhaps think a man has need of nothing else to know the Duty he owes to his Governour, and what Right he has to order him, but a good Natural Wit: but it is otherwise: for it is a Science, and built upon sure and clear Principles, and to be learned by deep and careful study, or from
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56428:135"/>
Masters that have deeply studied it; and who was there in the Parliament, or in the Nation, that could find out those evident Principles, and derive from them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Rules of Justice, and the necessary Connexion of Justice and Peace? The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have one day in seven the leisure to hear Instruction, and there are Ministers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to teach them their Duty: but how have those Ministers performed their Office? A great part of them, namely, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ministers throughout the whole War, instigated the People against the King; so did also Independents, and other Fanatick Ministers. The rest, contented with their Livings, preached in their Parishes Points of Controversie, to Religion impertinent; but to the breach of Charity, among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> selves very effectual, or else eloquent things, which the People either understood not, or thought themselves not concerned in. But this sort of Preachers, as they did little good, so they did little hurt. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief proceeded wholly from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Preachers, who by a long practiced Histrionique faculty preached up the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion powerfully.</p>

(as they thought) seeing Politicks are subservient to Religion, they might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and thereby satisfie, not only their covetous humour with Riches, but also their malice with power to undo all men that admir'd not their wisdom. Your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the People silly things, obliged me by this Digression to shew you, that it is not want of Wit, but want of the Science of Justice that brought them into these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Perswade, if you can, that man that has made his fortune, or made it greater, or an Eloquent Orator, or a Ravishing Poet, or a subtil Lawyer, or but a good Hunter, or a cunning Gamester, that he has not a good Wit; and yet there were of all these a great many so silly as to be deceiv'd by the Rump, and Members of the same Rump. They wanted not Wit, but the knowledge of the Causes and Grounds upon which one Person has a Right to govern, and the rest an Obligation to obey, which Grounds are necessary to be taught the People, who without them cannot live long in peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves.</p>

                        <p>In the rest of this year they voted a new Stamp for the Coyn of this Nation. They considered also of Agents to be sent to Forreign States; and having lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56428:136"/>
applause from the Army for their work done by the High Court of Justice, and encouragement to extend the same far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they perfected the said High Court of Justice, in which were tryed Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> whereof, as I mentioned before the three first were beheaded. This affrighted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the King's Party out of the Land: for not only they but all that had born Arms for the King were at that time in very great danger of their Lives. For it was put to the question by the Army at a Councel of War, whether they should be all Massacred or no, where the Noes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, but by two Voices. Lastly, <hi>March</hi> the 24<hi>th,</hi> they put the Major of <hi>London</hi> out of his Office, fined him 2000 <hi>l.</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchised him, and condemned him to two months Imprisonment in the Tower, for refusing to proclaim the Act for abolishing the Kingly Power. And thus ended the year 1648. and the Monthly Fast; God having granted that which they fasted for, the Death of the King, and the Possession of his Inheritance. By these their Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they had already lost the Hearts of the generality of the People, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trust to but the Army, which was not in their power, but in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s, who
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56428:136"/>
never failed, when there was occasion, to put them upon all Exploits that might make them odious to the people, in order to his future dissolving them, whensoever it should conduce to his ends.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of 1649. the <hi>Scots</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the Proceedings of the Rump against the late King, began to Levy Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in order to a new Invasion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, for want of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resistance from <hi>England,</hi> were grown terrible; and the <hi>English</hi> Army at home infected by the Adjutators, were casting how to share the Land amongst the Godly, meaning themselves; and such others as they pleased, who were therefore called Levellers. Also the Rump for the present were not very well provided of Money, and therefore the first thing they did was, the laying of a Tax upon the People of 90000 <hi>l.</hi> a month, for the maintenance of the Army.</p>

                        <p>Was it not one of their quarrels with the King; That he had Levied Money without the consent of the People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <p>You may see by this what reason the Rump had to call it self a Parliament; for the Taxes imposed by Parliament, were always understood to be by the Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and consequently Legal.</p>

                           <pb n="266" facs="tcp:56428:137"/>To appease the <hi>Scots,</hi> they sent Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with flattering Letters to keep them from engaging for the present King; but in vain; for they would hear nothing from a House of Commons (as they called it) at <hi>Westminster</hi> without a King and Lords. But they sent Commissioners to the King, to let him know what they were doing for him: for they were resolv'd to raise an Army of 17000 Foot and 6000 Horse, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>To relieve <hi>Ireland</hi> the Rump had resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to send eleven Regiments thither out of the Army in <hi>England.</hi> This hap'ned well for <hi>Cromwel:</hi> for the Levelling Soldiers, which were in every Regiment many, and in some the major part, finding that in stead of dividing the Land at home, they were to venture their Lives in <hi>Ireland,</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied to go; and one Regiment having cashier'd their Collonel about <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was marching to joyn with three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more of the same Resolution; but both the General and <hi>Cromwel</hi> falling upon them at <hi>Burford,</hi> utterly defeated them, and soon after reduced the whole Army to their obedience. And thus another of the Impediments to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Advancement was soon removed. This done they came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thence to <hi>London:</hi> and at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both the General and <hi>Cromwel</hi> were

made Doctors of the Civil Law; and at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> feasted and presented by the City.</p>

                        <p>They had made themselves already Masters both of the Laws and Parliament. The Army being now obedient, the Rump sent over those eleven Regiments into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> under the Command of Dr. <hi>Cromwel,</hi> intituled Governour of that Kingdom, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> being still General of all the Forces, both here and there.</p>
                        <p>The Marquess (now Duke) of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was the King's Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Rebels had made a Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, and these Confederates had made a kind of League with the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein they agreed upon liberty given them in the exercise of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be faithful to, and assist the King. To these also were joyned some Forces rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earls of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> and <hi>Clanri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi>; so that they were the greatest united strength in the Island: but there were amongst them a great many other Papists, that would by no means subject themselves to Protestants, and these were called the Nuntio's Party, as the other were called the Confederate Party. These Parties not agreeing, and the Confederate Party having broken their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56428:138"/>
the Lord-Lieutenant seeing them ready to besiege him in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend it, did, to preserve the Place for the Protestants, surrender it to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> and came over to the King at that time, when he was carried from place to place by the Army. From <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he went over to the Prince, now King, residing then at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Confederates affrighted with the News that the Rump was sending over an Army thither, desir'd the Prince by Letters to send back my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to submit absolutely to the King's Authority, and to obey my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> as his Lieutenant. And hereupon he was sent back, this was about a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the going over of <hi>Cromwel.</hi>

Within a few days after arrived <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who with extraordinary diligence, and horrid execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in less than a twelvemonth that he stayed there, subdued in a manner the whole Nation, having killed, or extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated a great part of them, and leaving his

Son-in-law <hi>Ireton</hi> to subdue the rest. But <hi>Ireton</hi> dyed there (before the business was quite done) of the Plague. This was one step more towards <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s exaltation to the Throne.</p>

Not long after also their Agent at <hi>Madrid,</hi> one <hi>Ascham,</hi> one that had written in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, was killed in the same manner.

                        <p>In this year the Rump did not much at home; save that in the beginning they made <hi>England</hi> a Free State by an Act which runs thus. Be it enacted and declar'd by this present Parliament, and by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof; That the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and all the Dominions and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereunto belonging, are, and shall be, and are hereby constituted, made and declared a Common-wealth and Free State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>What did they mean by a Free State and Common-wealth? Were the People no longer to be subject to Laws? They could not mean that: for the Parliament meant to govern them by their own Laws, and punish such as broke them. Did they mean that <hi>England</hi> should not be subject to any Forreign Kingdom or Common-wealth? That needed not be enacted, seeing there was no King nor People pretended to be their Masters. What did they mean then?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They meant that neither this King, nor any King, nor any single person, but only that they themselves would be the Peoples Masters, and would have set it
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56428:139"/>
down in those plain words, if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could have been cozned with words intelligible, as easily as with words not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                        <p>After this they gave one another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Estates out of the Lands and Goods of the Loyal Party. They enacted also an Engagement to be taken by every man, in these words: <hi>You shall promise to be true and faithful to the Common-wealth of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now established, without King, or House of Lords.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They banished also from within 20 Miles of <hi>London</hi> all the Royal Party, forbidding also every one of them to depart more than five Miles from his Dwelling house.</p>

                        <p>They meant perhaps to have them ready, if need were, for a Massacre. But what did the <hi>Scots</hi> in this time?</p>

                        <p>They were considering of the Officers of the Army, which they were Levying for the King, how they might exclude from Command all such as had loyally serv'd his Father, and all Independents, and all such as commanded in Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Army; and these were the main things that passed this year.</p>
                        <p>The Marquess of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> that in the year 1645. had, with a few men, and in little time, done things almost incredible against the late King's Enemies in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:56428:140"/>
landed now again in the beginning of the year 1650. in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Commission from the present King, hoping to do him as good Service, as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done his Father: but the Case was altered; for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces were then in <hi>England</hi> in the Service of the Parliament; whereas now they were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many more (for their intended Invasion) newly raised. Besides the Soldiers which the Marquess brought over were few, and Forreigners, nor did the Highlanders come in to him as he expected; in so much as he was soon defeated, and shortly after taken, and (with more spightful usage than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge requir'd) executed by the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Edenburgh May</hi> 2.</p>

                        <p>What good could the King expect from joyning with these men, who during the Treaty, discovered so much malice to him in one of his best Servants?</p>

                        <p>No doubt (their Church-men being then prevalent) they would have done as much to this King, as the <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had done to his Father, if they could have gotten by it that which they foolishly aspir'd to, the Government of the Nation. I do not believe that the Independents were worse than the Presbyterians: both the one and the other were resolv'd to destroy whatsoever should stand in the way to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56428:140"/>
their Ambition: but necessity made the King pass over both this, and many other Indignities from them, rather than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the pursuit of his Right in <hi>England</hi> to cool, and be little better than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>

                        <p>Indeed I believe a Kingdom, if suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to become an old Debt, will hardly ever be recover'd. Besides the King was sure, wheresoever the Victory lighted, he could lose nothing in the War, but Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

Now had General <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who was truly what he pretended to be, a Presbyterian) been so catechis'd by the Presbyterian Ministers here, that he refus'd to fight against the Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi>; nor did the Rump, nor <hi>Cromwel</hi> go about to rectifie his Conscience in that Point; and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56428:141"/>
thus <hi>Fairfax</hi> laying down his Commission, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was now made General of all the Forces in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; which was another Step to the Sovereign Power.</p>

But they sent Messengers after him to pray him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but they furnished these Messengers with strength enough to bring him back, if he should have refused.

                        <p>The King having yielded to all that the Church requir'd, the <hi>Scots</hi> proceeded in their intended War. <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched on to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> provoking them all he could to Battle, which they declining, and Provisions growing scarce in the <hi>English</hi> Army, <hi>Cromwel</hi> retir'd to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing of success; and intending by Sea
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56428:142"/>
or Land to get back into <hi>England.</hi> And such was the Condition, which this General <hi>Cromwel</hi> so much magnified for Conduct, had brought his Army to; that all his Glories had ended in Shame and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if Fortune, and the faults of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had not relieved him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as he retir'd the <hi>Scots</hi> followed him close all the way, till within a Mile of <hi>Dunbar.</hi> There is a ridge of Hills, that from beyond <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> goes winding to the Sea, and crosses the High-way between <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> at a Village called <hi>Copperspeith,</hi> where the passage is so difficult, that had the <hi>Scots</hi> sent timely thither a very few men to guard it, the <hi>English</hi> could never have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten home. For the <hi>Scots</hi> kept the Hills, and needed not have fought, but upon great advantage, and were almost two to one. <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Army was at the foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of those Hills, on the North side; and there was a great Ditch or Channel of a Torrent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Hills and it; so that he could never have got home by Land, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utter ruine of the Army attempted to Ship it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor have stayed where he was for want of Provisions. Now <hi>Cromwel</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pass was free, and commanding a good Party of Horse and foot to possess it; it was necessary for the <hi>Scots</hi> to let them go, whom they bragged they had impound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56428:142"/>
or else to fight; and therefore with the best of their Horse charged the <hi>English,</hi> and made them at first to shrink a little: but the <hi>English</hi> Foot coming on, the <hi>Scots</hi> were put to flight; and the flight of the Horse hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Foot from engaging, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fled, as did also the rest of their Horse. Thus the folly of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Commanders brought all their odds to an even Lay, between two small and equal Parties; wherein Fortune gave the Victory to the <hi>English,</hi> who were not many more in number than those that were killed and taken Prisoners of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Church lost their Canon, Bag and Baggage, with 10000 Arms, and almost their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The rest were got together by <hi>Lesly</hi> to <hi>Sterling.</hi>

and made certain Acts, in order to a better uniting of themselves, and better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the King, who was now at <hi>Sterling,</hi> with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Forces he had, expecting more now in Levying. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> went divers times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sterling</hi> to provoke the <hi>Scots</hi> to fight. There was no Ford there to pass over his Men; at last Boats being come from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>New-Castle,</hi> Collonel <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> (though it were long first, for it was now <hi>July</hi>) transported 1400 Foot of his own, besides another Regiment of Foot, and four Troops of Horse, and intrencht himself at <hi>North-ferry</hi> on the other side, and before any help could come from <hi>Sterling,</hi> Major-General <hi>Lambert</hi> also was got over with as many more.

                        <p>What hopes had the King in coming into <hi>England,</hi> having before and behind him none, at least none Armed, but his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies?</p>

                        <p>Yes; there was before him the City of <hi>London,</hi> which generally hated the Rump, and might easily be reckoned for 20000 well Armed Soldiers; and most men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd they would take his part, had he come near the City.</p>

                        <p>What probability was there of that? Do you think the Rump was not sure of the Service of the Major, and those that had command of the City Militia? And if they had been really the King's Friends, what need had they to stay for his coming up to <hi>London?</hi> They might have seized the Rump, if they had pleas'd, which had no possibility of defending themselves; at least they might have turned them out of the House.</p>

                        <p>This they did not; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary permitted the recruiting of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army, and the raising of Men to keep the Country from coming in to the King.

                        <p>Night coming on, before the City was quite taken, he left it, it being dark, and none of the Enemies Horse within the Town to follow him, the plundering Foot having kept the Gates shut, lest the Horse should enter and have a share of the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The King before morning got into <hi>Warwick-shire</hi> 25 Miles from <hi>Worcester,</hi> and there lay disguis'd a while, and afterwards went up and down in great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discover'd, till at last he got over into <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Brighthemsted</hi> in <hi>Sussex.</hi>

                        <p>Lieutenant-General <hi>Monk,</hi> whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> left there with 7000, took <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling August</hi> 14<hi>th,</hi> by Surrender, and <hi>Dundee</hi> the third of <hi>September,</hi> by Storm, because it resisted; this the Soldiers plundered, and had good Booty, because the <hi>Scots</hi> for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had sent thither their most precious Goods from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>St. Johnstons.</hi>
                           <pb n="283" facs="tcp:56428:145"/>
He took likewise by Surrender <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and (the place where the <hi>Scottish</hi> Ministers first learned to play the fools) <hi>St. Andrews.</hi> Also in the Highlands Collonel <hi>Alured</hi> took a knot of Lords and Gentlemen, <hi>viz.</hi> four Earls, and four Lords, and above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Knights and Gentlemen, whom he sent Prisoners into <hi>England.</hi> So that there was nothing more to be fear'd from <hi>Scotland</hi>; all the trouble of the Rump, being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve what they should do with it. At last they resolv'd to unite and incorporate it into one Common-wealth with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And to that end sent thither <hi>St. Johns, Vane,</hi> and other Commissioners to offer them this Union by publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and to warn them to choose their Deputies of Shires, and Burgesses of Towns, and send them to <hi>Westminster.</hi>

                        <p>I think so: and yet it was by many of the <hi>Scots,</hi> especially by the Ministers, and other Presbyterians, refus'd. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters had given way to the Levying of Money for the payment of the <hi>English</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but to comply with the Declaration of the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners they absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbad.</p>

                        <p>Methinks this contributing to the pay of their Conquerors was some mark of servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; whereas entring into the Union made

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The Cause why they refus'd the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rendred by the Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was this; That it drew with it a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of the Church to the Civil State in the things of Christ.</p>

                        <p>This is a downright Declaration to all Kings and Common-wealths in general, that a Presbyterian Minister will be a true Subject to none of them in the things of Christ, which things what they are, they will be Judges themselves. What have we then gotten by our deliverance from the Pope's Tyranny, if these petty men suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the place of it, that have nothing in them that can be beneficial to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, except their silence? For their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it amounts to no more than an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of Greek and Latin, and an acquir'd readiness in the Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with a Gesture and Tone suitable thereunto; but of Justice and Charity (the Manners of Religion) they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge, nor practice, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Stories I have already told you: Nor do they distinguish between the Godly and the Ungodly, but by conformity of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in Men of Judgment, or by repetition of their Sermons in the common sort of People.</p>

                        <p>They sent <hi>St. Johns</hi> and <hi>Strickland</hi> Ambassadors to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to offer League to the United Provinces, who had Audience <hi>March</hi> the third. <hi>St. Johns</hi> in a Speech shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those States what advantage they might have by this League in their Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations, by the use of the <hi>English</hi> Ports and Harbors. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> though they shewed no great forwardness in the business, yet appointed Commissioners to treat with them about it. But the People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally against it, calling the Ambassadors and their Followers (as they were) Traitors and Murderers, and made such Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their House, that their Followers durst not go abroad, till the States had quieted them. The Rump advertis'd hereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently recall'd them. The Compliment which <hi>St. Johns</hi> gave to the Commissioners at their taking leave is worth your hearing. <hi>You have,</hi> said he, <hi>an Eye upon the event of the Affairs of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and therefore do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the friendship we have offered. Now I

can assure you, many in the Parliament were of opinion, that we should not have sent any Ambassadors to you, till we had superated those matters between them and that King, and then expected your Ambassadors to us. I now perceive our error, and that those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were in the Right. In a short time you shall see that business ended; and then you will come and seek what we have freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when it shall perplex you that you have refused our proffer.</hi>

                           <hi>St. Johns</hi> was not sure that the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> business would end as it did.

                        <p>The Rump shewed now as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Agreement as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did then; standing upon Terms never likely to be granted. First; for the fishing on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Coast, that they should not have it without paying for it. Secondly, that the <hi>English</hi> should have free Trade from <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh</hi> to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as they had before their Rebellion against the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Thirdly, they demanded amends for the old (but never to be forgotten) business of <hi>Amboyna:</hi> So that the War was already certain, though the Season kept them from Action till the Spring following. The true Quarrel on the <hi>English</hi> part was, that their profer'd friendship was scorn'd, and their Ambassadors affronted: On the <hi>Dutch</hi> part was, their greediness to engross all Traffique, and a false estimate of our and their own strength.</p>
                        <p>Whilst these things were doing, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the War, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> were not neglected, though those Nations were not fully pacified till two years after, The persecution also of Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists still continued, amongst whom was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed one Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> for holding corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the King.</p>

                        <p>I had thought a Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, whilst he was such, could not be a

Royalist, because they think their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have the Supream Power in the things of Christ; and by consequence they are in <hi>England</hi> (by a Statute) Traitors.</p>

                        <p>You may think so still: for though I call'd Mr. <hi>Love</hi> a Royalist, I meant it only for that one Act, for which he was condemn'd. It was he, who during the Treaty at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> preaching before the Commissioners there, said, it was as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Heaven and Hell, as for the King and Parliament to agree. Both he and the rest of the Presbyterians are and were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the King's Enemies, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Fanaticks, for their own, not for the King's sake. Their Loyalty was like that of Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi>'s, that kept the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and afterwards would have betrayed the same to the Marquess of <hi>New-Castle.</hi> These Presbyterians therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rightly called Loyal, but rather dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perfidious, unless you think, that as two Negatives make an Affirmative, so two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons make Loyalty.</p>
                        <p>This year also were reduced to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Rump the Islands of <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and St. <hi>Christophers.</hi> One thing fell out that they liked not, which was, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> gave them warning to determine their sitting, according to the Bill for Triennial Parliaments.</p>

Three <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, with divers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants from the <hi>Straights</hi> being discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one Captain <hi>Young,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some <hi>English</hi> Frigats, the said <hi>Young</hi> sent to their Admiral to bid him strike his Flag, (a thing usually done in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>English</hi> Dominion in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas) which accordingly he did. Then came up the Vice-Admiral, and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to as the other was, to take down his Flag; he answered plainly, he would not: but after the exchange of four or five Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and mischief done, on either part, he took it down: but Captain <hi>Young</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded also, either the Vice-Admiral him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or his Ship, to make good the damage already sustained; to which the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral answer'd, that he had taken in his Flag, but would defend himself and his Ship. Whereupon Captain <hi>Young</hi> consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Captains of his other Ships, lest the beginning of the War, in this time of Treaty, should be charged upon himself, and night also coming on, thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther.</p>

                        <p>The Dominion of the Seas belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>English,</hi> there can be no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the <hi>Dutch</hi> began it: and that the said Dominion belonged to the <hi>English,</hi> it was confessed at first by the Admiral him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self peaceably, and at last by the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, taking in their Flags.</p>
                        <p>About a fortnight after, there happened another Fight upon the like occasion. <hi>Van Tromp</hi> with 42 Men of Mar came to the back of <hi>Goodwin-Sands,</hi> (Major <hi>Bourne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then with a few of the Parliaments Ships in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> with the rest far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Westward) and sent two Captains of his to <hi>Bourne,</hi> to excuse his coming thither. To whom <hi>Bourne</hi> return'd this Answer, That the Message was civil, but that it might appear real he ought to depart. So <hi>Tromp</hi> departed, meaning (now <hi>Bourne</hi> was satisfied) to sail towards <hi>Blake,</hi> and he did so; but so did also <hi>Bourne,</hi> for fear of the worst. When <hi>Tromp</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> were near one another, <hi>Blake</hi> made a Shot over <hi>Tromp</hi>'s Ship, as a warning to him to take in his Flag. This he did thrice, and then <hi>Tromp</hi> gave him a Broad-side, and so began the Fight, (at the beginning whereof <hi>Bourne</hi> came in) and lasted from two a Clock till night, the <hi>English</hi> having the better, and the Flag, as before making the Quarrel.</p>

                        <p>What needs there, when both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were heartily resolv'd to fight, to stand so much upon this Compliment of who should begin? For as to the gaining of Friends and Confederates thereby, I think it was in vain; seeing Princes and States in such occasions look not much upon the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of their Neighbours, but upon their own Concernment in the Event.</p>

                        <p>It is commonly so; but in this Case the <hi>Dutch</hi> knowing the Dominion of the narrow Seas to be a gallant Title, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed by all the Nations that reach the Shore, and consequently that they were likely to oppose it, did wisely enough in making this Point the state of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. After this Fight, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors residing in <hi>England,</hi> sent a Paper to the Councel of State, wherein they sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this last Encounter a rash Action, and affirmed it was done without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and against the Will of their Lords the States-General, and desir'd them that nothing might be done upon it in heat, which might become irreparable. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hereupon voted; first, That the States-General should pay the Charges they were at, and for the damages they sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this occasion. 2. That this being paid, there should be a Cessation of all Acts of Hostility, and a mutual Restitution of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56428:150"/>
all Ships and Goods taken. 3. And both these agreed to, that there should be made a League between the two Common-wealths. These Votes were sent to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassadors in answer of the said Paper; but with a Preamble setting forth the former kindnesses of <hi>England</hi> to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, and taking notice of their new Fleet of 150 Men of War, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparent Design than the destruction of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet.</p>

                        <p>None. <hi>Tromp</hi> sailed presently into <hi>Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> with 70 Men of War to the <hi>Orkney</hi> Islands, to seize their Busses, and to wait for five <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships from the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> And Sir <hi>George Ascue</hi> newly returned from the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> came into the <hi>Downs</hi> with 15 Men of War, where he was commanded to stay for a Recruit out of the <hi>Thames.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tromp</hi> being recruited now to 120 Sail, made account to get in between Sir <hi>George Ascue</hi> and the mouth of the River, but was hindered so long by contrary Winds, that the Merchants calling for his Convoy, he could stay no longer, and so he went back into <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence to <hi>Orkney,</hi> where he met with the said five <hi>East-India</hi> Ships, and sent them home. And then he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56428:150"/>
to engage with <hi>Blake,</hi> but a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Storm forced him to Sea, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated his Fleet, that only 42 came home in Body, the rest singly, as well as they could. <hi>Blake</hi> also came home, but went first to the Coast of <hi>Holland</hi> with 900 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and six Men of War taken, which were part of twelve which he found and took guarding their Busses. This was the first bout after the War declar'd.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>August</hi> following there happened a Fight between <hi>de Ruitter</hi> the Admiral of <hi>Zealand,</hi> with 50 Men of War, and Sir <hi>George Ascue,</hi> near <hi>Plimouth,</hi> with 40, wherein Sir <hi>George</hi> had the better, and might have got an intire Victory, had the whole Fleet engaged. Whatsoever was the matter, the Rump (though they reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) never more employed him after his return, in their Service at Sea: but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the year to come, three Generals, <hi>Blake</hi> that was one already, and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Monk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About this time the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> besieging <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> sending a Fleet to relieve it, General <hi>Blake</hi> light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Calais,</hi> and taking seven of their Ships, was cause of the Towns Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>September</hi> they fought again, <hi>De Wit</hi> and <hi>Ruitter</hi> commanding the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56428:151"/>
                           <hi>Blake</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were again worsted.</p>
                        <p>Again in the end of <hi>November Van Tromp</hi> with 80 Men of War, shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the back of <hi>Goodwin-Sands</hi>; where <hi>Blake,</hi> though he had with him but 40, adventured to fight with him, and had much the worst, and (night parting the Fray) retir'd into the River of <hi>Thames</hi>; whilst <hi>Van Tromp</hi> keeping the Sea, took some inconsiderable Vessels from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and thereupon (as it was said) with a Childish vanity, hung out a Broom from the Main-top mast, signifying he meant to sweep the Seas of all <hi>English</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
                        <p>After this, in <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> with <hi>Van Tromp</hi> were encountered by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> under <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> near <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and had the worst. And these were all the Encounters between them in this year, in the narrow Seas. They fought also once at <hi>Legorne,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the better.</p>

had) to signifie the Declaration of the War, and to get them to their Party, recalled their Ambassadors from <hi>England</hi>; and the Rump, without delay, gave them their parting Audience; without abating a Syllable of their former severe Propositions. And presently to maintain the War for the next year, laid a Tax upon the People of 120000 <hi>l. per Mensem.</hi>

                           <hi>Cromwel</hi> was now quarreling (the last and greatest obstacle to his Design) the Rump.

To which the Rump un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to yield, and not daring to refuse, determined for the end of their sitting the fifth of <hi>November</hi> 1654. But <hi>Cromwel</hi> meant not to stay so long. In the mean time the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> was taking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, and granting Transportations of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and condemning whom they pleas'd in a High Court of Justice erected there for that purpose.

                           <hi>Cromwel</hi> wanted now but one step to the end of his Ambition, and that was to set his Foot upon the Neck of this Long Parliament, which he did <hi>April</hi> the 23<hi>d</hi> of this present year 1653. a time very seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For though the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not mastered, yet they were much weakned; and what with Prizes from the Enemy, and squeezing the Royal Party, the Treasury was pretty full, and the Tax of 120000 <hi>l.</hi> a month began to come in; all which was his own in right of the Army.</p>
                        <p>Therefore without more ado, attended by the Major-Generals <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and some other Officers, and as many Soldiers, as he thought fit, he went to the Parliament-house, and dissolv'd them, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out and locked up the doors. And for this Action he was more applauded by the People, than for any of his Victories in the War, and the Parliament-men as much scorned and derided.</p>

                        <p>No: but presently after he invented a Title, which was this; That he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated for the defence of the Cause, for which at first the Parliament had taken up Arms (that is to say rebelled) to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to extraordinary Actions. You know the pretence of the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Rebellion was <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> The safety of the Nation against a dangerous Conspiracy of Papists, and a Malignant Party at home, and that every man is bound, as far as his Power extends, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the safety of the whole Nation, (which none but the Army were able to do; and the Parliament had hitherto neglected) was it not then the General's Duty to do it? Had he not therefore Right? For that Law of <hi>Salus Populi</hi> is directed only to those that have Power enough to defend the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that is, to them that have the Supream Power.</p>

                        <p>Yes certainly, he had as good a Title as the Long Parliament, But the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did represent the People; and it seems to me, that the Sovereign Power is essentially annexed to the Representative of the People.</p>

Nor was ever the Lower House of Parliament the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the whole Nation, but of the Commons only; nor had that House the power to oblige, by their Acts, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, any Lord, or any Priest.</p>

                        <p>This is a Title that very few men understand. His way was to get the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power confer'd upon him by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore he call'd a Parliament, and gave it the Supream Power, to the end that they should give it to him again. Was not this witty? First therefore he published a Declaration of the Causes why he dissolv'd the Parliament. The sum whereof was, that in stead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promote the good of God's People, they endeavour'd (by a Bill then ready to pass) to recruit the House, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their own Power. Next he consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Councel of State of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be the Supream Authority of <hi>England</hi>; but no longer than till the next Parliament should be called, and met. Thirdly, he summoned 142 Persons, such
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56428:153"/>
as he himself, or his Trusty Officers made choice of: the greatest part of whom were instructed what to do, obscure Persons, and most of them Fanaticks, though stiled by <hi>Cromwel</hi> men of approved fidelity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. To these the Councel of State sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the Supream Authority, and not long after these men surrendred it to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel. July</hi> the fourth this Parliament met, and chose for the Speaker one Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> and called themselves from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> but <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for the more surety, constituted also a Councel of State, not of such petty fellows as most of these were, but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his principal Officers. These did all the business, both publick and private, making Ordinances, and giving Audience to Forreign Ambassadors. But he had now more Enemies than before, <hi>Harrison,</hi> who was the Head of the Fifth-monarchy-men, laying down his Commission, did nothing but animate his Party against him; for which afterwards he was imprison'd. This little Parliament in the mean time were making of Acts so ridiculous, and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the People, that it was thought he chose them on purpose to bring all Ruling Parliaments into contempt, and Monarchy again into credit.</p>

                        <p>One of them was; That all Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should be made by a Justice of Peace, and the Banes asked three several days in the next Market: None were forbidden to be married by a Minister, but without a Justice of Peace the Marriage was to be void: So that divers wary Couples (to be sure of one another, howsoever they might repent it afterwards) were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both ways. Also they abrogated the Engagement, whereby no man was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sue in any Court of Law, that had not taken it, that is, that had not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the late Rump.</p>

                        <p>They were also in hand with an Act to cancel all the present Laws and Law-Books, and to make a new Code more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the humor of the Fifth-monarchy-men; of whom there were many in this Parliament.

                        <p>All they did was absurd, though they knew not that, no nor this, whose Design was upon the Sovereignty, the Contriver of this Act, it seems, perceived not, but <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Party in the House saw it well enough. And therefore, as soon as it was laid, there stood up one of the Members, and made a Motion, that since the Common-wealth was like to receive little benefit by their fitting, they should dissolve themselves. <hi>Harrison,</hi> and they of his Sect, were troubled hereat, and made Speeches against it: but <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Party, of whom the Speaker was one, left the House, and with the Mace before them went to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and surrendred
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56428:155"/>
their Power to <hi>Cromwel</hi> that had given it them. And so he got the Sovereignty by an Act of Parliament, and within four days after, <hi>viz. December</hi> the 16<hi>th,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled Protector of the three Nations, and took his Oath to observe certain Rules of governing, ingrossed in Parchment, and read before him: The Writing was called the Instrument.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>One was to call a Parliament every third year, of which the first was to begin <hi>September</hi> the third following.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>I believe he was a little superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the choice of <hi>September</hi> the third, because it was lucky to him in 1650. and 1651. at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi>; but he knew not how lucky the same would be to the whole Nation in 1658. at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Another was; That no Parliament should be dissolved, till it had sitten five Months; and those Bills that they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, should be passed by him within twenty days, or else they should pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>
                        <p>A Third; That he should have a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State of not above 21, nor under 13; and that upon the Protectors death this Councel should meet, and before they parted choose a new Protector. There
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56428:155"/>
were many more besides, but not necessary to be inserted.</p>

                        <p>The Generals for the <hi>English</hi> were <hi>Blake,</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Monk,</hi> and <hi>Van Tromp</hi> for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> between whom was a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought the second of <hi>June,</hi> (which was a month before the beginning of this little Parliament) wherein the <hi>English</hi> had the Victory, and drove the Enemies into their Harbors, but with the loss of General <hi>Dean,</hi> slain by a Canon-shot. This Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was great enough to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> send over Ambassadors into <hi>England</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Treaty; but in the mean time they prepared and put to Sea another Fleet, which likewise in the end of <hi>July</hi> was defeated by General <hi>Monk,</hi> who got now a greater Victory than before: and this made the <hi>Dutch</hi> descend so far as to buy their Peace with the payment of the charge of the War, and with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment amongst other Articles, that the <hi>English</hi> had the Right of the Flag. This Peace was concluded in <hi>March,</hi> being the end of this year: but not proclaimed till <hi>April</hi>; the Money (it seems) being not paid till then.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> War being now ended, the Protector sent his youngest Son <hi>Henry</hi>
                           <pb n="304" facs="tcp:56428:156"/>
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom also some time after he made Lieutenant there; and sent <hi>Monk</hi> Lieutenant-General into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to keep those Nations in obedience. Nothing else worth remembring was done this year at home; saving the discovery of a Plot of Royalists (as was said) upon the Life of the Protector, who all this while had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the King's Designs from a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his Court, who afterwards was taken in the manner and killed.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>He was the Son of a Collonel that was slain in the Wars on the late King's side. Besides, he pretended Employment from the King's Loyal and Loving Subjects here, to convey to his Majesty Money, as they from time to time should send him; and to make this credible, <hi>Cromwel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self caused Money to be sent to him.</p>
                        <p>The following year 1654. had nothing of War, but was spent in Civil Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in appointing of Judges, preventing of Plots, (for Usurpers are jealous) and in Executing the King's Friends, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Lands. The third of <hi>September,</hi> according to the Instrument, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met, in which there was no House of Lords; and the House of Commons was made as formerly, of Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56428:156"/>
but not as formerly of two Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses for a Burrough, and two Knights for a County: for Burroughs for the most part had but one Burgess, and some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties six or seven Knights: Besides, there were twenty Members for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as many for <hi>Ireland.</hi> So that now <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> had nothing else to do, but to shew his Art of Government upon six Coach-Horses newly presented him, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Rebellious as himself, threw him out of the Coach-box, and almost killed him.</p>

                        <p>This Parliament which had seen how <hi>Cromwel</hi> had handled the two former, the Long one and the Short one, had surely learnt the wit to behave themselves better to him, than those had done.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, especially now that <hi>Cromwel</hi> in his Speech at their first Meeting had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbidden them to meddle, either with the Government by a single Person and Parliament, or with the Militia, or with perpetuating of Parliaments, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Liberty of Conscience: and told them also, that every Member of the House, before they sate, must take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of his Power in divers Points. Whereupon of above 400 there appeared not above 200 at first; though afterwards some relenting, there sate about 300. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56428:157"/>
just at their sitting down he publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some Ordinances of his own, bearing date before their meeting; that they might see he took his own Acts to be as valid as theirs. But all this could not make them know themselves. They proceeded to the Debate of every Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition.</p>

                        <p>They should have debated that before they had taken it.</p>

                        <p>But then they had never been suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cromwel</hi> being informed of their stubborn proceedings, and out of hope of any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from them, dissolved them.</p>
                        <p>All that passed besides in this year was the exercise of the High Court of Justice upon some Royalists for Plots.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1655. the <hi>English,</hi> to the number of near 10000, landed in <hi>Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> in hope of the plunder of the Gold and Silver, whereof they thought there was great abundance in the Town of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Domingo</hi>; but were well beaten by a few <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and with the loss of near 1000 men, went off to <hi>Jamaica</hi> and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.</p>
                        <p>This year also the Royal Party made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt in the West; and proclaimed there King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: but few joyning with them, and some falling off,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56428:157"/>
they were soon suppressed, and many of the principal Persons executed.</p>

                        <p>In these many Insurrections the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists, though they meant well, yet they did but disservice to the King by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. What hope had they to prevail against so great an Army as the Protector had ready? What cause was there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of seeing the King's business done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Dissention and Ambition of the great Commanders in that Army; whereof many had the favour to be as well esteemed amongst them as <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>That was somewhat uncertain. The Protector being frustrated of his hope of Money at <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> resolved to take from the Royalists the tenth part yearly of their Estates. And to this end chiefly he divided <hi>England</hi> into eleven Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralships, with Commission to every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General to make a Roll of the Names of all suspected Persons of the King's Party, and to receive the tenth part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states within his Precinct; as also to take Caution from them not to act against the State; and to reveal all Plots that should come to their knowledge, and to make them engage the like for their Servants. They had Commission also to forbid Horse-races and Concourse of People, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and account for this Decimation.</p>

                        <p>The year 1656. was a Parliament year by the Instrument, between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this year, and the day of the Parliaments sitting, which was <hi>September</hi> the 17<hi>th,</hi> these Major-Generals resided in several Provinces, behaving themselves most tyrannically. Amongst other of their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies was the awing of Elections, and making themselves, and whom they pleas'd, to be return'd Members for the Parliament, which was also thought a part of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Design in their Constitution: for he had need of a giving Parliament, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately upon a Peace made with the <hi>French,</hi> drawn upon himself a War with <hi>Spain.</hi>

                        <p>This year it was that Captain <hi>Stainer</hi> set upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plate-Fleet, being eight in number, near <hi>Cadiz,</hi> whereof he funk two and took two, there being in one of them two Millions of Pieces of Eight, which amounts to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                        <p>This year also it was that <hi>James Naylor</hi> appeared at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and would be taken
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56428:158"/>
for Jesus Christ. He wore his Beard fork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Hair composed to the likeness of that in the <hi>Volto Santo</hi>; and being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, would sometimes answer, <hi>Thou sayest it.</hi> He had also his Disciples that would go by his Horse side, to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg in dirt. Being sent for by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was sentenced to stand on the Pillory, to have his Tongue bored through, and to be marked in the Forehead with the Letter <hi>B.</hi> for Blasphemy, and to remain in <hi>Bridewel. Lambert,</hi> a great Favorite of the Army, endeavour'd to save him, partly, because he had been his Soldier, and partly to curry favour with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of the Army; for he was now no more in the Protector's favour, but meditating how he might succeed him in his Power.</p>

                        <p>Yes, yes: know there is nothing that renders Humane Counsels difficult, but the incertainty of future time, nor that so well directs men in their Deliberations, as the fore-sight of the Sequels of their Actions; Prophecie being many times the principal Cause of the Event foretold. If upon some prediction the People should have been made confident, that <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Army should be upon a day to come utterly defeated; would not every one have endeavoured to assist, and to deserve well of the Party that should give him that Defeat? Upon this account it was, that Fortune tellers and Astrologers were so often banished out of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <p>The last memorable thing of this year was a Motion made by a Member of the House, an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> that the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56428:159"/>
Protector might be petition'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd by the House, to leave the Title of Protector, and take upon him that of King.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>That was indeed a bold Motion, and which would, if prosperous, have put an end to many mens ambition, and to the licentiousness of the whole Army. I think the Motion was made on purpose to ruine both the Protector himself, and his Ambitious Officers.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>It may be so. In the year 1657. the first thing the Parliament did was the drawing up of this Petition to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, to take upon him the Government of the three Nations, with the Title of King. As of other Parliaments, so of this, the greatest part had been either kept out of the House by force; or else themselves had forborn to sit, and became guilty of setting up this King <hi>Oliver.</hi> But those few that sate presented their Petition to the Protector <hi>April</hi> the ninth in the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-house at <hi>White-hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Widdrington</hi> the Speaker used the first Arguments, and the Protector desir'd some time to seek God, the business being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The next day they sent a Committee to him to receive his Answer, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer being not very clear, they pressed him again for a Resolution; to which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56428:160"/>
he made answer in a long Speech, that ended in a peremptory refusal: and so retaining still the Title of Protector, he took upon him the Government accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to certain Articles contained in the said Petition.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What made him refuse the Title of King?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Because he durst not take it at that time; the Army being addicted to their great Officers, and amongst their great Officers many hoping to succeed him; and the Succession having been promised to Major-General <hi>Lambert,</hi> would have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinied against him. He was therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to stay for a more propitious Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What were those Articles?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The most Important of them were; First, That he would exercise the Office of Chief Magistrate of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Title of Protector, and govern the same according to the said Petition and Advice: and that he would in his life-time name his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</p>

                        <p>I believe the <hi>Scots,</hi> when they first rebell'd, never thought of being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed absolutely as they were by <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Secondly; That he should call a Parliament every three years at farthest. Thirdly; That those Persons which were Legally chosen Members should not be secluded without consent of the House. (In allowing this Clause the Protector observ'd not, that the Secluded Members of this same Parliament are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted.) Fourthly, the Members were qualified. Fifthly, The Power of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House was defin'd. Sixthly, That no Law should be made but by Act of Parliament. Seventhly; That a constant yearly Revenue of a Million of Pounds should be setled for the maintenance of the Army and Navy; and 300000 <hi>l.</hi> for the support of the Government, besides other Temporary Supplies, as the House of Commons should think fit. Eighthly; That all the Officers of State should be chosen by the Parliament. Ninthly; That the Protector should encourage the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. Lastly; That he should cause a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion to be agreed on, and published. There are divers others of less Importance.</p>
                        <p>Having signed the Articles he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently with great Ceremony installed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>What needed that, seeing he was still but Protector?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>But the Articles of this Petition were not all the same with those of his former Instrument. For now there was to be another House; and whereas before his Councel was to name his Successor, he had power now to do it himself; so that he was an absolute Monarch, and might leave the Succession to his Son, if he would, and so successively, or transfer it to whom he pleas'd.</p>
                        <p>The Ceremony being ended, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adjourned to the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and then the other House also sate with their Fellows.</p>
                        <p>The House of Commons being now full, took little notice of the other House; wherein there were not of sixty Persons, above nine Lords, but fell a questioning all that their Fellows had done, during the time of their Seclusion, whence had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the avoidance of the Power newly placed in the Protector. Therefore going to the House, he made a Speech to them ending in these words; <hi>By the Living God I must, and do dissolve you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this year the <hi>English</hi> gave the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> another great Blow at <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> not much less than that they had given him the year before at <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About the time of the Dissolution of this Parliament the Royalists had another
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56428:161"/>
Design against the Protector, which was to make an Insurrection in <hi>England,</hi> the King being in <hi>Flanders</hi> ready to second them with an Army thence. But this also was discover'd by Treachery, and came to nothing, but the ruine of those that were engaged in it; whereof many in the beginning of the next year were by a High Court of Justice imprison'd, and some executed.</p>
                        <p>This year also was Major General <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> put out of all Employment, a man second to none but <hi>Oliver</hi> in the favour of the Army; but because he expected by that favour, or by promise from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, to be his Successor in the Supream Power, it would have been dangerous to let him have Command in the Army; the Protector having design'd for his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor his eldest Son <hi>Richard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the year 1658. <hi>September</hi> the third, the Protector died at <hi>White-hall</hi>; having ever since his last Establishment been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with fear of being kill'd by some desperate attempt of the Royalists.</p>
                        <p>Being importun'd in his sickness by his Privy-Council to name his Successor, he nam'd his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who encouraged thereunto, not by his own Ambition, but by <hi>Fleetwood, Desbrough, Thurloe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Council, was content to take
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56428:162"/>
it upon him, and presently Addresses were made to him from the Armies in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> His first business was the chargeable and splendid Funeral of his Father.</p>
                        <p>Thus was <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> seated in the Imperial Throne of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Successor to his Father, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to it by the Officers of the Army then in Town, and congratulated by all the parts of the Army throughout the three Nations; scarce any Garrison omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their particular flattering Addresses to him.</p>

                        <p>The Army was inconstant, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self irresolute, and without any Military Glory. And though the two principal Officers had a near relation to him; yet neither of them, but <hi>Lambert,</hi> was the great Favorite of the Army; and by court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to take upon him the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorship, and by tampering with the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, had gotten again to be a Collonel. He and the rest of the Officers had a Councel at <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi> (where <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> dwelt) for the dispossessing of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> though they had not yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the Nations should be govern'd afterwards; for from the beginning of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56428:162"/>
the Rebellion the Method of Ambition was constantly this; first to destroy, and then to consider what they should set up.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Could not the Protector, who kept his Court at <hi>White-hall,</hi> discover what the business of the Officers was at <hi>Wallingford-house</hi> so near him?</p>

                        <p>Yes; he was by divers of his Friends inform'd of it, and councel'd by some of them, who would have done it, to kill the Chief of them; but he had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to give them such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. He took therefore the Counsel of some milder Persons, which was to call a Parliament. Whereupon Writs were presently sent to those that were in the last Parliament of the other House, and other Writs to the Sheriffs for the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Knights and Burgesses, to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections were made according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner, and a House of Commons now of the right <hi>English</hi> temper, and about 400 in number, including twenty for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and as many for <hi>Ireland.</hi> Being met, they take themselves, without the Protector and other House, to be a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to have the Supream Power of the three Nations.</p>

                           <pb n="318" facs="tcp:56428:163"/>For the first business, they intended the Power of that other House: but because the Protector had recommended to them, for their first business, an Act (already drawn up) for the Recognition of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectoral Power; they began with that; and voted, (after a fortnights Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that an Act should be made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this Act of Recognition should be part, and that another part should be for the bounding of the Protector's Power, and for the securing the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Liberties of the Subject; and that all should pass together.</p>

Was not that as full a Recognition of his Power as was needful? Why by this Example did they teach the People that he was to be obeyed, and then by putting Laws upon him, teach them the contrary?

set up and approved by all the Forces of the three Kingdoms. The Principles of this House of Commons were, no doubt, the very same with theirs who began the Rebellion; and would (if they could have raised a sufficient Army) have done the same against the Protector; and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of their Army would, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, have reduced them to a Rump: for they that keep an Army, and cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it, must be subject to it as much as he that keeps a Lion in his House. The temper of all the Parliaments, since the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> has been the same with the temper of this Parliament, and shall always be such as long as the Presbyterians and men of Democratical Principles have the like Influence upon the Elections.</p>

These Votes being passed, they proceed to another, wherein they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to themselves the Power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.

Points concerning Civil Rights, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, very pleasing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were now also under their Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                        <p>In the beginning of 1659. the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament passed divers other Acts; one was to forbid the Meetings in Councel of the Army-Officers without order from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and both Houses. Another, That no man shall have any Command or Trust in the Army, who did not first under his hand engage himself, never to interrupt any of the Members, but that they might freely meet and debate in the House. And to please the Soldiers, they voted to take presently into their Consideration the means of paying them their Arrears. But whilst they were considering this, the Protector (according to the first of those Acts) forbad the meeting of Officers at <hi>Wallingford-house.</hi> This made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56428:164"/>
which by the disagreement of the Protector and Army was already loose, to fall in pieces. For the Officers from <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi> with Soldiers enough, came over to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and brought with them a Commission ready drawn (giving power to <hi>Desborough</hi> to dissolve the Parliament) for the Protector to sign; which also his Heart and his Party sailing him, he signed. The Parliament never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless continued sitting, but at the end of the Week, the House adjourned till the <hi>Monday</hi> after, being <hi>April</hi> the 25<hi>th.</hi> At their coming on <hi>Monday</hi> morning, they found the door of the House shut up, and the passages to it filled with Soldiers, who plainly told them they must sit no longer. <hi>Richard</hi>'s Authority, and business in Town, being thus at an end, he retir'd into the Country, where within a few days (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promise of the payment of his Debts, which his Father's Funeral had made great) he signed a Resignation of his Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

                        <p>To no body. But after ten days Cessation of the Sovereign Power, some of the Rumpers that were in Town toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the old Speaker Mr. <hi>William Lenthal,</hi> resolv'd amongst themselves, and with <hi>Lambert, Heslerig,</hi> and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56428:165"/>
who were also Rumpers, in all 42, to go into the House, which they did, and were by the Army declared to be the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                        <p>There were also in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> at that time, about their private business, some few of those whom the Army had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in 1648. and were called the Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Members. These knowing themselves to have been elected by the same Authority, and to have the same Right to sit, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get into the House, but were kept out by the Soldiers. The first Vote of the Rump re-seated was; That such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as heretofore Members of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have not sitten in this Parliament since the year 1648. shall not sit in this House, till farther order of the Parliament; and thus the Rump recovered their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>May</hi> the seventh 1659. which they lost in <hi>April</hi> 1653.</p>

voted the Tryal of the King, and declar'd themselves, without King or House of Lords, to have the Supream Authority of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> For there were in the Long Parliament two Factions, the Presbyterian and Independent, the former whereof sought only the subjection of the King, not his destruction directly, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sought directly his destruction, and this part is it which was called the Rump. Thirdly, from <hi>April</hi> the 20<hi>th</hi> to <hi>July</hi> the fourth the Supream Power was in the hands of a Councel of State constituted by <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Fourthly, from <hi>July</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> to <hi>December</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> of the same year, it was in the hands of men called unto it by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whom he termed Men of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Integrity, and made them a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was called in contempt of one of the Members <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament. Fifthly, from <hi>December</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> 1653. to <hi>September</hi> the third 1658. it was in the hands of <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> with the Title of Protector. Sixthly, from <hi>September</hi> the third 1658. to <hi>April</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> 1659. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwel</hi> had it as Successor to his Father. Seventhly, from <hi>April</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> 1659. to <hi>May</hi> the seventh of the same year, it was no where. Eighthly, from <hi>May</hi> the seventh 1659. the Rump which was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of doors in 1653. recover'd it again,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56428:166"/>
and shall lose it again to a Committee of Safety, and again recover it, and again lose it to the Right Owner.</p>

                        <p>By whom, and by what Art came the Rump to be turned out the second time?</p>

                        <p>One would think them safe enough; the Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which when it was in <hi>London,</hi> had helped <hi>Oliver</hi> to put down the Rump, submitted now, begg'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and promised obedience. The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in Town had their pay mended, and the Commanders every where took the old Engagement, whereby they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their Authority heretofore. They also receiv'd their Commissions in the House it self from the Speaker, who was <hi>Generalissimo. Fleetwood</hi> was made Lieutenant General with such, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Limitations, as were thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Rump, that remembred how they had been served by the General <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</hi> Also <hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having resigned his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by Command, returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Lambert,</hi> to whom (as was said) <hi>Oliver</hi> had promised the Succession, and as well as the Rump knew the way to the Protectorship, by <hi>Oliver</hi>'s own foot-steps, was resolv'd to proceed in it, upon the first
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56428:166"/>
opportunity, which presented it self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after.</p>
                        <p>Besides some Plots of Royalists, whom after the old fashion they again persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there was an Insurrection made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them by Presbyterians in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> headed by Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> one of the Secluded Members, they were in number about 3000, and their pretence was for a Free Parliament; there was a great talk of another Rising, or endeavour to rise in <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> at the same time. To suppress Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> the Rump sent down more than a sufficient Army under <hi>Lambert,</hi> which quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the <hi>Cheshire</hi> Party, and recovered <hi>Chester, Leverpool,</hi> and all the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they had seized. Divers also of their Commanders in and after the Battle were taken Prisoners, whereof Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> himself was one.</p>
                        <p>This Exploit done, <hi>Lambert</hi> before his return, Caressed his Soldiers with an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at his own House in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and got their consent to a Petition to be made to the House, that a General might be set up in the Army, as being unfit that the Army should be judged by any power extrinsick to it self.</p>

                        <p>Nor I. But it was (as I have heard) an Axiom of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s: but it so much displeased the Rump, that they voted, That the having of more Generals in the Army than were already setled, was unnecessary, burthensome, and dangerous to the Common wealth.</p>

                        <p>This was not <hi>Oliver</hi>'s method: for though this <hi>Cheshire</hi>-Victory had been as glorious as that of <hi>Oliver</hi> at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> yet it was not the Victory that made <hi>Oliver</hi> General, but the Resignation of <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the profer of it to <hi>Cromwel</hi> by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>Lambert</hi> thought so well of himself, as to expect it: therefore, at his return to <hi>London,</hi> he and other Officers Assembling at <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi> drew their Petition into form, and call'd it a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, wherein the Chief Point was to have a General; but many other of less Importance were added; and this they represented to the House <hi>October</hi> the fourth by Major-General <hi>Desborough:</hi> and this so far forth awed them, as to teach them so much good manners as to promise to take it presently into debate. Which they did; and <hi>October</hi> the 12<hi>th,</hi> having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Spirits, voted; That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of <hi>Lambert, Desborough,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Councel at <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi>
                           <pb n="327" facs="tcp:56428:167"/>
should be void. <hi>Item,</hi> That the Army should be govern'd by a Commission to <hi>Fleetwood, Monk, Haslerig, Walton, Morley</hi> and <hi>Overton,</hi> till <hi>February</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And to make this good against the force they expected from <hi>Lambert,</hi> they ordered <hi>Haslerig</hi> and <hi>Morley</hi> to issue War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to such Officers as they could trust, to bring their Soldiers next morning into <hi>Westminster,</hi> which was done somewhat too late; for <hi>Lambert</hi> had first brought his Soldiers thither, and beset the House, and turned back the Speaker, which was then coming to it: but <hi>Haslerig</hi>'s Forces marching about St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park-wall, came into St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Church-yard; and so both Parties looked all day one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like Enemies, but offered not to fight, whereby the Rump was put out of possession of the House; and the Officers continued their Meeting, as before, at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford-house.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There they chose from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with some few of the City, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, which they called the Committee of Safety; whereof the Chief were <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and <hi>Vane,</hi> who with the advice of a General Councel of Officers, had power to call Delinquents to Trial. To suppress Rebellions; To treat with Forreign States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You see now the Rump cut off, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56428:168"/>
the Supream Power (which is charged with <hi>Salus Populi</hi>) transfer'd to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Officers. And yet <hi>Lambert</hi> hopes for it in the end. But one of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations was; That they should within six weeks present to the Army a new Model of the Government; if they had done so, do you think they would have prefer'd <hi>Lambert</hi> or any other to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority therein, rather than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>

                        <p>I think not. When the Rump had put into Commission (amongst a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) for the Government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that is to say, for the Government of the three Nations, General <hi>Monk,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Commander in Chief of the Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that had done much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in this War, than <hi>Lambert</hi>; how durst they leave him out of this Committee of Safety? Or how could <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> think that General <hi>Monk</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it, and not endeavour to fasten the Rump again?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They thought not of him; his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry had been shewn on remote Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Ambition had not appear'd here in their Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Government, but he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied both with <hi>Richard</hi> and the Rump. After General <hi>Monk</hi> had signified by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56428:168"/>
his dislike of the Proceedings of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and his Fellows, they were much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and began to think him more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable than they had done; but it was too late.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Why? His Army was too small for so great an Enterprize.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>The General knew very well his own, and their Forces; both what they were then, and how they might be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and what generally City and Country wished for, which was the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the King: which to bring about there needed no more, but to come with his Army (though not very great) to <hi>London:</hi> To the doing whereof there was no obstacle but the Army with <hi>Lambert.</hi> What could he do in this Case? If he had declar'd presently for the King, or for a Free-Parliament, all the Armies in <hi>England</hi> would have joyned against him, and assuming the Title of a Parliament, would have furnished themselves with Money.</p>
                        <p>General <hi>Monk,</hi> after he had thus quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled by his Letter with the Councel-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, secur'd first those Officers of his own Army, which were Anabaptists, and therefore not to be trusted, and put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into their places; then drawing his Forces together, marched to <hi>Barwick.</hi>
                           <pb n="330" facs="tcp:56428:169"/>
Being there he indicted a Convention of the <hi>Scots,</hi> of whom he desir'd that they would take order for the security of that Nation in his absence, and raise some main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for his Army in their March. The Convention promised for the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nation their best endeavour, and raised him a Sum of Money, not great, but enough for this purpose, excusing themselves upon their present wants. On the other side, the Committee of Safety, with the greatest and best part of their Army, sent <hi>Lambert</hi> to oppose him; but at the same time by divers Messages and Mediators, urged him to a Treaty; which he consented to, and sent three Officers to <hi>London</hi> to Treat with as many of theirs. These six suddenly concluded (without power from the General) upon these Articles; That the King be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; a Free State setled; the Ministry and Universities encouraged, with divers others. Which the General liked not, and imprisoned one of his Commissioners for exceeding his Commission. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon another Treaty was agreed on of five to five. But whilst these Treaties were in hand, <hi>Haslerig,</hi> a Member of the Rump, seized on <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers sent by the Committee of Safety to reduce it, instead of that, entred into
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56428:169"/>
the Town, and joyned with <hi>Haslerig.</hi> Secondly, the City renewed their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults for a Free-Parliament. Thirdly, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> a Member also of the Rump, and greatly favour'd in <hi>York-shire,</hi> was raising Forces there behind <hi>Lambert,</hi> who being now between two Armies, his Enemies, would gladly have fought with the General. Fourthly, there came news that <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi> were List<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Soldiers. Lastly, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wanting Money, and sure they should not be furnished from the Councel of Officers, which had neither Authority, nor Strength to Levy Money, grew dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and (for their free Quarter) were odious to the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>

                        <p>I wonder why the <hi>Scots</hi> were so ready to furnish General <hi>Monk</hi> with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for they were no Friends to the Rump?</p>

                        <p>I know not; but I believe the <hi>Scots</hi> would have parted with a greater Sum, rather than the <hi>English</hi> should not have gone together by the ears amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Councel of Officers being now beset with so many Enemies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced speedily their Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was to have a Free-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which should meet <hi>December</hi> the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56428:170"/>
15<hi>th,</hi> but with such qualifications of no King, no House of Lords, as made the City more angry than before. To send Soldiers into the West, to suppress those that were rising there, they durst not, for fear of the City; nor could they raise any other for want of Money. There remained nothing but to break, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi> to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>This coming to the knowledge of their Army in the North, they deserted <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>; and the Rump the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> repossessed the House.</p>

                        <p>The Rump, though seated, was not well setled, but (in the midst of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tumults for a Free-Parliament) had as much need of the General's coming up now, as before. He therefore sent them word, that because he thought them not yet secure enough, he would come up to <hi>London</hi> with his Army; which they not only accepted, but also intreated him to do, and voted him for his Services 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
                        <p>The General marching towards <hi>London,</hi> the Country every where petition'd him
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56428:170"/>
for a Free-Parliament. The Rump, to make room in <hi>London</hi> for his Army, dislodged their own. The General for all that, had not let fall a word in all this time, that could be taken for a Declaration of his final Design.</p>

                        <p>They never troubled him; nor do I know any cause of so gentle dealing with him: but certainly <hi>Lambert</hi> was the ablest of any Officer they had to do them service, when they should have means, and need to employ him. After the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was come to <hi>London,</hi> the Rump sent to the City for their part of a Tax of 100000 <hi>l.</hi> a month, for six months, according to an Act, which the Rump had made formerly, before their disseizin by the Committee of Safety. But the City, who were adverse to the Rump, and keen upon a Free-Parliament, could not be brought to give their Money to their Enemies, and to purposes repugnant to their own. Hereupon the Rump sent order to the General to break down the City Gates and their Portcullices, and to imprison certain obstinate Citizens. This he performed, and it was the last service he did them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="334" facs="tcp:56428:171"/>About this time the Commission, by which General <hi>Monk,</hi> with others, had the Government of the Army put into their hands by the Rump, before the usurpation of the Councel of Officers, came to expire, which the present Rump renewed.</p>

                        <p>He was thereby the sixth part of the General of the whole Forces of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. If I had been as the Rump, he should have been sole General.

                        <p>After the pulling down of the City Gates, the General sent a Letter to the Rump to let them know, that that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was much against his Nature, and to put them in mind how well the City had serv'd the Parliament throughout the whole War.</p>

                        <p>The Rump considered not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the City, nor the good Nature of the General. They were busie. They were giving out Commissions; making of Acts for Abjuration of the King and his Line, and for the Old Engagement and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56428:171"/>
conferring with the City to get Money. The General also desir'd to hear Conference between some of the Rump, and some of the Secluded Members, concerning the Justice of their Seclusion, and of the hurt that could follow from their re-admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it was granted, after long Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the General finding the Rump's pretences unreasonable and ambitious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself, with the City, for a Free-Parliament, and came to <hi>Westminster</hi> with the Secluded Members, (whom he had appointed to meet and stay for him at <hi>White-hall</hi>) and replaced them in the House amongst the Rumpers; so that now the same Cattle that were in the House of Commons in 1640.

                        <p>They had learnt nothing. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part was now again Presbyterian. 'Tis true they were so grateful to General <hi>Monk,</hi> as to make him General of all the Forces in the three Nations. They did well also to make void the Engagement; but it was because those Acts were made to the prejudice of their Party; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56428:172"/>
none of their own Rebellious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, nor did any thing in order to the good of the present King: but on the contrary they declared by a Vote, that the late King began the War against his two Houses.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>The two Houses considered as two Persons, were they not two of the King's Subjects? If a King raise an Army against his Subject, is it lawful for that Subject to resist with force, when (as in this Case) he might have had peace upon his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission?</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>They knew they had acted vilely and sottishly; but because they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pretended to greater than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wisdom and godliness, they were loth to confess it. The Presbyterians now saw their time to make a Confession of their Faith, and presented it to the House of Commons, to shew they had not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Principles, which (after six read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the House) was voted to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and once a year to be read publickly in every Church.</p>

                        <p>I say again, this re-establishing of the Long Parliament was no good service to the King.</p>

                        <p>Have a little patience. They were re-established with two Conditions. One to determine their sitting before the end
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56428:172"/>
of <hi>March</hi>; another to send out Writs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their rising for new Elections.</p>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>That brought in the King: for few of this Long Parliament (the Country having felt the smart of their former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) could get themselves chosen again. This New Parliament began to sit <hi>April</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> 1660. How soon these called in the King; with what Joy and Triumph he was receiv'd; how earnestly his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty pressed the Parliament for the Act of Oblivion, and how few were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of it, you know as well as I.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>But I have not yet observed in the Presbyterians any oblivion of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles. We are but returned to the state we were in at the beginning of the Sedition.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>Not so: for before that time, though the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had the Right of the Militia in vertue of the Sovereignty, and without dispute, and without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Act of Parliament directly to that purpose; yet now, after this bloody di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, the next (which is the present) Parliament in proper and express terms hath declar'd the same to be the Right of the King only, without either of his Houses of Parliament; which Act is more
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56428:173"/>
instructive to the People, than any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the Title of Sovereign, and consequently fitter to disarm the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of all seditious Haranguers for the time to come.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>I pray God it prove so. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I must confess, that this Parliament has done all that a Parliament can do for the security of our Peace: which I think also would be enough, if Preachers would take heed of instilling evil Principles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Auditory. I have seen in this Revolution a circular motion, of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power through two Usurpers, from the late King to this his Son: for (leaving out the Power of the Councel of Officers, which was but temporary, and no otherwise owned by them, but in trust) it moved from King <hi>Charles</hi> the First to the Long Parliament, from thence to the Rump, from the Rump to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and then back again from <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwel</hi> to the Rump, thence to the Long Parliament, and thence to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, where long may it remain.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in all things which I have written, so also in this Piece, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all I can to be perspicuous; but yet your own attention is always necessary. The late Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> published a Book called <hi>The Catching of Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> in which he hath put together divers Sentences pickt out of my <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which stand there plainly and firmly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sets them down without their Proofs, and without the order of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance one upon another; and calls them Atheism, Blasphemy, Impiety, Subversion of Religion, and by other names of that kind. My request unto you is, That when he cites my words for Erroneous, you
<pb facs="tcp:56428:178"/>
will be pleased to turn to the place it self, and see whether they be well proved, and how to be understood. Which labour his Lordship might have saved you, if he would have vouchsafed, as well to have weighed my Arguments before you, as to have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you my Conclusions. His Book contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two Chapters, the one concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the other concerning Politicks. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he does not so much as offer any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of any thing in my <hi>Leviathan</hi> concluded, I needed not to have answered either of them. Yet to the first I here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, because the words <hi>Atheism, Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> and the like, are words of the greatest defamation possible. And this I had done sooner, if I had sooner known that such a Book was extant. He wrote it ten years since, and yet I never heard of it till about three Months since; so little talk there was of his Lordship's Writings. If you want leasure or care of the questions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, I pray you condemn me not upon report. To judge and not examine is not just. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. I. That the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Principles are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Christianity and all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>

                     <p>THe Image of God is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together defaced by the fall of Man, but that there will remain some practical notions of God and Goodness; which, when the mind is free from vagrant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and violent passions, do shine as clearly in the heart, as other speculative notions do in the head. Hence it is, That there was never any Nation so barbarous or savage throughout the whole world, which had not their God. They who did never wear cloaths upon their backs, who did never know Magistrate but their Father, yet have their God, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rites and Devotions to him. Hence it is, That the greatest Atheists in any sudden danger do unwittingly cast their eyes up to Heaven, as craving aid from thence, and in a thunder creep into some hole to hide themselves. And they who are conscious to themselves of any secret Crimes, though they be secure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56428:179"/>
enough from the justice of men, do yet feel the blind blows of a Guilty Conscience, and fear Divine Vengeance. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>T. H.</hi> himself in his lucid Intervals. <hi>That we may know what worship of God natural reason doth assign, let us begin with his attributes, where it is manifest in the first place, That existency is to be attributed to him.</hi> To which he addeth <hi>Infiniteness, Incomprehensibility, Vnity, Vbiquity.</hi> Thus for Attributes, next for Actions. <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing external Actions, wherewith God is to be worshipped, the most general precept of reason is, that they be signs of honour,</hi> under which are contained <hi>Prayers, Thanksgivings, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>

                     <p>Hitherto his Lordship discharges me of Atheisme. What need he to say that <hi>All Nations, how barbarous soever, yet have their Gods and Religious Rites, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists are frighted with thunder, and feel the blind blows of Conscience?</hi> It might have been as apt a Preface to any other of his Discourses as this. I expect therefore in the next place to be told that I deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain my afore recited Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>Yet to let us see how inconsistent and irreconcileable he is with himself, else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where reckoning up all the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at large, even twenty in number, he hath not one word that concerneth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56428:179"/>
or that hath the least relation in the world to God. As if a man were like the Colt of a wild Asse in the wilderness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any owner or obligation. Thus in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the Laws of Nature, this great Clerk forgeteth the God of Nature, and the main and principle Laws of Nature, which contains a mans duty to his God, and the principal end of his Creation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>T. H.</speaker>
                     <p>After I had ended the discourse he mentions of the Laws of Nature, I thought it fittest in the last place once for all, to say they were the Laws of God, then when they were delivered in the Word of God; but before being not known by men for any thing but their own natural reason, they were but Theorems, tending to peace, and those uncertain, as being but conclusions of particular men, and therefore not properly Laws. Besides, I had formerly in my Book <hi>De Cive, cap.</hi> 4. proved them severally one by one out of the Scriptures; which his Lordship had read and knew. 'Twas therefore an unjust charge of his to say, I had not one word in them that concerns Religion, or that hath the least relation in the world to God; and this upon no other ground then that I added not to every article, <hi>This Law is in the Scripture.</hi> But why he should call me (ironically) a great Clerk, I cannot
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56428:180"/>
tell. I suppose he would make men believe I arrogated to my self all the learning of a great Clerk, Bishop, or other inferior Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. A Learned Bishop, is that Bishop that can interpret all parts of Scripture tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and congruently to the harmony of the whole; that has learnt the History and Laws of the Church, down from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time to his own; and knows what is the nature of a Law Civil, Divine, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Positive; and how to govern well the Parochial Ministers of his Diocess, so that they may both by Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample keep the people in the belief of all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith necessary to Salvation, and in obedience to the Laws of their Country. This is a Learned Bishop. A Learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is he that hath learned the way by which men may be drawn from Avarice, Pride, Sensuality, Prophaness, Rebellious Principles, and all other vices by eloquent and powerful disgracing them, both from Scripture and from Reason; and can terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy men from vice by discreet uttering of the punishments denounced against wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and by deducing rationally the dammage they receive by it in the end. In one word, he is a Learned Minister that can preach such Sermons as St. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> preached to the <hi>Antiochians</hi> when he was Presbyter in that City. Could his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56428:180"/>
find in my Book that I arrogated to my self the eloquence or wisdom of St. <hi>Chrisostom,</hi> or the ability of governing the Church? 'Tis one thing to know what is to be done, another thing to know how to do it. But his Lordship was pleased to use any artifice to disgrace me in any kind whatsoever.</p>

                     <speaker>J. D.</speaker>
                     <p>Perhaps he will say that he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Laws of Nature there, only so far as may serve to the constitution or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a Common-wealth. In good time, let it be so. He hath devised us a trim Common-wealth, which is founded neither upon Religion towards God, nor Justice towards Man; but meerly upon self-interest, and self-preservation. Those raies of heavenly Light, those natural seeds of Religion, which God himself hath imprinted in the heart of man, are more efficatious towards preservation of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; whether we regard the nature of the thing, or the blessing of God, then all his <hi>Pacts,</hi> and <hi>Surrenders,</hi> and <hi>Translations of power.</hi> He who unteacheth men their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, may make them Eye-servants, so long as their interest doth oblige them to obey; but is no fit Master to teach men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and fidelity.</p>

                     <speaker>T. H.</speaker>
                     <p>He has not yet found the place where I contradict either the Existence,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56428:181"/>
or Infiniteness, or Incomprehensibility, or Unity, or Ubiquity of God. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yet absolved of Atheism. But I am, he says, inconsistent and irreconcileable with my self, that is, I am, (though he says not so, he thinks) a forgetful blockhead. I cannot help that: But my forgetfulness appears not here. Even his Lordship where he says, Those raies of heavenly Light, those seeds of Religion, which God himself hath imprinted in the heart of man (meaning natural reason) are more efficacious to the preservation of Society, than all the <hi>Pacts, Surrenders,</hi> and <hi>Translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Power,</hi> had forgotten to except the Old Pact of the Jews, and the New Pact of Christians. But pardoning that, did he hope to make any wise man believe, that when this Nation very lately was an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and dissolute multitude of men, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one what his own reason or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed Light suggested, did again out of that same Light call in the King, and piece again, and ask pardon for the faults, which that their illumination had brought them into, rather than out of fear of perpetual danger, and hope of preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Without Religion, Societies are like but soapy bubbles, quickly dissolved. It was the judgment of as wise a man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56428:181"/>
as, <hi>T. H.</hi> himself (though perhaps he will hardly be perswaded to it) that <hi>Rome</hi> ought more of its grandeur to Religion, than either to strength or stratagems. <hi>We have not exceeded the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor the</hi> Galls <hi>in strength, nor the</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians <hi>in craft, nor the</hi> Grecians <hi>in art,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but we have overcome all Nations by our Piety and Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>T. H.</speaker>
                     <p>Did not his Lordship forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self here again, in approving this sentence of <hi>Tully,</hi> which makes the Idolatry of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only better than the Idolatry of other Nations; but also better than the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whose Law Christ himself says, he came not to destroy but to fulfil? And that the <hi>Romans</hi> overcame both them and other Nations, by their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, when it is manifest that the <hi>Romans</hi> overran the world by injustice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and that their Victories ought not to be ascribed to the Piety of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to the impiety as well of the <hi>Jews</hi> as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations? But what meant he by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tully</hi> was as wise a man as <hi>T. H.</hi> himself, though perhaps he will hardly be perswaded to it? Was that any part of the controversie? No: Then it was out of his way. God promiseth to assist good men in their way, but not out of their way. 'Tis therefore the less wonder that his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56428:182"/>
Lordship was in this place deserted of the Light which God imprints in the hearts of rudest Savages.</p>

                     <p>Among his Laws he incerteth <hi>gratitude</hi> to men as the third precept of the Law of Nature; but of the gratitude of mankind to their Creator, there is a deep silence. If men had sprung up from the earth in a night like Mushroms or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, without all sence of Honour, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Conscience, or Gratitude, he could not have vilified the humane nature more then he doth.</p>

                     <p>My Lord discovers here an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of such method as is necessary for lawful and strict reasoning and explication of the truth in controversie. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, but also how little able he is to fix his mind upon what he reads in other mens Writings. When I had defined Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude universally, he finds fault that I do not mention Ingratitude towards God, as if his Lordship knew not that an universal comprehends all the particulars. When I had defined Equity universally, why did he not as well blame me for not telling what that Equity is in God? He is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the man of whom he receives a good turn, that confesseth or maketh appear he is pleased with the benefit he receiveth. So also Gratitude towards God is to confess
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56428:182"/>
his benefits. There is also in Gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men a desire to requite their Benefits, so there is in our Gratitude towards God, so far to requite them, as to be kind to Gods Ministers, which I acknowledged in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices a part of natural Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and the benefit of those Sacrifices is the nourishment of Gods Ministers. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears therefore that the Bishops attention in reading my Writings was either weak in it self, or weakned by prejudice.</p>

                     <p>From this shameful omission or preterition of the main duty of mankind, a man might easily take the height of <hi>T. H.</hi> his Religion. But he himself put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it past all conjectures. His princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are brim full of prodigious impiety. <hi>In these four things, Opinions of Ghosts, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of second Causes, devotion to what men fear, and taking of things casual, for Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks, consisteth the natural seed of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; the culture and improvement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he referreth only to <hi>Policy.</hi> Humane and Divine Politicks, are but Politicks. And again, <hi>Mankind hath this from the conscience of their own weakness, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of natural events, that the most part of men believe that there is an invisible God, the maker of all visible things.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he telleth us, That <hi>Superstition proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from fear without right reason, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56428:183"/>
Atheisme from an opinion of reason without fear</hi>; making Atheisme to be more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than Superstition. What is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that Divine Worship which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason did assign unto God, the honour of Existence, Infiniteness, Incomprehensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Unity, Ubiquity? What is now become of that Dictate or Precept of reason, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Prayers, Thanksgivings, Oblations, Sacrifices,</hi> if uncertain Opinions, Ignorance, Fear, Mistakes, the conscience of our own weakness, and the admiration of natural Events, be the only seeds of Religion?</p>
                     <p>He proceedeth further, That <hi>Atheisme it self, though it be an erronious opinion, and therefore a sin, yet it ought to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sins of imprudence or ignorance.</hi> He addeth, that <hi>an Atheist is punished not as a Subject is punished by his King, because he did not observe Laws: but as an Enemy, by an Enemy, because he would not accept Laws.</hi> His reason is, because <hi>the Atheist never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his will to the Will of God, whom he never thought to be.</hi> And he concludeth that mans obligation to obey God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his weakness. <hi>Manifestum est obligationem ad prestandum ipsi (Deo) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiam, incumbere hominibus propter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitatem.</hi> First it is impossible that should be a sin of meer ignorance or imprudence, which is directly contrary to the light
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56428:183"/>
of natural reason. The Laws of nature need no new promulgation, being imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed naturally by God in the heart of Man. <hi>The Law of nature was written in our hearts by the finger of God, without our assent</hi>; or rather <hi>the Law of Nature is the assent it self.</hi> Then if Nature dictate to us that there is a God, and that this God is to be worshipped in such and such manner, it is not possible that Atheism should be a sin of meer ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Rebellious Subject is still a Subject, <hi>De Jure,</hi> though not, <hi>De Facto,</hi> by right, though not by deed: and so the most cursed Atheist that is, ought by right to be the Subject of God, and ought to be punished not as a just Enemy, but as a disloyal Traytor. Which is confessed by himself, <hi>This fourth Sin,</hi> (that is, of those who do not by word and deed confess one God the Supreme King of Kings) <hi>in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Kingdom of God is the Crime of High Treason, for it is a denial of Divine Power, or Atheism.</hi> Then an Atheist is a Traytor to God, and punishable as a disloyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not as an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it is an absurd and dishonourable assertion, to make our obedience to God to depend upon our weakness, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, and not upon our gratitude, because we owe our being and preservation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56428:184"/>
to him. <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of the Fruit thereof? And who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock?</hi> And again, <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they are and were created.</hi> But it were much better or at least not so ill, to be a down right Atheist, than to make God to be such a thing as he doth, and at last thrust him into the Devils Office, to be the cause of all Sin.</p>

                     <p>Though this Bishop, as I said, had but a weak attention in reading, and little skill in examining the force of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet he knew men, and the art, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling their judgments to win their assents by exciting their Passions. One Rule of his art was to give his Reader what he would have him swallow, a part by it self, and in the nature of News, whether true or not. Knowing that the unlearned, that is most men, are content to believe, rather than be troubled with examining, Therefore (a little before) he put these words <hi>T. H. no friend to Religion,</hi> in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. And in this place, before he offer at any confutation, he says my Principles are brim full of <hi>Prodigious Impieties.</hi> And at the next Paragraph, in the Margent, he puts that <hi>I excuse Atheism.</hi> This behaviour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56428:184"/>
becomes neither a Bishop, nor a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, nor any man that pretends to good education. Fear of invisible powers, what is it else in savage people, but the fear of somewhat they think a God? What invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible power does the reason of a savage man suggest unto him, but those Phantasms of his sleep, or his distemper, which we frequently call Ghosts, and the Savages thought Gods; so that the fear of a God (though not of the true one) to them was the beginning of Religion, as the fear of the true God was the beginning of wisdom to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>? Ignorance of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes made men fly to some first cause, the fear of which bred Devotion and Worship. The ignorance of what that power might do, made them observe the order of what he had done; that they might guess by the like order, what he was to do another time. This was their Prognostication. What Prodigious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here? How confutes he it? Must it be taken for Impiety upon his bare calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? I said Superstition was fear without reason. Is not the fear of a false God, or fancied Daemon contrary to right reason? And is not Atheism Boldness grounded on false reasoning, such as is this, <hi>the wicked prosper, therefore there is no God</hi>? He offers no proof against any of this; but says only
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56428:185"/>
I make Atheism to be more reasonable than Superstition; which is not true: For I deny that there is any reason either in the Atheist or in the Superstitious. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Atheist thinks he has reason, where he has none, I think him the more irrational of the two. But all this while he argues not against any of this; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only, what is become of my natural Worship of God, and of his Existency, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness, Incomprehensibility, Unity, and Ubiquity. As if whatsoever reason can suggest, must be suggested all at once. First, all men by nature had an opinion of Gods Existency, but of his other Attributes not so soon, but by reasoning, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. And for the Attributes of the true God, they were never suggested but by the Word of God written. In that I say A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism is a sin of ignorance, he says I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.</hi> Is it not then a sin of folly? 'Tis agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, that right reason dictates, There is a God. Does it not follow, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God is a sin proceeding from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasoning. If it be not a sin of ignorance, it must be a sin of malice. Can a man malice that which he thinks has no being? But may not one think there is a God, and yet maliciously deny him? If he think
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56428:185"/>
there is a God, he is no Atheist; and so the question is changed into this, whether any man that thinks there is a God, dares deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately deny it? For my part I think not. For upon what confidence dares any man (deliberately I say) oppose the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? <hi>David</hi> saith of himself, <hi>My feet were ready to slip when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</hi> Therefore it is likely the feet of men less holy slip oftner. But I think no man living is so daring, being out of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to hold it as his opinion. Those wicked men that for a long time proceeded so succesfully in the late horrid Rebellion, may perhaps make some think they were constant and resolved Atheists, but I think rather that they forgot God, than believed there was none. He that believes there is such an Atheist, comes a little too near that opinion himself, Nevertheless, if words spoken in passion signifie a denial of a God, no punishment praeordained by Law, can be too great for such an insolence; because there is no living in a Common-wealth with men, to whose oaths we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably give credit. As to that I say, <hi>An Atheist is punished by God not as a Subject by his King, but as an Enemy, and to my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, namely, because he never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himself Gods Subject,</hi> He opposeth, That if nature dictate that there is a God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56428:186"/>
and to be worshiped in such and such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then Atheism is not a sin of meer ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; as if either I or he did hold that Nature dictates the manner of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or any article of our Creed, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worship with or without a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. Secondly, he answers that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel is still a Subject <hi>de Jure,</hi> though not <hi>de Facto</hi>: And 'tis granted. But though the King lose none of his right by the Traytors act, yet the Traytor loseth the priviledg of being punisht by a praecedent Law; and therefore may be punish'd at the Kings will, as <hi>Ravillac</hi> was for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. of <hi>France.</hi> An open Enemy and a perfidious Traytor are both enemies. Had not his Lordship read in the Roman story how <hi>Perseus</hi> and other just enemies of that State were wont to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished? But what is this trifling question to my <hi>excusing of Atheism?</hi> In the seventh Paragraph of my Book <hi>de Cive</hi> he found the words (in Latin) which he here citeth. And to the same sense I have said in my <hi>Leviathan,</hi> That the right of nature whereby God raigneth over men, is to be derived not from his creating them, as if he required obedience, as of Gratitude; but from his irresistable Power. This he says is absurd and dishonourable. Whereas first all power is honourable, and greatest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56428:186"/>
power is most honourable. Is it not a more noble tenure for a King to hold his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the right to punish those that transgress his Laws from his Power, than from the gratitude or gift of the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. There is nothing therefore here of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God Almighty. But see the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of his disputing. He saw he could not catch <hi>Leviathan</hi> in this place, he looks for him in my Book <hi>de Cive,</hi> which is Latine, to try what he could fish out of that. And says I make our obedience to God, depend upon our weakness, as if these words signified the <hi>Dependence,</hi> and not the <hi>necessity</hi> of our submission, or that <hi>incumbere</hi> and <hi>dependere</hi> were all one.</p>

                     <p>For <hi>T. H.</hi> his God is not the God of Christians, nor of any rational men. Our God is every where, and seeing he hath no parts, he must be wholly here, and wholly there, and wholly every where. So Nature it self dictateth. <hi>It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said honourably of God that he is in a place; for nothing is in a place, but that which hath proper bounds of its greatness.</hi> But <hi>T. H.</hi> his God is not wholly every where. <hi>No man can conceive that any thing is all in this place, and all in another place at the same time, for none of these things ever have or can be incident to sense.</hi> So far well, if by conceiving he mean comprehending; but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56428:187"/>
then follows, <hi>That these are absurd Speeches taken upon credit, without any signification at all, from deceived Philosophers, and deceived or deceiving School-men.</hi> Thus he denieth the Ubiquity of God. A Circumscriptive, a Definitive, and a Repletive being in a place, is some heathen language to him.</p>

                     <p>Though I believe the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God, and that he can do what he will, yet I dare not say how every thing is done, because I cannot conceive nor comprehend either the Divine substance, or the way of its operation. And I think it Impiety to speak concerning God any thing of my own head, or upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Philosophers or School-men, which I understand not, without warrant in the Scripture: And what I say of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, I say also of Ubiquity. But his Lordship is more valiant in this place, telling us that God is <hi>wholly here,</hi> and <hi>wholly there,</hi> and <hi>wholly every where</hi>; because he has no parts. I cannot comprehend nor conceive this. For methinks it implies also that the whole World is also in the whole God, and in every part of God, nor can I conceive how any thing can be called <hi>Whole,</hi> which has no parts, nor can I find any thing of this in the Scripture. If I could find it there, I could believe it; and if I could find it in the publick Doctrine of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56428:187"/>
the Church, I could easily abstain from contradicting it. The School-men say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the Soul of Man (meaning his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Soul, which they call the rational Soul) is also <hi>wholly</hi> in <hi>the whole man,</hi> and wholly in every part of the man. What is this but to make the humane Soul the same thing in respect of mans Body, that God is in respect of the World? These his Lordship calls here rational men, and some of them which applaud this Doctrine, would have the High Court of Parliament corroborate such Doctrines with a Law. I said in my <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that it is no honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attribute to God, to say he is <hi>in a place,</hi> because, infinite is not confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a place. To which he replies, <hi>T. H. his God is not wholly every where.</hi> I confess the consequence. For I understand in <hi>English,</hi> he that says any thing to be <hi>all here,</hi> means that <hi>neither all nor any of the same thing is else where.</hi> He says further, I take a <hi>Circumscriptive, a Definitive, and a Repletive</hi> being in a place to be Heathen Language. Truly, if this Dispute were at the Bar, I should go near to crave the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Court, lest some trick might be put upon me in such obscurity. For though I know what these Latin words singly signifie, yet I understand not how any thing is in a <hi>Place Definitively</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56428:188"/>
and not <hi>Circumscriptively.</hi> For <hi>Definitively</hi> comes from <hi>definio</hi> which is to set bounds. And therefore to be in a Place Definitively, is when the bounds of the <hi>place</hi> are every way marked out. But to be in a place Circumscriptively, is when the bounds of the place are described round about. To be in a Place Repletive, is to fill a place. Who does not see that this dictinction is Canting and Fraud? If any man will call it Pious Fraud, he is to prove the Piety as clearly as I have here explained the Fraud. Besides, no Fraud can be Pious in any man, but him that hath a lawful Right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him whom he beguileth; whom the Bishop pretends to govern, I cannot tell. Besides his Lordship ought to have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that every Bishop is one of the Great Councel, trusted by the King to give their advice with the Lords Temporal, for the making of good Laws, Civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, and not to offer them such obscure Doctrines, as if, because they are not versed in School-divinity, therefore they had no Learning at all, nor understood the English Tongue. Why did the Divines of <hi>England</hi> contend so much heretofore to have the Bible translated into <hi>English,</hi> if they never meant any but themselves should read it? If a Lay-man be publickly encouraged to search the Scriptures for his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56428:188"/>
own Salvation, what has a Divine to do to impose upon him any strange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, unless if he make him err to Damnation, he will be damned in his stead?</p>

                     <p>Our God is immutable without any shadow of turning by change, to whom all things are present, nothing past, nothing to come. But <hi>T.

That is as much as to say, That our God is infinite, and his God is finite, for unto that which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite, nothing can be added neither time nor parts. Hear himself, <hi>Nor do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what derogation it can be to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfection, to attribute to it Potentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is in English, Power</hi> (so little doth he understand what Potentiality is) <hi>and successive duration.</hi> And he chargeth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as a fault; that will not have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be an <hi>endless succession of time.</hi> How, <hi>successive duration,</hi> and <hi>an endless succession of time in God?</hi> Then God is infinite, then God is elder to day than he was yesterday.

                     <p>I shall omit both here and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth his preambulatory, impertinent, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56428:189"/>
uncivil calumnies. The thing he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove is this. That it is a deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Divine Power to attribute to it Potentiality (that is in <hi>English</hi> Power) and Successive Duration. One of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is, God is infinite, and nothing can be added to infinite, neither of time nor of parts: It is true. And therefore I said, God is infinite and eternal, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end, either of Time or Place; which he has not here confuted, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. He denies Potentiality and Power to be all one, and says I little understand what Potentiality is. He ought therefore in this place to have defined what Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality is: For I understand it to be the same with <hi>Potentia,</hi> which is in <hi>English</hi> Power. There is no such word as Potentiality in the Scriptures, nor in any Author of the Latin Tongue. It is found only in School-Divinity, as a word of Art, or rather as a word of Craft, to amaze and puzzle the Laity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I no sooner read than intepreted it. In the next place he says, as wondring, How an endless succession of time in God! Why not? <hi>Gods mercy endureth for ever,</hi> and surely God endureth as long as his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore there is duration in God, and consequently endless succession of time. <hi>God who in sundry times and divers manners spake in time past,</hi> &amp;c. But in a former
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56428:189"/>
dispute with me about Free-will, he hath defined Eternity to be <hi>Nunc stans,</hi> that is an <hi>ever standing now,</hi> or <hi>everlasting instant.</hi> This he thinks himself bound in honour to defend. What reasonable soul can digest this? We read in Scripture, that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years with God, is but as yesterday. And why? but because he sees as clearly to the end of a thousand years, as to the end of a day. But his Lordship affirms, That both a thousand years and a day are but one instant, the same <hi>standing Now,</hi> or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. If he had shewed an holy Text for this Doctrine, or any Text of the Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> (in the Scripture and Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is contained all our Religion) I had yielded to him, but School-Divinity I value little or nothing at all. Though in this he contradict also the School-men, who say the Soul is eternal only <hi>à parte post,</hi> but God is eternal both <hi>à parte post,</hi> and <hi>à parte ante.</hi> Thus there are parts in eternity, and eternity being, as his Lordship says, the divine substance, the divine substance has parts, and <hi>Nunc stans</hi> has parts. Is not this darkness? I take it to be the Kingdom of Darkness, and the teachers of it, especially of this Doctrine. That God who is not only <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus,</hi> but also <hi>Maximus</hi> is no greater than to be wholly contained in the least Atome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56428:190"/>
of earth, or other body, and that his whole duration is but an instant of time, to be either grosly ignorant or ungodly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>

                     <p>Our God is a perfect, pure, simple indivisible, infinite Essence; free from all composition of matter and form, of substance and accidents. All matter is finite, and he who acteth by his infinite Essence, needeth neither Organs, nor Faculties (<hi>id est, no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, note that</hi>) nor accidents, to render him more compleat. But <hi>T. H.</hi> his God is a divisible God, a compounded God, that hath matter, or qualities, or accidents. Hear himself. I argue thus, <hi>The divine substance is indivisible, but eternity is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine substance. The Major is evident, because God is</hi> Actus simplicissimus; <hi>the Minor is confessed by all men, that whatsoever is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, is God.</hi> Now listen to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>The Major is so far from being evident, that</hi> Actus simplicissimus <hi>signifieth nothing. The Minor is said by some men, thought by no man, whatsoever is thought is understood.</hi> The Major was this, <hi>The divine substance is indivisible.</hi> Is this far from being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Either it is indivisible or divisible. If it be not indivisible, then it is divisible, then it is materiate, then it is corporeal, then it hath parts, then it is finite by his own confession. <hi>Habere partes, aut esse
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56428:190"/>
totum aliquid, sunt attributa finitorum.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this silly conceit he chargeth me for saying, That <hi>God is not just,</hi> but justice it self; not eternal, but eternity it self; which he calleth <hi>unseemly words to be said of God.</hi> And he thinketh he doth me a great courtesie in not adding <hi>Blasphemous and Atheistical.</hi> But his Bolts are so soon shot, and his Reasons are such vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and such drowsie Phantasies, that no sad man doth much regard them. Thus he hath already destroyed the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquity, the Eternity, and the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God. I wish he had consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better with himself, before he had desperately cast himself upon these Rocks.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>paulo majora canamus,</hi> my next charge is, That he destroys the very being of God, and leaves nothing in his place, but an empty name. For by taking away all incorporeal substances, he taketh away God himself. The very name (saith he) of an incorporeal substance, is a <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And <hi>to say that an Angel or Spirit, is an incorporeal substance, is to say in effect, that there is no Angel or Spirit at all.</hi> By the same reason to say, That God is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal substance, is to say there is no God at all. Either God is incorporeal, or he is finite, and consists of parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently is no God. This, That there is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56428:191"/>
no incorporeal spirit, is that main root of Atheism, from which so many lesser branches are daily sprouting up.</p>

                     <p>God is indeed a Perfect, Pure, Simple, Infinite Substance; and his Name incommunicable, that is to say, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible into this and that individual God, in such manner as the name of Man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible into <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> And therefore God is individual; which word amongst the Greeks is expressed by the word Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. Certain Hereticks in the primitive Church, because special and individual are called Particulars, maintained that Christ was a particular God, differing in number from God the Father. And this was the Doctrine that was condemned for Heresy in the first Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> by these words, <hi>God hath no parts.</hi> And yet many of the Latin Fathers in their explications of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, have expounded the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> by the community of nature, which different Species have in their Genus, and different individuals in the Species, as if <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial,</hi> because they agree in one humane nature; which is contrary (I confess) to the meaning of the <hi>Nice</hi> Fathers. But that in a substance infinitely great, it should be impossible to consider any thing as not infinite. I do not see it there condemned.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56428:191"/>
For certainly he that thinks God is in every part of the Church, does not exclude him out of the Church-yard. And is not this a considering of him by parts? For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a thing which we cannot reach nor separate one part thereof from another, is nothing else but considering of the same by parts. So much concerning Indivisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from Natural Reason; for I will wade no farther, but relie upon the Scriptures. God is no where said in the Scriptures to be indivisible, unless his Lordship meant division, to consist only in separation of parts, which I think he did not. St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Is Christ divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Not that the followers of <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> followed some one part, some another of Christ; but that thinking diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of his nature, they made as it were different kinds of him. Secondly, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship expounds Simplicity, by not being compounded of Matter and Form, or of Substance and Accidents, Unlearnedly. For nothing can be so compounded. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a <hi>Chair</hi> is <hi>Wood,</hi> the form is the figure it hath apt for the intended use. Does his Lordship think the Chair compounded of the Wood and the Figure? A man is Rational, does it therefore follow that Reason is a part of the man? It was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> deceived him, who had told him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56428:192"/>
that <hi>a Rational living Creature,</hi> is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a man, and that the definition of a man was his Essence; and therefore the Bishop and other School-men, from this that the word Rational is a part of these words <hi>Man is a Rational living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> concluded that the Essence of man, was a part of the man, and a <hi>Rational man,</hi> the same thing with a Rational Soul. I should wonder how any man, much more a Doctor of Divinity, should be so grosly deceived, but that I know naturally the generality of men speak the words of their Masters by rote, without having any Idea of the things, which the words signifie. Lastly, he calls God an <hi>Essence.</hi> If he mean by <hi>Essence</hi> the same with <hi>Ens,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) I approve it. Otherwise, what is <hi>Essence?</hi> There is no such word in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Hebrew Language, which has no word answerable to the copulative <hi>est,</hi> will not bear it. The New Testament hath <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but never for <hi>Essence,</hi> nor for <hi>Substance,</hi> but only for <hi>Riches.</hi> I come now to his Argument in Mood and Figure, which is this, <hi>The Divine Substance is indivisible.</hi> That's the <hi>Major. Eternity is the Divine Substance.</hi> That's the <hi>Minor. Ergo,</hi> the Divine Substance is indivisible. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, he says, is evident, because God is <hi>Actus simplicissimus.</hi> The Minor is confessed,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56428:192"/>
he thinks, by all men, because whatsoever is attributed to God, is God. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that the Major was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evident, that <hi>Actus Simplicissimus</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, and that the Minor was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by no man. First, what is <hi>Actus</hi> in the <hi>Major?</hi> does any man understand <hi>Actus</hi> for a Substance, that is, for a thing subsisting by it self? Is not <hi>Actus</hi> in English, either an <hi>Act,</hi> or an <hi>Action,</hi> or nothing? or is any of these <hi>Substances</hi>? If it be evident, why did he not explain <hi>Actus</hi> by a definition? And as to the Minor, though all men in the world understand that the <hi>Eternal</hi> is God, yet no man can understand that the <hi>Eternity</hi> is God. Perhaps he and the School-men mean by <hi>Actus,</hi> the same that they do by <hi>Essentia.</hi> What is the <hi>Essence</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> but his <hi>Humanity?</hi> or of <hi>God,</hi> but his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi>; of <hi>Great,</hi> but <hi>Greatness</hi>; and so of all other denominating Attributes? And the words God and Deity, are of different sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. <hi>Damascene</hi> a Father of the Church expounding the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies plainly that the <hi>Deity</hi> was incarnate, but all true Christians hold that God was incarnate. Therefore <hi>God</hi> and the Deity, signifie divers things; and therefore <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> are not the same, no more than a wise man and his wisdom are the same. Nor God and his justice the same
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56428:193"/>
thing, and universally 'tis false, that the Attribute in the Abstract is the same with the Substance, to which it is attributed. Also it is universally true of God, that the Attribute in the Concrete, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to which it is attributed, is not the same thing. I come now to his next Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or Paragraph, wherein he would fain prove, that by denying Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, I take away Gods Existence. The words he cites here are mine; <hi>To say an Angel or Spirit is an Incorporeal Substance, is to say in effect there is no Angel nor Spirit at all.</hi> It is true also, that to say that God is an Incorporeal Substance, is to say in effect there is no God at all. What al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges he against it, but the School-Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which I have already answered? Scripture he can bring none, because the word Incorporeal is not found in Scripture. But the Bishop trusting to his Aristotelean and Scholastick Learning hath hitherto made no use of Scripture, save only of these Texts, <hi>Who hath planted a Vineyard, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of the fruit thereof; or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honour, and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they were created</hi>; thereby to prove that the right of God to govern and punish mankind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56428:193"/>
is not derived from his Omnipotence. Let us now see how he proves Incorporeity by his own Reason without Scripture. <hi>Either God</hi> (he saith) <hi>is Incorporeal or Finite.</hi> He knows I deny both, and say he is <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> against which he offers no proof, but only (according to his custom of disputing) calls it the root of Atheism; and interrogates me, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing is left in the world, if God be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, but Body and Accidents? I say there is nothing left but Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For I have denyed (as he knew) that there is any reality in accidents; and nevertheless maintain Gods Existence, and that he is a most pure, and most simple Corporeal Spirit. Here his Lordship catching nothing, removes to the eternity of the Trinity, which these my grounds (he says) destroy. How so? I say the Trinity, and the Persons thereof are that one pure, simple, and eternal Corporeal Spirit; and why does this destroy the Trinity, more than if I had called it Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal? He labours here and seeketh some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to refresh himself in the word <hi>Person,</hi> by the same grounds (he saith) every King has as many Persons as there be Justices of Peace in his Kingdom, and God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath as many Persons as there be Kings, why not? For I never said that all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56428:194"/>
those Kings were that God; and yet God giveth that name to the Kings of the earth. For the signification of the word <hi>Person,</hi> I shall expound it by and by in another place. Here ends his Lordships School Argument; now let me come with my Scripture Argument. St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning Christ, (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.) saith thus, <hi>In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead Bodily.</hi> This place <hi>Athanasius</hi> a great and zealous Doctor in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, and vehement ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Arius</hi> the Heretick, who allowed Christ to be no otherwise God, then as men of excellent piety were so called, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth thus. The fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in him Bodily (Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>id est <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, id est, Realiter.</hi> So there is one Father for Corporality, and that God was in Christ in such manner as Body is in Body. Again, there were in the primitive Church a sort of Hereticks who maintained that Jesus Christ had not a true real Body, but was onely a Phantasm or Spright, such as the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Spectra.</hi> Against the head of this Sect (whose name I think was <hi>Apelles) Tertullian</hi> wrote a Book, now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant amongst his other Works, intituled <hi>De Carne Christi,</hi> wherein after he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the nature of Phantasms, and shewed that they had nothing of reality in them, he concludeth with these words,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56428:194"/>
whatsoever is not <hi>Body,</hi> is <hi>Nothing.</hi> So here is on my side a plain Text of Scripture, and two ancient and learned Fathers, nor was this Doctrine of <hi>Tertullian</hi> condemned in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; but the division of the Divine Substance into God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost. For these words, <hi>God has no parts,</hi> were added, for explication of the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> at the request of the dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fathers, and are farther explained both in <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed, in these words, <hi>not three Gods but one God,</hi> and by the constant Attribute ever since of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> Trinity. The same words never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless do condemn the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> also: For though there appeared no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that professed that God had an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Body, and consequently that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were three Individuals, yet the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were all <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> and there condemned by those words, <hi>God has no parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have answered his accusation concerning the Eternity and Existence of the Divine Substance, and made appear that in truth, the question between us, is whether God be a Phantasme (<hi>id est,</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol of the Fancy, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) or a Corporeal Spirit, that is to say, something that has Magnitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56428:195"/>In this place I think it not amiss, leaving for a little while this Theological dispute, to examine the signification of those words which have occasioned so much diversity of opinion in this kind of Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Substance,</hi> in Greek <hi>Hypostasis, Hypostan, Hypostamenon</hi> signifie the same thing, namely, a Ground, a Base, any thing that has Existence or Subsistence <hi>in it self,</hi> any thing that upholdeth that which else would fall, in which sence God is properly the Hypostasis, Base, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that upholdeth all the world, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subsistence not only <hi>in himself,</hi> but <hi>from himself</hi>; whereas other Substances have their subsistence only in themselves, not from themselves. But Metaphorically, Faith is called a Substance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the foundation or Base of our Hope; for Faith failing our Hope falls. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having boasted of the liberal promise of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> calls that promise the ground, the Hypostasis of that his boasting. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Christ is called the Image of the Substance (the Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis) of his Father, and for the proper and adequate signification of the word Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis, the Greek Fathers did always oppose it to Apparition or Phantasme; as when a man seeth his face in the water, his real
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56428:195"/>
face is called the Hypostasis of the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick face in the water. So also in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the thing understood or named, is called Hypostasis, in respect of the name, so also a Body coloured is the Hypostasis, Substance and Subject of the colour; and in like manner of all its other Accidents. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and all other abstract names are words artificial belonging to the Art of Logick, and signifies only the manner how we consider the Substance it self. And of this I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sufficiently in <hi>Pag.</hi> 371.372. of my <hi>Leviathan. Body [Lat.] Corpus [Grae.]</hi>

Pure</hi> and <hi>Simple Body,</hi> is Body of one and the same kind, in every part throughout, and if mingled with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of another kind, though the total be compounded or mixt, the parts neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less retain their simplicity, as when water and wine are mixt, the parts of both kinds retain their simplicity. For water and wine cannot both be in one and the same place at once.</p>

                        <hi>Matter</hi> is the same with <hi>Body</hi>; But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without respect to a Body which is made thereof. <hi>Form</hi> is the aggregate of

                     <p>I have seen, and so have many more two waters, one of the River, the other a Mineral Water, so like, that no man could discern the one from the other by his sight; yet when they have been both put together, the whole substance could not by the eye be distinguished from milk. Yet we know that the one was not mixt with the other, so as every part of the one to be in every part of the other, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, unless two Bodies can be in the the same place. How then could the change be made in every part, but only by the Activity of the Mineral water, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it every where to the Sense, and yet not being every where and in every part of the water? If then such gross Bodies have so great Activity, what shall we think of Spirits, whose kinds be as many as there be kinds of Liquor, and Activity greater? Can it then be doubted, but that God, who is an infinitely fine Spirit and withall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56428:196"/>
intelligent, can make and change all species and kinds of Body as he pleaseth; but I dare not say, that this is the way by which God Almighty worketh, because it is past my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, yet it serves very well to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that the Omnipotence of God impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no contradiction; and is better than by pretence of magnifying the fineness of the divine Substance, to reduce it to a Spright or Phantasm, which is Nothing.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Person,</hi> [Lat.] <hi>Persona,</hi> signifies an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Substance, that acteth any thing in his own or anothers Name, or by his own or anothers Authority. Of this Definition there can be no other proof than from the use of that word, in such Latin Authors as were esteem'd the most skilful in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of which number was <hi>Cicero.</hi> But <hi>Cicero,</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Atticus,</hi> saith thus, <hi>Vnus sustineo tres Personas, Mei, Adversarii, &amp; Judicis:</hi> That is, I that am but one man, sustain three Persons; mine own Person, the Person of my Adversary, and the Person of the Judge. <hi>Cicero</hi> was here the Substance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, one man; and because he pleaded for himself, he calls himself, his own Person; and again, because he pleaded for his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, he says, he sustained the Person of his Adversary; and lastly, because he himself gave the Sentence, he says, he sustained the Person of the Judge. In the same sence we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56428:197"/>
use the word in English vulgarly, calling him that acteth by his own Authority, his own Person, and him that acteth by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of another, the Person of that other. And thus we have the exact meaning of the word <hi>Person.</hi> The Greek Tongue cannot render it; for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is properly a Face, and Metaphorically, a Vizard of an Actor upon the Stage. How then did the Greek Fathers render the word <hi>Person,</hi> as it is in the blessed Trinity? Not well. Instead of the word <hi>Person</hi> they put <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Substance, from whence it might be inferr'd, that the three Persons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are three divine Substances, that is, three Gods. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, they could not use, because Face and Vizard are neither of them honourable Attributes of God, nor explicative of the meaning of the Greek Church. Therefore the Latin (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the English) Church renders <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis</hi> every where in <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed by <hi>Person.</hi> But the word <hi>Hypostatical Vnion</hi> is rightly retained and used by Divines, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Union of two Hypostases, that is, of two Substances or Natures in the Person of Christ. But seeing they also hold the Soul of our Saviour to be a Substance, which though separated from his Body, subsisted neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in it self, and consequently before it was separated from his Body upon the Cross,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56428:197"/>
was a distinct Nature from his Body, how will they avoid this Objection, That then Christ had three Natures, three Hypostases, without granting, that <hi>his Resurrection was a new vivification, and not a return of his Soul out of Heaven into the Grave?</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is not determined by the Church. Thus far in explication of the words that occur in this Controversie. Now I return again to his Lordship's Discourse.</p>

By Corporeal I mean a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that has Magnitude, and so mean all learned men, Divines and others, though perhaps there be some common people so rude as to call nothing Body, but what they can see and feel. To his second Question, What real Being he can have amongst Bodies and Accidents, I answer, The Being of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not of a Spright. If I should ask any the most subtil Distinguisher, what middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there were between an infinitely subtil Substance, and a meer Thought or Phantasm, by what Name could he call it? He might
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56428:198"/>
call it perhaps an Incorporeal Substance, and so <hi>Incorporeal</hi> shall pass for a middle nature between <hi>Infinitely subtil</hi> and <hi>Nothing,</hi> and be less subtil than Infinitely subtil, and yet more subtil than a thought. 'Tis granted (he says) that the Nature of God is incomprehensible. Doth it therefore follow, that we may give to the divine Substance what negative Name we please? Because he says, the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Substance is here and there and every where throughout the World, and that the Soul of a man is here and there and every where throughout man's Body, must we therefore take it for a Mystery of Christian Religion, upon his or any Schoolman's word, without the Scripture, which calls nothing a Mystery but the Incarnation of the eternal God? Or is Incorporeal a Mystery, when not at all mentioned in the Bible, but to the contrary 'tis written, <hi>That the fulness of the Deity was bodily in Christ?</hi> When the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing is incomprehensible, I can acquiesce in the Scripture, but when the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of words are incomprehensible, I cannot acquiesce in the Authority of a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

                     <p>We have seen what his Principles are concerning the Deity, they are full as bad or worse concerning the Trinity. Hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>A person is he that is represented as often as he is represented. And therefore God who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56428:199"/>
has been represented, that is, personated thrice, may properly enough be said to be three Persons, though neither the word Person nor Trinity be ascribed to him in the Bible.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>To conclude, the doctrine of the Trinity as far as can be gathered directly from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is in substance this, that the God who is always one and the same, was the Person repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by Moses, the Person represented by his Son incarnate, and the Person represented by the Apostles. As represented by the Apostles, the holy Spirit by which they spake is God. As represented by his Son that was God and Man, the Son is that God. As represented by Moses, and the High Priests, the Father, that is to say, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is that God. From whence we may gather the reason why those Names, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the signification of the Godhead, are never used in the Old Testament. For they are Persons, that is, they have their Names from representing, which could not be, till divers Persons had represented God, in ruling or in directing under him.</hi>

What
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56428:199"/>
is now become of the great adorable Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the blessed undivided Trinity? It is shrunk into nothing? Upon his grounds there was a time when there was no Trinity. And we must blot these words out of our Creed, <hi>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal.</hi> And these other words out of our Bibles, <hi>Let us make man after our Image.</hi> Unless we mean that this was a consultation of God with <hi>Moses</hi> and the Apostles. What is now become of the eternal generation of the Son of God, if this Sonship did not begin until about 4000 years after the Creation were expired? Upon these grounds every King hath as many <hi>Persons,</hi> as there be Justices of Peace, and petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables in his Kingdom. Upon this account God Almighty hath as many <hi>Persons,</hi> as there have been Soveraign Princes in the World since <hi>Adam.</hi> According to this reckoning each one of us like so many <hi>Geryons,</hi> may have as many <hi>Persons</hi> as we please to make Procurations. Such bold presumption requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth another manner of confutation.</p>

                     <p>As for the words recited, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess there is a fault in the Ratiocination, which nevertheless his Lordship hath not discovered, but no Impiety. All that he objecteth is, That it followeth hereupon, that there be as many Persons of a King, as there be petty Constables in his Kingdom. And so there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56428:200"/>
are, or else he cannot be obeyed. But I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said that a King, and every one of his Persons are the same Substance. The fault I here made, and saw not was this; I was to prove, That it is no contradiction (as <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and Heathen Scoffers would have it) to say of God, he was One and Three. I saw the true definition of the word <hi>Person</hi> would serve my turn in this manner; God in his own Person both created the World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a Church in <hi>Israel,</hi> using therein the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi>; the same God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Son God and Man redeemed the same World, and the same Church; the same God in the Person of the Holy Ghost sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the same Church, and all the faithful men in the World. Is not this a clear proof, that it is no contradiction to say that God is three Persons and one Substance? And doth not the Church distinguish the Persons in the same manner? See the words of our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism. Quest. <hi>What dost thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy Belief? Answ.</hi> First, I learn to believe in God the Father, that hath made me and all the World; Secondly, In God the Son, who hath redeemed me and all Mankind; Thirdly, In God the Holy Ghost, that hath sanctified me and all the elect people of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at what time was the Church sanctified? Was it not on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> in the descending of the Holy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56428:200"/>
Ghost upon the Apostles? His Lordship all this while hath catched nothing. 'Tis I that catched my self, for saying, (instead of, <hi>By the Ministry of Moses</hi>) in the Person of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But this Error I no sooner saw, then I no less publickly corrected then I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, in my <hi>Leviathan</hi> converted into Latin, which by this time I think is printed beyond the Seas with this alteration, and also with the omission of some such passages as Strangers are not concerned in. And I had corrected this Error sooner, if I had sooner found it. For though I was told by Dr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> that the place above-cited was not applicable enough to the Doctrine of the Trinity, yet I could not in reviewing the same espy the defect till of late, when being sollicited from beyond Sea to translate the Book into Latin, and fearing some other man might do it not to my liking, I examined this passage and others of the like sence more narrowly. But how concludes his Lordship out of this, that I put out of the Creed these words, <hi>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Ghost eternal?</hi> Or these words, <hi>Let us make man after our Image,</hi> out of the Bible. Which last words neither I nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> put out of the Bible, but we both put them out of the number of good Arguments to prove the Trinity; for it is no unusual thing in the Hebrew, as may be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56428:201"/>
seen by <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s quotations, to joyn a Noun of the plural Number with a Verb of the singular. And we may say also of many other Texts of Scripture alledged to prove the Trinity, that they are not so firm as that high Article requireth. But mark his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Scholastick charity in the last words of this period, <hi>Such bold presumption requireth another manner of confutation.</hi> This Bishop, and others of his opinion had been in their Element, if they had been Bishops in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>

                     <p>Concerning God the Son, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what he had said elsewhere, where he calleth him <hi>God and Man,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God incarnate,</hi> he doubteth not to say, that <hi>the word</hi> Hypostatical <hi>is canting.</hi> As if the same Person could be both God and Man without a Personal, that is, an Hypostatical Union of the two Natures of God and Man.</p>

                     <p>If Christian Profession be (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is in <hi>England</hi>) a Law, and if it be of the nature of a Law to be made known to all men that are to obey it, in such manner as they may have no excuse for disobedience from their ignorance, then without doubt all words unknown to the people, and as to them insignificant, are Canting. The word <hi>Substance</hi> is understood by the Vulgar well enough, when it is said of a Body, but in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56428:201"/>
other sence not at all, except for their Riches. But the word <hi>Hypostatical</hi> is understood only by those, and but few of those that are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Greek Tongue, and is properly used, as I have said before, of the Union of the two Natures of Christ in one Person. So likewise <hi>Consubstantial</hi> in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, is properly said of the Trinity. But to an <hi>English</hi> man that understands neither Greek nor Latin, and yet is as much concerned as his Lordship was, the word <hi>Hypostatical</hi> is no less Canting than <hi>Eternal now.</hi>

                     <p>I allow it in some Cases, and to some men, which his Lordship knew well enough, but would not mention. I alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for it, in the place cited, both Reason and Scripture, though his Lordship thought it not expedient to take notice of either. If it be true that I have said, why does he blame it? If false, why offers he no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against it, neither from Scripture nor from Reason? Or why does he not show that the Text I cite is not applicable to the Question, or not well interpreted by me. First, He barely cites it, because he thought the words would sound harshly, and make a Reader admire them for Impiety. But I hope I shall so well instruct my Reader ere I leave
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56428:202"/>
this place, that this his petty Art will have no effect. Secondly, The Cause why he omitted my Arguments was, That he could not answer them. Lastly, The Cause why he urgeth neither Scripture nor Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it was, That he saw none sufficient. My Argument from Scripture was this, (<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> pag. 271.) taken out of 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17. where <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> saith to <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other Gods, but unto the Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my self in the house of Rimmon: when I bow my self in the house of Rimmon, the Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy servant in this thing, and he said unto him, Go in peace.</hi> What can be said to this? Did not <hi>Elisha</hi> say it from God? Or is not this Answer of the Prophet a permission? When St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> commanded the <hi>Christians</hi> of their time to obey their Princes, which then were Heathens and Enemies of Christ, did they mean they should lose their Lives for disobedience? Did they not rather mean they should preserve both their Lives and their Faith, (believing in Christ as they did) by this denial of the tongue, having no command to the contrary? If in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a <hi>Mahometan</hi> should be made by terror
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56428:202"/>
to deny <hi>Mahomet</hi> and go to Church with us, would any man condemn this <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>? A denyal with the mouth may perhaps be prejudicial to the power of the Church, but to retain the Faith of Christ stedfastly in his Heart, cannot be prejudicial to his Soul that hath undertaken no charge to Preach to Wolves, whom they know will destroy them. About the time of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> there was a Canon made (which is extant in the History of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) concerning those that being Christians had been seduced, not terrified, to a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Christ, and again repenting, desired to be readmitted into the Church; in which Canon it was ordain'd that those men should be no otherwise readmitted than to be in the number of the Catechised, and not to be admitted to the Communion till a great many years penitence. Surely the Church then would have been more merciful to them that did the same upon terror of present death and torments.</p>
                     <p>Let us now see what his Lordship might, though but colourably, have alledged from Scripture against it. There be three Places only that seem to favour his Lordship's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The first is where <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Christ, and Weepeth. The second is, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.29. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>and the other Apostles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said, we ought to obey God rather
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56428:203"/>
than men.</hi> The third is, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.9. <hi>But he that denyeth me, shall be denyed before the Angels of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>T. H.</speaker>
                     <p>For answer to these Texts, I must repeat what I have written, and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship read in my <hi>Leviathan,</hi> pag. 362. <hi>For an unlearned man that is in the power of an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous King, or State, if commanded on pain of Death to worship before an Idol, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he detesteth the Idol in his Heart, he doth well; though if he had the fortitude to suffer Death, rather than worship it, he should do better. But if a Pastor, who as Christ's Messenger has undertaken to teach Christ's Doctrine to all Nations should do the same, it were not only a sinful Scandal in respect of other Christian Mens Consciences, but a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious forsaking of his Charge.</hi> In which words I distinguish between a Pastor and one of the Sheep of his Flock. St. <hi>Peter</hi> sinned in denying Christ; and so does every Pastor that having undertaken the Charge of Preaching the Gospel in the Kingdom of an Infidel, where he could expect at the undertaking of his Charge no less than Death. And why, but because he violates his Trust in doing contrary to his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was an Apostle of Christ, and bound by his voluntary undertaking of that Office, not only to Confess Christ, but also to Preach him before those Infidels whom he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56428:203"/>
knew would (like Wolves) devour him. And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles were forbidden to preach Christ they gave this Answer, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Men.</hi> And it was to his Disciples only which had undertaken that Office, that Christ saith, <hi>he that denyeth me before Men, shall be denyed before the Angels of God.</hi> And so I think I have sufficiently answered this place, and shewed that I do not allow the denying of Christ, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colour of Torments, to his Lordship, nor to any other that has undertaken the Office of a Preacher. Which if he think right, he will perhaps in this case put himself into the number of those whom he calls merciful Doctors, whereas now he extends his seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beyond the bounds of common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He has read <hi>Cicero,</hi> and perhaps this Story in him. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> would have sent <hi>Cicero</hi> to treat of Peace with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antonius,</hi> but when <hi>Cicero</hi> had shewed them the just fear he had of being killed by him, he was excused; and if they had forced him to it, and he by terror turned Enemy to them, he had in equity been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable. But his Lordship I believe did write this more valiantly than he would have acted it.</p>

                     <p>How do I take away Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office? He neither draws it by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from my Words, nor offers any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at all against my Doctrine. The words he cites are in the Contents of <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>de Cive.</hi> In the Body of the Chapter it is thus. The time of Christ's being upon the Earth is called in Scripture the <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> often, but the <hi>Kingdom</hi> never. <hi>When the Son of God comes in Majesty, and all the Angels with him, then he shall sit on the seat of Majesty. My Kingdom is not of this World. God sent not his Son that he should Judge the World. I came not to Judge the World, but to save the World. Man, who made me a Judge or Divider amongst you? Let thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come.</hi> And other words to the same purpose; out of which it is clear that Christ took upon him no Regal Power upon Earth before his Assumption. But at his Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption his Apostles asked him if he would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56428:204"/>
then restore the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> and he Answered, it was not for them to know. So that hitherto Christ had not taken that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon him, unless his Lordship think that the Kingdom of God, and the Kingdom of Christ be two distinct Kingdoms. From the Assumption ever since, all true Christians say daily in their Prayers, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> But his Lordship had perhaps forgot that. But when then beginneth Christ to be a King? I say it shall be then when he comes again in Majesty with all the Angels. And even then he shall Reign (as he is Man) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Father. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>He must Raign till he hath put all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies under his feet; the last Enemy that shall be destroyed is Death.</hi> But when shall God the Father Raign again? St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the same <hi>Chapter verse</hi> 28. <hi>When all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> And <hi>verse</hi> 24. <hi>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father; when he shall have put down all Rule, Authority and Power.</hi> This is at the Resurrection. And by this it is manifest, that his Lordship was not so well versed in Scripture, as he ought to have been.</p>

                     <p>And touching the Prophetical Office of Christ, I do much doubt whether he do believe in earnest, that there is any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56428:205"/>
such thing as Prophecy in the World. He maketh very little difference between a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>Mad-man,</hi> and <hi>a Demoniack. And if there were nothing else</hi> (says he) <hi>that bewrayed their madness, yet that very arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such inspiration to themselves, is Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough.</hi> He maketh the pretence of Inspiration in any man to be, and always to have been, <hi>on opinion pernicious to Peace, and tending to the dissolution of all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> He subjecteth all Prophetical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from God, to the sole Pleasure and Censure of the Soveraign Prince, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Authorize them, or to Exauctorate them. So as two Prophets prophecying the same thing at the same time, in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of two different Princes, the one shall be a true Prophet, the other a false. And Christ who had the approbation of no Soveraign Prince, upon his grounds, was to be reputed a false Prophet every where. <hi>Every man therefore ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who is the Soveraign Prophet, that is to say, who it is that is Gods Vicegerent upon Earth, and hath next under God the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of governing Christian Men, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve for a Rule that Doctrine which in the Name of God he hath Commanded to be taught, and thereby to examine and try out the truth of those Doctrines which pretended Prophets, with miracle, or without, shall at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56428:206"/>
time advance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if he disavow them then no more to obey their Voice; or if he Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, then to obey them as Men, to whom God hath given a part of the Spirit of their Soveraign.</hi> Upon his Principles the case holdeth as well among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> as <hi>Christians.</hi> Then he that Teacheth Transubstantiation in <hi>France,</hi> is a true Prophet; he that Teacheth it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a false Prophet. He that Blasphemeth Christ in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a true Prophet; he that doth the same in <hi>Italy,</hi> a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Then <hi>Samuel</hi> was a false Prophet to Contest with <hi>Saul</hi> a Soveraign Prophet: So was the Man of God who submitted not to the more Divine and Prophetick Spirit of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> And <hi>Elijah</hi> for Reproving <hi>Ahab.</hi> Then <hi>Michaiah</hi> had but his deserts, to be clapt up in Prison, and fed with Bread of Affliction, and Water of Affliction, for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Contradict <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Vice-gerent upon Earth.</hi> And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was justly thrown into a Dungeon, for Prophecying against <hi>Zedekiah</hi> his Liege Lord. If his Principles were true, it were strange indeed, that none of all these Princes, nor any other that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the World, should understand their own Priviledges. And yet more strange, that God Almighty should take the part of such Rebellious Prophets, and justifie their Prophesies by the Event, if it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56428:206"/>
were true that <hi>none but the Soveraign in a Christian</hi> (the Reason is the same for <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish) Commonwealth can take notice, what is or what is not the Word of God.</hi>

                     <p>To remove his Lordships doubt in the first place, I confess there was true Prophesie and true Prophets in the Church of God, from <hi>Abraham</hi> down to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the greatest Prophet of all, and the last of the Old Testament, and first of the New. After our Saviour's time, till the Death of St. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, there were true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Church of Christ, Prophets to whom God spake Supernaturally, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified the truth of their Mission by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Of those that in the Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prophets without Miracles, and for this cause only, that they spake in the Name of God to Men, and in the name of Men to God, there are, have been, and shall be in the Church Innumerable. Such a Prophet was his Lordship, and such are all Pastors in the Christian Church. But the Question here is of those Prophets that from the Mouth of God foretell things Future, or do other Miracle. Of this kind I deny there has been any since the Death of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist. If any Man find fault with this, he ought to Name some Man or other whom we are bound to acknowledge that they have done a Miracle, cast out a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56428:207"/>
or cured any Disease by the sole Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Divine Majesty. We are not bound to trust to the Legend of the <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, nor to the History written by <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> of the Life of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> or to any other Fables of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, nor to such things as were pretended to be done by some Divines here in the time of King <hi>James.</hi> Secondly, he says I make little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>Mad-man,</hi> or <hi>Demoniack</hi>; To which I say he accuses me falsly. I say only thus much, <hi>That I see nothing at all in the Scripture that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a belief, that Demoniacks were any other thing than Madmen.</hi> And this is also made very probable out of Scripture by a worthy Divine Mr. <hi>Meade.</hi> But concerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, I say only that the <hi>Jews</hi> both under the Old Testament and under the New, took them to be all one with <hi>Mad-men</hi> and <hi>Demoniacks.</hi> And prove it out of Scripture by many places both of the Old and New Testament. Thirdly, that the pretence or arrogating to ones self Divine Inspiration, is argument enough to shew a Man is <hi>Mad,</hi> is my opinion; but his Lordship understands not <hi>Inspiration</hi> in the same sence that I do. He understands it properly of God's breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Man, or pouring into him the Divine Substance, or Divine Graces, and in that sence, he that arrogateth Inspiration
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56428:207"/>
into himself, neither understands what he saith, nor makes others to understand him, which is properly Madness in some degree. But I understand <hi>Inspiration</hi> in the Scripture Metaphorically, for Gods guidance of our minds to Truth and Piety. Fourthly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he says, I make the pretence of <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be pernicious to Peace. I answer, that I think his Lordship was of my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he called those Men which in the late Civil War pretended the Spirit, and New Light, and to be the only faithful men <hi>Phanaticks</hi>; for he called them in his Book, and did call them in his Life time <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> And what is a <hi>Phanatick</hi> but a <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and what can be more pernicious to Peace than the Revelations that were by these <hi>Phanaticks</hi> pretended? I do not say there were Doctrines of other Men, not called <hi>Phanaticks</hi> as pernicious to Peace, as theirs were, and in great part a cause of those troubles. Fifthly, from that I make Prophetical Revelations subject to the examination of the Lawful Soveraign, he inferreth, that two Prophets prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same thing at the same time, in the Dominions of two different Princes, the one shall be a true Prophet, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a false. This consequence is not good, for seeing they teach different Doctrines, they cannot both of them confirm their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56428:208"/>
Doctrine with Miracles. But this I prove (in the <hi>page</hi> 232 he citeth) that, whether either of their Doctrines shall be Taught Publickly or not, 'tis in the power of the Soveraign of the Place only to determine. Nay, I say now further, if a Prophet come to any private Man in the Name of God, that Man shall be Judge whether he be a true Prophet or not, before he obey him. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. Sixthly, whereas he says, that upon my grounds Christ was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a false Prophet every where, because his Doctrine was received no where. His Lordship had Read my Book more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently than was fit for one that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it. My ground is this, that Christ in right of his Father was King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and consequently Supream Prophet, and Judge of all Prophets. What other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thought of his Prophesies, is nothing to the purpose. I never said that Princes can make Doctrines or Prophesies true or false, but I say every Soveraign Prince has a right to prohibite the publick Teaching of them, whether false or true. But what an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight is it in a Divine to say, that Christ had the Approbation of no Soveraign Prince, when he had the Approbation of God, who was King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Christ his Vice-Roy, and the whole Scripture Written (<hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31.) to prove it? When his Miracles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56428:208"/>
it; when <hi>Pilate</hi> confessed it; and when the Apostles Office was to Proclaim it? Seventhly, If we must not consider in points of Christian Faith who is the Soveraign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that is, who is next under Christ our Supream Head and Governor, I wish his Lordship would have cleared, ere he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, these few Questions, Is there not need of some Judge of Controverted Doctrines? I think no man can deny it, that has seen the Rebellion that followed the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie here between <hi>Gomar</hi> and <hi>Arminius.</hi> There must therefore be a Judge of Doctrines. But (says the Bishop) not the King. Who then? Shall Dr. <hi>Bramhall</hi> be this Judge? As profitable an Office as it is, he was more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest than to say that. Shall a private Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have it? No man ever thought that. Shall it be given to a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Minister? No; 'tis unreasonable. Shall a Synod of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have it? No; For most of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Primitive Church were undoubtedly subordinate to Bishops, and the rest were Bishops. Who then? A Synod of Bishops? Very well. His Lordship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too Modest to undertake the whole Power, would have been contented with the six and twentieth part. But suppose it in a Synod of Bishops, who shall call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The King. What if he will not? Who should Excommunicate him, or if he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56428:209"/>
despise your Excommunication, who shall send forth a Writ of <hi>Significavit</hi>? No; all this was far from his Lordships thoughts. The power of the Clergy, unless it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held legally by the King, or illegally by the Multitude amounts to nothing. But for the Multitude, <hi>Suarez</hi> and the School-men will never gain them, because they are not understood. Besides there be very few Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that can act a Sermon (which is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant part of <hi>Rhetorick</hi>) So well as divers <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Preachers can do. I conclude therefore, that his Lordship could not possibly believe that the Supream Judicature in matter of Religion could any where be so well placed as in the Head of the Church, which is the King. And so his Lordship and I think the same thing; but because his Lordship knew not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, he was angry with me because I did it. He says further that <hi>by my Principles, he that blasphemeth Christ at</hi> Constantinople <hi>is a true Prophet,</hi> as if a man that blasphemeth Christ, to approve his Blasphemy can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Miracle; for by my principles no Man is a Prophet whose Prophesie is not confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God with a Miracle. In the last place out of this, That the lawful Soveraign is the Judge of Prophesie, he deduces That then <hi>Samuel</hi> and other Prophets were false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that contested with their Soveraigns.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56428:209"/>
As for <hi>Samuel</hi> he was at that time the Judge, that is to say the Soveraign Prince in <hi>Israel,</hi> and so acknowledged by <hi>Saul.</hi> For <hi>Saul</hi> received the Kingdom (from God himself, who had right to give and take it) by the hands of <hi>Samuel.</hi> And God gave it him to himself only, and not to his Seed; though if he had obeyed God, he would have setled it also upon his Seed. The Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God was, that he should not spare <hi>Agag. Saul</hi> obeyed not. God therefore sent <hi>Samuel</hi> to tell him that he was rejected. For all this <hi>Samuel</hi> went not about to resist <hi>Saul.</hi> That he caused <hi>Agag</hi> to be slain, was with <hi>Sauls</hi> consent. Lastly, <hi>Saul</hi> confesses his sin. Where is this contesting with <hi>Saul</hi>? After this God sent <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint <hi>David,</hi> not that he should depose <hi>Saul,</hi> but succeed him, the Sons of <hi>Saul</hi> having never had a right of Succession. Nor did ever <hi>David</hi> make War on <hi>Saul,</hi> or so much as resist him, but fled from his persecution. But when <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, then indeed he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his right against the House of <hi>Saul.</hi> What Rebellion or Resistance could his Lordship find here, either in <hi>Samuel</hi> or in <hi>David</hi>? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all these Transactions are supernatural, and oblige not to imitation. Is there any Prophet or Priest now that can set up in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> another King by pretence of Prophesie or Religion? What
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56428:210"/>
did <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to the man of God 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13) that Prophesied against the Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> without first doing a Miracle, but offer to seize him for speaking (as he thought) rashly of the Kings Act; and after the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous withering of his Hand, desire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to pray for him? The sin of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was not his distrust of the Prophet, but his Idolatry. He was the sole Judge of the truth which the man of God uttered against the Altar, and the process agreeable to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. What is the story of <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.) but a confirmation of the Right, even of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be the Judge of Prophesie? <hi>Eliah</hi> told <hi>Ahab,</hi> he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed the Commandement of God. So may any Minister now tell his Soveraign, so he do it with sincerity and discretion. <hi>Ahab</hi> told <hi>Eliah</hi> he troubled <hi>Israel.</hi> Upon this controversie <hi>Eliah</hi> desired Tryal. Send, saith he, and Assemble all <hi>Israel</hi>; Assemble also the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> four hundred and fifty. <hi>Ahab</hi> did so. The Question is stated before the People thus, If the Lord be God, follow him; but if <hi>Baal</hi> follow him. Then upon the Altars of God and <hi>Baal</hi> were laid the Wood and the Bullocks; and the cause was to be Judged by Fire from Heaven, to Burn the Sacrifices; which <hi>Eliah</hi> procured, the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> could not procure. Was not this cause here Pleaded before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56428:210"/>
The Sentence of <hi>Ahab</hi> is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for <hi>Eliah</hi> from that time forward was no more persecuted by <hi>Ahab,</hi> but only by his Wife <hi>Jezabel.</hi> The story of <hi>Micaiah</hi> (2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 18.) is this, <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted the Prophets, four hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether he should prosper or not, in case he went with <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> to fight against the <hi>Syrians</hi> at <hi>Ramoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilead.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> was also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and both the Kings <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> sat together to hear what they should prophecy. There was no Miracle done. The 400 pronounced Victory, <hi>Micaiah</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the contrary. The King was Judge, and most concern'd in the event; nor had he received any Revelation in the business. What could he do more discreetly than to follow the Counsel of 400 rather than of one Man? But the event was contrary; for he was slain; but not for following the Counsel of the 400, but for his Murder of <hi>Naboth</hi> and his Idolatry. It was also a sin in him, that he afflicted <hi>Micaiah</hi> in Prison; but an unjust Judgment does not take away from any King his right of Judicature. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what's all this, or that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which he cites last, to the Question of who is Judge of Christian Doctrine?</p>

                     <p>Neither doth he use God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, more favourably than God the Son. Where St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit; He saith, <hi>By the Spirit, is meant the Voice of God in a Dream or Vision Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> which Dreams or Visions, he maketh to be no more than <hi>imaginations which they had in their sleep, or in an extasie, which in every true Prophet were Supernatural, but in false Prophets were either natural or feigned,</hi> and more likely to be false than true. To say <hi>God hath spoken to him in a Dream, is no more than to say, he dreamed that God spake to him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To say he hath seen a Vision or heard a Voice, is to say, That he hath dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between sleeping and waking.</hi> So St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Holy Ghost is come to be their own imaginations, which might be either feigned, or mistaken, or true. As if the Holy Ghost did enter only at their eyes, and at their ears, not into their understandings, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their minds; Or as if the Holy Ghost did not seal unto their hearts the truth and assurance of their Prophesies. Whether a new light be infused into their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or new graces be inspired into their heart, they are wrought, or caused, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted immediately by the Holy Ghost, And so are his <hi>imaginations,</hi> if they be Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>

His conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are not deduced. I never said that the Holy Ghost was an Imagination, or a Dream, or a Vision, but that the Holy Ghost spake most often in the Scripture by Dreams and Visions supernatural. The next words of his, <hi>As if the Holy Ghost did enter only at their eyes, and at their ears, not into their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, nor into their minds,</hi> I let pass, because I cannot understand them.

                     <p>But he must needs fall into these absurdities, who maketh but a jest of inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>They who pretend Divine inspiration to be a supernatural entring of the Holy Ghost into a Man, are (as he thinks) in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Dilemma; for if they worship not the Men whom they conceive to be inspired, they fall into impiety; and if they worship them, they commit Idolatry.</hi> So mistaking the Holy Ghost to be corporeal, some thing that is blown into a Man, and the Graces of the Holy Ghost to be corporeal Graces. And <hi>the words, inpoured or infused virtue, and, inblown or inspired virtue, are as absurd and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, as a round Quadrangle.</hi> He reckons it

                     <p>The word <hi>Holy</hi> I had defined in the words which his Lordship here sets down, and by the use thereof in the Scripture made it manifest, That that was the true significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word. There is nothing in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more difficult than to determine the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of words. That difficulty excuses him. He says that <hi>Holiness</hi> (in my sence) is a Relation, not a Quality. All the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agree that Quality is an Accident, so that in attributing to God <hi>Holiness</hi> (as a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) he contradicts himself; for he has in the beginning of this his discourse denyed (and rightly) that any Accident is in God, saying whatsoever is in God is the Divine Substance. He affirms also, that to attribute any Accident to God, is to deny the simplicity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Substance. And thus his Lordship makes God, as I do, a Corporeal Spirit. Both here, and throughout, he discovers so much ignorance, as had he charged me with error only, and not with Atheism, I should not have thought it necessary to answer him.</p>

                     <p>We are taught in our Creed to believe the Catholick or Universal Church. But <hi>T.

                     <p>All other Men distinguish between the Church and the Common-wealth; only <hi>T.

I say further, that the denyal of this point tendeth in <hi>England</hi> towards
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56428:214"/>
the taking away of the Kings Supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical. But his Lordship has not here denyed any thing of mine, because he has done no more but set down my words. He says further, that this Doctrine destroyes the Authority of all General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; which I confess. Nor hath any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at this day in this Kingdom the force of a Law, nor ever had, but by the Authority of the King.</p>

                     <p>Neither is he more Orthodox con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Hitherto,</hi> that is, <hi>for the</hi> Books of <hi>Moses, the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture Canonical, was in the Civil Soveraign.</hi> The like he saith of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, made Canonical by <hi>Esdras.</hi> And of the New Testament, That <hi>it was not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles which made their own Writings Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but every Convert made them so to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Yet with this restriction, That <hi>until the Soveraign Ruler had prescribed them, they were but Counsel and Advice, which whether good or bad, he that was counselled might without injustice refuse to observe, and being contrary to the Laws established, could not without injustice observe.</hi> He maketh the Primitive Christians to have been in a pretty condition. Certainly the Gospel was contrary to the Laws then establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But most plainly, <hi>The word of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the Scripture is the word of God.</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56428:214"/>
And the <hi>same is the Interpreter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Soveraign Judge of all Doctrines,</hi> that is, the Soveraign Magistrate, <hi>to whose Authority we must stand no less, than to theirs, who at first did commend the Scripture to us for the Canon of Faith.</hi> Thus if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Soveraigns, of different Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do clash one with another, in their interpretations, or misinterpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (as they do daily) then the word of God is contradictory to it self; or that is the word of God in one Common-wealth, which is the word of the Devil in another Common-wealth. And the same thing may be true, and not true at the same time: Which is the peculiar priviledge of <hi>T.H.</hi> to make Contradictories to be true toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>There is no doubt but by what Authority the Scripture or any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is made a Law, by the same Authority the Scriptures are to be interpreted, or else they are made Law in vain. But to obey is one thing, to believe is another; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction perhaps his Lordship never heard of. To obey is to do or forbear as one is commanded, and depends on the Will; but to believe depends not on the Will, but on the providence and guidance of our hearts that are in the hands of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Laws only required obedience; Belief
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56428:215"/>
requires Teachers and Arguments drawn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Reason, or from some thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready believed. Where there is no reason for our Belief, there is no reason we should believe. The reason why men believe, is drawn from the Authority of those men whom we have no just cause to mistrust, that is, of such men to whom no profit accrues by their deceiving us, and of such men as never used to lye, or else from the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such men whose Promises, Threats, and Affirmations we have seen confirmed by God with Miracles. If it be not from the Kings Authority that the Scripture is Law, what other Authority makes it Law? Here some man being of his Lordships judgment will perhaps laugh and say, 'tis the Authority of God that makes them Law. I grant that. But my question is, on what Authority they believe that God is the Author of them? Here his Lordship would have been at a Nonplus, and turning round, would have said the Authority of the Scripture makes good that God is their Author. If it be said we are to believe the Scripture upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Universal Church, why are not the Books we call Apocrypha the Word of God as well as the rest? If this Authority be in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then it is not any other than the Authority of the Head of the Church, which is the King. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56428:215"/>
the Head the Church is mute, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therefore is in the King; which is all that I contended for in this point. As to the Laws of the Gentiles, concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Primitive times of the Church, I confess they were contrary to Christian Faith. But none of their Laws, nor Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, nor a mans own Will are able to take away Faith, though they can compel to an external obedience; and though I may blame the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Princes for compelling men to speak what they thought not, yet I absolve not all those that have had the Power in Christian Churches from the same fault. For I believe since the time of the first four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels, there have been more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians burnt and killed in the Christian Church by Ecclesiastical Authority, than by the Heathen Emperors Laws for Religion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Sedition. All that the Bishop does in this Argument is but a heaving at the Kings Supremacy. Oh, but (says he) if two Kings interpret a place of Scripture in contrary sences, it will follow that both sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are true. It does not follow. For the interpretation, though it be made by just Authority, must not therefore always be true. If the Doctrine in the one sence be necessary to Salvation, then they that hold the other must dye in their sins, and be Damned. But if the Doctrine in neither
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56428:216"/>
sence be necessary to Salvation, then all is well, except perhaps that they will call one another Atheists, and fight about it.</p>

                     <p>All the power, vertue, use and efficacy, which he ascribeth to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, is to be <hi>signs or commemorations.</hi> As for any sealing, or confirming, or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Grace, he acknowledgeth nothing. The same he saith particularly of Baptism: Upon which grounds a Cardinals red Hat, or a Serjeant at Arms his Mace, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sacraments as well as Baptism, or the holy Eucharist, if they be only signs and commemorations of a benefit. If he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that Baptism and the Eucharist, are of Divine institution: But a Cardinals red Hat or a Serjeant at Arms his Mace are not: He saith truly but nothing to his advantage or purpose, seeing he deriveth all the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Word and Sacraments, in respect of Subjects, and all our obligation to them, from the Authority of the Soveraign Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, without which <hi>these words repent, and be Baptized in the name of Jesus, are but Counsel,</hi> no Command.

                     <p>Of the Sacraments I said no more, than that they are <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Commemorations.</hi> He finds fault that I add not <hi>Seals, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> and that they <hi>confer grace.</hi> First, I would have asked him if a Seal be any thing else besides a Sign, whereby to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber somewhat, as that we have promised, accepted, acknowledged, given, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken somewhat. Are not other <hi>Signs</hi> though without a <hi>Seal,</hi> of force sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me or oblige me? A Writing obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Release signed only with a mans name is as Obligatory as a Bond signed and sealed, if it be sufficiently proved, though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it may require a longer Process to obtain a Sentence, but his Lordship I think knew better than I do the force of Bonds and Bills; yet I know this that in the Court of Heaven there is no such difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween saying, signing, and sealing, as his Lordship seemeth here to pretend. I am Baptized for a Commemoration that I have enrolled my self. I take the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to Commemorate that Christ's Body was broken, and his Blood shed for my redemption. What is there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56428:217"/>
more intimated concerning the nature of these Sacraments, either in the Scripture or in the Book of Common-Prayer? Have Bread and Wine and Water in their own Nature, any other Quality than they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Consecration? It is true that the Consecration gives these bodies a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as being a giving and dedicating of them to God, that is to say a making of them Holy, not a changing of their Quality. But as some silly young men returning from <hi>France</hi> affect a broken <hi>English,</hi> to be thought perfect in the <hi>French</hi> language; so his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (I think) to seem a perfect understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the unintelligible language of the Schoolmen, pretends an ignorance of his Mother Tongue. He talks here of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> as if he were no <hi>English</hi> man, nor knew any difference between their significations. What <hi>English</hi> man when he commandeth, says more than, Do this; yet he looks to be obeyed, if obedience be due unto him. But when he says, <hi>Do this,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt have such or such a Reward,</hi> he encourages him, or advises him, or Bargains with him, but Commands him not. Oh, the understanding of a Schoolman.</p>

                     <p>Sometimes he is for holy Orders, and giveth to the Pastors of the Church the right of Ordination and Absolution, and Infallibility, too much for a particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56428:217"/>
or the Pastors of one particular Church. <hi>It is manifest, that the consecration of the chiefest Doctors in every Church, and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, doth pertain to the Doctors of the same Church.</hi> And <hi>it cannot be doubted of, but the power of binding and loosing was given by Christ to the future Pastors, after the same manner as to his present Apostles.</hi> And <hi>our Saviour hath promised this infallibility in those things which are necessary to Salvation, to his Apostles, until the day of Judgment, that is to say, to the Apostles and Pastors, to be Consecrated by the Apostles successively, by the imposition of hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But at other times he casteth all this Meal down with his foot. <hi>Christian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns are the supream Pastors, and the only persons whom Christians now hear speak from God, except such as God speaketh to in these dayes supernaturally.</hi> What is now become of the promised infallibility?</p>
                     <p>And <hi>it is from the Civil Soveraign that all other Pastors derive their right of teaching, preaching, and all other functions pertaining to that Office, and they are but his Ministers in the same manner as the Magistrates of Towns, or Judges in Courts of Justice, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Armies.</hi> What is now become of their Ordination? Magistrates, Judges, and Generals, need no precedent qualifications. He maketh <hi>the Pastoral Authority of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56428:218"/>
to be</hi> Jure divino, <hi>of all other Pastors</hi> Jure civili: He addeth, <hi>neither is there any Judge of Heresie among Subjects, but their own civil Soveraign.</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, <hi>the Church Excommunicateth no man but whom she Excommunicateth by the Authority of the Prince.</hi> And <hi>the effect of Excommunication hath nothing in it, neither of dammage in this World, nor terror upon an Apostate, if the Civil Power did persecute or not assist the Church. And in the World to come, leaves them in no worse estate, than those who never believed. The dammage ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther redoundeth to the Church. Neither is the Excommunication of a Christian Subject, that obeyeth the Laws of his own Soveraign, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effect.</hi> Where is now their power of binding and loosing?</p>

                     <p>Here his Lordship condemneth, first my too much kindness to the Pastors of the Church; as if I ascribed Infallibility to every particular Minister, or at least to the Assembly of the Pastors of a particular Church. But he mistakes me, I never meant to flatter them so much. I say only that the Ceremony of Consecration, and Imposition of hands belongs to them; and that also no otherwise than as given them by the Laws of the Common-wealth. The Bishop Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, but the King both makes him Bishop and gives him his Authority. The Head of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56428:218"/>
the Church not only gives the power of Consecration, Dedication, and Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but may also exercise the Act himself if he please. <hi>Solomon</hi> did it, and the Book of Canons says, That the King of <hi>England</hi> has all the Right that any good King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had. It might have added that any other King or soveraign Assembly had in their own Dominions. I deny That any Pastor or any Assembly of Pastors in any particular Church, or all the Churches on earth though united are Infallible. Yet I say the Pastors of a Christian Church assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled are in all such points as are <hi>necessary to Salvation.</hi> But about what points are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation</hi> he and I differ. For I in the 43d <hi>chapter</hi> of my <hi>Leviathan</hi> have proved that this Article, <hi>Jesus is the Christ,</hi> is the <hi>unum necessarium, the only Article ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation</hi>; to which his Lordship hath not offered any Objection. And he (it seems) would have necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Doctrine he himself thought so. Doubtless in this Article, <hi>Jesus is the Christ,</hi> every Church is infallible; for else it were no Church. Then he says, I overthrow this again by saying that Christian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns are the <hi>Supream Pastors,</hi> that is, Heads of their own Churches; <hi>That they have their Authority Jure Divino; That all other Pastors have it Jure Civili:</hi> How came
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56428:219"/>
any Bishop to have Authority over me, but by Letters Patents from the King? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Parliament wherein a Bishop, who was both a good Preacher and a good Man, was blamed for a Book he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before Published in maintenance of the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Bishops; a thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation here, was never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them by the Pope. Two <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinums</hi> cannot stand together in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In the last place he mislikes that the Church should Excommunicate by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King, that is to say, by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Head of the Church. But he tells not why. He might as well mislike that the Magistrates of the Realm should execute their Offices by the Authority of the Head of the Realm. His Lordship was in a great error, if he thought such incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would add any thing to the Wealth, Dignity, Reverence or Continuance of his Order. They are Pastors of Pastors, but yet they are the Sheep of him that is on earth their soveraign Pastor, and he again a Sheep of that supream Pastor which is in Heaven. And if they did their pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, both by Life and Doctrine, as they ought to do, there could never arise any dangerous Rebellion in the Land. But if the people see once any ambition in their Teachers, they will sooner learn that, than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56428:219"/>
any other Doctrine; and from Ambition proceeds Rebellion.</p>

And again, <hi>I have not found any Text that can probably be drawn to prove any Ascention of the Saints into Heaven, that is to say, into any</hi> Coelum Empyraeum.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56428:220"/>
Prayer, where in the Canons, where in the Homilies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or in any part of our Religion? What has a Christian to do with such Language? Nor do I remember it in <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Perhaps it may be in some Schoolman or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator on <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and his Lordship makes it in <hi>English</hi> the <hi>Heaven of the Blessed,</hi> as if <hi>Empyraeum</hi> signified <hi>That which belongs to the Blessed.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> says better; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of Judgment all that is not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall be Hell.

Perhaps his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thinks that the happiness of the Life to come is not real but a Vision. As for that which I say (<hi>Lev. pag.</hi> 345.)

                     <p>But considering his other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I do not marvel much at his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in this point. To what purpose should a <hi>Coelum Empyraeum,</hi> or Heaven of the Blessed, serve in his judgment, who maketh the blessed Angels that are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that happy Mansion, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idols of the brain, that is in plain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> nothing, or thin, subtil, fluid bodies, destroying the Angelical nature. <hi>The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse being the aggregate of all bodies, there is no real part thereof that is not also body.</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56428:220"/>
And elsewhere, <hi>Every part of the Vniverse is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Vniverse. And because the Vniverse is all, that which is no part of it is nothing, and consequently no where.</hi> How? By this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he maketh not only the Angels, but God himself to be nothing. Neither doth he salve it at all, by supposing erroneously Angels to be corporeal Spirits, and by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the name of incorporeal Spirit to God, <hi>as being a name of more honour, in whom we consider not what Attribute best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his nature, which is incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but what best expresseth our desire to honour him.</hi> Though we be not able to comprehend perfectly what God is, yet we are able perfectly to comprehend what God is not, that is, he is not imperfect, and therefore he is not finite, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he is not corporeal. This were a trim way to honour God indeed to honour him with a lye. If this that he say here be true, That <hi>every part of the Vniverse is a Body; and whatsoever is not a Body is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Then by this Doctrine, if God be not a Body, God is nothing; not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Spirit, but <hi>one of the Idols of the Brain,</hi> a meer nothing, though they think they dance under a Net, and have the blind of Gods incomprehensibility, between them and discovery.</p>

                     <p>This of <hi>Incorporeal substance</hi> he urged before, and there I answered it. I wonder he so often rolls the same stone. He is like <hi>Sysiphus</hi> in the Poets Hell, that there rolls a heavy stone up a hill, which no sooner he brings to day-light, then it slips down again to the bottom, and serves him so perpetually. For so his Lordship rolls this and other questions with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe till they come to the light of Scripture; and then they vanish, and he vexing, sweating, and railing goes to't again, to as little purpose as before. From that I say of the Universe he infers, that I make God to be nothing. But infers it absurdly. He might indeed have inferr'd that I make him a Corporeal, but yet a pure Spirit. I mean by the Universe, the Aggregate of all things that have being in themselves, and so do all men else. And because God has a being, it follows that he is either the whole Universe, or part of it. Nor does his Lordship go about to disprove it, but only seems to wonder at it.</p>

                     <p>He comes here to that which is a great Paradox in School Divinity. The grounds of my opinion are the Canonical Scripture, and the Texts which I cited I must again recite, to which I shall also add some others. My Doctrine is this, First, <hi>That the elect in Christ from the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forward, by vertue of Christ's Passion and Victory over death, shall enjoy eternal life, that is, they shall be Immortal.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56428:222"/>
                        <hi>that there is no living Soul separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in place from the Body, more than there is a living Body separated from the Soul.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That the reprobate shall be revived to Judgment, and shall dye a second death in Torments, which death shall be everlasting.</hi> Now let us consider what is said to these points in the Scripture, and what is the harmony therein of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                     <p>And first, because the word <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> is not found in the Scriptures, the question is to be decided by evident conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from the Scripture. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith of God expresly (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.) That <hi>He only hath immortality, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in inaccessible light.</hi> Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Soul of man is not of its own nature Immortal, but by Grace, that is to say, by the gift of God. And then the question will be whether this grace or gift of God were bestowed on the Soul in the Creation and Conception of the Man, or afterwards by his redemption. Another question will be in what sence immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Torments can be called a gift, when all gifts suppose the thing given to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the receiver. To the first of these, Christ himself saith (<hi>Luke</hi> 14.13, 14.) <hi>When thou makest a Feast, call the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame, the Blind, and thou shalt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56428:222"/>
be Blessed, for they cannot recompense thee; For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them that be just.</hi> It follows hence that the reward of the Elect is not before the Resurrection. What reward then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes a separated Soul in Heaven, or any where else till that day come, or what has he to do there till the Body rise again? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain St. <hi>Paul</hi> says (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7.) <hi>God will render to every man according to his works. To them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for Honour, Glory and Immortality, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. But unto them that be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, indignation and wrath.</hi> Here it is plain that God gives Eternal Life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to well doers, and to them that seek (not to them that have already) Immortality. Again (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>Christ hath abolished Death, and brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Gospel.</hi> Therefore before the Gospel of Christ, nothing was Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal but God. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the day of Judgment (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54.) saith that <hi>This Mortal shall put on Immortality,</hi> and <hi>that then Death is swallowed in Victory.</hi> There was no Immortality of any thing Mortal till Death was overcome, and that was at the Resurrection. <hi>And John</hi> 8.52. <hi>Verily, Verily, if a man keep my sayings he shall never see Death,</hi> that is to say, he shall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56428:223"/>
be Immortal; but it is no where said, that he which keeps not Christ's sayings shall never see Death, nor be Immortal, and yet they that say that the wicked, Body and Soul, shall be tormented everlastingly, do therein say they are Immortal. Mat. 10.28. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but fear him that is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi> Man cannot kill a Soul, for the Man kill'd shall revive again. But God can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Soul and Body in Hell, as that it shall never return to life. In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament we read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 7.4.) I will destroy every living Substance that I have made from off the face of the Earth; therefore, if the Souls of them that perished in the Flood were Substances, they were also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in the Flood and were not Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. (<hi>Math.</hi> 25.41.) <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> These words are to be spoken in the day of Judgment, which Judgment is to be in the Clouds. And there shall stand the men that are reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alive, where Souls according to his Lordships Doctrine were sent long before to Hell. Therefore at that present day of Judgment they had one Soul by which they were there alive, and another Soul in Hell. How his Lordship could have maintained
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56428:223"/>
this, I understand not. But by my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Soul is not a separated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but that the Man at his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be revived by God, and raised to Judgment, and afterwards Body and Soul destroyed in Hell-fire (which is the second death) there is no such consequence or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to be inferred. Besides it avoids the unnecessary disputes about where the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was for four dayes he lay dead. And the order of the Divine Process is made good, of not inflicting torments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Condemnation pronounced.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the harmony of the two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments, it is said in the old (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.) <hi>In the day that thou eatest of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, dying thou shalt dye. Moriendo mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris,</hi> that is, when thou art dead thou shalt not revive; for so hath <hi>Athanasius</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were not Immortal by their Creation. Then (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22.) <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us —Now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever, &amp;c.</hi> Here they had had an Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by the gift of God, if they had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It was therefore sin that lost them Eternal-life. He therefore that redeemed them from sin was the Author of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and consequently began in the day of Judgment when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56428:224"/>
again made alive by admission to the new Tree of Life, which was Christ.</p>
                     <p>Now let us compare this with the New Testament. Where we find these words (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21.) <hi>since by Man came Death, by Man came also the Resurrection of the dead.</hi> Therefore all the Immortality of the Soul, that shall be after the Resurrection, is by Christ, and not by the nature of the Soul. verse 22. <hi>As by Adam all dye, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</hi> Therefore since we dyed by <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, so we shall live by Christ's Redemption of us, that is, after the Resurrection. Again verse 23. <hi>But every man in his order; Christ the first Fruits, afterwards they that are Christs, at his coming.</hi> Therefore none shall be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live till the coming of Christ. Lastly, as when God had said, That day that thou eatest of the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil, thou shalt dye, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him then, yet he suffered him to live a long time after; so when Christ had said to the Thief on the Cross, this day thou shalt be with me in Paradise, yet he suffered him to lye dead till the General Resurrection, for no man rose again from the dead before our Saviours coming, and conquering death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56428:224"/>If God bestowed Immortality on every man then when he made him, and he made many to whom he never purposed to give his saving Grace, what did his Lordship think that God gave any man Immortality with purpose only to make him capable of Immortal Torments? 'Tis a hard saying, and I think cannot piously be believed. I am sure it can never be proved by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But though I have made it clear that it cannot be drawn by lawful consequence from Scripture, that Man was Created with a Soul Immortal, and that the Elect only, by the Grace of God in Christ, shall both Bodies and Souls from the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forward be Immortal; yet there may be a Consequence well drawn from some words in the Rites of Burial, that prove the contrary, as these. <hi>Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy, to take unto himself the Soul of our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here departed,</hi> &amp;c. And these, <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, with whom do live the Spirits of them that depart hence in the Lord.</hi> Which are words Authorised by the Church. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Lordship that had so often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, took no notice of them here. But it often happens that men think of those things least, which they have most perfectly learnt by rote. I am sorry
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56428:225"/>
I could not without deserting the sence of Scripture and mine own Conscience say the same. But I see no just cause yet why the Church should be offended at it. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> pretendeth not (as doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to be above the Scripture; nor forbiddeth any man to Read the Scripture; nor was I forbidden when I Wrote my <hi>Leviathan</hi> to Publish any thing which the Scriptures suggested. For when I Wrote it, I may safely say there was no lawful Church in <hi>England,</hi> that could have maintained me in, or prohibited me from Writing any thing. There was no Bishop, and though there were Preaching, such as it was, yet no Common-Prayer. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayer, though made in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, is not Common-Prayer. There was then no Church in <hi>England</hi> that any man living was bound to obey. What I Write here at this present time I am forced to in my defence, not against the Church, but against the accusations and arguments of my Adversaries. For the Church, though it excommunicates for scandalous life, and for teaching false Doctrines, yet it profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to impose nothing to be held as Faith, but what may be warranted by Scripture, and this the Church it self saith in the 20th of the 39 Articles of Religion. And therefore I am permitted to alledge Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56428:225"/>
at any time in the defence of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>

                     <p>But they that in one case are griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in another must be relieved. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance <hi>T. H.</hi> hath given his Disciples any discontent in his Doctrine of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>holy</hi> Angels, and <hi>the glorified Souls of the Saints,</hi> he will make them amends in his Doctrine of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Devils,</hi> and the <hi>damned Spirits.</hi> First of the Devils; He fancieth that all those Devils which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did cast out, were Phrensies, and all <hi>Demoniacks</hi> (or Persons possessed) <hi>no other than Mad-men.</hi> And to justifie <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's speaking to a Disease as to a Person,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the example of inchanters.

The other sort of Devils are called in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> Daemonia, <hi>which are the feigned Gods of the Heathen, and are neither Bodies nor spiritual Substances, but meer fancies, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of terrified hearts, feigned by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and other Heathen People, which St.</hi> Paul
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56428:226"/>
                        <hi>calleth Nothings.</hi> So <hi>T.H.</hi> hath killed the great infernal Devil, and all his black An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and left no Devils to be feared, but Devils Incarnate, that is, wicked men.</p>

                     <p>That Metaphors bear sad truths in them, I deny not. It is a sad thing to lose this present life untimely. Is it not therefore much more a sad thing to lose an eternal happy Life? And I believe that he which will venture upon sin, with such danger, will not stick to do the same not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Doctrine of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Is it not also a sad truth, that the Kingdom of darkness should be a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy of deceivers?</p>

                     <p>Lastly, for the damned Spirits, he declareth himself every where, that their sufferings are not eternal. <hi>The Fire shall be unquenchable, and the Torments everlasting; but it cannot be thence inferred, that he who shall be cast into that Fire, or be tormented with those Torments, shall endure and resist them, so as to be eternally burnt and tortured, and yet never be destroyed nor dye. And though there be many places, that affirm ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire, into which men may be cast suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessivily one after another for ever; yet I find none that affirm that there shall be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life therein of any individual Person.</hi> If he had said, and said only, that the pains of the Damned may be lessened, as to the degree of them, or that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure not for ever, but that after they are purged by long torments from their dross and Corruptions, as Gold in the fire, both
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56428:227"/>
the damned Spirits and the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should be restored to a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he might have found some Ancients (who are therefore called <hi>the merciful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>) to have joyned with him, though still he should have wanted the suffrage of the Catholick Church.</p>

                     <p>Why does not his Lordship cite some place of Scripture here to prove that all the Reprobates which are dead, live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in torment? We read indeed That everlasting Torments were prepared for the Devil and his Angels, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures also are everlasting; and that the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>false Prophet</hi> shall be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed everlastingly; but not that every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate shall be so. They shall indeed be cast into the same fire, but the Scripture says plainly enough, that they shall be both Body and Soul destroyed there. If I had said that the Devils themselves should be restored to a better condition; his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would have been so kind as to have put me into the number of the <hi>Merciful Doctors.</hi> Truly if I had had any Warrant for the possibility of their being less ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Church of God than they have been, I would have been as merciful to them as any Doctor of them all.

                     <p>In summ I leave it to the free judgment of the understanding Reader, by these few instances which follow, to judge what the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Principles are in point of Religion. <hi>Ex ungue leonem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, that no man needs to put himself to any hazzard for his Faith, but may safely comply with the times. <hi>And for their Faith it is internal and invisible. They have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence that</hi> Naaman <hi>had, and need not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into danger for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he alloweth Subjects, being commanded by their Soveraign, to deny Christ. <hi>Profession with the Tongue is but an external thing, and no more than any other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, whereby we signifie our obedience. And wherein a Christian, holding firmly in his heart the Faith of Christ, hath the same liberty which the Prophet</hi> Elisha <hi>allowed to</hi> Naaman, &amp;c. <hi>Who by bowing before the Idol</hi> Rimmon, <hi>denyed the true God as much in effect, as if he had done it with his Lips.</hi> Alas, why did St. <hi>Peter</hi> Weep so bitterly for denying his Master, out of fear of his Life or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56428:228"/>
It seems he was not acquainted with these <hi>Hobbian</hi> Principles. And in the same place he layeth down this general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>This we may say that whatsoever a Subject is compelled to, in obedience to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order to the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that action is not his, but his Soveraign's; nor is it he that in this case denyeth Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but his Governor and the Law of his Country.</hi> His instance in a <hi>Mahometan</hi> commanded by a Christian Prince to be present at Divine Service, is a weak mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, springing from his gross ignorance in Case-Divinity, not knowing to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between an erroneous Conscience, as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> is, and a Conscience right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed.</p>

                     <p>In these his two first instances I confess his Lordship does not much be lye me. But neither does he confute me. Also I confess my ignorance in his Case-Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is grounded upon the Doctrine of the School-men. Who to decide Cases of Conscience, take in, not only the Scriptures, but also the Decrees of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the advancing of the Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church over Consciences; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true decision of Cases of Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be grounded only on Scripture, or natural Equity. I never allowed the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56428:229"/>
denying of Christ with the Tongue in all men, but expresly say the contrary (<hi>Lev. pag.</hi> 362.) in these words, For an unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that is in the power of an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous King or State, if commanded on pain of death to worship before an Idol, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth the Idol in his heart; he doth well, though if he had the fortitude to suffer death rather than worship it, he should do better. But if a Pastor who as Christ's mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger has undertaken to teach Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to all Nations, should do the same, it were not only a sinful scandal in respect of other Christian mens Consciences, but a perfidious forsaking of his charge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> in denying Christ sinned, as being an Apostle. And 'tis sin in every man that should now take upon him to preach against the power of the Pope, to leave his Commission unexecuted for fear of the fire; but in a meer Traveller, not so. The three Children and <hi>Daniel</hi> were worthy Champions of the true Religion. But God requireth not of every man to be a Champion. As for his Lordship's words of <hi>complying with the times,</hi> they are not mine, but his own spightful Paraphrase.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, if this be not enough, he giveth licence to a Christian to commit Idolatry, or at least to do an Idolatrous act, for fear of death or corporal danger. <hi>To
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56428:229"/>
pray unto a King voluntarily for fair weather, or for any thing which God only can do for us, is divine Worship, and Idolatry. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, if a King compel a man to it by the terror of death, or other great corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not Idolatry.</hi> His reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>it is not a sign, that he doth inwardly honour him as a God, but that he is desirous to save himself from death, or from a miserable life.</hi> It seemeth <hi>T.

How much is he wiser than the three Children, or <hi>Daniel</hi> himself? who were thrown, the first into a fiery Furnace, the last into the Lions Denn, because they refused to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Idolatrous Decree of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince.</p>

                     <p>Here also my words are truly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But his Lordship understood not what the word <hi>Worship</hi> signifies; and yet he knew what I meant by it. To think high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God (as I had defined it) is to honour him. But <hi>to think</hi> is internal. To Worship, is to signifie that Honour which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly give, by signs <hi>external.</hi> This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood (as by his Lordship it was) all he says to it is but a cavil.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56428:230"/>
to obey God than man, hath place in the Kingdom of God by Pact, and not by Nature.</hi> Why? Nature it self doth teach us it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God than men. Neither can he say that he intended this only of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the use of indifferent actions and gestures, in the service of God, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Common-wealth, for that is to obey both God and man. But if divine Law and humane Law clash one with another, without doubt it is evermore better to obey God than man.</p>

                     <p>Here again appears his unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in reasoning. Who denyes, but it is alwayes, and in all causes better to obey God than Man? But there is no Law, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine nor humane that ought to be taken for a Law, till we know what it is, and if a divine Law, till we know that God hath commanded it to be kept. We agree that the Scriptures are the Word of God. But they are a Law by Pact, that is, to us who have been Baptized into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. To all others it is an invitation only to their own benefit. 'Tis true that even nature suggesteth to us that the Law of God is to be obeyed rather than the Law of man. But nature does not suggest to us that the Scripture is the Law of God, much less how every Text of it ought to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But who then shall suggest this? Dr.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56428:230"/>
                        <hi>Bramhall</hi>? I deny it. Who then? The stream of Divines? Why so? Am I that have the Scripture it self before my eyes, obliged to venture my eternal life upon their interpretation, how learned soever they pretend to be, when no counter-secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that they can give me, will save me harmless? If not the stream of Divines, who then? The lawful Assembly of Pastors or of Bishops? But there can be no lawful Assembly in <hi>England</hi> without the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King. The Scripture therefore what it is, and how to be interpreted, is made known unto us here, by no other way than the Authority of our Soveraign Lord both in Temporals and Spirituals, The Kings Majesty. And where he has set forth no Interpretation, there I am allowed to follow my own, as well as any other man, Bishop or not Bishop. For my own part, all that know me, know also it is my opinion, That the best government in Religion is by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, but in the King's Right, not in their own. But my Lord of <hi>Derry</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this, would have the utmost resolution of our Faith to be into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Schools. I do not think that all the Bishops be of his mind. If they were, I would wish them to stand in fear of that dreadful Sentence, <hi>All covet all lose.</hi> I must not let pass these words of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56428:231"/>
                        <hi>If divine Law and humane Law clash one with another, without doubt it is better evermore to obey God than man.</hi> Where the King is a Christian, believes the Scripture, and hath the Legislative power both in Church and State, and maketh no Laws concerning Christian Faith, or divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but by the Counsel of his Bishops whom he trusteth in that behalf, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops counsel him aright, what clashing can there be between the divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws? For if the Civil Law be against God's Law and the Bishops make it clearly appear to the King that it clasheth with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, no doubt he will mend it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or by the advice of his Parliament; for else he is no professor of Christ's Doctrine, and so the clashing is at an end. But if they think that every opinion they hold, though obscure and unnecessary to Salvation, ought presently to be Law, then there will be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shings innumerable, not only of Laws, but also of Swords, as we have found it too true by late experience. But his Lordship is still at this, that there ought to be, for the divine Laws that is to say, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, a Legislative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Church, distinct from that of the King, which under him they enjoy already. This I deny. Then for clashing between the Civil Laws of Infidels with the Law of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56428:231"/>
God, the Apostles teach that those their Civil Laws are to be obeyed, but so as to keep their Faith in Christ entirely in their hearts; which is an obedience easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But I do not believe that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> was bound to make the holy Scripture Law; and yet unless they did so they could not attain to eternal life.</p>

                     <p>His fifth conclusion may be, that the sharpest and most successful Sword, in any War whatsoever, doth give Soveraign Power and Authority to him that hath it, to approve or reject all sorts of Theological Doctrines, concerning the Kingdom of God, not according to their truth or falshood, but according to that influence which they have upon political affairs. Hear him, <hi>But because this Doctrine will appear to most men a novelty, I do but propound it, maintaining nothing in this or any other Paradox of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but attending the end of that dispute of the Sword, concerning the Authority (not yet amongst my Country-men decided) by which all sorts of Doctrine are to be approved or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For, the points of Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God, have so great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Kingdom of Man, as not to be determined, but by them that under God have the Soveraign Power.</hi>

Let him evermore want success who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth actions are to be judged by their events. This Doctrine may be plausible to those who desire to fish in troubled Waters. But it is justly hated by those which are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and all those who are lovers of peace and tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>The last part of this conclusion smelleth rankly of Jeroboam, <hi>Now shall the Kingdom return to the house of</hi> David, <hi>if this people go up to do Sacrifice in the house of the Lord at</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>whereupon the King took counsel, and made two Calves of Gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>behold thy Gods O</hi> Israel, <hi>which brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt.</hi> But by the just disposition of Almighty God this Policy turned to a sin, and was the utter destruction of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Family. It is not good jesting with edge-tools, nor playing with holy things: Where men make their greatest fastness, many times they find most danger.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56428:233"/>
Laws.</hi> Where by the Laws he doth not understand the Written Laws, elected and approved by the whole Common-wealth, but the verbal Commands or Mandates, of him that hath the Soveraign Power, as we find in many places of his Writings. <hi>The Civil Laws are nothing else but the Commands of him, that is endowed with Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Common-wealth, concerning the future actions of his Subjects.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56428:233"/>
and Nature. If the Civil Laws swerve from these more authentick Laws, they are Lesbian Rules. <hi>What the Lawgiver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is to be accounted good, what he forbids bad.</hi> This was just the garb of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Sophisters, as they are described by <hi>Plato.</hi> Whatsoever pleased the great Beast [the Multitude] they call holy, and just, and good. And whatsoever the great Beast disliked, they called evil, unjust, prophane. But he is not yet arrived at the height of his flattery. <hi>Lawful Kings make those things which they command just by commanding them.</hi> At other times when he is in his right wits he talketh of sufferings, and <hi>expecting their reward in Heaven. And going to Christ by Martyrdome. And if he had the fortitude to suffer death he should do better.</hi> But I fear all this was but said in jest. How should they expect their reward in Heaven, if his Doctrine be true, that there is no reward in Heaven? Or how should they be Martyrs, if his Doctrine be true, that <hi>none can be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs but those who conversed with Christ upon earth?</hi> He addeth, <hi>Before Empires were, just and unjust were not.</hi> Nothing could be written more false in his sence, more dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, more inglorious to the humane nature. That God should create Man and leave him presently without any Rules, to his own ordering of himself, as the Ostridg leaveth her Eggs in the sand. But in truth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56428:234"/>
there have been Empires in the World e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since <hi>Adam.</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> had a Law written in his heart by the finger of God, before there was any Civil Law. Thus they do endeavour to make goodness, and justice, and honesty, and conscience, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to be empty names, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, which signifie nothing, further than they conduce to a man's interest.

                     <p>My sixth Paradox he calls a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A Rapper, a Swapper and such like terms are his Lordships elegancies. But let us see what this Rapper is. 'Tis this, The Civil Laws are the Rules of Good and Evil, Just and Unjust, Honest and Dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. Truly I see no other Rules they have. The Scriptures themselves were made Law to us here, by the Authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and are therefore part of the Law Civil. If they were Laws in their own nature, then were they Laws over all the World, and men were obliged to obey them in <hi>America,</hi> as soon as they should be shown there (though without a Miracle) by a Frier. What is Injust but the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of a Law? <hi>Law</hi> therefore was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Unjust. And the Law was made known by Soveraign Power before it was a Law. Therefore <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56428:234"/>
both to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Injustice.</hi> Who then made Injust but Soveraign Kings or Soveraign Assemblies? Where is now the wonder of this Rapper, <hi>That Lawful Kings make those things which they command Just by commanding them, and those things which they forbid Vnjust by forbidding them?</hi> Just and Unjust were surely made; if the King made them not, who made them else? For certainly the breach of a Civil Law is a sin against God. Another Calumny which he would fix upon me, is, That I make the King's verbal Commands to be Laws. How so? Because I say <hi>the Civil Laws are nothing else but the Commands of him that hath the Soveraign Power, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the future Actions of his Subjects.</hi> What verbal Command of a King can arrive at the ears of all his Subjects (which it must do ere it be a Law) without the Seal of the Person of the Common-wealth (which is here the Great Seal of <hi>England?</hi>) Who but his Lordship ever denyed that the command of <hi>England</hi> was a Law to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> men? Or that any but the King had Authority to affix the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to any Writing? And who did ever doubt to call our Laws (though made in Parliament) the King's Laws? What was ever called a Law which the King did not assent to? Because the King has granted in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56428:235"/>
divers cases not to make a Law without the advice and assent of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, therefore when there is no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in being, shall the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> stand for nothing? What was more unjustly maintained during the long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (besides the resisting and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King) then this Doctrine of his Lordship's? But the Bishop endeavoured here to make the Multitude believe I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the King sinneth not though he bid hang a man for making his Apparel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than he appointed, or his Servant for negligent attendance. And yet he knew I distinguished always between the King's natural and politick capacity. What name should I give to this wilful slander? But here his Lordship enters into passion, and exclaims, <hi>Where are we, in</hi> Europe <hi>or in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia? <hi>Gross, palpable, pernicious flattery, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of a Common-wealth, poysoning the King's mind.</hi> But where was his Lordship when he wrote this? One would not think he was in <hi>France,</hi> nor that this Doctrine was Written in the year 1658, but rather in the year 1648, in some Cabal of the King's enemies. But what did put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this fit of Choller? Partly, this very thing, that he could not answer my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but chiefly, that he had lost upon me so much School-learning in our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56428:235"/>
touching <hi>Liberty and Necessity,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to blame himself, for believing that the obscure and barbarous Language of School Divinity could satisfie an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader as well as plain and perspicuous <hi>English.</hi> Do I flatter the King? Why am I not rich? I confess his Lordship has not flattered him here.</p>

                     <p>Something there is which he hath a confused glimmering of, as the blind man sees <hi>men walking like Trees,</hi> which he is not able to apprehend and express clearly. We acknowledge, that though the Laws or Commands of a Soveraign Prince be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or unjust, or injurious, such as a Subject cannot approve for good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet he is bound to acquiesce, and may not oppose or resist, otherwise than by Prayers and Tears, and at the most by flight. We acknowledge that the Civil Laws have power to bind the Conscience of a Christian, in themselves, but not from themselves, but from him who hath said, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers.</hi> Either they bind Christian Subjects to do their Soveraign's Commands, or to suffer for the Testimony of a good Conscience. We acknowledge that in doubtful Cases <hi>semper praesumitur pro Rege &amp; Lege,</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and the Law are always presumed to be in the right. But in plain evident ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56428:236"/>
which admit no doubt, it is always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God than man. Blunderers whilst they think to mend one imaginary hole, make two or three real ones. They who derive the Authority of the Scriptures or God's Law from the Civil Laws of men, are like those who seek to underprop the Heavens from falling with a Bullrush. Nay, they derive not only the Authority of the Scripture, but even the Law of nature it self from the Civil Law. <hi>The Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (which need no promulgation) <hi>in the condition of nature are not properly Laws, but qualities which dispose men to peace and obedience. When a Common-wealth is once setled, then are they actually Laws and not before.</hi> God help us, into what times are we fallen, when the immutable Laws of God and Nature are made to depend upon the mutable Laws of mortal men, just as one should go about to controll the Sun by the Authority of the Clock.</p>

                     <p>Hitherto he never offered to mend any of the Doctrines he inveighs against; but here he does. He says I have a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of something I was not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and express clearly. Let us see his Lordship's more clear expression. <hi>We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that though the Laws or Commands of a Soveraign Prince be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or unjust, or injurious, such as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56428:236"/>
cannot approve for good in themselves, yet he is bound to acquiesce, and may not oppose or resist otherwise than by Prayers and Tears, and at the most by Flight.</hi> Hence it follows clearly, that when a Soveraign has made a Law, though erroneous, then if his Subject oppose it, it is a sin. Therefore I would fain know, when a man has broken that Law by doing what it forbad, or by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to do what it commanded, whether he have opposed this Law or not. If to break the Law be to oppose it, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. Therefore his Lordship has not here expressed himself, so clearly as to make men understand the difference between breaking a Law and opposing it. Though there be some difference between breaking of a Law, and opposing those that are sent with force to see it executed; yet between breaking and opposing the Law it self there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Also though the Subject think the Law just, as when a Thief is by Law Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, yet he may lawfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Execution, not only by Prayers, Tears and Flight, but also (as I think) any way he can. For though his fault were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, yet his endeavour to save his own life is not a fault. For the Law expects it, and for that cause appointeth Felons to be carryed bound and encompassed with Armed men to Execution. Nothing is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56428:237"/>
to Law but sin. Nothing opposite to the Sheriff but force. So that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's sight was not sharp enough to see the difference between the Law and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Again, <hi>We acknowledge</hi> (says he) <hi>that the Laws have power to bind the Conscience of a Christian in themselves, but not from themselves.</hi> Neither do the Scriptures bind the Conscience because they are Scriptures, but because they were from God. So also the Book of <hi>English</hi> Statutes bindeth our Consciences in it self, but not from it self, but from the Authority of the King, who only in the right of God has the legislative Powers. Again he saith, <hi>We acknowledge that in doubtful cases, the Soveraign and the Law are always presumed to be in the right.</hi> If he presume they are in the right, how dare he presume that the cases they determine are doubtful? But saith he, <hi>in evident cases which admit no doubt it is always better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God than man.</hi> Yes, and in doubtful cases also say I. But not always better to obey the inferior Pastors than the Supream Pastor, which is the King. But what are those cases that admit no doubt? I know but very few, and those are such as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was not much acquainted with.</p>

                     <p>Thus we have seen how the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do destroy the Existence, the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the Ubiquity, the Eternity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness of God, the Doctrine of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, the Hypostatical Union, the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56428:242"/>
Kingly Sacerdotal and Prophetical Office of Christ, the Being and Operation of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, Heaven, Hell, Angels, Devils, the Immortality of the Soul, the Catholick and all National Churches; the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, holy Orders, the holy Sacraments, the whole frame of Religion, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; the Laws of Nature, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of Goodness, Justice, Piety, Honesty, Conscience, and all that is Sacred. If his Disciples have such an implicite Faith, that they can digest all these things, they may feed with <hi>Ostriches.</hi>

                     <p>He here concludes his first Chapter with bitter Reproaches, to leave in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as he thought) a sting, supposing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that he will Read nothing but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of his Book, as is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of many men. But to make him lose that petty piece of cunning, I must desire of the Reader one of these two things. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would read with it the places of my <hi>Leviathan</hi> which he cites, and see not only how he answers my arguments, but also what the arguments are which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth against them; or else that, he would forbear to condemn me, so much as in his thought; for otherwise he is unjust. The name of Bishop is of great Authority, but these words are not the words of a Bishop, but of a passionate School-man, too fierce
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56428:242"/>
and unseemly in any man whatsoever. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they are untrue. Who that knows me will say I have the confidence of a Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or that I use to brag of any thing, much less that I play the Mountebank? What my works are, he was no sit Judge. But now he has provoked me, I will say thus much of them, that neither he, if he had lived could, nor I if I would, can extinguish the light which is set up in the World by the greatest part of them; and for these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which he impugneth, I have few op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, but such whose Profit, or whose Fame in Learning is concerned in them. He accuses me first of destroying the Existence of God, that is to say, he would make the World believe I were an Atheist. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground? Because I say, that God is a Spirit, but <hi>Corporeal.</hi> But to say that, is allowed me by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that says <hi>There is a Spiritual Body, and there is an Animal Body.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He that holds that there is a God, and that God is really somewhat (for <hi>Body</hi> is doubtlesly a <hi>real Substance</hi>) is as far from being an Atheist, as is possible to be. But he that says God is an <hi>Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance,</hi> no man can be sure whether he be an Atheist or not. For no man living can tell whether there be any <hi>Substance</hi> at all, that is not also <hi>Corporeal.</hi> For neither
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56428:243"/>
the word <hi>Incorporeal,</hi> nor <hi>Immaterial,</hi> nor any word equivalent to it is to be found in Scripture, or in Reason. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that <hi>the Godhead dwelleth bodily in Christ,</hi> is found in <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.9. and <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> maintains that God is either a <hi>Corporeal Substance</hi> or <hi>Nothing.</hi> Nor was he ever condemned for it by the Church. For why? Not only <hi>Tertullian</hi> but all the learned call <hi>Body,</hi> not only that which one can see, but also whatsoever has magnitude, or that is somewhere; for they had greater reverence for the Divine Substance than that they durst think it had no <hi>Magnitude</hi> or was <hi>no where.</hi> But they that hold God to be a Phantasm, as did the Exorcists in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, such a thing as were at that time thought to be the Sprights that were said to walk in Church-yards, and to be the Souls of men buried, they do absolutely make God to be nothing at all. But how? Were they Atheists? No. For though by ignorance of the consequence they said that which was equivolent to Atheism, yet in their hearts they thought God a Substance, and would also, if they had known what <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and what <hi>Corporeal</hi> meant, have said he was a Corporeal Substance. So that this <hi>Atheism by consequence</hi> is a very easie thing to be fallen into, even by the most Godly men
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56428:243"/>
of the Church. He also that says that God is <hi>wholly here,</hi> and <hi>wholly there,</hi> and <hi>wholly every where,</hi> destroys by consequence the Unity of God, and the Infiniteness of God, and the Simplicity of God. And this the Schoolmen do, and are therefore <hi>Atheists by consequence,</hi> and yet they do not all say in their hearts that there is no God. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his Lordship by exempting the Will of man from being subject to the necessity of God's Will or Decree, denies by <hi>consequence</hi> the Divine Praescience, which also will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to <hi>Atheism by consequence.</hi> But out of this that God is a <hi>Spirit corporeal</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely pure,</hi> there can no unworthy or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonourable consequence be drawn. Thus far to his Lordship's first Chapter in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as to matter of Religion; and especially to wipe off that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just slander cast upon me by the Bishop of <hi>Derry.</hi> As for the second Chapter which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my Civil Doctrines, since my errors there, if there be any, will not tend very much to my disgrace, I will not take the pains to answer it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas his Lordship has talked in his discourse here and there ignorantly of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and some others have not doubted to say publickly, that there be many Heresies in my
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56428:244"/>
                        <hi>Leviathan</hi>; I will add hereunto for a general answer an Historical relation concerning the word Heresie from the first use of it amongst the <hi>Graecians,</hi> till this present time.</p>

                  <head>AN Historical Narration CONCERNING HERESIE, AND THE Punishment thereof.</head>
                  <p>THE word <hi>Heresie</hi> is Greek, and signifies a taking of any thing, and particularly the taking of an Opinion. After the study of Philosophy begun in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Philosophers disagreeing amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, had started many Questions, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about things Natural, but also Moral and Civil; because every man took what Opinion he pleased, each several Opinion was called a <hi>Heresie</hi>; which signified no more than a private Opinion, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to truth or falshood. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56428:246"/>
of these Heresies were chiefly <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Zeno</hi>; men who as they held many Errors, so also found they out many true and useful Doctrines, in all kinds of Learning: and for that cause were well esteemed of by the greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of their own times; and so also were some few of their Followers.</p>
                  <p>But the rest, ignorant men, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten needy Knaves, having learned by heart the Opinions of these admir'd Philosophers, and pretending to take after them, made use thereof to get their Living by the teaching of Rich mens Children that happened to be in love with those great Names. Tho' by their impertinent Discourse, sordid and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Manners, they were generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, of what Sect or Heresie soever; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> or <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi> (Followers of <hi>Plato</hi>) or <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> (Followers of <hi>Aristotle: Epicureans</hi> or <hi>Stoicks</hi>) (Followers of <hi>Zeno</hi>) For these were the names of Heresies, or (as the <hi>Latines</hi> call them) <hi>Sects, à sequendo,</hi> so much talkt of from after the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> till this present day, and that have perpetually troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or deceived the people with whom they lived, and were never more numerous than in the time of the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56428:246"/>The Heresie of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of time has had the good fortune to be predominant over the rest. However originally the name of <hi>Heresie</hi> was no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, nor the word <hi>Heretick</hi> at all in use. Tho' the several Sects, especially the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> hated one another; and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> being the fiercer men, used to revile those that differed from them with the most despightful words they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be doubted, but that, by the preaching of the Apostles and Disciples of Christ in <hi>Greece</hi> and other parts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, full of these Philosophers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of men were converted to the Christian Faith, some really, and some feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, for factious ends, or for need; (for Christians lived then in common, and were charitable:) and because most of these Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers had better skill in Disputing and Oratory than the Common people, and thereby were better qualified both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and propagate the Gospel, there is no doubt (I say) but most of the Pastors of the Primitive Church were for that reason chosen out of the number of these Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; who retaining still many Doctrines which they had taken up on the authority of their former Masters, whom they had in reverence, endeavoured many of them to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56428:247"/>
draw the Scriptures every one to his own Heresie. And thus at first entred Heresie into the Church of Christ. Yet these men were all of them Christians; as they were when they were first baptized: Nor did they deny the Authority of those Writings which were left them by the Apostles and Evangelists, tho' they interpreted them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with a bias to their former Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy. And this Dissention amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was a great scandal to the Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and which not only obstructed the way of the Gospel, but also drew scorn and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Persecution upon the Church.</p>
                  <p>For remedy whereof, the chief Pastors of Churches did use, at the rising of any new Opinion, to assemble themselves for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and determining of the same; wherein, if the Author of the Opinion were convinced of his Error, and subscribed to the Sentence of the Church assembled, then all was well again: but if he still persisted in it, they laid him aside, and considered him but as an Heathen man; which to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Christian, was a great Ignominy, and of force to make him consider better of his own Doctrine; and sometimes brought him to the acknowledgment of the Truth. But other punishment they could inflict none, that being a right appropriated to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power. So that all the punishment the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56428:247"/>
Church could inflict, was only Ignominy; and that among the Faithful, consisting in this, that his company was by all the Godly avoided, and he himself branded with the name of <hi>Heretick</hi> in opposition to the whole Church, that condemned his Doctrine. So that <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Heretick</hi> were terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative; and here it was that Heretick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to be a Name, and a name of Disgrace, both together.</p>
                  <p>The first and most troublesome Heresies in the Primitive Church, were about the Trinity. For (according to the usual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of Natural Philosophers) they could not abstain from disputing the very first Principles of Christianity, into which they were baptized, <hi>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi> Some there were that made them allegorical. Others would make one Creator of Good, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of Evil; which was in effect to set up two Gods, one contrary to another; supposing that causation of evil could not be attributed to God, without Impiety. From which Doctrine they are not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that now make the first cause of sinful actions to be every man as to his own sin. Others there were that would have God to be a body with Parts organical, as Face, Hands, Fore-parts and Back-parts. Others, that Christ had no real body, but was a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56428:248"/>
meer Phantasm: (For Phantasms were taken then, and have been ever since, by unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and superstitious men, for things real and subsistent.) Others denyed the Divinity of Christ. Others, that Christ being God and Man, was two Persons. Others confest he was one Person, and withal that he had but one Nature. And a great many other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies arose from the too much adherence to the Philosophy of those times, whereof some were supprest for a time by St. <hi>John</hi>'s pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing his Gospel, and some by their own unreasonableness vanished, and some lasted till the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and after.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great (made so by the assistance and valour of the Christian Souldiers) had attained to be the only <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperor, he also himself became a Christian, and caused the Temples of the Heathen Gods to be demolished, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Christian Religion only to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. But towards the latter end of his time, there arose a Dispute in the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> between <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop, and <hi>Arius</hi> a Presbyter of the same City; wherein <hi>Arius</hi> maintained, first, That Christ was inferiour to his Father; and afterwards, That he was no God, alleadging the words of Christ, <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi> The Bishop on the contrary alleadging the words
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56428:248"/>
of St. <hi>John, And the Word was God</hi>; and the words of St. <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God.</hi> This Controversie presently amongst the Inhabitants and Souldiers of <hi>Alexandria</hi> became a Quarrel, and was the cause of much Bloodshed in and about the City; and was likely then to spread further, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it did. This so far concerned the Emperors Civil Government, that he thought it necessary to call a General Council of all the Bishops and other eminent Divines throughout the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to meet at the City of <hi>Nice.</hi> When they were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they presented the Emperor with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of Accusation one against another. When he had received these Libels into his hands, he made an Oration to the Fathers assembled, exhorting them to agree, and to fall in hand with the settlement of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, for which cause he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled them, saying, Whatsoever they should decree therein, he would cause to be observed. <hi>This may perhaps seem a greater indifferency than would in these dayes be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of.</hi> But so it is in the History; and the Articles of Faith necessary to Salvation, were not thought then to be so many as afterwards they were defined to be by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56428:249"/>When <hi>Constantine</hi> had ended his Oration, he caused the aforesaid Libels to be cast into the fire, as became a wise King and a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Christian. This done, the Fathers fell in hand with their business, and following the method of a former Creed, now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>The Apostles Creed,</hi> made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, <hi>viz. I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> (in which is condemned the Polytheism of the Gentiles.) <hi>And in one Lord Iesus Christ the only begotten Son of God,</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the many sons of the many Gods of the Heathen.) <hi>Begotten of his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, God of God,</hi> (against the <hi>Arians) Uery God of very God,</hi> (against the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and against the Heresie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles,</hi> and others, who made Christ a meer Phantasm.) <hi>Light of Light,</hi> [This was put in for explication, and used before to that purpose, by <hi>Tertullian.] Begotten, not made, being of one Substance with the Father.</hi> In this again they condemn the Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi>: for this word <hi>Of one substance,</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Consubstantialis,</hi> but in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Of one Essence,</hi> was put as a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to discern an <hi>Arian</hi> from a <hi>Catholick</hi>: And much ado there was about it. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> himself, at the passing of this Creed, took notice of it for a hard word; but yet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56428:249"/>
approved of it, saying, That in a divine Mystery it was fit to use <hi>divina &amp; arcana Verba</hi>; that is, divine words, and hidden from humane understanding; calling that word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, divine, not because it was in the divine Scripture, (for it is not there) but because it was to him <hi>Arcanum,</hi> that is, not sufficiently understood. <hi>And in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain appeared the indifferency of the Emperor, and that he had for his end, in the calling of the Synod, not so much the Truth, as the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Doctrine, and peace of his People that depended on it.</hi> The cause of the obscurity of this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, proceeded chiefly from the difference between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect, in the Philosophy of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> The first Principle of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Nations, is, <hi>That God is,</hi> that is to say, that God really is Something, and not a meer fancy; but that which is really some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is considerable alone by it self, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>somewhere.</hi> In which sence a man is a thing real: for I can consider him <hi>to be,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering any other thing <hi>to be</hi> besides him. And for the same reason, the Earth, the Air, the Stars, Heaven, and their Parts, are all of them things real. And because whatsoever is real here, or there, or in any place, has Dimensions, that is to say, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; and that which hath Magnitude, whether it be visible or invisible, finite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

                     </gap>; but most of the Latine Philosophers use to convert <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> into <hi>substantia,</hi> and so confound real and corporeal things with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal; which is not well: For Essence and Substance signifie divers things. And this mistake is received, and continues still in these parts, in all Disputes both of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and Divinity: For in truth <hi>Essentia</hi> signifies no more, than if we should talk ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously of the <hi>Isness</hi> of the thing that is. [<hi>By whom all things were made.</hi>] This is proved out of St. <hi>John, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and <hi>Heb. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and that again out
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56428:250"/>
of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. where God is said to create eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by his sole Word, as when he said, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi> And then, that Christ was that Word, and in the beginning with God, may be gathered out of divers places of <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prophets. Nor was it ever questioned amongst Christians (except by the <hi>Arians</hi>) but that Christ was God Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and his Incarnation eternally decreed. But the Fathers, all that write Expositions on this Creed, could not forbear to philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize upon it, and most of them out of the Principles of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> Which are the same the School-men now use; as may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by this, that many of them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their Treatises of Religion, have affected to publish Logick and Physick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples according to the sense of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Damascene.</hi> And so some later Divines of <hi>Note,</hi> still confound the Concreet with the Abstract, <hi>Deus</hi> with <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Ens</hi> with <hi>Essentia, Sapiens</hi> with <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Aeternus</hi> with <hi>Aeternitas.</hi> If it be for exact and rigid Truth sake, why do they not say also, that Holiness is a Holy man, Covetousness a Covetous man, Hypocrisie an Hypocrite, and Drunkenness a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and the like, but that it is an Error? The Fathers agree that the Wisdom of God is the eternal Son of God, by whom all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56428:251"/>
things were made, and that he was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by the Holy Ghost, if they meant it in the Abstract: For if <hi>Deitas</hi> abstracted be <hi>Deus,</hi> we make two Gods of one. This was well understood by <hi>Damascene,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Fide Orthodoxâ,</hi> (which is an Exposition of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed) where he denies absolutely that <hi>Deitas</hi> is <hi>Deus,</hi> lest (seeing God was made man) it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the Deity was made man; which is contrary to the Doctrine of all the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers. The Attributes therefore of God in the Abstract, when they are put for God, are put <hi>Metonymically</hi>; which is a common thing in Scripture; for Example, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.28. where it is said, <hi>Before the mountains were setled, before the Hills was I brought forth</hi>; the Wisdom there spoken of being the Wisdom of God, signifies the same with the wise God. This kind of speaking is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ordinary in all Languages. This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, such abstracted words ought not to be used in Arguing, and especially in the deducing the Articles of our Faith; though in the Language of God's eternal Worship, and in all Godly Discourses, they cannot be avoided: And the Creed it self is less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be assented to in its own words, than in all such Expositions of the Fathers. <hi>Who for us men and our Salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56428:251"/>
Holy Ghost of the Uirgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and was made Man.</hi> I have not read of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to this: For where <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Creed says of the Son, <hi>He was not made, but begotten,</hi> it is to be understood of the Son as he was God Eternal; whereas here it is spoken of the Son as he is man. And of the Son also as he was man, it may be said he was begotten of the Holy Ghost; for a Woman conceiveth not but of him that begetteth; which is also confirmed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That which is begotten in her (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) is of the Holy Ghost. And was also Crucified for us under</hi> Pontius Pilate: <hi>He suffered and was buried: And the third day he rose again according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and ascended into Heaven: and sitteth on the right hand of the Father; And he shall come again with Glory to judge both the Quick and the Dead. Whose Kingdom shall have no end.</hi> [Of this part of the Creed I have not met with any doubt made by any Christian.] Hither the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> proceedeth in their general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, and no further.</p>
                  <p>This finished, some of the Bishops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Council (seventeen or eighteen, whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> was one) not sufficiently satisfied, refused to subscribe till this Doctrine of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter explained. Thereupon the Council De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56428:252"/>
that whosoever shall say that God hath parts, shall be Anathematized; to which the said Bishops subscribed. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> by Order of the Council wrote a Letter, the Copies whereof were sent to every absent Bishop, that being satisfied with the reason of their subscribing, they also should subscribe. The reason they gave of their Subscription was this, <hi>That they had now a form of words prescribed, by which, as a Rule, they might guide themselves so, as not to violate the Peace of the Church.</hi> By this it is manifest, that no man was an Heretick, but he that in plain and direct words contradicted that Form by the Church prescribed, and that no man could be made <hi>an Heretick by Consequence.</hi> And because the said Form was not put into the body of the Creed, but directed only to the Bishops, there was no reason to punish any Lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that should speak to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But what was the meaning of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That God has no Parts</hi>? Was it made Heresie to say, that God, who is a real sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, cannot be considered or spoken of as <hi>here</hi> or <hi>there,</hi> or any where, which are parts of places? Or that there is any real thing without length every way, that is to say, which hath no Magnitude at all, finite nor infinite? Or is there any whole substance, whose two halves or three thirds are not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56428:252"/>
the same with that whole? Or did they mean to condemn the Argument of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> by which he confuted <hi>Apolles</hi> and other Hereticks of his time; namely, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was not Corporeal, was nothing but Fantasm, and not Corporeal,</hi> for Heretical? No certainly, no Divines say that. They went to establish the Doctrine of <hi>One indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual God in Trinity</hi>; to abolish the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of species in God, not the distinction of <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there</hi> in substance. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> asked the <hi>Corinthians, Is Christ divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi> He did not think they thought him impossible to be considered as having hands and feet, but that they might think him (according to the manner of the Gentiles) one of the Sons of God, as <hi>Arius</hi> did; but not the only begotten Son of God. And thus also it is expounded in the Creed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> who was present in that Council, by these words, <hi>Not confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substances</hi>; that is to say, that God is not divided into three Persons, as man is divided into <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; nor are the three persons one and the same person. But <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and from him all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and other Learned Men, when they distinguish the general La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of a word, they call it Division; as when they divide <hi>Animal</hi> into Man and Beast, they call these <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Species</hi>; and when
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56428:253"/>
they again divide the <hi>Species</hi> Man into <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> they call these <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>partes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuae.</hi> And by this confounding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the substance with the distinction of words, divers men have been led into the Error of attributing to God a Name, which is not the name of any substance at all, <hi>viz. Incorporeal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these words, <hi>God has no parts,</hi> thus explained, together with the part of the <hi>Creed</hi> which was at that time agreed on, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those Heresies which were antecedent to that first General Council, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; as that of <hi>Manes,</hi> who appeared about thirty years before the Reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> by the first Article, <hi>I believe in one God</hi>; though in other words it seems to me to remain still in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which so ascribeth a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Will to Men, as that their Will and Purpose to commit sin, should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Cause of all things, God; but originally from themselves, or from the Devil. It may seem perhaps to some, that by the same words the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> also were then Condemned: And certainly, if by Parts were meant not persons Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, but Pieces, they were Condemned: For Face, Arms, Feet, and the like, are pieces. But this cannot be, for the <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites</hi> appeared not till the time of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56428:253"/>
the Emperor, which was after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> between forty and fifty years; and was not condemned till the second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the Punishment of Hereticks ordained by <hi>Constantine,</hi> we read of none; but that Ecclesiastical Officers, Bishops and other Preachers, if they refused to subscribe to this Faith, or taught the contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were for the first Fault Deprived of their Offices, and for the second Banished. And thus did Heresie, which at first was the name of private Opinion, and no Crime, by vertue of a Law of the Emperor, made only for the Peace of the Church, become a Crime in a Pastor, and punishable with Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on first, and next with Banishment.</p>
                  <p>After this part of the Creed was thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, there arose presently many new Heresies, partly about the Interpretation of it, and partly about the Holy Ghost, of which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council had not determined. Concerning the part established, there arose Disputes about the Nature of Christ, and the word <hi>Hypostasis, id est,</hi> Substance; for of Persons there was yet no mention made, the Creed being written in <hi>Greek,</hi> in which Language there is no word that answereth to the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Persona.</hi> And the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as the Fathers called it, of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine Nature in Christ, <hi>Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56428:254"/>
caused <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and after him <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus,</hi> to affirm, there was but one Nature in Christ; thinking that whensoever two things are united, they are one: And this was condemned as <hi>Arianism</hi> in the Councils of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought two living and rational Substances, such as are God and Man, must needs be also two <hi>Hypostases,</hi> maintained that Christ had two <hi>Hypostases:</hi> But these were two Heresies condemned together. Then concerning the Holy Ghost, <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, denied the Divinity thereof. And whereas about seventy years before the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council, there had been holden a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council at <hi>Carthage,</hi> wherein it was Decreed, that those Christians which in the Persecutions had denyed the Faith of Christ, should not be received again into the Church unless they were again baptized: This also was condemned, though the President in that Council were that most sincere and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Christian, <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And at last the Creed was made up entire as we have it, in the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Council, by addition of these words, <hi>And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son. Who with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; the Son together is Worshipped and Glorified. Who spake by the Prophets.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56428:254"/>
And I believe one Catholick &amp; Apostolick Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the Remission of Sins. And I look for the Resurrection of the Dead, and the Life of the World to come.</hi> In this addition are condemned, first the <hi>Nestorians</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in these words, <hi>Who with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son together is worshipped and glorified:</hi> And secondly the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in these words, <hi>I believe one Baptism for the Remission of Sins:</hi> For one Baptism is not there put as opposite to several sorts or manners of Baptism, but to the iteration of it: St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was a better Christian than to allow any Baptism that was not in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In the General Confession of Faith contained in the Creed called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, there is no mention of <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> nor of Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union, nor of Corporeal, nor of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, nor of Parts; the understanding of which words being not required of the Vulgar, but only of the Pastors, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement else might trouble the Church; nor were such Points necessary to Salvation, but set abroach for ostentation of Learning, or else to dazle men, with design to lead them towards some ends of their own. The Changes of prevalence in the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56428:255"/>
how the great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the most fierce of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> was banished by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and afterwards restored, and again banished, I let pass; only it is to be remembred, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> is suppos'd to have made his Creed then, when (banished) he was in <hi>Rome, Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being Pope; by whom, as is most likely, the word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> as it was in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed, was disliked: For the <hi>Roman</hi> Church could never be brought to receive it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof used their own word <hi>Persona.</hi> But the first and last words of that Creed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> refused not: For they make every Article, not only those of the body of the Creed, but all the Definitions of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Fathers to be such, as a man cannot be saved, unless he believe them all stedfastly; though made only for Peace sake, and to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the minds of the Clergy, whose Disputes were like to trouble the Peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. After these four first General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church grew up a pace; and either by the negligence or weakness of the succeeding Emperors, the Pope did what he pleased in Religion. <hi>There was no Doctrine which tended to the Power Ecclesiastical, or to the Reverence of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the contradiction whereof was not by one Council or another made Heresie, and punished arbitrarily by the Emperors with Banishment or Death.</hi> And at last Kings themselves, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56428:255"/>
Commonwealths, unless they purged their Dominions of Hereticks, were Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, Interdicted, and their Subjects let loose upon them by the Pope; insomuch as to an ingenuous and serious Christian, there was nothing so dangerous as to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own Salvation, of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; the careless cold Christian was safe, and the skilful Hypocrite a Saint. But this is a Story so well known, as I need not insist upon it any longer, but proceed to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks here in <hi>England,</hi> and what Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ordained for them by Acts of Parliament. All this while the Penal Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Hereticks were such, as the several Princes and States, in their own Dominions, thought fit to enact. The Edicts of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors made their Punishments Capital, but for the manner of the Execution, left it to the Prefects of Provinces: And when other Kings and States intended (according to the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) to extirpate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they ordained such Punishment as they pleased. The first Law that was here made for the punishments of Hereticks called <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards,</hi> and mentioned in the Statutes, was in the fifth year of the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, occasioned by the Doctrine of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> and his Followers; which <hi>Wickliff,</hi> because no Law was yet ordained for his punishment in Parliament, by the favour of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56428:256"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the King's Son, during the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had escaped. But in the fifth year of the next King, which was <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, there passed an Act of Parliament to this effect; That Sheriffs and some others should have Commissions to apprehend such as were certified by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to be Preachers of Heresie, their Fautors, Maintainers and Abettors, and to hold them in strong Prison, till they should justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, according to the Law of Holy Church. So that hitherto there was no Law in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by which a Heretick could be put to Death, or otherways punished, than by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning him till he was reconciled to the Church. After this, in the next King's Reign, which was <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, Son of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> by whom <hi>Wickliffe</hi> had been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>and who in his aspiring to the Crown had needed the good Will of the Bishops,</hi> was made a Law, in the second Year of his Reign, wherein it was Enacted, That every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary may convene before him, and imprison any person suspected of Heresie; and that an obstinate Heretick shall be burnt before the People.</p>
                  <p>In the next King's Reign, which was <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fifth, in his Second year, was made an Act of Parliament, wherein it is declared, that the intent of Hereticks, called <hi>Lollards,</hi> was to subvert the Christian Faith, the Law of God, the Church and the Realm: And that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56428:256"/>
an Heretick convict should forfeit all his Fee-simple Lands, Goods and Chattels, besides the Punishment of Burning. Again, in the Five and Twentieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, it was Enacted, That an Heretick convict shall abjure his Heresies, and refusing so to do, or relapsing, shall be burnt in open place, for example of others. This Act was made after the putting down of the Pope's Authority: And by this it appears, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth intended no farther alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Religion, than the recovering of his own Right Ecclesiastical. But in the first year of his Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth was made an Act, by which were repealed not only this Act, but also all former Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Doctrines, or matters of Religion; So that at this time there was no Law at all for the punishment of Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Again, in the Parliament of the first and second year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> this Act of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. was not repealed, but made useless, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the Statute of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and freely put it in execution; insomuch as it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, Whether or no they should proceed upon that Statute against the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> the Queens Sister.</p>
                  <p>The Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not long after by the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> coming to the Crown in the fifth year of her Reign, by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament repealed in the first place all the Laws Ecclesiastical of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with all other
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56428:257"/>
former Laws concerning the punishments of Hereticks, nor did she enact any other punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their place. In the second place it was Enacted, That the Queen by her Letters Patents should give a Commission to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with certain other persons, in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Name, to execute the Power Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical; in which Commission the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were forbidden to adjudge any thing to be Heresie, which was not declared to be Heresie by some of the first four General Councels: But there was no mention made of General Councels, but only in that branch of the Act which Authorised that Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commonly called <hi>The High Commission</hi>; nor was there in that Commission any thing concerning how Hereticks were to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but it was granted to them, that they might declare or not declare, as they pleased, to be Heresie or not Heresie, any of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which had been Condemned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie in the first four General Councels. So that during the time that the said High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was in being, there was no Statute by which a Heretick could be punished other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, than by the ordinary Censures of the Church; nor Doctrine accounted Heresie, unless the Commissioners had actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and published, That all that which was made Heresie by those Four Councels, should be Heresie also now: But I never heard that any such Declaration was made either by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56428:257"/>
Proclamation, or by Recording it in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or by publick Printing, as in penal Laws is necessary; the breaches of it are excused by ignorance: Besides, if Heresie had been made Capital, or otherwise civilly punishable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Four General Councels themselves, or at least the Points condemned in them, ought to have been Printed or put into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches in English, because without it, no man could know how to beware of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending against them.</p>
                  <p>Some men may perhaps ask, whether no body were Condemned and Burnt for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, during the time of the High Commission.</p>
                  <p>I have heard there were: But they which approve such executions, may peradventure know better grounds for them than I do; but those grounds are very well worthy to be enquired after.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in the seventeenth year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, shortly after that the <hi>Scots</hi> had Rebelliously put down the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians of <hi>England</hi> endeavoured the same here. The King, though he saw the Rebels ready to take the Field, would not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to that; but yet in hope to appease them, was content to pass an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the abolishing the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. But though the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were taken away, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having other ends besides the setting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56428:258"/>
up of the Presbyterate, pursued the Rebellion, and put down both Episcopacy and Monarchy, erecting a power by them called <hi>The Common-wealth,</hi> by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Rump,</hi> which men obeyed not out of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for fear, nor was there any humane Laws left in force to restrain any man from Preaching or Writing any Doctrine concerning Religion that he pleased; and in this heat of the War, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to disturb the Peace of the State, which then was none.</p>
                  <p>And in this time it was, that a Book called <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,</hi> was written in defence of the King's Power, Temporal and Spiritual, without any word against Episcopacy, or against any Bishop, or against the publick Doctrine of the Church. It pleas'd God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve years after the Usurpation of this <hi>Rump,</hi> to restore His most Gracious Majesty that now is, to his Fathers Throne, and presently His Majesty restored the Bishops, and pardoned the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians; but then both the one and the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused in Parliament this Book of Heresie, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bishops before the War had declared what was Heresie, when if they had, it had been made void by the putting down of the High Commission at the importunity of the Presbyterians: So fierce are men, for the most part, in dispute, where either their Learning or Power is debated, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of the Laws, but as soon as they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they cry out, <hi>Crucifige</hi>; forgetting what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, even in case of obstinate holding of an Error, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. The Servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in meekness instructing those that oppose, if God peradventure may give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth: <hi>Of which counsel, such fierceness as hath appeared in the Disputation of Divines, down from before the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>to this present time, is a Violation.</hi>

                  <p>With an Apology for Himself, and his WRITINGS.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I do here most humbly present to Your Sacred Majesty, is the best Part of my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the Natural Causes of Events, both of such as are commonly known, and of such as have been of late artificially exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Curious.</p>
                  <p>They are ranged under seven Heads. <hi>1. Problems of Gravity. 2. Problems of Tides. 3. Problems of</hi> Vacuum. <hi>4. Problems of Heat. 5. Problems of Hard and Soft. 6. Problems of Wind and Weather. 7. Problems of Motion Perpendicular, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56428:260"/>
&amp;c. To which I have added, <hi>Two Propositions of Geometry;</hi> One is, <hi>The Duplication of the Cube, hitherto sought in vain;</hi> The other, <hi>A Detection of the absurd Use of Arithmetick, as it is now applied to Geometry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Natural Causes hath not infallible and evident Principles. For there is no Effect which the Power of God cannot produce by many several ways.</p>
                  <p>But seeing all Effects are produced by Motion, he that supposing some one or more Motions can derive from them the necessity of that Effect whose Cause is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, has done all that is to be expected from Natural Reason. And though he prove not that the thing was thus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet he proves that thus it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when the Materials, and the power of Moving is in our hands; which is as useful as if the Causes themselves were known. And notwithstanding the absence
<pb facs="tcp:56428:260"/>
of rigorous Demonstration, this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Nature (if not rendred obscure by empty terms) is the most Noble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Mind that can be, to such as are at leisure from their necessary Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
                  <p>This that I have done I know is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Present to be offered to a <hi>KING,</hi> though considered (as God considers Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings) together with the Mind and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Offerer, I hope will not be to Your Majesty unacceptable.</p>
                  <p>But that which I chiefly consider in it is, that my Writing should be tryed by Your Majesties Excellent Reason untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Language that has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or made use of by Men when they were puzzled; and who is acquainted with all the Experiments of the time; and whose approbation (if I have the good Fortune to obtain it) will protect my reasoning from the Contempt of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56428:261"/>I will not break the custom of joyning to my Offering a Prayer; And it is, <hi>That Your Majesty will be pleased to pardon this following short Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my</hi> Leviathan. Not that I rely upon Apologies, but upon Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties most Gracious General Pardon.</p>
                  <p>That which is in it of Theology, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the general Current of Divines, is not put there as my Opinion, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with submission to those that have the Power Ecclesiastical.</p>
                  <p>I did never after, either in Writing or Discourse, maintain it.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in it against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy;</hi> I cannot therefore imagine what reason any Episcopal-man can have to speak of me (as I hear some of them do) as of an <hi>Atheist,</hi> or man of no Religion, unless it be for making the Authority of the Church wholly upon the Regal Power; which I hope Your Majesty will think is neither Atheism nor Heresie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56428:261"/>But what had I to do to meddle with matters of that nature, seeing Religion is not <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but <hi>Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was written in a time when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Christ's Kingdom was made use of for the most horrid Actions that can be imagined; And it was in just Indignation of that, that I desired to see the bottom of that Doctrine of the Kingdom of Christ, which divers Ministers then Preached for a Pretence to their Rebellion; which may reasonably extenuate, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the writing of it.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore no ground for so great a Calamny in my writing. There is no sign of it in my Life; and for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when I was at the point of Death at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> can bear witness of it, if he be asked. Therefore, I most humbly beseech Your Sacred Majesty not to believe so ill of me upon reports, that proceed often (and may do so now) from the displeasure which commonly ariseth from difference in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb facs="tcp:56428:262"/>
nor to think the worse of me, if snatching up all the Weapons to fight against Your Enemies, I lighted upon one that had a double edge.</p>

                           <hi>WHat may be the cause, think you, that stones, and other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, thrown upward, or carried up and left to their liberty, fall down again (for ought a man can see) of their own accord? I do not think (with the old Philosophers) that they have any love to the Earth, or are sullen, that they will neither go nor stay. And yet I cannot imagine what body there is above that should drive them back.</hi>

                        <p>For my part, I believe the cause of their descending is not in any natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the bodies that descend, but rather that the Globe of the Earth hath some special motion, by the which it more easily casteth off the Air, than it doth other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And then this descent of those we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56428:263"/>
call heavy bodies, must of necessity follow; unless there be some empty spaces in the world to receive them. For when the Air is thrown off from the Earth, somewhat must come into the place of it, (in case the world be full) and it must be those things which are hardliest cast off, that is those things which we say are heavy.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But suppose there be no place empty (for I will defer the Question till anon) how can the Earth cast off either the Air, or any thing else?</hi>

                        <p>I shall shew you how, and that by a familiar Example. If you lay both your hands upon a Basen with water in it, how little soever, and move it circularly, and continue that motion for a while, and you shall see the water rise upon the sides, and fly over; by which you may be assured that there is a kind of circulating motion, which would cast off such bodies as are contiguous to the body so moved.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I know very well there is; and it is the same motion which Country people use to purge their Corn; For the Chaff and Straws, by casting the Grain to the side of the Seive, will come towards the middle. But I would see the Figure.</hi>

                        <p>Here it is. There is a Circle pricked out, whose Center is A, and three less Circles, whose Centers are B, C, D; let
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56428:263"/>
every one of them represent the Earth, as it goeth from B to C, and from C to D, always touching the uttermost Circle, and throwing off the Air, as is marked at E and F. And if the world were not full, there would follow by this scattering of the Air, a great deal of space left empty. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the world full, there must be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual shifting of the Air, one part into the place of another.</p>

                        <p>If the Air be thrown up beyond G, it will follow, that at the last, if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be continued, all the Air will be above G, that is, above the stone; which cannot be, till the stone be at the Earth.</p>

                        <p>Because as it descends, and is already in motion, it receiveth a new impression from the same cause, which is the Air, whereof as part mounteth, part also must descend, supposing as we have done the plenitude of the world. For, as you may observe by the Figure, the motion of the Earth, according to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the uttermost Circle, is progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; and so the whole motion is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of two motions, one circular, and the other progressive; and consequently the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56428:264"/>
Air ascends and circulates at once. And because the stone descending receiveth a new pressure in every point of its way, the motion thereof must needs be accelerated.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis true; For it will be accelerated equally in equal times; and the way it makes will encrease in a double proportion to the times, as hath heretofore been demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> Galileo. <hi>I see the solution now of an Experiment, which before did not a little puzzle me. You know that if two plummets hang by two strings of equal length, and you remove them from the perpendicular equally, I mean in equal angles, and then let them go, they will make their turns and returns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in equal times; And though the arches they describe grow continually less and less, yet the times they spend in the greater arches, will still be equal to the time they spend in the lesser.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis true. Do you find any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrary?</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Yes; For if you remove one of the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets from the perpendicular, so as (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) to make an angle with the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of</hi> 80 <hi>degrees, and the other so as to make an angle of</hi> 60 <hi>degrees, they will not make their turns and returns in equal times.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Because the arches are the spaces which these two motions describe, they must be in double proportion to their own times; which cannot be, unless they be let go from equal altitudes, that is, from equal angles.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis right; and the Experiment does not cross, but confirm the equality of the times in all the arches they describe, even from 90 degrees to the least part of one degree.</p>

                           <hi>But is it not too bold, if not extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, an assertion, to say the Earth is moved as a man shakes a Basen or a Seive? Does not the Earth move from West to East every day once, upon his own Center, and in the Ecliptick Circle once a year? And now you give it another odd motion; How can all these consist in one and the same body?</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Well enough. If you be a Shipboard under sail, do not you go with the Ship? Cannot you also walk upon the Deck? Cannot every drop of bloud move at the same time in your veins? How many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now do you assign to one and the same drop of bloud? Nor is it so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a thing to attribute to the Earth this kind of motion; but that I believe if we certainly knew what motion it is that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the descent of bodies, we should find it either the same, or more extravagant. But seeing it can be nothing above that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56428:265"/>
worketh this effect, it must be the Earth it self that does it; and if the Earth, then you can imagine no other motion to do it withal, but this; And you will wonder more, when by the same motion I shall give you a probable account of the causes of very many other works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        <p>I suppose them to be the same with the Poles of the Ecliptick. For, seeing the Axis of the Earth in this Nation, and in the annual motion keeps parallel to it self, the Axis must in both motions be parallel as to sense. For, the Circle which the Earth describes, is not of visible magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at the distance it is from the Sun.</p>

                           <hi>Though I understand well enough how the Earth may make a stone descend very swiftly under the Ecliptick, or not far from it, where it throws off the Air perpendicularly; yet about the Poles of the Circle methinks it should cast off the Air very weakly. I hope you will not say that bodies descend faster in places remote from the Poles, than nearer to them.</hi>

of the Air towards the Poles; And then there will be the same necessity for the descent there, that there is in other places, though perhaps a little more slowly. For you may have observed that when it snows in the South Parts, the flakes of Snow are not so great as in the North; which is a probable sign they fall in the South from a greater height, and consequently disperse themselves more, as water does that falls down from a high and steep Rock.</p>

                        <p>It is indeed the Earth that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth off that Air which is next unto it. But it is that Air which casteth off the next Air; and so continually Air moveth Air; which it can more easily do then any other thing, because like bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are more susceptible of one anothers motions; as you may see in two Lute-strings equally strained, what motion one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56428:266"/>
string being stricken communicates to the Air, the same will the other receive from the Air; but strained to a differing note, will be less, or not at all moved.

                        <p>The motion I have hitherto supposed but in the Earth, I suppose also in the Moon, and in all those great Bodies that hang in the Air constantly, I mean the Stars, both fixed and errant. And for the Sun and Moon, I suppose the Poles of their motion to be the Poles of the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi>; which supposed, it will follow, (because the Sun, the Earth and the Moon at every Full and Change are almost in one streight line) that this motion of the Earth will be made swifter than in the Quarters. For this motion of the Sun and Moon being communicated to the Earth, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the like motion, maketh the same greater; and much greater when they are all three in one streight line, which is only at the Full and Change, whose Tides are therefore called Spring Tides.</p>

                        <p>At other times of the year, the Earth being out of the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> the motion thereof, by which the Tides are made, will be less augmented, by so much as a motion in the obliquity of 23 degrees

or thereabout (which is the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> and Ecliptick Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) is weaker then the motion which is without obliquity.</p>

                           <hi>All this is reasonable enough, if it be possible that such motions as you suppose in these bodies, be really there. But that is a thing I have some reason to doubt of; For, the throwing off of Air, consequent to these motions, is the cause, you say, that other things come to the Earth; And therefore the like motions in the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, casting off the Air, should also cause all other things to come to every one of them. From whence it will follow, that the Sun, Moon, and Earth, and all other bodies but Air, should presently come together into one heap.</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>That does not follow: For if two bodies cast off the Air, the motion of that Air will be repress'd both ways, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a course towards the Poles on both sides; and then the two bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly come together.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis true. And besides, this driving off the Air on both sides, North and South, makes the like motion of Air there also. And this may answer to the Question, How a stone could fall to the Earth under the Poles of the Ecliptick, by the only casting off of Air?</hi>

                        <p>It follows from hence, that there is a certain and determinate distance of one of these bodies (the Stars) from another, without any very sensible variation.</p>

                           <hi>All this is probable enough, if it be true that there is no</hi> Vacuum, <hi>no place empty in all the World. And supposing this motion of the Sun and Moon to be in the plain of the</hi> Aequinoctial, <hi>methinks that this should be the cause of the Diurnal motion of the Earth; And because this motion of the Earth is (you say) in the plain of the</hi> Aequinoctial, <hi>the same should cause also a motion in the Moon on her own Center, answerable to the Diurnal motion of the Earth.</hi>

                        <p>Suppose there be <hi>Vacuum</hi> in that Air into which the Marble you pull off is to succeed, shall there be no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Air that was round about the two Marbles when they touched? Why cannot that <hi>Vacuum</hi> come into the place between? Air cannot succeed in an instant, because a body; and consequently cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through the least space in an instant. But emptiness is not a body, nor is moved, but made by the act it self of separation. There is therefore (if you admit <hi>Vacuum</hi>) no necessity at all for the Air to fill the space left, in an instant. And therefore, with what ease the Marble coming off presseth out the <hi>Vacuum</hi> of the Air behind it, with the same ease will the Marbles be pulled assunder. Seeing then, if there were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56428:270"/>
                           <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there would be no difficulty of Separation; it follows, because there is difficulty of separation, that there is no <hi>Vacuum.</hi>

                        <p>Take a piece of soft wax; Do not you think the one half touches the other half as close as the smoothest Marbles? yet you can pull them assunder. But how? still as you pull, the wax grows continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more and more slender; there being a perpetual parting or discession of the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost part of the wax one from another; which the Air presently fills, and so there is a continual lessening of the wax, till it be no bigger than a hair, and at last sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If you can do the same to a Pillar of Marble, till the outside give way, the effect will be the same, but much quicker, after it once begins to break in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies; because the force that can master the first resistance of the hardness, will quickly dispatch the rest.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>How comes the wind in? You know the Engine is a hollow round pipe of brass; into which is thrust a Cylinder of wood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Leather, and fitted to the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder so exactly as no Air can possibly pass between the leather and the brass?</hi>

                        <p>I know it; and that they may thrust it up, there is a hole left in the Cylinder to let the Air out before it; which they can stop when they please. There is also in the bottom of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder a passage into a hollow Globe of Glass; which passage they can also open and shut at pleasure. And at the top of that Globe there is a wide mouth to put in what they please to try conclusions on; and that also to be opened and shut as shall be needful. 'Tis of the nature of a Pop-gun which Children use, but great, costly, and more ingenious. They thrust forward, and pull back the wooden Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder (because it requires much strength) with an Iron screw. What is there in all this to prove the possibility of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56428:271"/>
of Brass close stopped, how can it be drawn back, as with the screw they draw it, but that the space it leaves must needs be empty. For it is impossible that any Air can pass into the place to fill it?</hi>

                        <p>Truly I think it close enough to keep out Straw and Feathers, but not to keep out Air, nor yet matter. For suppose they were not so exactly close but that there were round about a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for a small hair to lye between, Then will the pulling back of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of wood force so much Air in, as in retiring it forces back, and that without any sensible difficulty. And the Air will so much more swiftly enter as the passage is left more narrow. Or if they touch, and the contract be in some points, and not in all, the Air will enter as before in case the force be augmented accordingly. Lastly, though they touch exactly, if either the Leather yield, or the Brass (which it may do to the force of a strong screw) the Air will again enter. Do you think it possible to make two superficies so exquisitly touch in all points as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or Leather so hard as not to yield to the force of a screw? The Body of Leather will give passage both to Air and Water, as you will confess when you ride in Rainy and Windy weather. You
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56428:272"/>
may therefore be assured that in drawing out their wooden-leather Cylinder they force in as much Air as will fill the place it leaves, and that with as much swiftness as is answerable to the strength that drives it in. The effect therefore of their pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is nothing else but a vehement Wind, a very vehement Wind coming in on all sides of the Cylinder at once into the hollow of the Brass Pipe, and into the hollow of the Glass Globe joyned to it.</p>

                           <hi>I see the reason already of one of their wonders, which is, that the Cylinder they pump with, if it be left to it self, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is pulled back will swiftly go up again.

                        <p>Besides, you know, when they have sucked out (as they think) all the Air from the Glass Globe, they can neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less both see through it what is done, and hear a sound from within when there is any made. Which (if there were no

                        <p>The stream of Air that from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side meeting together, and turning in an infinite number of small points, do pierce the Bladder in innumerable places with great violence at once, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny invisible small wimbles; especially if the Bladder be a little blown before it be put in, that it may make a little resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And when the Air has once pierced it, it is easie to conceive, that it must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the same violent motion be extended till it break. If before it break you let in fresh Air upon it, the violence of the motion will thereby be tempered, and the Bladder be less extended. For that also they have observed. Can you imagine how a Bladder should be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and broken, by being too full of Emptiness.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56428:274"/>
by not receiving it into his mouth. And so with a great deal of labour glues his lips to the neck of the Vial. Then taking it off, and dipping the neck of the Vial into the water before the circulation cease, the Air with the endeavour it hath now gotten, pierces the water and goes out. And so much Air as goes out, so much matter comes up into the room of it.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56428:275"/>
by the motion I suppose both in the Sun, and in the Earth, the Air is dissipated, and consequently that there would be an infinite number of small empty places but that the World being full, there comes from the next parts other Air into the spaces, they would else make empty. When therefore this motion of the Sun is excercised upon the Superficies of the Earth, if there do not come out of the Earth it self some corporal substance to supply that tearing of the Air, we must return again to the admission of <hi>Vacuum.</hi> If there do, then you see how by this motion fluid bodies are made to exhale out of the Earth. The like happens to a mans body or hand, which when he perceives, he says he is Hot. And so of the Earth when it sendeth forth Water and Earth together in Plants, we say it does it by Heat from the Sun.</p>

of the Air by the reciprocal and contrary motions of the two pieces of wood, which necessarily causeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of whatsoever is Aereal or fluid within them, and (the motion pursued) a dissipation also of the other more solid parts into Ashes.</p>

                        <p>Heat does not cause Light at all.

                        <p>You know the rubbing or heard pressing of the Eye, or a stroke upon it makes an apparition of Light without and before it, which way soever you look. This can proceed from nothing else but from the restitution of the Organ pressed or stricken, unto its former ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary situation of parts. Does not the Sun by his thrusting back the Air upon your eyes press them? Or does not those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies whereon the Sun shines (though by reflection) do the same, though not so strongly? And do not the Organs of Sight, the Eye, the Heart, and Brains resist that pressure by an endeavour of restitution outwards? Why then should there not be without and before the Eye, an apparition of Light in this case as well as in the other?</p>

                           <hi>I grant there must. But what is that which appears after the pressing of the eye? For there is nothing without, that was not there before; or if there were, methinks another should see it better, or as well as he; or if in the dark, methinks it should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the place.</hi>

                        <p>It is a fancy, such as is the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your face in a Looking-glass; such as is a Dream; such as is a Ghost; such as is a spot before the Eye that hath stared upon the Son or Fire. For all these
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56428:276"/>

                        <p>So it is. Though the Sun it self be a real Body, yet that bright Circle of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a foot Diameter cannot be the Sun, unless there be two Suns, a greater and a lesser. And because you may see that which you call the Sun, both above you in the Skie, and before you in the Water, and two Suns (by distorting your Eye) in two places of the Skie, one of them must needs be Fancy. And if one, both. All sense is Fancy though the cause be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a real Body.</p>

Motion in its parts that I have all this while supposed in the Sun and Earth. In which Motion there must needs be a competent degree of swiftness, to move the sense, that is, to make it visible. All Bodies that are not fluid will shine with Heat, if the Heat be very great. Iron will shine and Gold will shine; but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not, because the parts are carried away before they attain to that degree of swiftness; which is requisite.</p>

                        <p>Nothing, but that it was the Wine that caused it; which having a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that Motion before, did when it was Heated in the Veins, give that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion (which you thought was in the window,) to the Veins themselves, and (by the continuation of the parts of mans Body) to the Brain; and that was it which made the window seem to move.</p>

                           <hi>What is Flame? For I have often thought the Flame that comes out of a small heap of Straw, to be more (before it hath done Flaming,) then a hundred times the Straw it self.</hi>

                        <p>It was but your Fancy. If you take a stick in your hand by one end, the other end burning, and move it swiftly, the burning end, if the Motion be circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, shall seem a circle; if streight, a streight line of Fire, longer or shorter, according to the swiftness of the Motion, or to the space it moves in.

                           <hi>I think it is, because the impression of that visible Object, which was made at the first instant of the Motion did last till it was ended. For then it will follow that it

must be visible all the way, the impressions in all points of the time being equal.</hi>

                        <p>The cause can be no other.

                        <p>The Air moved by the Sun presseth the convex glass in such manner as the action continued through it, proceedeth not in the same streight line by which it proceeded from the Sun, but tendeth more toward the center of the body it enters. Also when the action is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued through the convex body it bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again the same way. By which means the whole action of the Sun-beams are enclosed within a very small compass; in which place therefore there must be a very vehement Motion; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if there be in that place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible matter, such as is not very hard kindle, the parts of it will be dissipated, and receive that Motion which worketh on the Eye as other Fire does.</p>
                        <p>The same reason is to be given for burning by Reflection. For there also the Beams are collected into almost a point.</p>

llght their Tobacco at the Sun with a burning glass, or with a ball of Cristal, held which way they will indifferently. Which must be impossible, unless the ball were all pores. Again, neither you nor I can conceive any other Fire then we have seen, nor then such as water will put out.

                        <p>That body whereof no one part is easily put out of its place, without removing the whole, is that which I and all men call Hard; and the contrary Soft. So that they, are but degrees one of another.</p>

                           <hi>What is the cause that makes one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Harder then another, or (seeing you say they are but degrees of one another) what makes one body Softer then another, and the same body sometimes Harder, sometimes Softer?</hi>

                        <p>The same Motion which we have supposed from the beginning for the cause of so many other effects. Which Motion not being upon the center of the part moved, but the part it self going in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother circle to and again, it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the Motion be perfectly circular. For it is not circulation, but the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I mean the to and again that does cast off, and lacerrate the Air, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently produce the fore-mentioned effects.</p>

                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56428:280"/>For the cause therefore of Hardness, I suppose the reciprocation of Motion in those things which are Hard, to be very swift, and in very small circles.</p>

                        <p>How are you sure? You have no argument for it, but that you do not see the Motion. When I see you sitting still, must I believe there is no Motion in your parts within, when there are so many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince me there is.</p>

                        <p>If the Bow had been crooked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was bent, and a string tied to both ends, and then cut asunder, the Bow would not have stir'd. Where lies the difference?</p>

                           <hi>I mean a Prnciple or beginning of Motion in a contrary way to that of the force which bent it.</hi>

                        <p>But the beginning of Motion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Motion, how insensible soever it be. And you know that nothing can give a beginning of Motion to it self. What is it therefore that gives the Bow (which you say you are sure was at rest when it stood bent) its first endeavour to return to its former posture?</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>It was he that bent it.</hi>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>That cannot be. For he gave it an endeavour to come forward, and the Bow endeavours to go backward.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Well, grant that endeavour be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Motion in the Bow unbent, how do you derive from thence, that being set at liberty it must return to its former posture?</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>Thus There being within the Bow a swift (though invisible) Motion of all the parts, and consequently of the whole; the bending causeth that Motion, which was along the Bow (that was beaten out when it was hot into that length) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56428:281"/>
a cross the length in every part of it, and the more by how much it is more bent; and consequently endeavours to unbend it all the while it stands bent. And therefore when the force which kept it bent is removed, it must of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the posture it had before.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But has that endeavour no effect at all before the impediment be removed? For if endeavour be Motion, and every Motion have some effect more or less, methinks this endavour should in time produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>So it does. For in time (in a long time) the course of this internal Motion will lie along the Bow, not according to the former, but to the new acquired posture. And then it will be as uneasie to return it to its former posture, as it was before to bend it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That's true. For Bows long bent lose their appetite to restitution, long custom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming nature. But from this internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation of the parts, how do you infer the Hardness of the whole Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>If you apply force to any single part of such a body, you must needs disorder the Motion of the next parts to it before it yield, and there disordered, the Motion of the next again must also be disordered; and consequently no one part can yield
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56428:281"/>
without force sufficient to disorder all. But then the whole body must also yield. Now when a body is of such a nature as no single part can be removed without removing the whole, men say that body is Hard.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Why does the Fire melt divers Hard bodies, and yet not all?</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>The hardest bodies are those wherein the Motion of the parts are the most swift, and yet in the least circles.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if the Fire, the Motion of whose parts are swift, and in greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles, he made so swift, as to be strong enough to master the Motion of the parts of the Hard body, it will make those parts to move in a greater compass, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by weaken their resistance, that is to say, Soften them, which is a degree of liquefaction. And when the Moton is so weakened, as that the parts lose their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence by the force of their own weight, then we count the body melted.</p>

                        <p>In bending a Hard body, as (for example) a Rod of Iron, you do not inlarge the space of the internal Motion of the parts of Iron, as the Fire does;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56428:282"/>
but you master and interrupt the Motion, and that chiefly in one place. In which place the Motion that makes the Iron Hard being once overcome, the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that bending must needs suddenly master the Motions of the parts next unto it, being almost mastered before.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I have seen a small piece of glass, the figure whereof is this</hi> AABC. <hi>Which piece of glass if you bend toward the top, as in</hi> C, <hi>the whole body will shatter asunder into a Million of pieces, and be like to so much dust. I would fain see you give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reason of that.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>I have seen the Experiment. The making of the glass, is thus, They dip an Iron Rod into the molten glass that stands in a Vessel within the Furnace. Upon which Iron Rod taken out, there will hang a drop of molten but tough Mettal of the figure you have described, which they let fall into the water. So that the main drop comes first to the water, and after it the tail, which though streight whilst it hung on the end of the Rod, yet by falling into the water becomes croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Now you know the making of it, you may consider what must be the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. Because the main drop A comes first to the water, it is therefore first quenched, and consequently that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56428:282"/>
of the parts of that drop, which by the Fire were made to be moved in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger compass, is by the water made to shrink into lesser circles towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end B, but with the same or not much less swiftness.</p>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>If you take any long piece of Iron, Glass, or other uniform and continued body; and having Heated one end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you hold the other end in your hand, and so quench it suddenly, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you held it easily enough, yet now it will burn your fingers.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>A.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It will so.</hi>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>You see then how the Motion of the parts from A toward C is made more violent and in less compass by quenching the other parts first. Besides, the whole Motion that was in all the parts of the main drop A, is now united in the small end BC. And this I take to be the cause why that small part BC is so exceeding stiff. Seeing also this Motion in every small part of the glass, is not only circular, but proceeds also all along the glass from A to B, the whole Motion compounded will be such as the Motion of Spinning any Soft matter unto Thread, and will dispose the whole body of the glass in Threads, which in other Hard bodies are called the grain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56428:283"/>Therefore if you bend this body (for example) in C (which to do will require more force then a man would think that has not tryed) those threads of Glass must needs be all bent at the same time, and stand so, till by the breaking of the Glass at C, they be all at once set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And then all at once being sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly unbent, like so many brittle, and over-bent Bows, their Strings breaking, be shivered in pieces.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis like enough to be so. And if nature have betrayed her self in any thing, I think it is in this, and in that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Cross-bow; which strongly and evidently demonstrates the internal reciprocation of the Motion, which you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be in the internal parts of every Hard body. And I have observed somewhat in Looking-glasses which much confirms that there is some such Motion in the internal parts of Glass, as you have supposed for the cause of Hardness. For let the Glass be</hi> AB, <hi>and let the Object at</hi> C <hi>be a Candle, and the Eye at</hi> D. <hi>Now by divers Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Refractions in the two superficies of the Glass, if the Lines of Vision be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oblique, you shall see many images of the Candle, as</hi> E, F, G, <hi>in such order and position as is here described.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56428:283"/>
                           <hi>they will appear in a situation manifestly different from this. Which you will yet more plainly perceive if the Looking-Glass be coloured, as I have observed in Red and Blew Glasses; and could never conceive any probable cause of it, till now you tell me of this secret Motion of the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross the grain of the Glass, acquired by cooling it this or that way.</hi>

                           <hi>We see water Hardened every Frosty day. It's likely therefore you may give a pribable cause of Ice. What is the cause of Freezing of the Ocean towards the Poles of the Earth?</hi>

sides be a great Stream of Air towards the Poles, shaving the superficies of the Earth and Sea, in the Northern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Climates. This shaving of the Earth and Sea by the Stream of Air must needs contract and make to shrink those little Circles of the internal parts of Earth and Water, and consequently Harden them, first at the superficies, into a thin skin, which is the first Ice; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same Motion continuing, and the first Ice co-operating, the Ice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thicker. And this I conceive to be the cause of the Freezing of the Ocean.</p>

                           <hi>If that be the cause, I need not ask how a Bottle of water is made to Freeze in warm weather with Snow, or Ice mingled with Salt. For when the Bottle is in the midst of it, the Wind that goeth out both of the Salt and of the Ice as they dissolve, must needs shave the superficies of the Bottle, and the Bottle work accordingly on the water without it, and so give it first a thin skin, and at last thicken it into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid piece of Ice.

                        <p>A deep Pit is a very thick Bottle, and such as the Air cannot come at but only at the top, or where the Earth is very loose and spungy.</p>

                        <p>So it will when the Frost is great enough. But the internal Motion of the parts of Wine and other Heating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors is in greater Circles and stronger then the Motion of the parts of water; and therefore less easily to be Frozen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specally quite through, because those parts that have the strongest Motion retire to the center of the Vessel.</p>

                        <p>The motion of the Air (such as I have described to you already) tending to the dis-union of the parts of the Air, must needs cause a continual endeavour (there being no possibility of <hi>Vacuum</hi>) of whatsoever fluid parts there are upon the face of the Earth and Sea, to supply the place which would else be empty.</p>
                        <p>This makes the water, and also very small and loose parts of the Earth and Sea
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56428:285"/>
to rise, and mingle themselves with the Air, and to become mist and Clouds. Of which the greatest quantity arise there, where there is most water, namely, from the large parts of the Ocean; which are the South Sea, the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, and the Sea that divideth <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>America</hi>; over which the Sun, for the greatest part of the year is perpendicular, and consequently raiseth a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water.

                        <p>It is likely it would also hold them up, if they did not grow greater by meeting together, nor were carried away by the Air towards the Poles.</p>

                        <p>It is not improbable that they are carried against Hills, and there stopt till more overtake them. And when they are carried towards the North or South where the force of the Sun is more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que and thereby weaker, they descend gently by their own weight. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tend all to the center of the Earth, they must needs be united in their way for want of room, and so grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

                        <p>Because perhaps when the water is drawn up higher then the highest Mountains, where the course of the Air between the Aequator and the Poles is free from stopping, the Stream of the Air Freezeth it into Snow. And 'tis in those places only where the Hills shelter it from that Stream, that it falls in Rain.</p>

                        <p>The cause of the falling of Rain, I told you was the the stopping, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the collection of Clouds about great Mountains, especially when the Sun is near the Aequinoctial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draws up the water more potently, and from greater Seas. If you consider therefore that the Mountains in which are the springs of <hi>Nile,</hi> lye near the Aequinoctial and are exceeding great, and near the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, you will not think it strange there should be great store of Snow.

                        <p>No doubt but there is a greater descent of water there in their Summer then at other times; as there must be wheresoever there is much Snow melted. But what should that innundate, unless it should overflow the Sea that comes close to the foot of those Mountains? And for the cause why it seldom Rains in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it may be this, That there are no very high Hills near it to collect the Clouds. The Mountains whence <hi>Nile</hi> riseth being near 2000 Miles off.

                        <p>If nothing could move a Cloud but Wind, your objection were good. But you allow a Cloud to descend by it's own weight. But when it so descends, it must needs move the Air before it, even to the Earth, and the Earth again repel it, and so make lateral Winds every way. Which will carry forwards other Clouds if there be any in their way, but not the Cloud that made them The Vapour of the water rising into Clouds, must needs also as they rise, raise a Wind?</p>

maketh the Stone (or other matter it hits) to retire in a perpendicular to that flat; or, if the Wall be round, towards the center, that is to say, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly. For if the way of the motion be oblique to the Wall, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is compounded of two motions, one parrallel to the Wall, and the other perpendicular. By the former whereof the Bullet is carried along the Wall side, by the other it approacheth to it. Now the former of these motions can have no effect upon it; all the battery is from the motion perpendicular, in which it approacheth. And therefore the part it hits must also retire perpendicularly. If it were not so, a Bullet with the same swiftness would execute as much oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shot, as perpendicularly; which you know it does not.</p>

For I have seen a Board set upon four truckles, with a staff set up in the midst of it for a Mast, and another very thin and broad Board fastned to that staff in the stead of a Sail; and so set as to receive the Wind very obliquely, I mean so as to be within a point of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56428:288"/>
Compass directly opposite to it; and so placed upon a reasonable smooth pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the Wind blew somewhat strongly. The event was first, that it stood doubting whether it should stir at all or no, but that was not long; and then it ran a head extream swiftly, till it was overthrown by a Rub.</p>

                        <p>'Tis not the <hi>Rudder</hi> only, there must also be a stream to do it; you shall never turn a Ship with a <hi>Rudder</hi> in a standing pooll, nor in a natural current.</p>
                        <p>You must make a stream from head to stern, either with Oares or with Sails: when you have made such a stream, the turning of the <hi>Rudder</hi> obliquely holds the Water from passing freely; and the Ship or Boat cannot go on directly, but as the <hi>Rudder</hi> inclines to the stern, so will the Ship turn. But this is too well known to insist upon: you have observed, that the Rudders of the greatest Ships are not very broad, but go deep into the Water, whereas Western Barges, though but small Vessels, have their Rudders much broader, which argues that the holding of Water from passing is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56428:289"/>
office of a Rudder: and therefore to a Ship that draws much Water the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is made deep accordingly, and in Barges that draw little Water, the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as less deep, must so much the more be extended in breadth.</p>

                        <p>The same cause which (speaking of Hardness) I supposed for the cause of Ice. For the Stream of Air proceeding from.

                        <p>It is especially in Summer; and hot weather, that the drops of Water which make the Clouds, are great enough; but it is then also that Clouds are sooner and more plentifully carryed up.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56428:289"/>
the drops of Water, not in the Cloud it self, but as they are falling. Nor does it freeze them throughly, the time of their falling not permitting it, but gives them only a thin coat of Ice; as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by their suddain dissolving.</p>

                        <hi>IF a Bullet from a certain point given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be shot against a wall Perpendicularly and again from the same Point Oblique, What will be the proportion of the Forces wherewith they urge the wall?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For Example, let the wall be</hi> AB, <hi>a point given</hi> E, <hi>a Gun</hi> CE <hi>that carries the Bullet Perpendicularly to</hi> F, <hi>and another Gun</hi> DE <hi>that carries the like Bullet with the same swiftness Oblique to</hi> G; <hi>In what proportion will their Forces be upon the Wall?</hi>

                        <p>The force of the stroke Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular from E to F will be greater then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56428:292"/>
the Oblique force from E to G, in the proportion of the line EG to the line EF.</p>

                           <hi>How can the difference be so much? Can the Bullet lose so much of its force in the way from</hi> E <hi>to</hi> G?</p>

                        <p>No we will suppose it loseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its swiftness. But the cause is, That their swiftness being equal, the one is longer in coming to the wall then the other, in Proportion of Time, as EG to EF. For though their swiftness be the same, considered in themselves, yet the swiftness of their approach to the wall is greater in EF then in EG, in proportion of the lines themselves.</p>

                           <hi>When a Bullet enters not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds from the wall, does it make the same Angle going off, which it did falling on, as the Sun-beams do?</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>If you measure the Angles close by the wall there difference will not be ensible; otherwise it will be great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, For the Motion of the Bullet grows continually weaker. But it is not so with the Sun-beams which press con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and equally.</p>

                           <hi>What is the cause of Reflection? When a body can go no further on, it has lost its Motion. Whence then comes the Motion by which it reboundeth?</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>This Motion of rebounding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting proceedeth from the resistance. There is a difference to be considered between the Reflection of Light, and of a Bullet, answerable to their different Motions, pressing and striking. For the action which makes Reflection of Light, is the Pressure of the Air upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting Body, caused by the Sun, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shining body, and is but a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry endeavour; as if two men should press with their breasts upon the two ends of a Staff, though they did not remove one another, yet they would find in themselves a great disposition to press backward upon whatsoever is behind them, though not a total going out of their places. Such is the way of Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light. Now, when the falling on of the Sun-beams is Oblique, the action of them is nevertheless Perpendicular to the Superficies it falls on. And therefore the Reflecting Body, by resisting, turneth back that Motion Perpendicularly, as from F to E, but taketh nothing from the force that goes on parallel in the line of EH; because the Motion never presses. And thus of the two Motions from F to E, and from E to H is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Motion in the line FH, which maketh an Angle in BG, equal to the Angle FGE.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56428:293"/>But in Percussion (which is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bullet against a wall,) the Bullet no sooner goeth off then it loseth of its swiftness, and inclineth to the Earth by its weight. So that the Angles made in falling on and going off, cannot be equal, unless they be measured close to the point where the stroke is made.</p>

                           <hi>If a man set a Board upright upon its edge, though it may very easily be cast down with a little Pressure of ones finger, yet a Bullet from a Musquet shall not throw it down but go through it. What is the cause of that?</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>In pressing with your finger you spend time to throw it down. For the Motion you give to the part you touch is communicated to every other part before it fall. For the whole cannot fall till every part be moved. But the stroke of a Bullet is so swift, as it breaks through before the Motion of the part it hits can be communicated to all the other parts that must fall with it.</p>

                           <hi>The stroke of a Hammer will drive a Nail a great way into a piece of Wood on a sudden. What weight laid upon the head of a Nail, and in how much time will do the same? It is a question I have heard propounded amonst Naturalists,</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56428:293"/>
of weight from the operation of a stroke, makes it uncalculable. The suddenness of the stroke upon one point of the wood takes away the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from the rest. Therefore the Nail enters so far as it does. But the weight not only gives them time, but also aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the resistance; but how much, and in how much time, is (I think) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to determine.</p>

                        <p>Any Reflection may (and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly) be called recoiling; but not contrariwise every Recoiling Reflection. Reflection is always made by the Re-acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Body prest or stricken; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling not always. The Recoiling of a Gun is not caused by its own pressing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gun-powder, but by the force of the Powder it self, inflamed and moved every way alike.</p>

                           <hi>I had thought it had been by the sudden re-entring of the Air after the flame and Bullet were gone out. For it is impossible that so much room as is left empty by the discharging of the Gun, should be so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly filled with the Air that entereth at the Touch-hole.</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56428:294"/>
parts seems, of greater bulk by much, then in truth it is, because they shine. And as the parts scatter more and more, so still more Air gets between them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring not only at the Touch-hole, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at the mouh of the Gun. which two ways being opposite, it will be much too weak to make the Gun Recoil.</p>

                           <hi>I have heard that a great Gun char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged too much or too little, will Shoot (not above, nor below but) besides the mark; and charged with one certain charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both will hit it.</hi>

                        <p>How that should be I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. For when all things in the cause are equal, the effects cannot be unnequal. As soon as Fire is given, and before the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let be out, the Gun begins to Recoil. If then there be any unevenness or rub in the ground more on one side then on the other, it shall shoot besides the mark, whether too much, or too little, or justly charged; because if the line wherein the Gun Recoileth decline, the way of the Bullet will also decline to the contrary side of the mark. Therefore I can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine no cause of this event, but either in the ground it Recoils on, or in the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual weight of the parts of the Breech.</p>

If the <hi>Iron</hi> be lifted up from the Earth, the Motion of the <hi>Load-stone</hi> must be stronger, or the Body of it near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to overcome the Weight; and then the <hi>Iron</hi> will leap up to the <hi>Load-stone</hi> as as Swiftly as from the same distance, it would fall down to the Earth; but if both the <hi>Stone</hi> and the <hi>Iron</hi> be set float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Water, the attraction will begin to be manifest at a greater distance, because the hindrance of the weight is in part removed.</p>

                        <p>Not so, just in the Meridian, but almost in all places with some variations. But the cause I think is, that the Axis of this Magnetical Motion is parallel to the Axis of the Ecliptique, which is the Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is of the like Motion in the Earth, and consequently that it cannot freely exercise its Natural Motion in any other Scituation.</p>

                                 <p>I say the Cube of DX is double to the Cube of DV. For the three lines DY, DX, DV are in continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

                                 <p>Produce CD to P so as DP be equal to AD.

For though false do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produce Truth, yet it produces also absurdity, as it hath done here. But Truth produceth nothing but Truth.

                           <hi>I see the the Calculation in numbers is right, though false in lines. The reason whereof can be no other then some difference between multiplying numbers into lines or plains, and multiplying lines into the same lines or plains.</hi>

                        <speaker>B.</speaker>
                        <p>The difference is manifest. For when you multiply a number into lines, the product is lines; as the number 2 mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed into 3 lines is no more then 3 lines 2 times told. But if you multiply lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lines you make plains, and if you multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply lines into plains you make solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In Geometry there are but three dimensions, Length, Superficies, and Body. In Arithmetick there is but one, and that is Number or Length which you will. And though there be some Numbers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Plain, others Solid, others <hi>Plano-solid,</hi> others Square, others Cubique, others Square-square, others <hi>Quadrato-cubique,</hi> others Cubi-cubique <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are all these but one dimension, namely Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56428:303"/>
or a file of things Numbered.</p>

                           <hi>But seeing this way of Calculation by Numbers is so apparently false, what is the reason this Calculation came so near the truth.</hi>

                        <p>It is because in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> Units are not Nothings, and therefore have breadth. And therefore many Lines set together make a superficies though their breadth be insensible. And the greater the number is into which you divide your Line, the less sensible will be your errour.</p>

                        <p>Archimedes, <hi>to find a streight Line equal to the circumferrence of a Circle, used this may of extracting Roots.

But he ads all other Geometricans before and after him have had two Principles that cross one another when they are applyed to one and the same Science. One is, that a Point is no part of a Line which is true in Geometry, where a part of a Line when it is called a Point, is not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; another is, that a Unit is part of a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56428:304"/>
Number which is also true; but when they reckon by <hi>Arithmetick</hi> in <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> there a Unit is somtimes part of a Line, sometimes a part of a Square, and sometimes part of a Cube.</p>
                        <p>As for the Table of <hi>Sines, Secants</hi> and <hi>Tangents,</hi> I am not the first that find fault with them. Yet I deny not but they are true enough for the reckoning of Acres in a Map of Land.</p>
