         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Obſervator.</hi> I thought it fit to prepare the way by offering ſome
conſiderations at the Authors <hi>Stile,</hi> which by reaſon of many lofty
words, no <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader can <hi>climb</hi> over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer. Stile, unknown, lofty,</hi> and <hi>climb over!</hi> Here's a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
conceit made by as woodden an Obſervator, who, had
not his head (all but the face) been made of blocks, or had
he conſulted ancient Authors, he might have known that the
word <hi>ſtile</hi> uſed by writers, was not made of wood, as this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
ſuppoſeth, but of mettal; the very ſame with his
own face, one end whereof was ſerviceable as a pen, the other
as a knife to race or ſcrape out what was amiſſe. As to thoſe
lofty words, I declare to all the world, this, not uningenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acknowledgment, that having converſed with Authors
of the Nobleſt and cheif Remarque in ſeveral languages, not
onely their nations, but their very words, eſpecially being of
the moſt elegant import, became at length ſo familiar with
me, as when I apply'd my ſelf to that preſent work, I found it
very difficult to renounce my former acquaintance with
them; but as they freely offred themſelves, ſo I entertain'd
them upon theſe conſiderations. Firſt, I was confident that
amongſt learned men they needed no other paſſe then their
own extraction. And for thoſe who were meer Engliſh readers
I ſaw no reaſon they ſhould wonder at them, conſidering that
for their ſatisfaction, I had ſent along with every forreigner
his interpreter to ſerve inſtead of a Dictionary.</p>
            <p>Then I had obſerved that our language had of late already
admitted very neer all of them into ſo frequent uſe in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
diſcourſe, as almoſt amounted to a Naturalization of
them amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I was perſwaded, ſo long as my Narrative was even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carri'd, and tolerably true, a canded Reader would have
pardoned that blemiſh of my Stile, eſpecially ſuch an one
as takes notice that two Hiſtorians <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Saluſt</hi> lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame cenſure; the firſt for his <hi>Patavinity,</hi> as <hi>Aſinius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it, the other for his obſolete words extracted from <hi>Cato
de Originibus,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid; yet notwithſtanding are by
ſome thought to carry away the Garland from all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

whom he call'd, as <hi>Proſper</hi> before him, the enemies of

1. What theſe <hi>Arminians</hi> were which our Author ſpeaks
of. 2. Whether they were the enemies of Gods grace, or not. 3. What
the Reaſon was, why King <hi>James</hi> ſhew'd himſelf ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In the perſuance of theſe <hi>three particulars,</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
ſpends not leſſe then 10. pages, wherein though I
am very little concerned, yet I ſhall take the liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
theſe few things. Firſt, he ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſy, tranſported him into inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
expreſſions. It were a very proper work, for this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,
to inſtance to us thoſe inconvenient expreſſions, and to
undertake the confutation of him, as he is preſented to the
world by <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Secondly, he imputeth to them of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi>
way, this opinion that a man is forcibly drawn and
irreſiſtibly with the cords of grace, in the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Let him produce the men <hi>who,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they ſay it.
They take away indeed an actual reſiſtance of the will,
as inconſiſtent, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> with efficacious grace, but none
I think, aſſert this irreſiſtibility the Obſervator mentioneth;
Nor is this all, but <hi>they hold</hi> alſo, ſaith he, <hi>that man contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing to his own eternity.</hi> A thing I am confident never
declared <hi>in terminis</hi> by any; but ſeeing the man ſeems to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it as one of their errours, I would gladly learn, and
have the Obſervator explain this Metaphyſical whimwham,
how Eternity (for ſo he ſaith, not <hi>Salvation)</hi> can <hi>recipere majus
&amp; minus,</hi> receive either augmentation, or diminution from
man. Laſtly, he endeavoureth to ſhew that King <hi>James</hi> was
much governed by Doctor <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>
who being of a contrary perſwaſion, put him upon many
harſh and ſevere expreſſions againſt thoſe poor men. But this
<hi>Mountague</hi> being dead, he began to ſhew himſelf more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto thoſe opinions, eſpecially upon the comming out of
a book, of another <hi>Mountague</hi> then Prebend of <hi>Windſor;</hi> whoſe
judgment in thoſe points he liked very wel. A thing moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely;
for in Theological controverſies, it is well known King
<hi>James</hi> was able enough to go alone, &amp; needed not like a child,
be led up and down by the hanging ſleeves from one opinion
to the other, by either the one or the other. And whereas Mr.
<hi>Mountague</hi> is made the man who firſt reformed King <hi>James</hi>
his judgement, I offer it to conſideration, how probably it is
aſſerted, when <hi>An. 1628.</hi> this Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> then Biſhop, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151224:5"/>

to the King, as abetters of thoſe Tenets, and the King
declaring diſlike of thoſe Novelties, both he and the other
Biſhop; with tears in their eyes, proteſting, <hi>they hated thoſe
opinions,</hi> and before his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and his <hi>Councel</hi> on their knees,
renounced them. So Sr. <hi>Humphrey Mildmay</hi> averred in open

have reference to the ſixteen years whereof I treat in that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,

though I am guided by the beſt informers I had, yet will I
not, nor did ever ſo mean, to warrant the truth thereof, as
to every particular year. So it fareth in this errour, in point

he had, that no irregularity was incurred by that miſadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.]

not <hi>Regular.</hi> This Biſhop with Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> poſitively

thing, and in his own judgement adhere to the contrary, as
the Obſervator poſitively ſaith he did, I ſay the more too
blame he, and the much more too blame the Obſervator if he
doth in this particular belye him, as 'tis an hundred to one he
doth. But if the Biſhop pronounced the Archbiſhop <hi>Regular,</hi>
though he thought otherwaies, what was then the plot? the
Obſervator tells us it was to keep out Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

turn-key enough to let them in; if the Obſervator ſay not,
their excluſion is his own manufacture. Next to come to the

exclude them: This man is King <hi>Charles,</hi> the very ſame I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

will have him Profeſſor about the time of the <hi>Lambeth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
which were in 1595. So then he relinquiſht his place not
at the end of his firſt three years. Secondly, his firſt three

years. The preciſe words are, <hi>Et volumus inſuper quod de

heavy charge, which hath no truth in it; for I am very confident

               <hi>Obſervator.</hi> That Adoration towards the Altar or Eaſtern part
of the Church, was generally uſed by the beſt and moſt religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the Primitive Times, Our Author, (if he be the man he is
ſaid to be) being well verſed in the Monuments of moſt pure Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
cannot chuſe but know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Becauſe the Obſervator appeals here to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
though I boaſt not of any great knowledge of or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the <hi>Monuments of moſt pure Antiquity,</hi> yet will I
render both my ſcience and conſcience, and theſe apart from
what I deliver as the Report of this <hi>Committee,</hi> who are of age
to anſwer for themſelves. True it is that bodily Adoration,
and worſhipping towards the Eaſt, was an ancient cuſtome of
the Primitive Church; evidence thereof there is enough in
Eccleſiaſtical writers. As it was ancient, ſo can I not ſay it
was illaudable in them, and might be tolerable in us, as I
conceive, were all men ſatisfied in the <hi>decorum</hi> of it, or a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
left to thoſe who are ſtill dubious of the lawfulneſſe
thereof to forbear it. But for dopping or cringing to, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Altar</hi> or holy Table, as oft as they approached to,
or retreated from it, (which is I take the <hi>bowing</hi> meant by the
Committee, and was oft practiſed by ſome indiſcreet preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to conformity with the Primitive Church) I profeſſe
ſeriouſly I find not the leaſt trace thereof in any genuine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the firſt 500 yeares; and ſuppoſe I did, yet would not
that be exemplary enough to me to imitate their practiſe.
The Primitive Fathers never intended their uſages or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
ſhould be leading Charts, or Directories to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
they knew wel enough that ceremonies, phraſes &amp; modes
of ſpeech, muſt comply with, &amp; humour the temper of their
reſpective times, places, and other like circumſtances. Their
Prieſts, Altars, Sacrifices were at firſt words of an innocent
import, and pious intendment; but became afterwards, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151224:11"/>
proceſs of time, the main turn-keys to the ſuperſtitious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Maſſe, and the ſupporters of Tranſubſtantiation;
and though Great Scholars who know moſt properly how to
apply them, may ſometime take the ſame liberty the Fathers
uſed, yet ſeeing the Idolatry of worſe times hath impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe words a ſenſe differing from their primitive recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
reaſon good in common ſpeech they ſhould be forborn.

practice is in my opinion no general rule to goe by. I
proceed to the next ceremony faulted by the Committee, the
ſtanding up at <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> Concerning this the Obſervator
ſaith firſt [It was never obtruded I am ſure] <hi>Anſwer,</hi> what
never? Let him not be too confident, for really I fear there
will prove a flaw in his aſſurance, who ſo ever was of his
Councel. For in Biſhop <hi>Wren's</hi> Articles frame'd for the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> ſure I am, <hi>cap.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> there are theſe words [Do
they <hi>(i.e.</hi> the People) at the end of every <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſtand up and
ſay, Glory be to the Father, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Now I think things inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after in Dioceſan viſitations may be ſaid to be urged and
obtruded. But if it was not obtruded by the Biſhops, the more
negligent, the more too blame they; for the Obſervator tels
us Secondly, [The <hi>Rubrique</hi> of the Church requiring us to
ſtand up at the <hi>Creed,</hi> obligeth us by the ſame reaſon to ſtand
up at the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the <hi>Goſpels</hi> being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is the Epitome and abſtract
of it] Now ſay <hi>I,</hi> if the <hi>Rubrique</hi> obliged us to uſe this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
it did alſo oblige the Biſhops to enforce conformity to
it: and the Obſervators excuſe is their accuſation. But this
Theologaſter ſaying that <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is an Epitome of the
<hi>Creed,</hi> tells us newes indeed. For of what <hi>Creed I</hi> demand? of
that (the Apoſtles) at which the <hi>Rubrique</hi> enjoyned us to
ſtand up? ſurely no ſuch thing. It is in truth as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
quoteth out of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the evidence
of a right ſenſe in the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and not in all
concernments of that Doctrine neither, but only in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of <hi>Coequality</hi> of the three Perſons. Now there are in the
<hi>Creed</hi> other points beſides relating to the Trinity, and ſome
Articles not at all belonging to that Doctrine. So that this
Doxology muſt be ſtretched beyond all reaſon to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſaith that [Many a thing may be retained in a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151224:11"/>
Reformed Church, without ſpecial Rubriques to direct them,
<hi>ex vi Catholicae conſuetudinis,</hi> eſpecially where there is no rule
to the Contrary.] <hi>Bene, Bene, ſed quo iſtud tam bene?</hi> much
truth, but to little purpoſe. For will the <hi>Obſervator</hi> ſay; we
have no Rule to the contrary? If he doth, he muſt be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Act for uniformity prefixt to our <hi>Leiturgy,</hi>
where there is a <hi>vae,</hi> a woe to him who [ſhall wilfully uſe any
other Rite or Ceremony, &amp;c. then is ſet forth in the book of
<hi>Common-Prayer]</hi> expreſly binding all men to a ſtrict confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the very letter of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He ſaith [there is no more Authority for ſtanding
up at the Goſpel, then at <hi>Gloria Patri] Anſwer.</hi> Reaſon there
is more I am certain, and I believe more Authority. As for
Reaſon, Standing is the moſt proper poſture of attention; and
if any part of Scripture requireth attention, the Goſpel doth it
in a moſt eminent degree,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Iſai. Hom. 2.</note> the reading whereof is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the ſetting of Heaven gates wide open, not with the
Pſalmiſt <hi>for the King of Glory to come in,</hi> but for the King of
Glory to come forth. Now as ſtanding is not improper, ſo is it
not a poſture peculiar to the action of Doxology, and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, as is evident by our Church, which ſometimes (as
in our Communion ſervice) requireth it from our knees. Next
I come to Authority, which I ſay did poſitively injoyn me
and all men of my mind to ſtand up at the Goſpel, not ſo at
<hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> For by the Canons, it is required of every
man [when in the time of Divine Service the <hi>Lord</hi> [I think it
ſhould be, <hi>word</hi> or name, as in the Queens Injunctions] Jeſus
ſhall be mentioned] due &amp; lowly reverence ſhall be done, as
hath been accuſtomed; now how it hath been accuſtomed, the
Queens Injunctions tell us expreſly, it was [by lowneſſe of
curteſie, and uncovering of the head] By uncovering my
head this reverence I cannot perform; for <hi>Pileum</hi> being <hi>inſigne
libertatis receptae,</hi> the cognizance of liberty, I think it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
me not to have it on when my Lord and Maſter ſpeaks
to me. So that my Reverence I muſt do by Genuflection
and bowing of the knee, which cannot be done but in a Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
poſture. And note further, that this Reverence is not
only required by our Church, when the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but alſo when
the ſecondleſſon, yea when the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> (or <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
call'd it) was read.</p>

was ſent out by <hi>Edward 1.</hi> as is to be ſeen by <hi>Matthew Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

the Author thereof (an eminent Antiquary) being long ſince
dead, and not in being to make his defence, I ſhall offer
ſomething out of my reading, tending that way in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that note. Firſt, for the time, that it was regularly
to be at the <hi>Coronation,</hi> is inferrible from the inſtrucions ſent
down this year, with the Kings Commiſſion, whereby [Al ſuch
Baronets as were not Knights at his <hi>Coronation,</hi> and all
Knights who have received that honour ſince that time] are
declared liable to make fine. As for the <hi>Belt</hi> and <hi>Surcoate,
Matthew Weſtminſter</hi> tells us, <hi>K. Ed. 1.</hi> ſent forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that all ſuch perſons, <hi>Qui haber ent unde militarent
adeſſent apud Weſtmonaſter. &amp;c.</hi> Who had poſſeſſions valued at
a Knights fee ſhould appear at <hi>Weſtminſter, &amp;c.</hi> What to do? he
tells you preſently, <hi>admiſſuri ſinguli ornatum militatem ex regia
garderoba, to receive military accoutrements out of the Kings
Wardrobe.</hi> But I ſaid, theſe men ſummon'd were <hi>not to be
made Knights, as was vulgarly ſuppoſed,</hi> which words having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the preſent caſe, are no other in ſubſtance then
what Sr. <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaid before me, who in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited
ſpeaks clearly thus. [Now, <hi>tempora mutantur,</hi> the
times are changed and many a yeoman purchaſeth lands in

            <p>Now I come to my two errours in Locality. The firſt is my
miſplacing of the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> entertainment of the King.
Which he will have at <hi>Belſover Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Darby-ſhire,</hi> not at
<hi>Welbech:</hi> and not 1633. but the next year after; and why ſo?
becauſe [that was the entertainment which coſt the Earl
<hi>6000 l.]</hi> I anſwer, mentioning the entertainment given the
King by the Earl, I delivered theſe particulars. Firſt, that
it was in his progreſſe into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Secondly, that it was
the moſt <hi>Auguſt</hi> of all. Thirdly, that it was at <hi>Welbech.</hi> Laſtly,
that it was eſtimated (not poſitively that it did ſo) to coſt
the Earl 6000 <hi>l.</hi> The three firſt are granted for truth by the
very Obſervator himſelf; and for the laſt, as I ſaid barely, it
was ſo eſtimated, ſo I muſt tell him it was ſo eſtimated to my
ſelf at <hi>York</hi> at that very time of the Kings Progreſſe, and a
full year before the next entertainment was given or perhaps
thought of.</p>
            <p>The next miſtake in Locality, is, <hi>Fol. 129.</hi> where I relate

(having ſo fit an opportunity) be bold to re-mind Doctor
<hi>Heilen</hi> of an od miſtake (to ſay no worſe) committed by him,
in vindication whereof he never attempted any thing as yet;
The miſtake this. The main queſtion concerning that Day
was (and I am ſorry to find it is) whither or not it be of

ſaid nay; and (becauſe it would ſignifie the ſame thing,

Hiſtory of the Sabbath, he citeth out of <hi>Pareus</hi> his <hi>Com.</hi> in

in it, becauſe <hi>Quomodo</hi> alone he thought <hi>non vult fac,</hi>
would not do the deed without his Paraphraſe; he deſcants
on it thus. <hi>How?</hi> that is <hi>by, what Authority this change was

<hi>Pareus</hi> his word, in two ſeveral Editions, one 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the other

of rails to be ſet before it, by commanding all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
thither to reſort for the Bleſſed Sacrament: Theſe I
commend as decent in themſelves, but account as Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I will give you now my reaſon, not quarrelling with Dr.
<hi>Coal,</hi> whom the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> carbonado'd, nor yet with
<hi>Peter Heylin;</hi> plainly and ſincerely the 82 Canon enjoyneth,
that the Communion-Table, when the holy Communion is
to be adminiſtred [ſhall be placed in ſo good ſort within the
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Chancel,</hi> as thereby the Miniſter may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
heard of the Communicants, and the Communicants
alſo in more number may communicate with the ſaid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
Now the Communicants may both beſt hear, &amp; in moſt
number communicate, when the Table is in the body of the
<hi>Church,</hi> or of the <hi>Chancel.</hi> Again, it is clear from the word <hi>ſaving,</hi>
mention'd in this Canon, that the Table was to ſtand in one
place when there was no Communion, and in another when
there was one. And this is moſt clearly made out by the Queens
Injunctions 1559. from whence this <hi>Canon</hi> in this particular
is almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> taken; for after order taken where it ſhall
ſtand, in Communion-time, it is further ſaid in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
[And after the Communion done, from time to
time the ſame holy Table to be placed where it ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.]
Infallibly implying, that though it ſtood Altar-wiſe
before, yet at Communion-time it was to be removed, and
conſequently not to be raild in.</p>
            <p>But behold how he defends this from Innovation, [the
King gave Authority and Approbation for it a year before
the Metropolitical Viſitation I ſpeak of] Where's that? [in
deciding the controverſie about the Communion-Table in the

was 1633. <hi>a year before;</hi> ſure the man meanes <hi>London
meaſure.</hi> But what? did the King declare any thing in that
caſe, concerning the ſetting of railes before the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> or
that it ſhould ſtand there immoveable, ſo as the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
were to reſort up to thoſe railes to receive? Sure I am
that Declaration ſpeaks no ſuch matter, not a ſyllable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that way: <hi>Oportet eſſe memorem.</hi> When theſe words

<hi>King</hi> (for that is nothing with him) but him and the
Lords of the Scot'ſh Councel with overſights, great
overſights: Sure things will be gallantly ordered, when our

War,</hi> and ſo did they. True, they did; and beſides
them many an Engliſh Proteſtant:<note place="margin">Elenchus Mat.</note> why might they not?
Was it not a War undertaken at firſt in defence of their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy?
Nay, one of no mean eſteem makes one of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the main cauſe of that War, by introducing the Liturgy
amongſt them, <hi>Sc. ſpe quidem laudabili, eventu verò peſſimo;</hi>
with a good intent, but exceeding ill ſucceſſe: why ſo?
<hi>Hinc ſiquidem, &amp;c.</hi> For from hence proceeded Tragedies,
Tumults, War, and Invaſion. Now that War which an
Arch-Biſhop occaſion'd, and which was entred into for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that Hierarchy, may, I hope, without offence be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Biſhops War.</hi> But here I am cut off; the Obſervator
telling us that [Religion was but the vizard to diſguiſe that
buſineſſe which covetouſneſſe and ſacriledge had the greateſt
had in] which he confirmes by this enſuing Narrative.
[The King being engaged into a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by thoſe who engaged him in it, amongſt other wayes
of aſſiſtance, was minded of a purpoſe his Father had of
<hi>Revoking</hi> all Grants of Abby Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being veſted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151224:17"/>
in the Crown, were by his Protectors in his Minority, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on many of the Nobility and Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon the ſame courſe, he intends a Parliament in that
Kingdome, appoints the Earle of <hi>Nidderdale</hi> to preſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and armes him with inſtructions for paſſing of an Act of
Revocation accordingly: who being on his way as far as
<hi>Barwick,</hi> was there informed that all was in Tumult at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
that a rich coach which he had ſent before to <hi>Dalkeith</hi>
was cut in pieces, the poore horſes killed, the people ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely ſorry that they could not doe the like to the Earle
himſelfe. Things being brought to this ſtand, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
put off with a <hi>ſine Die,</hi> the King was put to a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſecond Councels, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That many had other then Religious deſignes,
there is little doubt, they hoping to obtain that honour or
wealth in a troubled State, which they were conſident they
ſhould never arrive at in a calm. Now, as concerning this
Relation, the Obſervator being a perſon to whom I am
ſo much obliged, I cannot but as part of requital of his own
labours, adde ſomething for illuſtration of his Story, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
ſome miſtakes thereof. Know then, Reader, that this
Earl of <hi>Nidderdale,</hi> of whom the Obſervator ſpeakes, was
then no Earle, but the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi> no more but ſo; and
the very Man, or I am deceived, mention'd in <hi>Habernfield</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery.
For, a rank Papiſt he was, and <hi>Anno 1624.</hi> went to
<hi>Rome</hi> to receive the Popes extraordinary Benediction; which
the Councel of <hi>Scotland</hi> hearing of, they ſet out a Bar, or
Preſcription againſt him for departing the Kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave: Soon after, King <hi>James</hi> dying, he came over into
<hi>England,</hi> and by the Dukes favour, whoſe Kinſwoman he
had married, was, <hi>Anno 1625.</hi> joyned in Commiſſion with
the Earle of <hi>Anandale (Murrey)</hi> for ſummoning a Parliament
(not for Revoking of Church, and other lands formerly inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the Crown) but for contribution of monies and ſhips
againſt the <hi>Dunkirkers;</hi> and was deſigned to preſide there,
with power to place and diſplace what Officers he pleaſed.
In Order and Pomp ſutable to ſo great a Truſt, the <hi>Lord</hi>
buyes him a Coach moſt radiant and richly gilded; this he
ſends before him to <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> The Councel of <hi>Scotland</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
early notice of this, conſpire to adhere and ſtick cloſe
together, and to oppoſe his commiſſion: And the ſurer to
fruſtrate the Lords deſigne, they ſend to all the chief Towns
informing them what was comming, deſiring they would
ſend in the money with all expedition. The Townes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
inſtantly, and all was done; yea the very undoing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151224:18"/>
and deſtruction of his glorious Coach, before the Lord <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
came to <hi>Barwich,</hi> and further he durſt not go, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his perſon ſo generally hated, might be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
there, but poſted a main to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> where
finding the King cool in the buſineſſe (having had an account
from the Councel of <hi>Scotland</hi> of al their proceedings, &amp; adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
by them how diſpleaſing a <hi>Preſident</hi> that <hi>Lord</hi> was like
to prove, in reſpect of his Religion) &amp;h the <hi>Duke</hi> gone to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> after him he goes, and returnes with him into <hi>England.</hi>
The <hi>Duke</hi> and this <hi>Lord</hi> being come to Court, poſſeſſe the King
with ſtrange inſolences and affronts committed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt his Regal power. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> in ſome
indignation thereupon ſends for them to come forthwith,
and anſwer what he had to object againſt them: up they come
to court, and being by his Majeſty chidden for their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
they defying this Lord openly in his Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
ſpake withal bug words, not very loyal 'tis confeſt;
whereat his Majeſty told them then, and not before, he
would make them reſtore all to the Crown, which they had
taken from it in his Fathers Minority. This and ſomewhat

to ſhew upon what account it was; ſaying [Both King

is, therefore to obtain like favours for ſuch <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as lived

Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> for the Election of Clerks
to the Convocation; in which writs though there were theſe
words <hi>ad tractandum, conſentiendum, &amp; concludendum, &amp;c.</hi> Yet
could not the Convocation <hi>Treat, conſent,</hi> or <hi>conclude</hi> any thing
without a ſpecial Commiſſion enabling them thereto. This
Commiſſion therefore was iſſued out <hi>April</hi> the 15. two dayes
after the Parliament ſate and impowred the Houſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
[to alter, amend and change the old Canons, and to
make new during the Parliament.] So that the Parliament
being diſſolved <hi>May</hi> the 5. by conſequence this Commiſſion
expired by the Obſervators own conceſſion; but though the
Commiſſion was nulled, it was a queſtion ſtill whither the
Convocation was ſo alſo: In the enſuing Parliament it was
agreed that it was; and if it was not, yet was it beheld to
have ſo little life in it, as the King thought fit to re-animate it
with a new Commiſſion, bearing date <hi>May 12,</hi> Authorizing it
to make Canons, &amp;c. And to continue during his Majeſties
pleaſure. Notwithſtanding this Commiſſion, the Obſervator
tells us [That the King for ſatisfation of ſome ſcrupulous
members of the lower houſe, propounded the Queſtion to
ſome eminent Lawyers, who reſolved under their hands
[That the Convocation being called by the Kings writ, was
to continue until it were diſſolved by the Kings writ, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the diſſolution of the Parliament.] All which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151224:19"/>
is very true, but not all the truth; for the light-fingerd
Obſervator hath pocketed up the break-neck of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

what I pray doth he oppoſe againſt it? but [firſt, want of

a Community of names, and proves it by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who calls

<hi>ad rem,</hi> and clear beſides the cuſhion, a meer ſhift and
no more; for doth any man doubt that the theſis is limited
to Goſpel-perſons initiated into ſacred orders, beneath the
Apoſtles, and above Deacons? Let him or any men elſe, tell
me where ſuch perſons in Holy Text are really diſtinguiſhed,
that is, where Presbyters import not <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and Biſhops
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and then he ſhall be confeſt to ſpeak to purpoſe,
to much better purpoſe then the Obſervator, who produceth
the order of the late Church of <hi>England</hi> in the ordaining of
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> when we talk of thoſe whom Holy Text calls <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
not what they were in ſucceeding times, or are in
our Church. And thus I have <hi>knockt down Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſaith
the Obſervator, <hi>with a painted club:</hi> Dead as a door nail no
doubt, yet really not ſo much as touched I dare ſay for it; I am
ſure <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> I mean <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> may live
many a fair day after it, notwithſtanding that aſſertion, the
other 1300. years, as it hath done already (for ſo long it is
ſince St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, whoſe opinion all men know it was <hi>in
terminis)</hi> and yet for all that, by the leave of <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> he
as great a friend to Epiſcopacy as any other <hi>Father;</hi> and not
more then my ſelf. That there was in the Apoſtolique <hi>Church,</hi>
a <hi>Prelacy,</hi> a <hi>Superiority</hi> inſtituted, of ſome one (no matter how
denominated) over other Presbyters, within ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
walks and precincts; that this <hi>Superiority</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the very <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to be exemplary, and to give law to
ſucceeding times, I do as little doubt, and think it as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable
out of Scripture as any thing whatſoever not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.
That the perſons ſelected for ſo high a function,
ſhould be men of the moſt eminent quality for piety and
learning, there is all the reaſon in the world; and if ſuch a
choyce be once made, as <hi>de facto</hi> in ſome it now is, judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
what they pleaſe, I ſhall account them meriting the
greateſt Reverence and honour (taken in the moſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151224:20"/>
ſenſe, either for dignity or maintenance, that any
ſubjects are capable of. Soules of the moſt noble ſize muſt
have elbow-room, they cannot exerciſe their activity in an
anguſt and narrow Sphere. The internal Grandour of the
mind, may perhaps exiſt; viſible, conſpicuous it cannot be,
without external Grandour of Eſtate. Againe, the entries
and advenues to advancement, are free and open to <hi>Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
under-graduates to the <hi>Sacred;</hi> why then ſhall this be
excluded? If Merit be all-ſufficient to entitle it poſſeſſor to
Preferment; what Merit greater then what is reſident in
perſons of Holy Orders? To defraud others of their due
Rewards, can at worſt be but injuſtice; to rob theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing from <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> This is my ſenſe of Epiſcopacy;
enough, I hope, to ſatisfie ſpirits of the moſt modeſt and ſober
temper; and for others, they are beneath my conſideration.
This done, I ſhall jog on to attend the Obſervators next
motion.</p>

Durham,</hi> and <hi>Carlile.</hi> Of which, the two laſt being men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd
in politick Affaires, depended wholly on the judgement of
the other two; and thoſe carried a ſharp tooth againſt the Lord
Lieutenant upon former grudges. The diſpleaſure which the Primate

their place the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Anno 1633.</p>

them depended upon the judgement of the others, it was

ſpake not one ſyllable. As for the Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi>
and <hi>Carlile,</hi> they ſpake as freely as any other, inſomuch as
the King faulted one of their Syllogiſmes, becauſe it had
in it four terms. Fourthly, the Lord <hi>Primate</hi> had no <hi>ſharp
tooth</hi> againſt the Lieutenant, as the Obſervator or Malice
it ſelf ſuggeſts; a calumny ſo abſurd, as nothing but the ſin
thereof can defend it from being ridiculous, not a ſyllable

were deſigned to the managing and preparing of it?]</hi> I can
aſſure him that the Biſhops only ſent him to the reſolution
of his own judgement for <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and to the opinions
of the Judges <hi>for matter of Law;</hi> and that the reſtleſs and
inſatiable ſcruple which ſo diſcompoſed his Majeſties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was this; That notwithſtanding he moſt earneſtly
preſſed the <hi>Judges</hi> to declare the particular <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Earls</hi>
charge, which (if proved) was Treaſon by an expreſſe
Law of the Land, he could not extort from them one ſingle
inſtance, nor any thing elſe, but that the <hi>Earl</hi> was <hi>guilty upon
the whole matter,</hi> which he thought was too confuſed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
upon which to ſhed the blood of one of the baſeſt, much
more of the Nobleſt Orb.</p>
            <p>Thus have I finiſhed my Animadverſions upon the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators
Matter. I ſhould next proceed to his Alphabetical
Table, or Vocabulary of my uncouth words, which really
is the Comical part of his Tragedies againſt me, and it were
pity to loſe ſo much mirth. I ſhall therefore in liew of that
Alphabet preſent thee Reader with a Catalogue, firſt of
mine own, and then of his miſtakes, with ſome things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151224:24"/>
of remark reſulting from them both; and firſt for mine
own.</p>

            <p>Other things as errors there are, I confeſſe, charged upon
me by the Obſervator; but ſome are dubious, and no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat</hi>
they are errors. Some are infallibly demonſtrated to
be no errors, and the reſt that are errors are none of mine.
Of mine, theſe are a true and perfect account; and how
far theſe comply for quality and number with what I pretend
to in my Preface, I ſhall now examine. My words in that
Preface are [Confident I am <hi>I</hi> ſtand ſecure againſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
falſhoods] Dares the Obſervator (though he as daring
as another) ſay any one of theſe <hi>falſhoods</hi> are <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> ſo as
their rectification will deſtroy the frame of the Narrative to
which they relate? I preſume he will not. Circumſtantial they
are every one; and againſt circumſtantial, though I durſt not
aſſume confidence, yet I <hi>hoped</hi> I ſtood ſecure alſo. And now
how that hope hath failed me, ſhall be my next enquiry.
The total of my lapſes and ſlips amount to eight; no more,
if I have faithfully collected them, as I hope I have, and did
really ſo intend; but leſt one or two ſhould be caſually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
I allow them to be 10. And being ſo, I appeal to
thy ingenuous candor, gentle Reader, firſt, whether in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
of at leaſt a thouſand circumſtances, it be not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miracle that I miſtook in but 10, then that I erred ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Secondly, whether 10. errors in ſuch circumſtances,
wherein the fame of no one man, the intereſt of no one
cauſe, is either damnify'd, or advantaged, be ground ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for ſo much clamour, ſo loud outcry, as would gladly
raiſe the Country, yea the whole Nation againſt me. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether it would not have repreſented the Obſervator
to be a man of more Chriſtian, yea Moral Principles, had
he <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> by conference, or by letters hinted to me theſe
miſtakes, as fit conſiderations for a ſecond impreſſion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151224:24"/>
the laſt is needleſſe, he having ſo fair and frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
unities of doing the firſt: True it is, acquaintance there
is none between us, if acquaintance be taken for familiarity;
but acquainted with my perſon he is, and I with his, ſo well,
as he knows me perfectly without a <hi>Nomenclator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can it be otherwiſe conjectured? when the truth is,
we have met in <hi>London</hi> at the ſame ſhop, I may ſafely ſay
neer an hundred times; and to ſpeak more cloſe to the point,
not leſſe then ten times, not only after the publication of my
Hiſtory; but after he had, to my knowledge, peruſed it, and
before he had entred one line of his Obſervations into the
Preſſe. All which do evidently declare, that it was not my
information, but a dear and precious quarrel he deſired.</p>
            <p>Having given you this particular of mine own failings, I
proceed to thoſe of the Obſervator himſelf, which I have
not only ſaid, but proved to be Errours.</p>

for one eſcaped from me in 70. which yet were diſpenſable
in any man, were they but circumſtantiall, as mine, but
when one of them tends to the very deſtruction of ſacred
worſhip, as that of the Sabbath; and another to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation
of one of the moſt glorious Lights of our Church:
Theſe are unpardonable faults, were not both the ſnfferers
thereby above his obloquy. In this Catalogue I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
ſuch miſtakes as relate imediately to my ſelf. I have
not minded him of his moſt notorous corrupting and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
my <hi>Preface;</hi> nor of his wilfull miſtaking other words
for mine, which coſt him a ſixth part of his Pamphlet; nor
yet his detorting &amp; wreſtling mine owne words to his fancy,
againſt their naturall mind and inclination, Things counter
to the ingenuity he ſo pretends to in his Epiſtle made to me,
to the ancient mode of ſimplicity, to which <hi>I</hi> wiſh he would
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151224:25"/>

what made King <hi>James</hi> ſo ſtout an adverſary of

of <hi>Olden-Barnevelt,</hi> and by him uſed to undermine the
power of <hi>Maurice</hi> then Prince of <hi>Orange]</hi> ſo then by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators
own inference, <hi>Reaſon of State and King-Craft</hi> will
not tolerate the <hi>Arminians</hi> in a Commonwealth; and if ſo,
they well deſerved the name of a Faction, as he <hi>page 73.</hi>

a <hi>Faction,</hi> a turbulent, ſeditious <hi>Faction,</hi> the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces

there; more eſpecially in that wicked conſpiracy of <hi>Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt</hi>
who ſuffered moſt condignly upon that very account
1619, and in no leſs damnable and helliſh plot, about three
years after, wherein the States ſitting in Councel at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and after them all other <hi>anti-Arminian</hi> Magiſtrates
were deſtined to ſlaughter: but this plot aborting and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying,
the next was to murder the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to
ſeiſe upon the Magazines, to diſplace all Officers both mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and civil, and commit an horrid Maſſacre upon all of
different belief; all which was by a bleſſed providence
diſcovered and prevented, four of the principal conſpirators
hanged, and the reſt ſome impriſon'd, others baniſht. This
was the deportment of the Obſervators <hi>Faction</hi> in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,
