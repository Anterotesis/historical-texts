         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beene oftentimes occaſioned
to trauell beyond the Seas: it ſo
chanced that I was once (through
diuers accidents) driuen to haue
ſome conference with father <hi>Seth,</hi>

ſole Confeſſor of a Couent of Engliſh Nunnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
in the ſame Cittie; who by his ſubtill and
wily fetches inticed me to abide with him in the
houſe, imploying me dayly in copying out certaine
Treatiſes of Obedience, which hee had compoſed
for the Nunnes. And after a while hauing depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
mee of meanes to depart from him, by taking

ſiſters (as they cal them) neuer ceaſed to vrge me by
deepe-diſſembled intreaties &amp; perſwaſions, vntill I
had giuen conſent to become a holy Brother and

to more skill in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> then euery ſhaueling is

whilome ouerſpred and ſhaddowed our whole
Country: which the Papiſts (in regard theſe two
houſes had both one foundation, and were as it
were linked and tyed the one to the other) do hold
as miraculous, and doe take it as a ſure ſigne and
token of their future returne from baniſhment;
<note n="e" place="margin">The Regiſter booke of their bouſe, telleth of many of theſe propheſies which were ſpoken by ſundry of the Siſters vpon their death-bed.</note> nay, ſome of the holieſt of our vnholy Siſters,

And now (by the way) it ſhall not be likewiſe much
amiſſe for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as haue not been
acquainted with Friers buſineſſe, in a word or two
to declare the originall of both theſe Orders, and
from what Patrons they firſt deſcended. For in
the Catholique <hi>Romane</hi> Church, amongſt all the
diſordered orders of ſwarming Locuſts, which
are almoſt innumerable, there is none but take
their beginning from one ſuppoſed Saint or other:
and as the reſt, ſo theſe.</p>
            <p>

For the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> ſprung vp from <note n="a" place="margin">Reade <hi>Surius</hi> vpon the life of <hi>Bruno.</hi>
               </note> one <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
in the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> who is ſaid to haue
beene preſent at the Funerall of a certaine Prieſt
reputed for a holy man in his life: but when they
were executing the office of the dead for him, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vſe of the Papiſts) it ſeemed they
had beene deceiued in their imagination. For
when the Deacon was come to the Leſſon which
beginneth <hi>Reſponde mihi quantas habeo iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
&amp;c.</hi> the dead man ſuddenly ſtart vp, and ſaid,
<hi>Vocatus ſum,</hi> or <hi>accufatus ſum,</hi> chuſe you whether;
whereupon they deferred his Obſequies vntill the

when proceeding the ſecond time, and comming
to the ſame words againe, the dead body made
anſwer, <hi>Iudicatus ſum.</hi> Then the third time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
their Seruice, and at the ſame <hi>Reſponde</hi> he ſate

much troubled, to thinke, that a man ſo generally
reputed for holy, ſhould yet be damned; determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to lead a moſt auſtere and ſolitary life: and to
that end being accompanied with a few others,
whom he had made priuy to his purpoſe, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a deſart ſtupendious mountaine called <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſia,</hi>
where he liued (as they ſay) in great regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and from the name of that hill, they came to
be called <hi>Carthuſians;</hi> and to this day they pretend
more ſeuerity and ſtrictneſſe of diſcipline, then any
other Order of Monks or Friers what ſoeuer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they remained not long in ſuch ſolitarie and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16480:8"/>
vnfrequented places, but by little and little obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their houſes in euery great Cittie and towne,
as magnificent, yea and more ſumptuous then
their fellow-Locuſts, witneſſe the <hi>Charter-houſe</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> which was once a <hi>Cage of theſe vncleane
birds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the other houſe of <hi>Syon:</hi> the Nunnes
thereof take their beginning from their holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<note n="a" place="margin">Reade the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of Saint <hi>Briget.</hi>
               </note> Saint <hi>Briget,</hi> and her daughter Saint <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine.</hi>
This Saint <hi>Briget</hi> was of the blood Royall
of <hi>Suetia;</hi> a woman (queſtionleſſe) of a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and ſingular memory, howbeit miſerably
ſeduced and led away by the ſubtill allurements of
her ghoſtly father, by whoſe perſwaſions and
counſell, ſhe went to <hi>Rome</hi> as a Pilgrime, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
before the Pope, ſhe pretended to haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
reuelations from God; amongſt which, one
was for the founding of this Order of Nunnes,
which was indeed the chiefe marke, that both her
ghoſtly father and ſhe aymed at. The reſt of her
pretended inſpirations, were for the reforming of
ſundry abuſes in the Church. Yea, ſhe ſpared not
to tell the Popes holineſſe of many faults in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
but he (like a good blood-hound) quickely
ſcented her, and followed her footing, till he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceiued from whom ſhe was ſent: who (being
a fellow that might vpon diſtaſte prooue a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique,
and make ſome reuolt in thoſe remote
Countries, from the Romane Church) he thought
beſt to be winked at; and thereupon condeſcended
vnto her requeſt, touching the erecting of a houſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16480:8"/>
of this Order, and ſo diſmiſſed her. But ſhe liued
not long after, (whether his Holineſſe had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſome <hi>modicum</hi> to bee miniſtred vnto her or no,
it is doubtfull) yet in her daughters dayes the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
came to perfection: and the firſt Houſe of
this Order was at a place called <hi>Watſteen</hi> in <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
from whence certaine Nunnes were procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into <hi>England,</hi> to propagate their Rules and
Ceremonies in <hi>Syon</hi> houſe, at the time when it was
firſt built.</p>
            <p>The magnificence of this Couent in former
times hath beene by the report of the now-liuing
Nunnes very admirable: at this preſent it is not of
any extraordinarie repute; neither are the people
of it for birth and parentage equall to their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
who were wont to bee of good diſcent:
whereas now (ſaue onely a few) they are Recuſants
daughters of the meaner ſort, and ſilly tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
chambermaids, who haue had the cuſtodie of
ſuch Seminaries and Ieſuits, as reſorted to their
Maſters houſes in <hi>England,</hi> at ſuch times as they
haue beene mewed vp for feare of <hi>Croſſe</hi> and his

of their ruffling diſguiſes, to ſeeke out for more
change of paſture; (like fathers <hi>Strange</hi> the Ieſuite)
where, making a vertue (or rather a vice) of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
the ghoſtly children haue miniſtred to their
ſpirituall fathers in all things. And by ſuch meanes
hauing gotten a clap, diuers of them <note n="b" place="margin">It is no great miracle for a whore to become a Nunne; nor for a Nunne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a whore.</note> become
Nunnes. And with a rabble of ſuch like ſtuffe, is
this houſe of <hi>Syon</hi> much repleniſhed, there beeing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16480:9"/>
of them in all betweene 40. and 50. whereof onely
fiue are ſtrangers, and the reſt all Engliſh. The
names of ſo many of them as I can at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
I haue at the end of the Booke ſet downe,
for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as deſire to know them.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe three Friers, the Confeſſor
and two more; and a ſimple beſotted fellow, who
hath the title of a familiar. And well may they
call him ſo: for he will be drunke familiarly foure
or fiue times euery weeke; by reaſon whereof hee is
not apparelled in any religious habit, but goeth
like an ordinary ſecular man, to the end the Houſe
ſhould be the leſſe ſcandalized by him: for now ſo
many doe not take notice of his drunkenneſſe as
would, if they ſhould ſee him in a religious habite.</p>
            <p>And this is the whole company of the Houſe at
this time: but now if any man demand, how and
by what meanes they are brought thither; and by
whom they are maintained: let him know, that
there lurketh in <hi>England</hi> an arch-Traytour, one
<note n="a" place="margin">This <hi>Flood</hi> cauſed the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites at <hi>Lisbon</hi> to ſpend a great deale of money vpon Powder, on a Feſtiuall day, a little before the <hi>Powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in England ſhould haue been effected, thereby to make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the force thereof. And alſo perſwaded one <hi>Iohn How</hi> (a Merchant whom be had peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and diuers other Catholikes, to goe ouer into England, and to expect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption there (as be called it) awhile.</note> 
               <hi>Henry Flood</hi> a Ieſuit, who is the chiefe Agent for

               <hi>Bruxels,
Greueling, Lisbon,</hi> or any other place; and whither
he pleaſeth to ſend them, thither they muſt goe. If
they haue no portion, and perhaps ſome little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,
they are not for the Ieſuits tooth, <hi>Aquila
non capit Muſcas,</hi> they muſt packe to <hi>Greueling,</hi> to
the poore bare-footed <hi>Clares.</hi> If they haue a ſmall
portion, that likes not the Iebuſite neither: a pound
of butter is nothing amongſt a cure of hungry
Hounds; <hi>nec vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe loui:</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16480:9"/>
they trudge to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they are allowed
daily fiue crownes, and their bread, and many a
good almes beſide is often beſtowed vpon them.
But if they haue a good round ſumme for their
dowrie, <hi>ab Inferno nulla est redemptio,</hi> there is no
plucking them out of the Ieſuites Iawes; they are
ſtamped for <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and thither muſt they goe;
where <hi>Fitz-herbert</hi> and his fellow-Ieſuits wil quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſſeſſe them of all worldly cares and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and (like ſubtill Alchymiſts) refine them out
of their ſiluer and golden droſſe, into a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
eſtate and condition, and will cheriſh and
nouriſh them, euen in their owne boſomes: ſuch a
burning zeale haue they towards them.</p>
            <p>And this is the manner after which our Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
daughters in <hi>England</hi> are tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into other
Countries, to take vpon them the profeſsion of a
ſolitary life, and to liue in pouerty, chaſtity, and
obedience: which how well they performe, I ſhall
now (God willing) in part declare.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore for their pouertie, I meane of
theſe Nuns of <hi>Syon,</hi> and they profeſſe themſelues
the pooreſt of any Engliſh, except them of Saint
<hi>Clares</hi> Order. It is well knowne, that they haue
ten thouſand pounds at vſe in the Towne-houſe of
<hi>Antwerpe;</hi> a great part whereof hath beene giuen
them by ſundry deceaſed Gentlemen in <hi>Flanders</hi>
and <hi>Portugal;</hi> and beſide their yeerly penſion. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
when they remained in <hi>France,</hi> they had the
cuſtodie of no ſmall ſumme of money, which was
ſent to them to keepe for Doctor <hi>Lopez</hi> the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16480:10"/>
as his reward for poyſoning our late Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, which after that
Traitor (hauing miſſed of his intent) was executed,
was remitted vnto them as an almes, as the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-booke
of their houſe, (from whence I had it)
ſhameth not to make mention.</p>
            <p>They haue likewiſe of late yeeres, through the
politicke plodding of their Confeſſor, <note n="a" place="margin">Sic figulus figulum, ſic &amp; fabrum faber odit.</note> giuen
the Ieſuites noſes a wipe of two thouſands pounds,
being the portion of the two daughters of Sir A. B.
Viſcount M. whom a Nunne of the houſe (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Chamber-maid of their fathers) had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from the Ieſuites. For which, and ſome other
like trickes about a Portugeſe Gentlewoman, the
poſteritie of lame <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> a lame ſouldier, a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Patron of the Popes Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries, the Ieſuits</note> 
               <hi>Ignatius</hi> could almoſt find in
their hearts to re-aſſume their Patrons firſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> to take reuenge vpon that old
hypocriticall Frier, which durſt preſume to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtudied in <hi>Nic. Machiauell</hi> then themſelues: yea
they ſo threatened him once, that he durſt not goe
abroad, leſt they ſhould worke him a miſchiefe.
Moreouer, they haue a daily penſion of 5. crowns,
and wheat more then ſufficeth for to ſpend in the
Houſe. They haue Vineyards, Oliue fields, corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
and houſes, to the value of foure hundred
<note n="c" place="margin">Euery mil-reis is twelue ſhillings and ſixe pence.</note> 
               <hi>mil-reis</hi> by the yeere, which was the portion of
the Portugeſe aforeſaid, whom (being ſole heire to
her father, a man of great wealth) they perſwaded
to become a religious ſiſter in their Couent. What
ſhould I ſpeake of the ſale of their Maſſes. I meane
the reuenues in generall of the <hi>Sacristia</hi> or Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16480:10"/>
where, though there bee but three Prieſts of
them, and therefore but three Maſſes; and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
but vpon Feſtiuall dayes, for the Confeſſor
himſelfe will not ſay Maſſe vpon a worke-day, yet
they will take money of twenty men, and tell euery
one they will ſay for him. Then haue they their
boxes ſent foorth in the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Braſilian</hi> ſhips,
with S. <hi>Brigets</hi> image vpon them; to which, in a
ſtorme the poore blinded people will contribute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally;
and ſea-men that go on ſuch long voyages
will take vp a moneths pay or two aforehand, and
giue it for Maſſes to bee ſaid for their good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
I haue knowne this in one yeere woorth ſixe
hundred <hi>mil-reis</hi> vnto them. Diuers other meanes
they haue to get money: as by putting a good
ſumme into the hands of a couple of young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
whom they haue peruerted to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and theſe men deale for them vnder a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
So that I may boldly ſay, (for I haue heard
<hi>Foſter</hi> himſelfe ſpeake it, and I haue partly ſeene it)
that all charges and expences of the Houſe being
payed, they doe yeerely lay vp <note n="a" place="margin">And it is no ſmall ſumme of money that he ſendeth to his kindred in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, that are Papiſts: but he will acknowledge none of them that are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> ſixe hundreth
pounds. For the ſiluer that inſhrineth their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and for their Church-plate, I know not how
to value it; but it is without doubt both plentifull
and maſsie; for there bee few of their rotten Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
but are ſet in ſiluer. They haue two armes
of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> notwithſtanding all his
bones were burned in <hi>England,</hi> when Popery was
ſuppreſſed; ſo that they wil make of him a <hi>Briareus,</hi>
or a <hi>centimanus Gygas,</hi> as doubtleſſe he was in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16480:11"/>
life, a very obſtinate Prelate to his Prince. And
for Saint <hi>Vrſula,</hi> ſhe muſt needes bee a <hi>diua trifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
or <hi>a triceps Hecate;</hi> for they haue one of her
heades; and there is another of them at <hi>Collen,</hi> and
the third at <hi>Rome.</hi> Then haue they the bones of S.
<hi>Briget</hi> and her daughter, and ſundry Reliques of
Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> from whoſe rule theirs is deriued.
There is <note n="a" place="margin">Beleeue it who liſt.</note> the milke of our Lady, the blood of
<hi>Hales,</hi> which was held ſo precious in <hi>England;</hi> and
(ſir reuerence) there is a piece of old <note n="b" place="margin">Although they cannot abide the Ieſuits, yet they loue their Gallowes, becauſe thereby they get money.</note> 
               <hi>Tyborne,</hi>
which the Ieſuites ſtole away out of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it had beene honoured by ſo many of their
brethren, which is had in little leſſe eſteeme then
the holy Croſſe: for (ſay they) as the Maſter died
on that, ſo his Diſciples died vpon this. And theſe
are all ſet in ſiluer, and richly adorned. Then haue
they a little childs legge, which I thinke they may
truly call as they doe; for they ſay it is a legge of
the <hi>Innocents;</hi> and doubtleſſe ſo it is, for I could (if
I were in the houſe) goe very neere <note n="c" place="margin">Saxa ipſa trabéſque lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentur.</note> a place in a
wall, where I could fetch out both legges and
armes of poore innocent baſtards, which might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
proue, that there is knauery in dawbing.</p>
            <p>And hauing hereby giuen a ſufficient inſtance
of their pouerty, I will now proceed to ſpeake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of their chaſtitie, which is as ſcarce and penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as their pouerty is plenteous. Neither can it
be otherwiſe; for they haue <hi>Sodoms</hi> prouocations
to ſinne, Pride, Fulneſſe of bread, and abundance
of Idleneſſe. As for their pride, though it bee not
outwardly in gorgeous and curious attire, yet are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16480:11"/>
they poſſeſſed with a vain-glorious pride of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
and diſſembled ſanctitie. For their fulneſſe of
bread, who knoweth not that they (like the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers
of <hi>Egypt)</hi> doe eate vp the fat and beſt
fruits of the Land? for what the purueyors of the
<hi>Vice-rey</hi> haue forſaken in the Market, (as too deare)
I haue knowne the Cator of this houſe to buy at
vnreaſonable rates for their ghoſtly fathers Table,
and for ſuch of his Chickens as hee moſt affected:
whoſe greateſt (and indeed onely) care is, to proue
skilfull in the confection and dreſsing of ſuch dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
cates as may beſt pleaſe their wanton palats.
And well doe they manifeſt the abundance of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that is in them, when at ſundry times playing
vpon their inſtruments for their fathers recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they ſing him ribaldrous Songs and jigs, as
that of <hi>Bonny Nell,</hi> and ſuch other obſcene and
ſcurrilous Ballads, as would make a chaſte eare to
glow at the hearing of them, and which I would
ſcarce haue beleeued would haue proceeded out of
their mouthes, had I not heard them with my owne
eares.</p>
            <p>And now againe for the Houſe. Whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religious Houſes are vnder the Iuriſdiction
of <hi>Prouincials</hi> of their owne Order <hi>mediatè,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe <hi>immediatè,</hi> yet this
is not ſubiected to either: For as for a <hi>Prouinciall</hi>
they haue none, in regard there are no more Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of that Order; neither would the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Lisbon</hi> take them into his iuriſdiction at their
firſt comming into <hi>Portugall,</hi> fearing leſt that being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16480:12"/>
ſtranger, and at that time pretending want and
pouerty, he ſhould afterward be driuen to ſuſtaine
and relieue them; they being forbidden to begge
by their rule. And ſo he put them off with a <hi>non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui
vos,</hi> telling them hee neuer knew or heard that
<note n="a" place="margin">At their firſt comming into <hi>Lisbon</hi> they were little ſet by. And euery one maruelled at their order, and liuing ſo together. But now their diſſembling hath wonne them a little more credit.</note> 
               <hi>frayles y freiras</hi> Friers and Nunnes ſhould keep
&amp; dwell together all, <hi>ſub eodem tecto,</hi> vnder the ſame
roofe. Wherevpon they were conſtrained to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
that famous Arch-Ieſuite Father <hi>Parſons</hi>
to be their ſollicitor to the Pope, who then tooke
them into his protection, and appointed his <hi>nuncio
apoſtatico,</hi> reſident in <hi>Lisbon</hi> to haue the care and
charge of them. And he againe being bribed and
preſented with gifts by Father <hi>Foſter,</hi> and dwelling
farre from the houſe, is ſatisfied with what he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him, and neuer commeth to viſit the Nunnes,
as he ought, and to inquire and demand their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances;
but permitteth him to play <hi>rex</hi> ouer them
at his own pleaſure. Wherevpon it is pittifull and
miſerable to behold the condition of theſe ſilly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
women: for they neither dare nor can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to any body, beeing ſeldome permitted to
ſpeake euen to them that are of the houſe as well as
themſelues, but onely at ſuch times when the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe

Women, beeing by this <hi>Foſters</hi> politique
contriuing ſo placed of purpoſe, that by and with

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16480:12"/>
hauing predominance ouer the others whom
want of beauty and fauour hath made deſpicable
in the eyes of this old <hi>Sinon,</hi> doe (according to the

vexe their poore fellow-priſoners. For it is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie
of this perfidious wretch, to ſet them at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
among themſelues, and to cauſe them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
one another, to th'intent they ſhould not dare
to truſt one another with the complaint of their
griefes; and ſo whilſt they remaine in a iealouſie
of each others ſecrecie and aide, they ſhould neuer
be able to contriue any meanes to free themſelues
from his thraldome.</p>
            <p>At this ſlay doth he keep them: and not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
hee will make them to Article one againſt the
other in writing. It was my chance one day to finde
a paper of theſe Articles in a walke in the Friers
Garden, which had vnawares fallen from him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawne by one Siſter <hi>Anne,</hi> alias <hi>Ioſepha Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
againſt Siſter <hi>Suzan Bacon:</hi> Wherein the ſaid
Siſter <note n="b" place="margin">If theſe ſilly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed women were examined by men of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and were aſſured to be free from ſuch a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, they would tell of horrible abuſes,</note> 
               <hi>Suſan</hi> ſtood accuſed, for blaming her
ghoſtly Father, and the Abbeſſe and Prioreſſe of
partialitie to ſome of their children more then to
others. Alſo that ſhe had vpbraided this ſiſter <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>
(being a deare darling of Father <hi>Foſters)</hi> of too
much familiaritie with Father <hi>Garnet</hi> the Powder
Traitor, <note n="c" place="margin">This Siſter <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepha</hi> is a ſtout defender of the miracle in the Wheat Straw, which hapned as was ſaid at <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> execution, although it be now proued a very counterfet and a falselye.</note> whoſe carefull keeper ſhee had of a
long time been, when he lurked in <hi>England</hi> at her
M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> houſe. Alſo that another of her ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

(whoſe name becauſe ſhe is lately dead, I wil paſſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16480:13"/>
ouer in ſilence) and that if ſhee had been a little
more honeſt, &amp; a little leſſe perſonable, ſhe ſhould
not haue beene one of the vpper Regiment. With
this and a great deale more of ſuch like ſtuffe was
this paper farſed; and with theſe and the like accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
one of another are theſe ſilly women daily
buſied. So that I haue generally obſerued in the
ſuperiours of this houſe, an egregious neglect and
contempt of their rule and vowed profeſſion: and
in the reſt, an extraordinarie maligning and enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt one another. And ſo much the better
could I obſerue this and all other my Narrations,
by how much I grew to be a more neere and dayly
attendant about the Confeſſor; for at length, what
with my long continuance in the houſe, and the
ſmall ſuſpect they had of my forſaking them, and
what for want of one to ſerue him at all occaſions, I
became to be oftentimes admitted euen into his
priuate houſe of iniquitie, where he vſeth to ſit and
heare the Confeſſions of the Nunnes. In which
houſe being very darke, there is a grate of iron that
looketh into the Nunnes partition or ſide; and this
grate (howſoeuer it ſeeme ſubſtantiall and firme)
may be, and is with a ſleight eaſily taken out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the ſiſters haue free egreſſe and regreſſe into his
chamber when they liſt, and hee to them: for the
Abbeſſe hath her bed not farre from this Grate,
where there is alſo a chimny ſo conuenient that he
may take the benefit of the fire into this his roome,
in which he vſeth to dine and ſup, hauing his meat
ſerued him by the Nunnes through a Wicket in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16480:13"/>
the wall. And when he is merrily diſpoſed (as that
is not ſeldom) then muſt his dearling <hi>Kate Knightley</hi>
play him a merry fit, and ſiſter <hi>Mary Brooke,</hi> or ſome
other of his laſt-come Wags muſt ſing him one
bawdy ſong or other to digeſt his meat. Then after
ſupper it is vſuall for him to reade a little of <hi>Venus</hi>
and <hi>Adonis,</hi> the ieſts of <hi>George Peele,</hi> or ſome ſuch
ſcurrilous booke: for there are few idle Pamphlets
printed in <hi>England</hi> which he hath not in the houſe,
being either brought ouer to his ſonne <hi>Peter,</hi> the
drunken Familiar aforeſaid, by Sea-men: or elſe
hapning into the hands of Father <hi>Newman</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Prieſt, who hath an office in the Inquiſition
houſe to peruſe all Engliſh books that are brought
into <hi>Lisbon.</hi> And hee, I truſt, ſhall haue the ſight
of this, wherein if he vſe a good conſcience, hee
muſt needs teſtifie with mee the truth of many
things herein contained; for he is one that knoweth
more of theſe people then any but themſelues, or
ſome that haue liued amongſt them.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould repeat all their vnchaſte practiſes, I
ſhould make the Chriſtian Reader bluſh at them:
or if I ſhould tell of all the obſcene bawdry which
I haue ſeene, I might recount as many irreligious
prankes as would fill a great Volume: but it ſhall
ſuffice for the skilfull by the length of their foot, to
iudge of the proportion of their whole body.</p>
            <p>And now for their Obedience, beeing the third
and laſt part of their Vow; I will not goe about to
vſe any Theologicall Definitions or proofes to tell
what Obedience is, and how it ought to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16480:14"/>
for it is beyond my element, and the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
checke ſhall be my warning, I will not goe <hi>vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
crepidam:</hi> but as I firſt determined, ſo I will
proceed; that is, to declare in what ſort they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their vow of obedience; referring it to the
cenſure of the iudicious, whether they do wel or no.</p>
            <p>It is certain that theſe ſilly women thus muzzled
in blindneſſe, doe liue in very ſeruile obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Superiours; and, in ſuch ſort, that without
ſtanding to diſcuſſe or examine the thing that is
commanded them whether it be lawfull or no, they
will readily performe it. For their ghoſtly father
hath compoſed ſundry Treatiſes for them of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
wherein hee pronounceth no leſſe then
damnation for the leaſt ſcruple or heſitation in the
performance of their Superiours commands. And
here let me tell the aforeſaid <note n="d" place="margin">It behooueth father <hi>Newman</hi> for his own credit to looke to this. The like alſo hath he done with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meditations vpon the Paſsion, which hee reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Father <hi>Iohn Kenſington</hi> an Engliſh Ieſuite at <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Rocks</hi> in <hi>Lisbon</hi> to peruſe and approue; beeing gelded likewiſe as the other bookes of Obedience were.</note> Father <hi>Newman</hi>
what a tricke his old friend <hi>Foſter</hi> hath put vpon
him, which is this: Hauing made theſe bookes of
Obedience, he cauſed mee to write them out faire,
omitting in many places a Leafe, and in ſome two
or three together, which contained any falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and vnallowable perſwaſions to draw them
to obedience in vnlawfull things; and being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this ſort, he bringeth them to Father <hi>Newman</hi>
to be ſigned with his approbation and teſtimonie,
that there was nothing in them repugnant to the
Catholique ſaith; which beeing done, hee then
interserreth and ſoweth in the aforeſaid omitted
Leaues, and ſo deliuereth them to his daughters to
be practiſed, who take the approbation at the end
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16480:14"/>
of the booke for a ſufficient warrantie of all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
therein contained. And this is a principall
furtherance to his ſacrilegious luſts: for I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
perſwaded that not one amongſt them will (for
feare of being diſobedient) refuſe to come to his
bed whenſouer he commands them: and that they
doe ſo, I haue manifeſtly ſeene and knowne. For
when I haue been his Chamberlain in the abſence
and times of drunkennes of the familiar aforeſaid;
hauing a Key to the Chamber doore, <note n="e" place="margin">They forgate the old caueat, <hi>Cauté ſi non caſté.</hi>
               </note> I haue
come ſometimes vnawares early in a morning,
when one might haue ſeene as great a miracle as
<hi>Scoggin</hi> ſpake off when he tooke a Frier a bed with a
Whore, &amp; called out to ſee a wonder, <hi>viz.</hi> a Frier
with foure legges. And now I will a little digreſſe
to aske a queſtion of my <hi>Ignatians,</hi> who are the
chiefe teachers and allowers of equiuocation and
mentall euaſion; whether theſe kinde-hearted
ſoules being profeſſed Nunnes, and hauing vowed
neuer to come ouer the threſhold, did breake
their Vow or no, in comming thorow a grate? If
they ſay they did: why, their ghoſtly father will
diſpence with their Vow: but if they ſay they did
not; (as I thinke they will) what then? Marry I
thinke that when their blacke Synagogues at <hi>Rome,
Valladolid</hi> and <hi>Siuill</hi> doe ſend forth their Locuſts
into <hi>England,</hi> and they chance to bait by the way
at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as they doe oftentimes: they deſerue to
enter commons with old father <hi>Seth</hi> for their legit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of the action. And to the end that no
man ſhould doubt, but a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> hath a carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16480:15"/>
as well as a ſpirituall, to any of his ghoſtly
children, it ſhall not be amiſſe to interſert a merry
Tale for the Readers recreation of one father
<hi>Strange</hi> an Engliſh <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> as it was reported for
<note n="f" place="margin">Inter caenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum bilares eſte.</note> table-talke by a Nun of this houſe to her ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
father; ſhe hauing then beene a chamber-maid
in the place where it was done.</p>
            <p>This Father <hi>Strange</hi> was a yong man, and had
been lately before profeſt and prieſted among the
<hi>Ieſuites:</hi> and being come of good friends, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
brought vp in <hi>England,</hi> he fell very ſick ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after his profeſsion, perhaps by reaſon of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſomneſſe
of the aire which neither at <hi>Rome</hi>
nor <hi>Valladolid</hi> is very pleaſant: wherevpon hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
licence of the <hi>Rector</hi> to goe into <hi>England,</hi>
where he hoped both to recouer his health, and to
employ his talent of Prieſthood, for the reducing
of Heretiques to the Catholique Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And being arriued, he took vp this Nunnes Ladies
Chamber for one of his places of <hi>rendezvous:</hi>
where it ſo fell out, that as this ſiſter <hi>Anne</hi> (for that
is her name) ſate ſowing with her backe to her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
backe and the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who were ſitting by the
fire, ſhee chanced to looke vpon a great Looking-glaſſe
which hung right before her, wherein ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed
what paines the late ſicke <hi>Ieſuite</hi> tooke to
ſhriue her Lady: neither had he ended his ſhrift,
before he alſo eſpied her looking in the Glaſſe; and
ſuſpecting that ſhee had ſeene all, (as indeed ſhee
had) <note n="g" place="margin">Shee might haue knowne by this, what ſhe ſhould truſt to when ſhe was a Nunne: but it ſeemes ſhe was as good as her Miſtreſſe: and I am ſure that her Father <hi>Foſter</hi> is a good as the <hi>Ieſuite.</hi>
               </note> he tooke her aſide in priuate, and told her
that he was fleſh and bloud, and could abſtaine no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16480:15"/>
more then another man, although at his profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had vowed chaſtitie: and vſing many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
to win her to be ſecret, he promiſed her,
that if ſhe ſtood in need of a ghoſtly father to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
her from any of her ſweet ſinnes, (as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
theſe) he would be the man ſhould doe it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould her penance be ouer-burthenſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her.</p>
            <p>By which may appeare both the carnall affection
of a Ieſuite, and the chaſte and ſober conuerſation
of a profeſt Nunne, and her ghoſtly father: of the
Ieſuit in doing it; of her, in not ſhaming to tell it as
a tale for recreation; and of the old fornicator, in
making himſelfe merry at the hearing of it; yea,
and reporting it againe in his iolly humors to my
ſelfe, and one Father <hi>Viuian</hi> a Frier of the houſe; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
a great ſort of ſuch like inuectiues which he
vſed againſt the Ieſuits, becauſe, a little before I
came away, they went about (if it had beene poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
to extrude the ſucceſsion of any more Friers
in the Houſe, and to bring it vnder their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which I beleeue they will ere long effect.
For I was told by an Engliſh Ieſuite at the Court
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that father <hi>Foster</hi> is bound vnto the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
neuer to ordaine any more Friers in the houſe,
that ſo for want of ſucceſſors it may of force fall
into their hands; and vpon this condition the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
permit him to liue quietly; which, if hee
ſhould not obſerue, they would quickly informe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him of ſundry of his prankes which they
know well inough. And if this be ſo, (as like it is)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16480:16"/>
the Nunnes haue no knowledge thereof, for hee
feedeth them with hope of making new brothers,
which they ſeeme earneſtly to wiſh for: <note n="a" place="margin">The Nunnes thought ſurely it ſhould be ſo, and if he did not meane ſo, yet I was loth to truſt to it, in regard of his daily earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with me concerning that matter.</note> and
they would often tell me, they hoped ere long to
ſee me a profeſt brother of the Couent: but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to diſpoſe better for me, and not to ſuffer
me to bee any longer lulled in ſinne and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for after I had beene two yeeres and an halfe
with them, I found a meanes to free my ſelfe from
them, before I had made any profeſsion or vow of
religion either to that or any other Order: for I
plainely ſaw, that theſe were led by a wrong guide,
who was ſo deepe plunged, and had continued ſo
long in all wickedneſſe and diſſembling, that hee
was growne inſenſible of ſinne; according to that
ſaying, <hi>Conſuetudo peccandi, tollit ſenſum peccati.</hi> For
he ſhamed not, vnder pretext of Religion, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a young man, a Merchant in <hi>Lisbon</hi> (one
<hi>How</hi> doe you call him) to defraud his <note n="b" place="margin">Theſe two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are both liuing in <hi>Lisbon</hi> at this preſent, and well knowne to moſt Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that vſe <hi>Portugall.</hi>
               </note> owne el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother of his eſtate; which matter was thus
effected.</p>
            <p>Theſe two brethren were by profeſsion Iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and aduentured their ſtocke ioyntly together:
the yonger brother (for that hee was a Bachelor)
being Factor for it beyond the ſeas. At length ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made many good returnes, hee tooke vp his
abode in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as a place moſt conuenient for his
Trade; and falling into familiarity with this Father
<hi>Foſter,</hi> and Father <hi>Flood</hi> a Ieſuite, who then liued in
<hi>Lisbon,</hi> they perſwaded him to become a Romane
Catholique, and ſo ſoone as he could get his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16480:16"/>
Stock againe into his hands, to profeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſuch; which he accordingly did: and ſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtructed by them, that it was meritorious to
coozen an Heretique, as they account all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants)
defrauded his brother, and would come to
no accompts with him, relying vpon the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of theſe Hypocrites, on whom he beſtowed
liberall almes; giuing them many faire pictures for
their Church, and a horſe of twenty <hi>mil-reis</hi> price,
to fetch home their prouiſions to the Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
diuers other things: whilſt in the meane time
his brother was vndone, and could get nothing at
his hands by Law, in regard hee was a Proteſtant.
Whereupon hee was faine to petition in <hi>England</hi>
for redreſſe many times, and yet could not preuaile
to recouer any thing: yea, he refuſed to come into
his owne Country, or to obey the command of
the Councell, in giuing ſatisfaction for what hee
had in his hands. At length the Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Ambaſſadour into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſtaying by
the way at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> (where he landed) decided the
matter betwixt them; and articles of agreement
were drawne by Father <hi>Newman,</hi> which my ſelfe
afterward wrote out faire for them: the tenour
whereof was this in effect: That either of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould by a day prefixed, bring in a iuſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of all debts due vnto them, as likewiſe of all
debts which either of them ought: alſo that they
ſhould bring in all ſuch moneys and goods as did
any way as their owne belong vnto them: and that
they ſhould both depoſe and ſweare, that they had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16480:17"/>
truly laid open their eſtates. And this being done,
their debts which they ought, were to be payed out
of the whole ſumme, and the debts which were
owing to them, were to be added vnto it; and ſo
they to ſhare equally betwixt them whatſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
that by this meanes their eſtates might be
both alike. Now a few dayes before this was to
be put in effect, the yonger brother knowing his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to be farre better then the others, commeth
very penſiuely to his ghoſtly Father old <hi>Foſter</hi> for
counſell; who inſtructed him to come to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe,
and ſome other of the ſiſters at their Grate,
where they vſe to talke with ſtrangers, and there to
tell them that he was weary of the troubles and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations
which attended a Merchants life, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would renounce the world, and become a
religious man: and ſeeing that God had beſtowed
ſufficient wealth vpon him, he could not do better,
then to impart it to them; being ſuch holy Saints
as had preferred that kind of life in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
before all worldly contents in their owne. And
thereupon at his fained requeſt, they ſent their
horſe to his houſe, and had him laden backe with
plate, iewels and money, which my ſelfe helped to
take from the horſe-backe, and carry into <hi>Foſters</hi>
Cell. He had likewiſe at that time a great quantity
of <hi>Cochenill</hi> in ſundry bagges, being at leaſt foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
or fifteene hundred waight, amounting to
no ſmall ſumme of money, which he had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bought of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, who that yeere,
and about that time put into <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and this was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16480:17"/>
brought into the Nunnery by night out of the
ſhippes, to defraud the King of his right, and was
vnder a colour, together with the other things, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the Siſters of the Houſe. By which dealing
he ſo imbezeled his eſtate, that when his brother
and he came to an accompt, there remained little
or nothing for him to receiue; being by this means
defrauded of all hee ſhould haue had. When as
preſently after this concluſion was made betweene
them, Father <hi>Foſter</hi> and the Abbeſſe ſend for their
ghoſtly child, giuing him thankes for the good wil
he had to beſtow his eſtate vpon them: but they
told him, (as was before determined) that ſo much
money and wealth was an hinderance to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion;
and therefore they requeſted him to haue
it away againe: to which he ſoone condeſcended;
telling them, that now alſo his chiefeſt troubles
were ouerpaſt, (meaning, becauſe hee had done
with his brother) and that he perceiued it was not
Gods will to make him ſo happy, as (ſuch another
youth) Father <hi>Nicholas Price,</hi> who awhile before,
of a Merchant, became a <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier: and
therefore hee would liue as aforetimes; and when
he died, hee would bequeath all hee had to the
Church: and thereupon tooke home all his eſtate
againe, after he had by theſe aequiuocations and
euaſions, defrauded his brother.</p>
            <p>And now leſt this Treatiſe ſhould riſe to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-bigge
Volume, I will haſten to an end, after I
haue in a few words ſet downe the manner of my
departure from them, which was thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:16480:18"/>
After I had continued with them for the ſpace
of two yeeres and an halfe, and had plainly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that all their outward ſhew of holineſſe was
nothing but diſſimulation, hypocriſie and luſtfull
ſacriledge, I began to conſider in what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eſtate I ſhould be, if God ſhould at that time
call me out of the world; for I could well ſay with
the Poet, <hi>Video meliora, proboque, deterior a ſequor,</hi>
I ſaw and allowed of the beſt way, yet followed the
worſt: at length the feare of my ſoules health, and
a naturall affection to my kindred and countrey ſo
wrought with me, that I waxed reſolute in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of forſaking them: but not knowing
how to effect my purpoſe without hazard of my
life, (for they would haue poyſoned me, if they had
knowne I would haue gone from them, becauſe I
ſhould not bewray their ſecrets) it came in my
mind to draw out certaine Articles in manner of
an information againſt them, which I thought to
exhibite to the chiefe Inquiſitors of the Citie. And
this might haue beene very dangerous vnto me, if
they ſhould not haue proceeded according to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie;
of which I was doubtful, fearing that <note n="a" place="margin">Reade <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, for forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Monkes, and Romiſh Religion after he had bin 20. yeeres pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great men of other Monaſteries (being perhaps
in the ſame predicament) would haue ſtopped the
courſe of Iuſtice, <hi>propter honorem Monaſtica vitae,</hi>
for the credit of a Monaſticall life, as is many
times done: yet notwithſtanding I was reſolued to
vndertake this courſe, and had prouided my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which were theſe:</p>
            <p>1. That Father <hi>Seth,</hi> alias <hi>Ioſeph Foſter,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16480:18"/>
of the Engliſh Nunnes of Saint <hi>Brigets</hi> Order
in Lisbon, did compell diuers youths his countrimen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their wils to remaine with him in the houſe: who
if they had any good affection to the Romiſh Catholike
faith before they came there, were ſoone brought into
diſlike of it, by reaſon of the ill gouernement which is
vſed in the houſe. <hi>And of this ſort I could haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
in twenty, who within a few yeeres haue
beene recorded in their Regiſter booke, for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
runne-awayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>He would daily without any companion goe into
the Nunnes Cloiſter or Side, and remaine there halfe
a day together, yea and ſometime, ſit and dine at their
Table with them: but euery day in their ſight, which
is expreſſely againſt their Rule.</hi> And this I could haue
prooued by the teſtimonie of diuers <hi>Portugeſes</hi> our
neighbours, who frequenting the houſe, haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
obſerued and ſeene him going in, and
comming foorth; and haue ſpoken of it to my ſelfe
and others. Alſo the Nunnes themſelues would
haue auouched it vpon their examinations.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>He hath in his Cell, where he heareth their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
a Grate, which I can ſhew how he vſeth to take
downe with a ſleight, thorow which the Nunnes paſse
to his bed by night.</hi> And for the further auouching
of this, I would haue brought in the drunken fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
aforeſaid, who will many times in his drinke,
tell how he helped to make it firme, againſt a time
when there was a Viſitation intended by the Popes
<hi>Nuncio,</hi> and expected by them of the Houſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was not performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:16480:19"/>
4. That in many yeeres paſt there neuer came any
Viſitor to the Houſe, to examine and vnderstand their
grieuances: neither haue they any Confeſſor extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
as all other Religious haue, to whom they might
freely complaine of their Superiours oppreſsions. <hi>And
this needed ſmall proofe, for it would ſoone haue
beene apparant enough of it ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Through his politique plotting, he cauſeth whom
he liſt to be elected Abbeſse,</hi> (for they hold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but three yeeres) <hi>and her to diſpoſe of the Houſe
as he thinketh good.</hi> This alſo the Nunnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
would quickly complaine of, if they had one
to heare their complaint.</p>
            <p>6. That my ſelfe (being diuers times called into the
Nunnes partition or ſide, to helpe them to nayle vp
boords, ſet vp their Vines in the walkes of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and doe ſuch like things which women could not
ſo well doe) did chance to make a hole in a hollow place in
a wall, (which had beene latelier dawbed vp then the
reſt) to ſet vp a Sparre to vnderprop the Vines; out of
which hole I pulled ſundry bones of ſome dead children,
and left many more remaining behind. <hi>And this the
place it ſelfe would haue teſtified to be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus prouided my Articles in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
I abſented my ſelfe from helping the Prieſt
at Maſſe that day, who being readie to go into the
Church, and miſſing mee, was faine to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Clerke, whilſt I walked vp and downe my
chamber, with a reſolute mind to depart the houſe.
At length commeth Father <hi>Foſter,</hi> (for he vſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day to viſit me at vnawares, to ſee if he could
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16480:19"/>
finde mee writing of any thing that diſliked him)
and eſpied vpon my table (which I had negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgot) a blotted Copy of my Articles, beeing
the firſt draught of them: which when I ſaw him
take vp, I proffered to ſnatch out of his hand, but
miſſed of my purpoſe; and therevpon went downe
the ſtaires, and ſo tooke my way out at the gates:
but he (hauing ſoon perceiued to whom they were
intended) followed mee amaine, and quickly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
me, yea, euen before I was paſt his own wals;
and demanding of mee what I meant by ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I told him my intent; and bade him peruſe the
Articles at large, giuing him a faire copy of them
out of my boſom, where I had three or foure more.</p>
            <p>But as ſoone as he had read them, he waxed pale
as aſhes, and was ſo terrified, that he began earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to intreat me that I ſhould not proceed with my
purpoſe, and told mee that if I would bee ſecret, I
ſhould haue his good will to depart; whereof bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad, I not onely promiſed, but performed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie,
(although indeed I ought not to haue done
it) not bewraying any of his prankes to my neereſt
acquaintance and friends; vntill ſuch time as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
occaſion a few months after to be at <hi>Lisbon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he ſuſpected mee vniuſtly of telling tales of
his houſe; and meeting mee one day in the ſtreet,
he called me to him, and told me, that if I did not
preſently depart the City, he would haue my throat
cut. Vpon which his diuelliſh ſpeech I could not
refraine any longer, but in the open ſtreet I told him
of many of his vngodly actions, which came to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16480:20"/>
hearing of diuers of our Nation, beeing men of
good qualitie, whereof ſome haue teſtified in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to Honorable Perſonages in my behalfe, how
ready and willing I was to auouch and maintaine
whatſoeuer is herein contained, and much more:
which (although it be here omitted) I am ready at
all times truely to declare and ſet forth for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of all that deſire it: but eſpecially for ſuch
as haue either Daughters or Kinſwomen in that
houſe, in whoſe behalfe I am bound to intreat their
friends to enter into a further ſearch of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
eſtate and condition; and (hauing found my
words true) to vſe meanes, if it be poſsible, to free
them from ſuch horrible and ſacrilegious rapine
and ſpoile; themſelues not being able to ſend any
word thereof, becauſe all their Letters muſt bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to him to be ſent into <hi>England;</hi> which if they
contain any thing contrary to his mind, ſhal neuer
be ſent; for hee will peruſe them all. And likewiſe
when their friends ſend to them, the Letters muſt
firſt come to his hands, wherein alſo if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that he miſliketh (for he will breake them
all vp) they ſhall neuer know of it. And here I will
conclude, hoping that the friendly Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wil be no way ſcandalized with any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. But as for the curious and captious
(eſpecially <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> if they taxe me for any thing
I haue written, let them know I haue done neither
them not any of their ſect any wrong in publiſhing
the truth. If any of them amongſt theſe inſuing
names finde either a Siſter or Kinſwoman, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16480:20"/>
Friend, let him ſigh to thinke on their miſery, and
vſe his beſt indeuours to free them. I haue not ſet
downe-all their names, becauſe I cannot well call
them to remembrance; neither are many of theſe
chriſten names the ſame which they had in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it being vſuall at the Biſhops confirmation to
take what name they will: as alſo ſome of the ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
are not their true names indeed; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
do many times change their names: but there
are few of theſe which are not right; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
they are knowne to their friends by theſe.</p>
