            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So now I shall have lesse will, than heretofore, to use such ceremonies; When I have left with <hi>Martha</hi> to be, <hi>Solicitus circa multa,</hi> and beleeve with <hi>Mary, unum sufficit,</hi> but it is no complement or ceremony, but a reall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty, that one friend oweth to another in absence, and especially at their leave taking, when in mans reason many accidents may either keepe them long divided, or perhaps barre their meeting till they meet in another world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For then shall I think that my friend, whose honour, whose person, and whose fortune, is deare unto mee shall prosper and be happy where ever he goe, and what ever hee takes in hand, when he is in the favour of that God, under whose protection there is only safety, and in whose service there is only true happinesse to be found. What I think of your naturall gifts, or of your abilities in this age, and in this state to give glory to God, and to winne honour to your self, if

you imploy the talents you have received, to their best use; I will not now tell you, it sufficeth that when I was furthest of all times from dissembling, I spake truly, and have witnesse enough. But those things I will only put your Lordship in mind of. First, that you have nothing that you have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Secondly, That you possesse them not as a Lord over them, but as an accomptant for them. Thirdly, If you imploy them to serve this world, or your owne wotldly delights, which the Prince of this world will seek to entertain you with; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, it is injustice, yea, it is perfidious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. For what would you think that such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of yours, that shall convert your goods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, to the advantage or service of your greatest Enemie: And what do you lesse than thus with God, since you have all from him, and know that the world and the Ptince thereof are at continuall enmity with him. If ever therefore the admonition of your truest friend be heard by you, or your Country (which you may serve in so great and many respects) be deare unto you: If your God (whom you must, if you deale truly with your selfe, acknowledge to be powerfull over all, and just in all) be feared by you; yea, if you be deare unto your selfe, and prefer an everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before a pleasant dreame, which you must shortly awake out of, and then repent in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your soule, any of these things be regarded by you; then, I say, call your selfe to an accompt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58024:3"/>
for what is past, Cancell all the leagues which you made without the warrant of a religious consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, make a resolute Covenant with your God to serve him with all your naturall and spirituall inward and outward gifts and abilities, and then he that is faithfull and cannot lie, hath promised to honour them that honour him, he will give you that inward peace of soule, and true joy of heart; which til you have you shal never rest, which when you have you shall never be shaken, and which you can never attaine to by any other way then this that I have shewed you; I know your Lordship that when you reade this, you may say to your selfe, and object to me, this is but a vapour of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchollie, and a stile of a prisoner; and that I was farre enough from it when I lived in the world (as you do now; and may doe so againe when my fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are taken from me. I answer, Though your Lordship should thinke so, yet cannot I distrust the goodnesse of my God, that his mercie will fail me, or his grace forsake me, I have so deepely inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my self that I should be one of the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Apostates</hi> that ever was: I have so avowed my profession, and called so many from time to time to witnesse it, and to be watchmen over me, that I should be the hollowest <hi>Hypocrite</hi> that ever lived, and the most detestable <hi>Atheist</hi> that ever was borne. But though I should perish in my owne sinne, and drawe upon my selfe my owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; should not you take holde of the Grace and Mercy of God which is offered

and make your profit of my fearefull, wretched and miserable example. I was longer a slave and servant to the world, and the corruption of it, than you have been, and therefore could hardly be drawn from it, I had many callings, and answered some of them: thinking a soft pace fast enough to come to Christ: and my selfe forward enough, when I saw the end of my journey, though I arrived not at it. Therefore I have beene by Gods providence vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pulled, halled, and dragged to the Marriage feast, as all the world hath seene. It was just with God to afflict me in this world, that he might give me joy in another: I had too much knowledge, while I performed too little obedience, and was therefore to be beaten with double stripes; God grant your Lordship may quietly feele the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts I now injoy in my unfained conversion, but that you never feele the torments I have suffered for the too long delaying it; I had none but Divines to call upon me: To whom I said, If my ambition could have entred into their narrow hearts, they would not have bin so humble; or if my delights had bin once tasted by them, they would not have bin so precise; But your Lordship hath one to call upon you that knowes what it is you now enjoy, and what the greatest fruit and end is of all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that this world can afford; thinke therefore (Deare Earle) that I have staked and bounded all the wayes of pleasure to you, and left them as sea-markes for you to keep the channell of religious

ventures; for shut your eyes never so long, they must be opened at last, and then you must say with me, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked and ungodly, I will make a covenant with my soule:</hi> not suffer mine eyes to sleep in the night, nor my thoughts to attend the first businesse of the day, till I have prayed to my God that your Lordship may beleeve, and may profit by this plain, but faithfull admonition. And then I know your Country and friend shal be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in you, and you successefull in all you take in hand: which shall be an unspeakable comfort to your Lordships</p>
