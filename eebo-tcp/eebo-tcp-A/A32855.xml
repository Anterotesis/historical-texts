            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Good Mr.</hi> Lewger,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I am resolved not to be much afflicted at that which is not in my power to Help; yet I cannot deny but the <hi>loss of a Friend</hi> goes very near to my heart, and by this name of a <hi>Friend,</hi> I did presume, till of late, that I might have called you; because though perhaps for want of power and oportunity I have done you no good office, yet I have always been willing and ready to do you the best Service I could, and therefore I cannot but admire at your affected strangeness which in your <hi>last Letter</hi> to me you seem to take upon you; renouncing in a manner all Relation to me, and tacitly <hi>Excommunicating</hi> me from all Interest in you. The <hi>Superscription</hi> of your Letter is to Mr. <hi>William Chillingworth,</hi> and the Subscription <hi>Iohn Lewger,</hi> as if you either disdained, or made a Conscience of stiling me your <hi>Friend,</hi> or your self mine. If this proceed from <hi>passion</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> pray mend it; if from <hi>reason</hi> pray shew it: If you think me one of those to whom St. <hi>Iohn</hi> forbids you to say <hi>(God save you)</hi> then you are to think and prove me one of those Deceivers, which <hi>deny Christ Iesus to be come in the flesh:</hi> If you think me an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and therefore to be avoided, you must
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66451:3"/>
prove me to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>condemned</hi> by mine <hi>own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which I know I am not, and therefore think you cannot. If you say I do not <hi>hear the Church,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am to be esteemed an <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Publican,</hi> you are to prove then that by the <hi>Church</hi> is meant the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and yet when you have done so, I hope <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are not forbidden to shew <hi>humanity</hi> and <hi>civility</hi> even to <hi>Pagans?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God's sake Mr. <hi>Lewger</hi> free your self from this <hi>blind Zeal,</hi> at least for a little space, and consider with reason and moderation, what strange Crime you can charge me with that should deserve this strange usage, especially from you: Is it a Crime with all my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to endeavour to find your <hi>Religion</hi> true, and to make my self a believer of it, and not to be able to do so? Is it a crim<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to imploy all my reason upon the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman-Church;</hi> and to find it impossible e to be justified? I will call God to witness, who knows my heart better than you do, that I have <hi>evened the Scale of my Iudgment,</hi> as much as possibly I could, and have not willingly allowed one grain of worldly motives on either side, but have <hi>weighed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> for <hi>your Religion,</hi> and against it, with such <hi>indifference,</hi> as if there were nothing in the world but God and my self; and is it my fault that the <hi>Scale</hi> goes down which hath the most weight in it? that the Building falls that hath a false foundation? Have you such power over your understanding, that you can believe what you please, though you see no Reason? Or that you can suspend your belief, when you see Reason? If you have, I pray for old <hi>Friendship</hi>'s sake, teach me this trick, and until I have learned it, I pray blame me not for going
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66451:3"/>
the ordinary way, I mean for believing, or not believing as I see reason. If you can convince me of <hi>wilful opposition</hi> against the <hi>known Truth;</hi> of <hi>negligence</hi> in <hi>seeking</hi> it, of <hi>unwillingness</hi> to find it, of preferring temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects before it, or of any other fault which is in my power to amend, that is indeed a fault, if I mend it not; be as angry with me as you please; but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to me <hi>involuntary Errors,</hi> or that I do not see that which I would see, but cannot; or that I will not profess that which I do not believe; certainly this is a far more <hi>unreasonable errour,</hi> then any you can justly charge me with; for let me tell you, the imputing <hi>Socinianisme</hi> to me (whosoever was the Author of it) was a wicked and groundless Slander. Perhaps you will say (for this is the usual Song of that side) <hi>Pride is a voluntary fault,</hi> and with this I am justly chargeable, for forsaking the <hi>Guide</hi> that God hath appointed me to follow: but what if I forsook it, because I thought I had reason to fear it was one of those <hi>blind Guides,</hi> which whosoever blindly follows, is threatned by our Saviour, that both <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Guide</hi> shall <hi>fall into the Ditch?</hi> then I hope you will grant it was <hi>not Pride,</hi> but <hi>Conscience,</hi> that moved me to do so; for as it is wise humility to obey those whom God hath set over me, so is it sinful credulity to follow every man, or every Church, that without warrant will take upon them to guide me: shew then some good and evident title which your <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath to this Office; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but one reason for it, which upon tryal will not finally be resolved and vanished into incertainty, and if I yield not unto it, say, if you please, I am as proud as <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66451:4"/>
In the mean time give me leave to think it strange, and not far from a Prodigy, that this Doctrine of the <hi>Roman Churches</hi> being the <hi>Guide of Faith</hi> (if it be true Doctrine) should either not be known to the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> or if it were known to them, yet being Wise and Good Men, they should either be so envious of the Churches Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or so forgetful of the Work they took in hand, which was to write the <hi>Whole Gospel of Christ,</hi> as that not so much as one of them should mention so much as once this so necessary part of the Gospel, without the belief whereof there is no Salvation, and with the belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unless men be snatched away by sudden death, there is hardly any damnation. It is evident they do all of them with one consent speak very plainly of many things of no importance in comparison hereof, and is it credible or indeed possible that with one consent or rather conspiracy, they should be so deeply silent concerning this <hi>Unum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarium?</hi> You may believe it if you can, for my part I cannot, unless I see demonstration for it: And if you say they send us to the <hi>Church,</hi> and consequently to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> this is to suppose that which can never be proved, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the <hi>only Church,</hi> and without this supposal upon the Division of the Church, I am as far to seek for a Guide of my Faith as ever.</p>
            <p>As for Example: In that <hi>Great Division of the Church</hi> when the whole World wonder'd, said St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> that it was become <hi>Arrian,</hi> when <hi>Liberius</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (as St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and St. <hi>Hilary</hi> testifie, subscribed their Heresie, and joyned in communion with them: or in the Division betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Church,</hi> about the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost,</hi> when either side was the Church to it self, and each part <hi>Schismatical</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66451:4"/>
               <hi>Heretical</hi> to the other: what direction could I then, an ignorant man, have found from the Text of Scripture, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen or a Publican: Upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Give me leave to wonder that neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> should so much as intimate this their priviledge of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but rather on the contrary put them in fear in the 11 Chapter, that they, as well as the Jews, were in danger of <hi>falling away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the pretended Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing <hi>two Catholick Epistles,</hi> mentioning his departure, should not once acquaint the <hi>Christians</hi> whom he writes to, what Guide they were to follow after he was taken from them!</p>
            <p>That the Writers of the <hi>New Testament</hi> should so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently warn men of <hi>Hereticks, false Christs, false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and not once arm them against them, with letting them know this onely sure means of avoiding their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger!</p>
            <p>That so great a part of the <hi>New Testament</hi> should be imployed about <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and so little, and indeed none at all, about the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> and the Guide of the Faithful!</p>
            <p>That our Saviour should leave this only means for the <hi>Ending of Controversies,</hi> and yet speak so obscurely and ambiguously of it, that now our <hi>Iudge</hi> is the greatest <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,</hi> and the greatest hindrance of ending of them!</p>
            <p>That there should be better evidence in the Scripture to justifie the <hi>King</hi> to this Office, who disclaims it, than the <hi>Pope,</hi> who pretends to it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66451:5"/>
That St. <hi>Peter</hi> should never exercise over the <hi>Apostles</hi> any one <hi>Act of Iurisdiction,</hi> not they ever give him any one Title of Authority over them!</p>
            <p>That if the <hi>Apostles</hi> did know that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was made <hi>Head</hi> of them, when our Saviour said, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> they should still contend who should be the First, and that our Saviour should never tell them that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man!</p>
            <p>That St. <hi>Paul</hi> should say he was nothing inferiour to the very <hi>chief Apostles!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> should never be taught this Foundation of their Faith, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was the <hi>Guide</hi> of their Faith!</p>
            <p>That the Fathers, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> when they flew highest in recommendation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, should attribute no more unto her than to all <hi>Apostolical</hi> Churches!</p>
            <p>That in the Controversie about <hi>Easter,</hi> the Bishops and Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> should be so ill Catechised as not to know this Principle of Christian Religion, The necessity of <hi>Conformity</hi> of Doctrine with the Church of <hi>Rome!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they should never be pressed with any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in all things, but only with the particular Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Western Churches in that point!</p>
            <p>That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and many other <hi>Bishops</hi> notwithstanding, <hi>Ad hanc Ecclesiam necesse est omnem convenire Ecclesiam,</hi> should not yet think that a necessary Doctrine, nor a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought to be so!</p>
            <p>That St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Affrick</hi> should be so ill-instructed in their Faith, as not to know this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66451:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That they likewise were never urged with any such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ever charged with Heresie or Errour for denying of it!</p>
            <p>That when <hi>Liberius</hi> joyned in Communion with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and subscribed their <hi>Heresie,</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> then should not be the Church, and the Guide of the Faith.</p>
            <p>That never any Hereticks for five Ages after Christ were pressed with this Argument of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or charged with the denial of it as a distinct <hi>Heresie,</hi> so that <hi>AEneas Sylvius</hi> should have cause to say, <hi>Ante tempora Concilii Niceni quisque sive vivebat, &amp; parvus respectus habebatur ad Ecclesiam Romanam!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Ecclesiastical Story</hi> of these times, mentions no <hi>Act of Authority</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Churches; as if there should be a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> for some Ages together should exercise no <hi>Act of Iurisdiction</hi> in it!</p>
            <p>That to supply this defect, the <hi>Decretal Epistles</hi> should be so impudently forged, which in a manner speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <hi>Reges &amp; Monarchas,</hi> I mean the <hi>Popes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws to exercise Authority over all other Churches!</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Affrican</hi> Churches in Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s time should be ignorant that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, and Judge of Appeals <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Conformity with the Church in this and all other points of Doctrine!</p>
            <p>Nay that the <hi>Popes</hi> themselves should be so ignorant of the ground of this their Authority, as to pretend to it, not upon Scripture or Universal Tradition; but upon an imaginary pretended <hi>Non-such-Canon</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> seeking for a Guide of his Faith and a Preservation from Heresie, should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66451:6"/>
of this so ready an one, the <hi>Infallibility of the Church of Rome!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these things, and many more, are very strange to me, if the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be indeed, and were always by Christians acknowledged the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith: and therefore I beseech you pardon me, if I chose mine upon one that is much firmer and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and lies open to none of these Objections, which is <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Universal Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if one that is of <hi>this Faith</hi> may have leave so to do, I will subscribe with hand and heart,</p>
