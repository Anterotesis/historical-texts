            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough theſe following lines were at firſt deſigned for a private Perſon, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to his condition, yet ſeeing there are many, Oh too many ſick of the ſame diſeaſe! and <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is become a publick diſtemper in poor and rich; I thought it not amiſs to make my Receipt publick alſo. This diſeaſe is become epidemical, and all the Phyſicians in <hi>England</hi> know not how to ſet a ſtop to it, 'tis like a mighty torrent that bears down all before it, ſo that <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> ſeem to ſtrive for the Preheminence. Now though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that my little Dam can ſet a ſtop to this fierce Flood, which doubtleſs will ſoon mount over it, and bear it down, yet being made in ſome ſmall Stream it may poſſibly do ſome good, or however, when I have done my duty, and witneſſed for my God againſt this debauchery, <hi>My
<pb facs="tcp:40444:3"/>
reward will be with my God, and though</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>be not gathered my labour will not be in vain,</hi> Iſa. <hi>49. 4 &amp;c.</hi> and I ſhall ſtand up at laſt in my lot to witneſs againſt thoſe that now ſhut their eyes againſt the light: If theſe Lines meet with any that are not guilty, let them bleſs God that hath made them to differ, and let them be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Phyſick againſt future temptations, and <hi>let him that ſtandeth take heed leaſt he fall.</hi> But <hi>Reader,</hi> If thou art guilty, conſider well the ſtrength of Reaſon, and the ſorce of Scripture ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments here brought, for thy Conviction, and ſhut not thine eyes againſt either, for the time will come God will open them, and if thou canſt not ſpeak as much Reaſon and Scripture for <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> as bere thou findeſt againſt it, take heed of reſiſting God, and the Meſſage he hath ſent thee, for I am ſure thou canſt not reſiſt his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he hath threatned againſt ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful offenders, and <hi>'tis hard to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> I know this diſcourſe runs croſs to the humours of the Time, and the ſinful inclination of corrupt nature, yet though the Phyſick ſeem ſharp 'tis ſafe, old Diſeaſes are not uſually cured with Cordial Syrups, nor old feaſtered Sores with leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Plaſters, a gentle reproof will not work upon an incorrigible Perſon, or gray Headed Sinner; ſome happly may quarrel the Language, as well as the matter, becauſe the Pills are not Sugared, but when there is Fire in the Town, men ſtand not to make an eloquent Oration, but cry <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> I write to thoſe that many times can neither
<pb facs="tcp:40444:3"/>
ſpeak Sence nor underſtand Reaſon, to thoſe who had rather be accounted Good-fellows, than either good livers or good Chriſtians; and my deſign is to make them better Livers, rather than better Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians, and ſeeing they ſin in <hi>Engliſh</hi> why ſhould they be reproved in <hi>Latine,</hi> they had need have one ſpeak loud enough, leſt they are aſleep, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the crowd of their Drunken Companions; for then 'tis hard to make them hear or regard. All the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> could not awaken <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> till the red Sea convinced him; neither could all the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> convince the <hi>Jews</hi> till <hi>Titus Veſpatian</hi> ſwept them away: the <hi>Sodomites</hi> when ſtruck with Blindneſs, yet were not cured of their madneſs, till Fire, and Brimſtone convinc'd them of their folly, and 'tis to be feared, that nothing but Fire and Brimſtone will awake many of our drowſy <hi>Drunkards;</hi> this will make them ſee God ſpake in earneſt what they took in jeaſt. If any pretend they make no profeſſion of Religion, and therefore are not concerned with part of the Book, it being adapted only to ſuch, this will prove but a bad excuſe, they never pretended to ſerve God, and therefore may the more freely break his Laws, but I conceive all thoſe that own that there is a God, make ſome profeſſion to ſerve him, but let their profeſſion be what it will, without Holineſs they ſhall never enjoy Happineſs, and truly till a man break off from wicked Company there is little hopes of a Reſormation. When <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was in <hi>Caiphas</hi>'s Hall, he ſoon learnt to deny his Maſter, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in <hi>Egypt</hi> he learnt

to ſwear <hi>by the life of</hi> Pharaoh; If <hi>Solomon</hi> will have <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter to Wife, he ſhall have her Idols alſo. The <hi>Fuller</hi> in the Fable, would not dwell with the <hi>Collier</hi> for fear of a Smut, and whoever would avoid <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> muſt avoid Drunken companions: he that would avoid Infection muſt beware of Infected Perſons, and Infected Places; a man that would be Chaſt muſt not live in a Brothel-houſe, and he that would be ſober muſt not haunt Alehouſes and Taverns. I ſhall add no more at preſent, but wiſh that what I have written may be beneficial to that end for which it is written. I now reſt,</p>

of Reformation, yet nothing is done; this hath been no ſmall grief to me. In this diſtemper therefore give me leave alſo among other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to preſcribe you ſome Pills, which though they may ſeem untoothſom, may prove whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and may be the better ſwallowed being Sugared with Love; a feaſtered Sore is ſeldom cured with gentle Lenitives, a deſperat Diſeaſe muſt have a deſperate Cure, what the event of it may be as to you I know not, or what effect it will work upon you, however my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be with <hi>God,</hi> and my judgment with the Moſt High: you may read my Commiſſion, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him, and not ſuffer ſin to lie upon him.</hi> He is no friend to your Soul that is a friend to your Sin; 'tis true <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth, <hi>not to reprove a Scorner leſt he hate thee, but rebuke a Wiſe man and he will love thee,</hi> Prov. 9. 8. and by your reception of this, you will diſcover your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Folly, <hi>David</hi> bid, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oyle, which ſhall not break my head, for my prayer alſo ſhall be in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,</hi> Pſal. 141. 5. and we find he loved <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> never the worſe for a ſharp reproof; 'tis a Chriſtians duty, much more a Miniſters, which we owe to all that offend, much more to our Relations, <hi>Rebuke them ſharply</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that they may be ſound in the Faith,</hi> Tit. 1. 13. and though it ſhould not be ſcalding hot, yet

it ſhould have ſome heat, though railing and reviling ſhould be laid aſide, yet Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency are neceſſary ingredients; 'tis true Chriſt bids us, <hi>not give holy things to Dogs, neither to caſt Pearls before Swine, leſt they turn again and rent us,</hi> Matth. 7. 6. yet Like I not their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who to ſave themſelves a labour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving make all Offenders to be Dogs and Swine, and never make a trial of them: ſhould you prove thus, I ſhould hereafter take Chriſts advice, 'tis a ſign of a gall'd Back that cannot endure rubbing, and of a gall'd Conſcience to kick againſt reproofs: 'tis a good obſervation of one, that <hi>Admonition and Reprehenſion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe, whether it come from a Friend, or a Foe, never doth a Wiſe man harm, if true, he knows what to amend, if falſe, of what to beware.</hi> To judge the Wound incurable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before it be ſearched, or before we have made an experiment, is but uncharitable dealing, I chooſe rather with the compaſſionate <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> to pour in Oyl and Wine. The uſual mode of flattery to skin over the ſore, is not ſafeſt, 'tis better if we ſearch it to the bottom, though it make it ſmart, but to leave apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing I ſhall addreſs my ſelf to you in theſe <hi>Ten</hi> following <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> and deſire in the Words of a Miniſter, of a Friend, and of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and as you will anſwer the contrary before the Great God, the ſcearcher of all Hearts, at your peril lay them to heart exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min their weight, and the evidence of Truth,

The <hi>Drunkards</hi> are Leperous perſons, no clean perſon ſhould aſſociate himſelf with them, they have a Plague-Sore upon them, and we may well fear the Infection. Man is an imitable Creature, and like the <hi>Camelion</hi> apt to change with the Company, and like Drink apt to ſmell of the Cask, and this Sin is as Infectious as the Plague it ſelf, and more dangerous; that only kils the the Body, this Soul and Body, their acts uſually increaſe the habits, and at laſt bring it to a Cuſtom, and Cuſtom is a ſecond Nature, and after a while that Sin which at firſt men ſtumble at, at laſt 'tis as eaſy as Water to run down the Chanel, 'tis a ſure ſigne of an ungracious Heart to delight in wicked Company, <hi>Noſcitur ex comite qui non dignoſcitur ex ſe.</hi> What <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks by way of caution concerning the Whoriſh Woman, may be applied here, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Remove thy way far from her, come not nigh to the door of her Houſe;</hi> this would be ſafe in

And is it any wonder if men learn worſe words in a worſe School? many men amongſt us have taken ſuch a curſed habit of Swearing and Curſing, that if the Law were duly executed, all their Eſtates would not pay their Mulcts; they deal with Chriſt as a Kennel of Hounds do with an Hare, pluck him to pieces, wound and tear him, what in them lies, limb meal, neither his Blood, nor his Wounds, nor his Head, nor his Heart, nor any other part ſhall eſcape, and they even dare Vengeance it ſelf, to puniſh them; like Mad-Dogs they bite and ſnatch at all, and would make all as mad as themſelves, and is this company to be deſired by a civil man, and in their quarrelling alſo and contentions, which is not unuſual upon the Ale-bench, they are like Fire-brands ready to kindle one another, not only Swearing and Railing but alſo fighting, Quarreling and Murder it ſelf is the effect of

and poverty, and ſhould you invent a way to ruin your ſelf, and family, you can ſcarcely pitch upon any ſurer and more certain way than this is: Scripture Reaſon and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience prove this ſo evidently and fully, that it cannot be denied, <hi>He that loveth pleaſure ſhail be a poor man, and he that loveth Wine and Oyl ſhall not be rich,</hi> Prov. 23. 20, 21. <hi>Be not amongſt Wine-bibbers, amongſt riotous eaters of fleſh, for the Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to poverty, and drowſineſs ſhall clothe a man with rags,</hi> and the experience of all ages, of all Nations, of all Cities, Towns, Countries, and Villages, are undeniable arguments to prove this, and ſave me a labour to ſpeak much of it, few but can evidence this truth by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: How many ancient Families in our times and in our Neighbourhood, have by <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> been everted and overthrown? nay, where do you ſee one that is much addicted to this vice, but there is a ſenſible decay in his Eſtate? perhaps there may be ſome that have large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues coming in, left them by their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, whoſe Eſtates are not quickly perceived to moulder away, but doubtleſs there is a Worm eating at the root of this <hi>Goard,</hi> that in time will make it wither; God will blow upon it, and a ſecret curſe of God will dry up this their <hi>Euphrates;</hi> many have turned Houſes, Livings, Lordſhips, down their throats, and many of the great ones that have Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands <hi>per annum,</hi> cannot keep both ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40444:16"/>
and no wonder when Gods Laws are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, that nothing they do proſpers: there are many men (as one ſaith) drink God out of their Hearts, Health out of their Bodies, Wit out of their Heads, and Money out of their Purſes, the Ale out of the Barrels, Wives and Children out of doors, the Land out of quiet, and Plenty out of the Nation, and when all is done they have nothing to ſhew for it but ſome Buttery door Buttons, a red firey meaſled pimpled Noſe and Face, a diſeaſed, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, gouty, deformed Body, and a Leprous Soul, and do procure ſuch an inſatiable thirſt that can never be ſatisfied, the more they drink the more they may, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that loves Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver;</hi> ſo he that loves Strong Drink will never think he hath enough, they drink not only the poors part, for which they ſhall be called e're long to a ſtrict account, they being Gods ſtewards, to give them their meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 45, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe gormundizing wretches devour alſo their Childrens Portion, even that which was left them by their Predeceſſors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to want and beggery, how many poor Children had been better if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen ſuch Parents?

which ſhould ſuſtain them, but theſe will prove bitterneſs in the latter end, and God will make them vomit up thoſe ſweet morſels they ſo greedily ſwallowed; ſee the Doom of ſuch Offenders, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 49, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many a poor Labourer that hath but from hand to mouth, and with his work can ſcarcely maintain his Children with Bread, yet is ſo addicted to this bewitching Vice, or ſo won upon by curſed company, that oft-times he ſpends in a day what ſhould maintain his Family a week, and ſo expoſe them either to Begging, Stealing, or Starving, and many ſpend that in youth, ſhould maintain them when they are old, ſell their Eſtates, ruin themſelves, and if the Pariſh make not proviſion, either Beg or Steal, and oft end their dayes in Priſon or on the Gallows. There are many that fear poverty more than Hell, and think that the greateſt argument againſt <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> which yet is to be feared, are like to have the one in earneſt of the other, for neither Poverty, nor Hell can make them leave this Beaſtly Sin; God will give ſuch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hand, and the Devil will pay them the reſt of their wages, and thoſe that keep ſuch men company get a blot to their own Souls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 17. <hi>Noah</hi> got nothing amongſt the luxurious old World, nor <hi>Lot,</hi> in intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat <hi>Sodom.</hi> The <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſpent his Subſtance with riotous living, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 13. and there are many Prodigals in our age, there are many that like <hi>Livius</hi> are their own Executors, and

the grief of your Friends, and the ſcorn of your Enemies, leave off theſe courſes betime, and break off your ſinful ſociety, which are the Cords of Vanity with which the Devil draws you on in his ſervice, and by Cuſtom they will be Cart-ropes to ty you faſter to him, and lead you after him to Hell it ſelf.</p>

a Drunken Magiſtrate? If the Devil can get ſuch into Office, he need not fear but his Work will be done: and as he is unfit for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, ſo for the Miniſtry, and much more unfit; If he be not a fit guide for the Body, much leſs for the Soul, they ſtray themſelves and therefore are unfit to be others guides. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 7. <hi>They have erred through Wine, and through Strong Drink are gone out of the way, the Prieſts and the Prophets have erred through Strong Drink, they are ſwallowed up of Wine.</hi> Hoſ. 4. 11. <hi>Whoredom, Wine, and new Wine take away the Heart.</hi> One Luſt calls upon another, as one Souldier doth upon another in Fighting, or as thoſe did, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Now therefore Moab to the ſpoil.

Nay, what calling is that man fit for in this condition? for in every calling there is ſome labour or ſome care, or ſome thing or other requiſit, which a Drunken man is unfit for. Now if the Devil can get ſuch as theſe in Office, eſpecially in the Magiſtracy or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, (and he will do it if his own wit, or his Inſtruments Intereſt can do it) what a deal of ſervice do they do him?

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40444:21"/>
thereunto belonging, it muſt be upon their Knees, and ſometimes attended with the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Glaſſes, burning of their Hats, Coats, or other Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What prodigious mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Helliſh folly is this? and to make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice compleat, it muſt be powdered or ſalted with horrid Blaſphemies, Damnings, and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, as if they had been in Hell to learn the the exact language of the Devil and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and tis to be feared, that many drink Healths of Damnation here, that they ſhall be pledging in Hell to all eternity: for God is more diſhonoured, the Creatures more abuſed, and devoured, the Devil more obeyed, ſerved, and adored by this, than almoſt any other Sin. Their Healths are oft-times made to great men, whom they adore, making Gods of them, and Beaſts of themſelves; and hence many times grow quarrels, ſtrifes, debates, fightings, ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, and death it ſelf: yea, I ſuppoſe there are more Drunken quarrels occaſioned by their Healths than by any other thing whatſoever, <hi>(Whores</hi> excepted:) ſometimes they chalenge the Field, ſometimes they give each other the lye, and the ſtab, and oft-times comes to blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; for when the Drink is in the Wit is out, and the greateſt friends in a moment prove the greateſt enemies, and thoſe that even now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the greateſt amity, ſuddenly ſhew the greateſt enmity, and ſheath their Swords in each others Bowels, as we read, <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Drink killed his dear friend <hi>Clit us,</hi> only for

diſallowing his profuſe Healths, and had he been ſuffered would afterwards have killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it was not long before he and thirty five more of his conſorts killed themſelves by immoderate Drinking at one time, and forty of his Companions at another. But we need not look far for Examples, our own Age, our own Nation, our own Neighbourhood yields us too many: how many of our Gallants, and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gentlemen, within a few years, and a few miles have caught their death by their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Drinking, and died of Surfeits: almoſt every Pariſh, Town, and Hamlet, may afford examples of ſome that have come to an untimely end this way, either in their Drink killing one another, and ſo come to the Gallows, or breaking their necks, drowning, burning, ſcalding, and ſome ſuch accident, or by Surfets, Feavors, Gouts, Dropſies, or ſome dangerous uncurable Diſeaſe gotten this way, which puts a period to their Lives, and Drinking: or that by this means run into Miſery, Danger, Debt, Poverty, and dye on a Dunghil, in a Barn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for want of ſuſtenance; or end their days in Priſon: theſe and ſuch like are the fruits and effects of this filthy Sin; this Sin is as one calls it, <hi>A flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devil, a ſweet Poiſon, the bane of virtue, the Mother of vice, voluntary madneſs, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of quarrels, contentions, ſtrife, and debate.</hi> The <hi>Drunkard</hi>'s heart is a fit receptacle for all Vice, for as Frogs live and thrive in a filthy lake, a ſtinking ditch where no Fiſh can abide,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40444:22"/>
ſo Vices are nouriſhed here, but no Virtue can live but is poiſoned. When the old World could not overcome <hi>Noah,</hi> this filthy Sin did; this ſets it ſelf againſt the Law of God, of Grace, of Nature, and of Nations, 'tis the grief of Friends, the ſcorn of Enemies, the ruin of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; it opens Hell, and ſhuts Heaven Gates againſt us. The Soul where this filthy Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous weed grows, is like that which was ſowed with Salt, it became baren to every thing that was good. The Graces of the Spirit of God cannot abide to dwell in ſuch a naſty Houſe, or to lodg with ſuch a filthy Bedfellow, for as Smoke drives away Bees, ſo Drunkenneſs drives away the Spirit of God, all holy deſires, and good reſolutions, and quencheth all holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is as water to the Fire, extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hopeful beginnings, 'tis like the <hi>Mare mortuum</hi> wherein no good Fiſh can live; and therefore if you would not be acceſſary to your own death, both of Body and Soul, if you will not run the hazard of a ſudden or violent, or untimely death, or fil your bodies with Surfets, Feavors, Gouts, Dropſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by intemperance; take heed in time of this filthy Sin for theſe are the natural Products of it, and God doth uſually witneſs againſt it by ſuch judgments as theſe.</p>

God commanded, If a Father had a Son that was a Glutton or a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> and upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and correction would not amend, the Father of that Son ſhould bring him out to the Elders of the City, and they ſhould ſtone him: Now if Magiſtrates are negligent of their Duty, and will not puniſh this Sin according to its, demerits and if the Eccleſiaſtical Courts take little notice of it, then God is forced to take the Sword in his own hand, and cut off the putrified member, and though he be ſlow, yet many times he ſtrikes home, nay he doth not ſpare his own people, yet he lets them blood as a Phyſician, not as an Executioner. As for the other, though he reſerves many till the general Aſſizes, to have their doom, yet ſome he hangs up in Chains, <hi>that others may hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly. Noah</hi> though a good man, and eſcaping the pollutions of the old World, was after tainted with this Sin; God ſuffered him to uncover his nakedneſs, and to be a laughingſtock to his own Son, who by this means entailed the curſe to him and his Poſterity, and the generation then to come had cauſe to bewail the act. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Lot,</hi> whoſe righteous Soul was vexed with the unclean converſation of the wicked <hi>Sodomites,</hi> fell through this Sin to that of Inceſt, for this ſeldom goes alone, and became the Father of the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> two curſed generations, haters of God and his People, which had he lived to ſee would have

been a further trouble to him. My intention is not in reciting theſe examples, to rank them amongſt <hi>Drunkards,</hi> or confer that odious name upon them; for 'tis not our bare ſimple act deſerves, or can faſten ſuch an imputation u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them; A godly man by the ſubtilty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's temptations, and the prevalency of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, or inadvertency, not knowing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Wine</hi> (as it may be imagined of <hi>Noah,</hi> if not of the other) may fall in the Sin, but there is difference between a Sheep falling in a foul way, which riſeth again, ſhakes himſelf, and takes better heed, and a Swine that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, willingly and delightfully wallows in the mire: A Godly man through imprudence, or want of heed may have a fall, and loſe ſome degrees of innocency which is great cauſe of ſhame and Sorrow, but thoſe that make it their Trade and daily practice, beſt deſerve the name. But Gods dealing with others is more ſevere, <hi>Elah</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> drinking himſelf Drunk in his Steward's Houſe, was killed by <hi>Zimri</hi> his own Servant, a ſad death, eſpecially at ſuch a time when he was moſt unfit to dye; the like had befallen <hi>Nabal</hi> in his Drunkenneſs, had not wiſe <hi>Abigail</hi> prevented it, and when he heard the danger he was in, his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a ſtone within him, and he died, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 36, <hi>&amp;c.

I have heard alſo of ſome ſtruck ſuddenly dead in the very act, ſome drowned, ſome ſcalded to death, ſome choaked with the Drink, ſome broke their necks, ſome lying in the way were ſlain by Carts, ſome in their Drink murthered their Parents, many that have caught ſurfets

There are many that have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough in other things, and yet know not the way to Heaven; they can ſearch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Garden from end to end, but cannot ſearch their own hearts: they are well skill'd abroad, ſtrangers at home.

They are skilled in all Courts but the Court of Conſcience, but let them have never ſo much knowledge, they are really fools, to ſell their ſouls to Satan for ſo low a value as a belly-full of Ale. They are worſe than <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ſold his birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage; or a King I have read of, that loſt his Kingdom for a Draught of Water.

The firſt Leſſon in Chriſts School is <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and if we deny not, forſake not Father, Mother, Wife, and Children, yea hate all and our own lives, we cannot be his Diſciple. Can thoſe men lay down their lives for Chriſt, that cannot deny their ſenſual Appetite? Was it ever known that a Debaucht Drunkard ever ſuffered for him? As Drink increaſeth their Thirſt, and the more they drink the more they may; ſo Drunkenneſs increaſeth Hell-fire like Oyl, which will never be quenched. <hi>The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life;</hi> Rom. 6. 23.

What now can you ſay for your ſelves, why this is not your portion? Do you think God is not juſt, will he ſpeak one thing and do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or is he not able to do as he ſaith; and that you ſhall go to Heaven notwithſtanding? See what God ſaith to ſuch, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, <hi>&amp;c. He that heareth the words of this Curſe, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the ſtubborneſs of my heart, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drunkenneſs to Thirſt, the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man; and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lite upon him; and God ſhall blot out his name from under heaven.</hi> However great Offenders in this life may eſcape temporal judgments, yet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judgments, which are far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſeize upon them; blindneſs of mind, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, ſearedneſs of conſcience, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe, ſtrong deluſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eternal judgments dog them at the heels; the Devil that now ſets them on work, takes notice of their work, that he may not be behind with them with their wages: but what this wages is, the tongue of men nor angels cannot fully deſcribe; for though the torments themſelves are exquiſite, yet the duration is an aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: though the pain of loſs be inexpreſſible, and the pain of ſenſe be inſupportable, yet Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is unimaginable; and though the pain of ſenſe be ten thouſand times beyond our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, yet the perpetuity of it will be the greateſt torment; and the word <hi>Never</hi> will
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40444:28"/>
be a Hell in the midſt of Hell. If the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard were to ſuffer but a thouſand years in Hell, for every Cup of Drink he hath drunk above meaſure (and this would be dear-bought plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) yet were there hopes an end would come: Ah! but what is this to Eternity? Oh Eternity, Eternity, how ſhall we conceive of thee, how ſhall we number thee? If this be the Drunkards portion, we may well ſay as the Holy Ghoſt doth, Woe to them. <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 50. <hi>If I be wicked woe to me.</hi> If the aking of the head, ſaith one, came before the Drinking of the Wine, which uſually follows it, there would be few Drunkards. But I think we may well ſay, If but one hour the pains of Hell were felt by them, it would make them ſober all their life. If now you would not loſe the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and be transformed into a Beaſt, if you would not bring upon your Body Deformities without, and Infirmities within, if you would not bring reproaches upon your ſelf, and bury your good name in obloquy, if you would not debauch your ſoul and incline it to all manner of wickedneſs; if you would be preſerved from that filthy ſin of Adultery, to which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines you; if you would not waſte your Eſtate, ruin your Family, undo your Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bring them to beggery; if you would not unfit your ſelf for any calling and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any Duty to God or Man; if you would not by intemperance haſten your own death, and ſet a period to your life; if you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40444:28"/>
would not bring the horrible judgments of God upon you, and force him to cut you off in the midſt of your days; and if you would not loſe your Soul, and ſuffer the vengeance of Eternal Fire; take heed of this filthy, beaſtly ſin of Drunkenneſs, which carries all thoſe evils and many more in the belly of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what Charge I have drawn up againſt this ſin of Drunkenneſs, and much more may be ſaid; for 'tis a fearful Mother, and moſt ſins are bred in the Womb of it, or fed or foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; for in ſin almoſt nothing can be named but Drunkenneſs doth patronize it, and excites men to the practice of it: I do not hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or mean that all that are addicted to it, are guilty of all other villany; ſome perhaps never blaſphemed or murthered, yet this in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is the cauſe of blaſphemy and murther; neither do I mean that all that ever were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with Drink, that they are thus to be tearmed: A Godly Man may have his ſlips, though this is rare; but there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Sheep and a Swine, as I ſaid; the one falls into the Mire unwillingly, the other wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in it; ſo here ſome are ſurprized unawares as 'tis conceived <hi>Noah</hi> was. Theſe by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance waſh away their ſpot, and others ſeek occaſions, and are not well till they find them. And now though I have done with Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the general, yet have I not done with you in particular, for I conceive your ſin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of many aggravations, which ſome other

mens ſins do not; and that is worſe in you then in them: ſome of thoſe I ſhall draw up againſt you, that if poſſible I may ſhame you out of it; for though this ſin by ſome is compared to Hell; few fall into it that recover; and by ſome to the Gout incurable; yet I having known ſome have recovered, I am not out of hope.

Conſider your Education, which was Civil, nay, not only Civil but Religious, you are extracted from thoſe that were Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient profeſſors, trained up in Family Duties, Prayer and Praiſe; the Word of God was read in the Family, and many a prayer put up with you and for you, you were dedicated to God in your Baptiſmal Vow, which ſince you owned and were liſted into his company; and ſhall all this be loſt upon you: it had been better then for you that you had had <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> for your Parents. Many an Exhortation and loving Admonition you have had; the danger of ſinful courſes you have been told; you have had examples and preſidents of a Holy Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and ſome of the contrary, and you have ſeen the difference: The Family you live in, hath been a Houſe of Prayer; and will you now make it a Cage of unclean Birds? You have been warn'd of the Devils Temptations, and the Worlds Allurements; you have ſeen the difference between thoſe that have reſiſted them, and thoſe that yielded to them. Conſider in whether of their caſes you would rather be

when death calls you; and whether a day ſpen in Prayer, or a day ſpent in an Ale-houſe, wil then bring moſt comfort; you have lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the powerful means of Grace all your days, and heard thouſands of Sermons, beſides other Ordinances, and are all thoſe loſt: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum; It ſhall be more tollerable for</hi> Tire <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>or</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgment, than for them.</hi> A fruitleſs Tree in the Vineyard, is more in danger than if it grew in the Deſert: Others may ſay I never knew the danger of ſuch a courſe, my Parents rather incouraged me then otherwiſe; but what can you ſay, or what excuſe can you make.</p>

Oh let it not be to tell the World how far a Hipocrite may go and fall ſhort of Heaven; and let them know, whatever you ſaid you meant nothing leſs: With what face can you ever call God Father, or ever beg for mercy at his hands, thus to uſe him; or beg power againſt ſin, when you mind nothing leſs than a Reformation. Are you inded willing to loſe all the pains that ere you have taken in Heavens way, now you have born the burthen and heat of the day, and for ought you know, the time of your receiving reward is at hand. Many a day and many an hour you have ſpent in Prayer, Humiliation, Hearing, Reading, Chriſtian Conference, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and ſuch like Duties; and will you now out-run and loſe them all: Shall all your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be loſt, as fooliſh Boys loſe their Arrows, ſhoot them, and then mind them no more: <hi>If a Righteous Man turn from his Righteouſneſs, he ſhall die in his ſin;</hi> Ezek. 3. 20. <hi>all his Righteouſneſs, ſhall not be remembred.</hi> Is the way of Holineſs too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, or will heaven be had upon eaſier terms; or were the Godly from the beginning of the world all deceived, which took Holineſs to be the only way to Happineſs; and is there a nearer

If Religion be not good, why did you profeſs it; if it be, why do you not practice it? Or doth Religion teach you ſuch courſes? I know ſome will be apt to charge Religion with it from your practice; and ſay, ſee what your profeſſors are, they will be drunk as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 12. <hi>That the grace of God, that bringeth Salvation, teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Have you found out a better maſter, better work, and better wages, 'tis well; but praiſe in the parting. The world hates you becauſe of your profeſſion, and will you make God hate you for your Hypocriſie? Would you reconcile God and the World, it will never be; or would you have your good things both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? You will find the miſtake, you muſt renounce the one or the other; Heaven will

This courſe of life in you, that have been a profeſſor of Religion, is exceeding injurious both to God and man; if you never had pretended better, none would have expected better at your hands: but to be wounded in the houſe of our friend, to have one with whom <hi>we took ſweet counſel together, and walked to the houſe of God in company;</hi> he lift up the heel againſt us: this would trouble a <hi>David</hi> himſelf. The former hopes you gave us, the noiſe you made in the world of more than ordinary ſanctity, is an aggravation to your crime: the higher men clime, the greater will be their fall. How doth this make ſad the hearts of thoſe that the Lord would not make ſad, and ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked. <hi>If</hi> Iſrael <hi>play the harlot,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>yet let not Judah offend; you did run well, who hindred you,</hi> you began well and you end ill; <hi>you began in the ſpirit, and will you end in the fleſh:</hi> What a blow will this be to Religion, when the chief prop in ſuch a family ſhall not only break, but like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed, run into our hands. What a diſcouragement is it to an Army, when a chief champion not only turns his back, but revolts to the enemy? What a diſhonour is this to God, to leave his ſervice and ſerve his greateſt enemy. How will the enemy in ſult, Lo (ſaith they) you ſee what a maſter they ſerve, for all their brags, they are ſoon weary of his ſervice. <hi>Davids</hi> ſin cauſed Gods enemies to blaſpheme, and for that cauſe God told him
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40444:32"/>
                     <hi>The Sword ſhould never depart from his houſe.</hi> How doth this ſadden the hearts of the godly, and fill their faces with ſhame? How is Religion loaded with aſperſions, as if there were no real difference between the godly and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Theſe, ſay they are your profeſſors, they'll take their cups as well as others. Poor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians are diſcouraged, and think they ſhall never hold out, when ſuch Cedars are ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and ſuch Champions foiled. Others are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in their ſin, and are apt to ſay, let them have their fling, they will come bank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to us ere long. What account will you give of this to God at laſt, what iniquity have you found in him, that you are departed from him? Is there any thing in religion that cauſeth you to forſake it, or hath God ever given you any cauſe? Teſtifie againſt him, hath <hi>he been a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wilderneſs to you?</hi> Is there more real worth in your pot companions, which have wrought your ruine if God prevent not, both of Body and Soul; than is in the communion of Saints? and had you rather be hearing ſwearing, curſing, and blaſpheming than prayers, or praiſes unto God? Conſider the Blood of your own Soul, and the Soul of your Children and Servants, that are like to be undone by your example; and of many others that are either hardned in their ſins, or diſcouraged in their duties, will be laid at your door: Conſider the price of this Blood, before you are too laviſh of it; one Soul is worth a world, and do not ſell it for pots of Ale.</p>

The many Covenants, Promiſes, Vows, and Ingagements, which you have made to God for better Obedience, and the many Promiſes and Ingagements which you have made to Miniſters and other Chriſtians, and which you have ſo often broke, are no ſmall Aggravation to your ſin; ſo that you cannot commit this ſin at ſo cheap a rate as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may: <hi>'Tis better not to vow, then to vow and not preform.</hi> In your Baptiſmal Vow, which you have ſince owned and ratified, you were dedicated up to God, and devoted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and 'tis ſacriledge to divert things dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated up to God to profane uſes: You then received Preſs-money, and liſted your ſelf into Chriſts Company, and promiſed to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Banner; and that his Enemies ſhould be your Enemies, and you would maintain War while you lived againſt ſin, the World, and the Devil; and he promiſed, you ſo doing, you ſhould have what ever was neceſſary here, and Heaven it ſelf for a reward; and to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant you have often ſet your other Seal in the Sacrament, and will you after all theſe Vows and Covenants to God, and Promiſes to Men, treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly and perfidiouſly revolt, change ſides, and joyn with the Devil, Gods ſworn enemy; and that to fight againſt him, his cauſe and people, and the power of godlineſs, which you did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.

prodigal Son, and his prodigality was his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as may eaſily appear by his rejoycing at his return: yea, Chriſt tells us there is joy in the preſence of the Angels, when a ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth; and if there could be ſorrow in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſure it would be at their revolting back: the reſiſting the motions of Gods Spirit, is called a grieving of, or a quenching of it; and if each Saint have his Guardian Angel, as ſome imagine, and it may ſeem probable; for they are guarded by the Angels: we may imagine they rejoyce when we do well, and as far as they are capable, are troubled at our falls and ſlips: and what ſorrow and ſadneſs, alſo muſt this be to your relations, put your ſelf into their condition; how ſad would it be to you, to have a Child, the only hope of the Family, to ruin himſelf and his poſterity; to have a young fellow take ſuch extravagant courſes, to have a Brother or a Siſter thus debaucht; what grief is it to a Godly Miniſter, <hi>that travelled in Birth till he thought Christ had been formed in you,</hi> and then ſuddenly ſee all his hopes daſht, all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, admonitions, reproofs, prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> loſt upon you; how may it trouble and ſhame him that ever you were of his ſociety: your Chriſtian Friends, and thoſe of your ſociety, how may it trouble them, that you are gone from them, and with <hi>Demas</hi> have choſen the World before Chriſt; to think what will become of you, and of your Family, and of your poor Soul, when death ſhall ſeperate it from your

In this courſe of life you lead, the loſs of your precious time which is given you for an higher end, is no ſmall aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your fall; for though you meet with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderable loſſes by this extravagant courſe of yours, yet no temporal loſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this: this cannot be redeemed with Silver nor Gold, Jems, nor Jewels; nay if the World were ſold to its worth, it could not call back one day that is paſt; and yet alaſs how prodigal are many of their time, as if they knew not how to waſte it faſt enough; they

drink and play and rail it away; nay go pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to drive away time: that did they but know the value of it, would prize it at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate; but the time is coming you will know the worth of it by the want of it. God hath placed you in his Vineyard, given you work to do, and ſufficient time to do it in; if you idle away this time, and your work be undone, what wages do you expect: Amongſt other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he hath given you this Talent of time; if either you not uſe it or abuſe it, what can you expect but the doom of the unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that hid his Talent in the Earth. You have a little time in the World to ſpend, and 'tis but a little; and one of theſe days they will ſay of you, He is dead alſo; for you ſee younger and ſtronger are gone before you, and your turn may be next; how as you ſpend this time, ſo it will fare with you to eternity. This is the Harveſt of the Soul, if you lay not in proviſion for the Winter with the <hi>Bee,</hi> you are like to want with the <hi>Graſshopper:</hi> this is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket day to lay in proviſion for the following week, and to buy Oyl; if this ſeaſon be let ſlip, the door will be ſhut againſt you, and we know not how ſoon this day may be over, which will never dawn again: you have a great deal of work to do, and work of great concernment; if it be not finiſhed in the time, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; you are in a race, and your Soul is the prize you run for; and will you either ſtand ſtill or run back: you are in the field fighting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40444:35"/>
with cruel blood-thirſty enemies, who will make no truce with you but upon more unreaſonable terms than <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the <hi>Ammonite</hi> offered to the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi> Which was <hi>to thruſt out all their right eyes, and lay it as a reproach on all Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. But the Devil will make no truce, but the everlaſting deſtruction of Soul and Body: And will you caſt by your Armour, and yield to his mercy; and revolt from him that will warrant you the Victory, if you will but keep the field: you are in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on life and death, and will you now turn back, or run after Butterflies, when the Sun grows low and you have far to go; when you muſt be ſure to tread theſe weary ſteps back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or loſe your life: Much of your time is already ſpent, and your work undone, and what you have done you are again plucking down, and making your work every day more and harder. Conſider you will repent or not repent, If you do not repent you are undone; for no unrepenting ſinner ſhall come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if you do repent it will coſt you more pains, dolour, trouble and grief, than ever the pleaſure of your ſin was worth; you muſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit up all thoſe ſweet morſels which you have ſwallowed with ſo much delight. Eternity lies before you, and one of theſe days Death will open the door and let you in. What appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions then will you have of theſe courſes, when you ſee an infinite Ocean of eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and all your friends and pleaſures

laviſhly ſpend, neither in your general nor particular calling, muſt be accounted for; and what the price will be God only knows: and at death, whether do you think the time ſpent in Humilation, Prayer, Hearing, Reading, Meditating, Chriſtian Conference; Exhorting the Careleſs, inſtructing the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, comforting the Dejected, viſiting the Sick, relieving the Poor; and generally in Acts of Piety and Charity; will bring moſt comfort: or the time ſpent in Drinking and Drabbing, in Hawking, Hunting, Carding, Diceing, Cocking, Playing, or ſuch like Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience when 'tis often check'd and ſnub'd, at laſt leaves checking; and the Devil ſears it with his hot iron, that it becomes unſenſible; but at laſt it will ſpeak, and will not hold its peace: the Devil at laſt makes a path-way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the heart, and ſo all the ſeed is loſt that falls upon this High-way ground; and men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sermon proof, and Ordinance proof: they can ſit ſtill and have Hell-fire flaſht in their faces, and not regard it. What God ſpeaks of the <hi>Leviathan, Job</hi> 4. 24 is true of them, in another ſenſe; <hi>Their heart is as firm as a ſtone, yea as hard as a piece of the neather millſtone.</hi> The Acts of ſin increaſe the habit, and at laſt it becomes as natural to them to ſin as to live; and they draw in iniquity as they draw in their breath: they commit ſin as eaſily

as water runs down the Channel. Cuſtom breeds a ſecond nature, of ſuch doth God ſpeak, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots; then may ye alſo do good, which are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Some vainly promiſe themſelves repentance hereafter, but their deceitful heart puts a cheat upon them; there is not one of many that ſend repentance thus before them, that ever overtake it. Thoſe that have long accuſtomed themſelves to ſin, and thoſe that have long enjoyed the means of grace, and are grown Sermon proof; and thoſe that have made Profeſſion of Religion, and faln back, 'tis a rare thing to ſee them prove true Converts.

See how he likes of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12, 13. <hi>In that day did the Lord call for weeping and for mourning, and to baldneſs and girding with ſackcloth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen and killing ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it was revealed in my ear by the Lord of hoſts, ſurely this iniquity ſhall not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from you till you die.</hi> God alſo threatens thoſe, <hi>That they ſhall go captives with the firſt that go, that drink wine in Bowles and annoint themſelves with chief ointment, and forget the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6, 7. And the blood of thoſe which have periſhed for want of thoſe creatures which you have wilfully waſted, God will lay at your door. In a word, conſider your pious Education, your former holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the Convictions upon your ſpirit; knowing and acknowledging your courſes bad:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40444:39"/>
The profeſſion of Religion you have made, the incouragements which you gave, the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hearts of the Godly, the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hands of the wicked, the vows and covenants you have made to God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to men; the grief you bring your friends and relations, the hardning of your heart by cuſtom, the diſabling your ſelf to do good to ſoul or body; and the wilful waſteing of the creatures in this time of need; will all riſe up in judgment againſt you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But it may be you will object and ſay, You do not drink to Drunkenneſs, you can carry it away well enough; you ſtagger not over it, neither do you vomit as others do: And though I fear this excuſe cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be pleaded, yet if it were taken for granted, 'tis but a Fig-leaf to cover your nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and will prove too thin and ſhort. A Man may drink to exceſs that can carry it away as you ſay. We read of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> whom God himſelf tells us was drinking himſelf drunk with the thirty two Kings that were with him; and yet could give directions to his Souldiers: yea, eſcaped away on Horſe-back with his Army. The trial of Drunkenneſs which we have amongſt many, is not the ſame with Gods: many think that Man is not drunk that can crawl out of the Carts way, or riſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Fire, or hit Fingers with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they are not competent Judges in that caſe, that are themſelves ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40444:40"/>
'Tis not only Drunkenneſs that trips up a Mans heels, that he cannot go nor ſtand, but when a Man over-affects Drink, or ſpends too much time, or too much money; or waſtes the good creatures needleſly; that drinks too much for his purſe, or too much for his health, or too much for his reaſon: For a Man hath no more reaſon to drown his time, to drown his eſtate, or his credit, than he hath to drown his wit; for all theſe are Talents for which he muſt be accountable. But ſuppoſe you are ſtronger than others, and can drink more; is this therefore a Warrant ſo to do; ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God ſeals it or no: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of ſtrength to mingle Strong Drink.</hi> Muſt God be diſhonoured, the Creature abuſed, becauſe thou haſt a ſtronger brain; 'tis pity mercies ſhould be ſo abuſed: but beſides this guilt, are you not in the mean time guilty of the Drunkenneſs of others; have you not forced them to it, that you may laugh at their folly? See then what the Lord ſaith to you; <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 15, 16. <hi>Wo unto him that giveth his neighbour Drink, that putteſt thy Bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo; that thou mayſt look on their nakedneſs: Thou art filled with ſhame for glory: drink thou alſo, and let thy fore-skin be uncovered: the cup of the Lords right hand ſhall be turned unto thee, and ſhameful ſpewing ſhall be on thy glory.</hi> Now if you glory in your ſtrength to drink, and this too common; conſider this Text, and ſee what will be the iſſue: The Cup of Gods Indignation will be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40444:40"/>
ſuch as you cannot bear; thy own ſins are great enough, you need not other mens.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Perhaps you will ſay, We have the Examples of many, yea, many great Men, and many learned Men, and of ſome good Men alſo, for our imitations: Yea, this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is Epidemical and grown common, both in Court and Country; and when a faſhion is become National, 'tis no diſcredit to wear it; and 'tis true, the more is the pitty: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of great ones are very prevalent, and if bad infectious; theſe are Stars of the firſt Magnitude; and like the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> carry all before them: and they have oft times a hand in the tranſgreſſion, and leave an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious air, that few can eſcape that comes near them. What a ſad Example did <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> and <hi>thirty two Kings</hi> that were with him give to their followers, when they were all drunk: but will this excuſe ſerve our turns before God; did it excuſe poor Men before the Flood, that great ones did thus or thus; or in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that the Rulers were in the tranſgreſſion? Should they command ſin, they are are not to be obeyed; becauſe 'tis forbidden by a greater Authority: how much leſs when we are left at liberty. Great Men are not always good Men, neither is their example always imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Not many Wiſe Men after the Fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> The greateſt number commonly are the worſt, and the greateſt men not always the

The way to Hell is moſt trodden, and moſt mens cuſtom is to walk in it; but wo to that man that follows that faſhion: <hi>We must not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> We are the ſinful off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like him we frame excuſes, and ſeek to lay the fault upon another: I was forc'd, I could not help it; I muſt pledg the Health: But had we known there had been Poyſon in the Cup, we would have helpt it. <hi>Harpaste,</hi> a Woman in <hi>Seneca,</hi> being in the night ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck blind; ſhe blames the darkneſs of the Houſe, the Sun for not riſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but would not acknowledge her own Deficiency. Thus 'tis with us, any ſhall be faulted ſo we be free; like the man that had a Thorn in his foot, yet imputed his halting to the roughneſs of the way; no man can live in ſuch an age, but he muſt do as others do; but no man ſhould break Gods Command to pleaſe any Mans humour.</p>
                  <p>That the ſin is grown National, 'tis ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40444:41"/>
much the ſadder, and preſages a National judgment; as <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſins and the ſins of the Old World did; and <hi>Iſraels</hi> before the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: When it hid it ſelf in corners there was hopes, but when it dares the Magiſtrate, and ſends a Challenge to God himſelf; the Ulcer is deſperate, and the Member more fit to be cut off than cheriſhed: When rotten Fruits hangs out in the ſight of the Sun, and <hi>Men declare their ſin as</hi> Sodom <hi>and hide it not;</hi> what can we expect but <hi>Sodoms</hi> Plagues: But bleſſed be God there is no force upon us, Men may be ſober if they will, and many are; yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble and Learned: why do you not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their examples which is worth imitating. I know vicious great Men, are like Load-ſtones that draw Iron; that if a Chain of Iron be near, the Loadſtone draws the firſt Link, then the ſecond, till the whole Chain comes; ſo the Devil puts ſuch an influence in men, that one draws his neighbour and he a third, till moſt are corrupted: or rather they are like to Jet that draws Straws, or light refuſe; but no ſolid thing: They are like to Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when one corn is fired it fires the next, and that another, till all be in a flame. The Devil is like a cunning Angler, he holds out the Bait, but hides himſelf behind the Buſh: many are faſtened with the Bait before they ſee the hand that holds it. The Devil doth not thruſt a Man into an Ale-houſe by the Head and Shoulders, this might terrifie him; but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40444:42"/>
he ſets Good-fellows at the Ale Houſe door to call him: And then he apprehends no danger. And for the falls of the godly as they are rare, ſo they are not recorded for our imitation but caution; they ſhew not what we ſhould do, but what we ſhould beware: they are as Sea-marks, ſet up to warn others; and what mad <hi>Pilot</hi> will ruſh upon ſuch places, where he knows other Ships have there been ſplit. The beſt men are not always to be imitated; we muſt follow <hi>Paul</hi> as he follows after Chriſt; to the Word and to the Teſtimony: This is a ſure guid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But I muſt do as others do, or I ſhall be mockt, ſcorned, and had in deriſion; ſhould I refuſe their healths, what would they think of me? <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is an unſafe Rule to follow: Some break their Necks, hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; muſt we needs follow them for fear of a ſcorn; ſome turn Thieves, Hackers; and come to the Gallows; and muſt we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them alſo. If you do as others do, you muſt fare as others fare, and receive your wages together: If you follow the greateſt company, it will be in the worſt way; for moſt miſcarry and go to Hell. Chriſt tells us broad is the way that leads to Deſtruction, and many men go that way. Who is it that will mock you for keeping the Commands of God? Not one that loves God, Ior oves your Soul, or that carries the face of an honeſt Man; and thoſe that have neither good word
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40444:42"/>
for God, or for any good Man, for the Word of God, or the Image of God; what matter is it if they have none for you: Thoſe that hate God and Godlineſs, and every thing that looks like God; that love none but thoſe that will damn their own Souls with them for company; what is their love worth? Will you venture for their love to have Gods hatred, and to go to Hell to bear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Were a Malefactor going to Execution; and laught at you that you would not bear him company; would this move you ſo to do? By this rule indeed <hi>Daniel</hi> might have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the Lions Den; and the three Children the Fiery Furnace; but not the wrath of God. Probably God was mockt in the Old World, and <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom;</hi> but they could not mock them out of their innocency: 'Tis better have the Devil mock them, than God mock them; <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. Take heed of being mockt out of Heaven, leſt when you come to Hell you be laught at for your labour. The ſeed of the Serpent will alwayes oppoſe the ſeed of the Woman; and faithful <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall meet with a ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> Gods <hi>Ark</hi> and the Devils <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot ſtand together: Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial cannot accord: the world will love her own, and cannot abide that Chriſt ſhould pluck one feather from her wing. If you are content to take up with the World, and the World ſhall pay you your portion, then 'tis not beſt to croſs the World; if not 'tis
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40444:43"/>
impoſſible to pleaſe it: God willl not allow us to do the Devils drudgery for fear of a ſcorn from his ſervants. Chriſt gave no diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to break his Laws rather than be ſcorn'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But though I do follow theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for a while, yet I intend hereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and to reform. Why may not I do as the Penitent Thief did? And you may (ſaith one) as rationally conclude that the Sun ſhall ſtand ſtill at your command, becauſe it did ſo at the Command of <hi>Joſuah;</hi> or that the Sea ſhould divide to let you paſs, becauſe it did ſo for <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Or that you may ſpur your Aſs and make him ſpeak, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did: Or that you may take a journey and leave your money behind, in hope to find a purſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in your way, as ſome others have done. Were not theſe think you mad concluſions, and truly this is as reaſonleſs. One man in five thouſand years was ſaved by late repentance, therefore I ſhall be a ſecond, when five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in one year miſcarry upon the like account. God doth ſeldom work ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, where the means of grace is afforded; perhaps it was the firſt Sermon that ever this Thief heard, but you have heard thouſands: There are indeed many, that like you, ſend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and religion before them to ſixty; but ſuch men ſeldom ever overtake it. Do you really think that God will take up with the blind and the lame, will he give us leave to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the prime and marrow of our time to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40444:43"/>
the Devil, and give him the dregs and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe? Will he ſuffer you to do the Devils work all day, and receive his wages at night? No, no, moſt men deal by God, as bad Debtors do by their Creditors, beg more time, and put it off from one week to another, and then break and never pay? So they break their time with God, but never come to make good their promiſes. More Objections might be anſwered, but there is none that can ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a rational unprejudiced man: and I have already far exceeded my intended limits, I ſhall therefore draw towards a concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I performed a Chriſtian, though perhaps an unwelcome duty, in putting you in remembrance of what you knew before; if you would not loſe all your pains for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all the duties that ever you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and have them all thrown back into your face as dung: If you would not loſe Gods Favour, the benefit of Chriſts Merits, your own Soul, Heaven, and Happineſs, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider from whence you are fallen and return and do your firſt works:</hi> If you have found out any nearer, eaſier way to Heaven than ever any yet could do; demonſtrate it, and convince us of it; but before you venture your Soul upon it, be ſure it ends there: the attempt of any ſuch experiments will prove vain; for if there be any but the path of Holineſs that ends in Happineſs, then call me a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; or if there be any other way into Gods
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40444:44"/>
Holy Hill, than by a pure Heart and clean Hands, then am I content to be called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; but if I be deceived God himſelf hath deceived me, who tells me, <hi>Without Holineſs no one ſhall ſee God; without Faith no one can pleaſe God; without repentance we ſhall all periſh; that no unrighteous perſon ſhall enjoy Heaven,</hi> and no unregenerate man ſhall ever enter there; <hi>that thoſe that live after the fleſh ſhall die; that the ungodly ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into Life eternal:</hi> Thoſe that think otherwiſe will find that God ſpeaks in earneſt what they took in jeſt. The time is comming, that you will find it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you that you had <hi>never known the way of life, then having known it to depart from it.</hi> If you give up the Reins to corruption, it will miſlead you, and prove a treacherous guid; if you decline the way of ſelf-denial, you will miſs of Heaven; for none ever come there any other way Looſe licenciouſneſs and carnal liberty, is diametrically oppoſite to it; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company if you forſake them not, will be your bane; and if repentance prevent it not, you will curſe the time that ever you ſaw each others face. What ever Society or Party a man be, what ever Religion or Opinion, though in the moſt Reformed Church, and in the Society of the ſtricteſt Chriſtians; yet without the power of Godlineſs, and the practice of Holineſs, he ſhall never go to Heaven; <hi>for no unclean thing ſhall ever enter</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40444:44"/>
                     <hi>there:</hi> no dirty Dog ſhall tread upon that pavement. Or what ever his Profeſſion, or ſeeming Holineſs hath been, yet if he back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide, he ſhall die in his ſins, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall not be remembred: <hi>The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways;</hi> Prov. 13. 20. <hi>He that puts his hand to the plow and looks back, he is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven; if any draw back, Gods Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I made bold, perhaps you may think too bold, to tell you my thoughts of your preſent condition; perhaps you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it becauſe 'tis not in the Language of your flatterers; but to skin over a ſore is not the way to cure it; <hi>The rebukes of a friend are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the kiſſes of an enemy.
