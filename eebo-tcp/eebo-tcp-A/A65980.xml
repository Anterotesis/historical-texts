         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ADVERTISEMENT,
To all the faithful followers of the Lamb in Lancaſhire, in
and about Mancheſter, Warrington and Lancaſter; And to
all in every place that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
to whoſe view the following Diſcourſe may come.</head>
            <p>AS it was my deſire and diſpoſition (during the time of my
impriſonment amongſt the people called <hi>Quakers</hi>) to live
peaceably, and to avoid conteſts with them; So when I
was forced (for truths ſake) to a debate with them, and
afterwards to give forth a relation thereof, together with
an account of the light within man, there was not the leaſt intention, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
in me to commit my papers to the Preſs, until many friends
(having peruſed them) did (as appears by the firſt letters prefixed to the
following diſcourſe) with many arguments urge me to make them more
publick; Which thereupon I reſolved ſpeedily to do, and to that end did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
and tranſcribe them, with ſome enlargement, as they are hereafter
in this book preſented.</p>
            <p>Afterwards it being ſuggeſted by ſome, that it was not a ſeaſon to print
againſt this people, being great ſufferers, leſt it ſhould adde affliction to
their bonds; I did thereupon lay aſide my papers for divers months; And
was the more eaſily inclined thereto, not ſimply becauſe they are ſufferers,
But, 1. For that they (which is much more the duty of others who owne
the truth as it is in Jeſus, and that worſhip which is preſcribed by himſelf)
do ſtand faſt in the defence of their liberty, publickly owning that worſhip
which they judge (though erroneouſly) agreeable to truth, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any humane Law to the contrary: And, 2. That in reſpect of the
powers impoſing upon them without warrant from the Lord, (though in
reſpect of the wrong they do to the man Chriſt Jeſus, to his Goſpel, and
to their own ſouls, they be far from innocencie) they ſuffer as Innocents,
as (if thus underſtood) they do often truly call themſelves. And hence it
is, that (in greateſt probability) the Laws made againſt them, and their
proſecutors, have not hitherto had, nor will hereafter have any better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
then the perſecutors of the Innocent in all ages have had, whoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:47209:3"/>
was never bleſt to convert any from the errour of his way, but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been an effectual means as to confirm and ſtrengthen the perſecuted in
his way, (yea, though a miſtaken and erroneous way, as is evident in this
people at this day) ſo to bring ſwift and inevitable deſtruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, being again called upon, and deſired by divers to
go on with this work, I had theſe following Conſiderations encouraging
thereto.</p>
            <p>1. Many judicious and ſober perſons, who judge the work may be for
common benefit, do call for its publication.</p>
            <p>2. The diſcourſe is not level'd againſt their perſons, nor againſt any
appearance that is commendable in them, but onely againſt their Errors
and miſcarriages; Nor are thoſe in power ſtir'd up againſt them; but on
the contrarie, their violence is witneſſed againſt.</p>
            <p>3. An endeavour to recover ſome out of the ſnare of the devil, and to
prevent the apoſtacy of others (which are aymed at in this undertaking)
is ſuch an abſolute duty, as may not be ſuſpended, out of fear that ſome
who have the ſword in their hand ſhould take advantage thereby to abuſe
their power.</p>
            <p>4. By how much this people are carried out to ſuffer above many others,
and by this fair ſhew in the fleſh are apt to glory in their way, as the only
way to life, and that many (unable or negligent in the tryal of ſpirits and
principles) are liable to be ſnared and taken by them; by ſo much it ſeems
more neceſſarie, at this time, to diſcover the ſandie foundation upon which
their whole building ſtands, and how pernitious it will prove to their ſouls
who build thereon, that Sathans deep deſigne in drawing men thereto
being unveiled poor weak and unſtable ſouls may better diſcerne that their
glorying in their ſufferings, yea in giving their bodies to be burned upon
the account of ſuch a foundation, is vain.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, and eſpecially, in as much as the principle contended againſt,
doth not only deny the man Chriſt Jeſus, and make void his ſufferings,
death, and blood, with their effects, but that Satan hereby would dethrone
him, and by this moſt ſubtil way of changing himſelf into an Angel of light,
would get into the Temple of God, and ſhew himſelf as God, that he may
be worſhipped as God; I account it my dutie (what ever the effect may be)
to be found faithfull to my dear Head the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in diſcovering
(according to the meaſure of light received from him) this ſecret and laſt
deſigne of his and his peoples grand adverſarie; to the end that he may
(through the bleſſing of the bleſſed and only Potentate upon theſe weak
endeavours) receive ſuch a blow, that neither he nor his miniſters who be
transformed as the miniſters of righteouſneſs, may proceed any further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47209:3"/>
Thus, dear friends, you have an account of the principal motives which
(after ſome delay) have prevailed with me to preſent theſe Papers to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
view. It's probable the old enemy, whoſe ſtrong-hold is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
will rage yet more againſt me, and be active in the ſpirits of ſome
to follow me with ſuch language as you may read in the Appendix; but I
matter not the judgement of mans day; the Lord who ſearcheth the heart
knows, that the honour of his Name, and the undeceiving and ſaving of
precious ſouls, is more to me then a name among men, yea then my own
life. But I beſeech you, let no prejudice nor reproaches caſt upon me, or this
Work, hinder you from a ſerious peruſal of it. It's likely many of you
may be as ſheep ſcattered without a ſhepherd; and your adverſary, who
goes about like a roaring lion, will ſeek all advantages againſt you; and
his miniſters will be (in this dark hour of temptation) the more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to make merchandiſe of your ſouls. Oh Remember the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>Look to your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Believe not every ſpirit,
but try the ſpirits whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are gone out into the world.</hi> And among all the deceivers that
Chriſt foretold ſhould come, there are none more ſubtil, nor lead into more
pernitious wayes, then the leaders and teachers of this people, with whom
I have to do. O conſider what need you have to be alwaies upon your
watch; take heed, whom and what you hear; and in a ſpecial manner be
careful that you bottom upon a right foundation, Jeſus Chriſt, God and
man in union, who in his own perſon without us, hath wrought a great
ſalvation; having finiſhed tranſgreſſion, made an end of ſin, aboliſhed
condemnation and death for us. And if any man, or an Angel from
Heaven, ſhould not bring this doctrine, and point you unto a crucified and
glorified Jeſus for acceſs to God; receive him not into your houſe, neither
bid him God ſpeed. Neither let it ſuffice you, thus to behold redemption
wrought for you in the perſon of the Mediatour without you, but minde his
comming down in ſpirit into your hearts to manifeſt this redemption, and
to live and work in you as a quickening ſpirit; and let it be your care, as to
live, ſo to walk in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And the Lord grant that you being rooted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uilt up in him, and
ſtabliſhed in the faith, may henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and
fro, and carried about with every winde of doctrine, by the ſlight of
men, and cunning craftineſs whereby they lie in weight to deceive; but
may keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life: ſo prayes</p>

               <p>WE received yours with the incloſed Manuſcript, containing
a relation of a Debate you had with the Quakers, An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Light within,</hi> and An Appendix: all which
we have as we could peruſed, but yet not ſo as we intend and deſire;
onely did haſtily run it over, being willing as many as could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
might ſee it or hear it, before we ſet upon the tranſcribing of it,
for then it muſt of neceſſity lie ſtill a while. And leſt we might either
diſcourage, or not comfort you in ſo good a work (as we can bleſs the
Lord for from our hearts) by making no return till we have got it
writ over; we thought it meet to give you a few Lines from a few of
us, so ſignifie the receipt of it, alſo our acceptance of it, and hearty
agreement with you in it; and do believe the good hand of the Lord
was in it, to make your condition a neceſſity upon you, by his wiſe-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
providence, to encounter this ſtrong man in his ſtrong hold
(<hi>the light within</hi>) with which this ſpirit of deluſion hath run thorow
the dark world, and by it kindled ſome ſparks upon the reliques of old
<hi>Adam,</hi> but brought nothing to light of a crucified Saviour, nor of
the bloud of his Croſs, by which we have peace with God: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
hath reviled us in making mention of this way of peace, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glorying in their own croſs, then in the Croſs of Chriſt, keeping a
catalogue of their own wounds and ſufferings, filling all places with
Prints of them; but never mention the ſufferings, wounds and death
of him through whoſe ſtripes we are healed; which hath been to us
as another Goſpel then that which our Lord brought to light, and was
afterwards preached by his diſciples, and glorified in by good <hi>Paul,</hi>
when others glorified in the fleſh: this is that Goſpel we have heard
and received, (through the workings of his grace) how that Chriſt
died for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried,
and that he roſe again the third day according to the Scriptures, and
<pb facs="tcp:47209:4"/>
aſcended far above all the heavens of this creation into heaven it ſelf,
there to a ppear before God for us our bleſſed high-Prieſt, and onely
Advocate, to whom we deſire always to look, that we may not ſin
againſt him: this is our Kings high-way, in which the way faring man,
though a fool, ſhall not erre. We confeſs there is a righteouſneſs that
is more agreeable unto man, unto which he is more enclined (as that
liquor which this veſſel of the natural man had firſt in it) we hope
without offence we may ſay) not onely then this righteouſneſs of
Chriſt by faith, but then unrighteouſneſs: and upon this ſpark may
this light fall, and make man to walk in the light of it, but ſhall never
place man again in that garden of Gods preſence with him, making all
things delightful to him, out of which after mans fall God drove him,
and hath ever ſince placed ſuch a guard as ſhall for ever keep man
from coming that way. Nay, an <hi>as it were</hi> in this matter may not be
admitted under the adminiſtration of the Goſpel; nor is there any
name given by which we ſhall be ſaved but that Name which is above
all names, unto which all things ſhall bow: this is the Fathers Chriſt,
and our Jeſus, who when he came in the fleſh was not miniſtred unto,
but did himſelf miniſter, and became a ſervant: but our God, who
alſo is Chriſts God, hath highly exalted him.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel we have never heard nor felt from theſe folks, but on
the contrary derided with ſcornful expreſſions, when we have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thus to argue any thing with them; and in ſtead of words of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs,
in the evidence of Scripture-light, we have had ſuch returns
as you have met with, as many in this County can evidence clearly for
us, as their own Papers do for you, under their own hands. Nor are
we willing to rip up the remembrance of things upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
then if it be the Lords will ſome among them might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the Lord may give them repentance unto life; and do hope
there may be ſuch a bleſſing in this Labour of yours, God having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
you not to inſiſt upon any thing leſs then their All, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the light with which every one is enlightned that comes into the
world, is not a ſaving light: this is that which we have believed, but
have not had ability to bring it forth in ſo orderly a way, fit for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view, as we finde the Lord hath enabled you; but rejoyce to have
this opportunity to ſet to our aſſent to what the Lord hath given forth
by you, and further deſire you would permit it to the Preſs. And
theſe two things move us to deſire this from you: partly, that we
have not ſeen any thing in Print that hath met with their Maſter-piece
as this doth; as alſo the perſons undertaking have one way or other
had ſomething of diſadvantage, as you have hinted in your Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix:
<pb facs="tcp:47209:5"/>
nor have they owned thoſe good things in them, which ought
to be owned: and we can ſay we could wiſh not onely for our ſelves,
but for all that call upon the Name of our Lord Jeſus, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
among men might more glorifie our Father in heaven. And
then the other reaſon is, inaſmuch as the Lord hath made you inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
and given you utterance for us in this place, where theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(ſo far as we can underſtand) had their firſt gathering into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
And if they may yet hear, or others fear, and that ſpirit of
Antichriſt diſcovered, that the Lord alone may be exalted, and our
glorying may be together in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus, whom
we may deſigne to exalt together, though we be made but as a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool
to this end, we have the deſire of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Excuſe this unintended tedious Scribble, and paſs by the <hi>Errata</hi>'s
of it, which are many, and accept of our thankfulneſs to your for your
pains: and we hope we ſhall not be negligent to acknowledge the
grace of God to you in this matter, and continue to preſent you to
the Lord in that liberty he hath given us of acceſs to the Father
through him, in whom we are</p>

heartily to bleſs the Lord on your behalf, owning his ſingular
goodneſs in that his gracious leading in this ſervice of truth, whereby beſide
your ſuffering and witneſs for your holy profeſſion he called you to, we
now ſee the further ends of the Father in ſending you to that place; that
even there, where as we have heard this people had their firſt riſe in this
Nation, they ſhould receive ſo eminent a diſcovery and foyl; having alſo by
his good Spirit ſo directed and enabled you to deal with the very ſpirit
and Principle, and that with the principal of their party (then priſoners
with you) whereby that myſtery of iniquity, and ſpirit of Antichriſt is
(bleſſed be his Name) very much detected, and that not onely by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable

arrogant, proud, frothy, raging, ridiculous, vain, erring ſpirit, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

as acceptable ſervice as any of the Lords ſervants can engage in; and the
rather, becauſe under the ſpecious pretences of humility, ſelf-denyal, juſtice,
righteouſneſs, moderation, patient ſuffering, they have abundantly gained
ground &amp; reputation to the ſpreading of their deteſtable errors, &amp; by their
fair words, and feigned ſpeeches, have greatly deceived the hearts of many
ſimple ones; &amp; more eſpecially in ſuch an evil day as this, wherein the pride,
vanity, formality and apoſtacy of too too many profeſſors of truth has appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
but we have a long time through grace been enabled to diſcern their
deceivings, and to ſee through the depth of their cheat, and fully ſatisfyed
that theſe following Scriptures evidently foretel them, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="tcp:47209:6"/>
they are now ſadly manifeſt to the fulfilling thereof, <hi>Viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
13, 14. <hi>For ſuch are falſe apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming
themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt: and no marvel, for Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is transformed into an angel of light; therefore it is no great
thing if his miniſters be alſo transformed as the miniſters of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
whoſe end ſhall be according to their works.</hi> Matth. 24.
4, 5. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you:
for many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many. And there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, and
ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, inſomuch that if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
they ſhall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you
before.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 12. <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaks expreſly, that in the
later days ſome ſhall depart from the ſaith, giving heed to ſeducing
ſpirits and doctrines of devils, ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie, having
their conſciences ſeared with a hot iron.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. <hi>But there
were falſe prophets alſo amongſt the people, even as there ſhall be
falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable
hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves ſwift deſtruction: and many ſhall follow their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken
of.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the
ſpirits whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe prophets are
gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the ſpirit of God: every
ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God;
and every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the
fleſh, is not of God: and this is the ſpirit of Antichriſt, whereof
you have heard that it ſhall come, and even now already is in the
world.</hi> 2 Joh. 7, 9. <hi>For many deceivers are entred into the world,
who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh: this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
and an Antichriſt. Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in
the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Oh how viſibly manifeſt are theſe Scriptures fulfilled in this generation
now among us! who under pretence of Chriſts Apoſtles, Miniſters of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
Angels of God, men immediately inſpired with the Spirit, in
the very ſtate of perfection, crying up Chriſt within, they blaſpheme, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
deny the man Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, both in his name, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
offices, doctrine. How do they introduce another Goſpel, Miniſtery,
Spirit, other Ordinances, another juſtification, Salvation, Reſurrection,
another Heaven, Hell, then the Scriptures witneſs to! Nay, how many have
called themſelves Chriſt the Son of God, and have undeniably theſe chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of the Antichriſtian ſpirit foretold by <hi>John</hi> upon them, denying not
<pb facs="tcp:47209:6"/>
onely the doctrine of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf to be come in the fleſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of his being come in their fleſh; and have eminently manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
themſelves to be the ſons of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> that blaſphemer,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 19, 20. with 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18.</note> who ſaid the
reſurrection was <hi>paſt already, overthrowing the faith of ſome:</hi> which
<hi>Hymenean</hi> doctrine was atteſted not many days ſince by ſome of their
number, to one of us, in a Conference with them, and that before ſeveral
witneſſes, ſaying, <hi>The dead bodies that lie in the graves are not to riſe
again, neither are we to expect any other reſurrection, heaven, hell,
judgement, then what is within us, and paſt upon us here.</hi> To whom
it was replied, that then their faith and hope was vain, and they were yet
in their ſins, and in a damnable eſtate: and why then did they ſuffer, if
the dead riſe not? and that ſuch doctrine undeniably led to ſenſuality, to
eat, drink, and play, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wholly razing out all principles both of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Chriſtianity: which is well known to be their principle, though the
cunning among them ſubtilly gloſs it over, knowing what offence it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gives. Oh that the poor deluded ſincere among them might ſee the gulph
they are plunged into, and that your endeavour might be bleſt to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their eyes, and undeceiving them. Surely if that one Scripture was
weighed by them, it might be of uſe, That men may <hi>give their bodies to
be burnt,</hi> and <hi>all their goods to the poor,</hi> and <hi>profit not,</hi> and be
<hi>but as ſounding braſs and a tinkling cymbal:</hi> and that is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from which, and the end whereto every work is done, that renders it
acceptable.</p>
               <p>And Oh that this may be bleſt to keep all upright hearts from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Luke 17. 23.</note>

that cauſeth to erre from the ways of knowledge.</hi> Surely
principles, ſpirits and doctrines are to be weighed and tryed as well as
converſation:<note place="margin">1 John 4. 1.</note> and them would theſe ſeeming Angels appear Devils; for
Satan can come forth as an angel of light. But how do they rage, and
like the waves of the ſea foaming out their own ſhame, when brought
to the Word for tryal! which is no ſmall diſcovery of their ſpirit: this is
one of the tryals God has ſuffered to come upon his people, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 3.
<hi>to prove whether they will love the Lord their God with all their
heart and all their ſoul.</hi> How long hath the Pope by all his power and
policie endeavoured to get the Bible from Profeſſors, and not prevailed!
but this ſpiritual Antichriſt doth it ſpeedily and effectually. But let grace
be magnified, that keeps any out of their ſnares: and let it be ſeriouſly
laid to heart, that ſo many are ſnared and taken in their net.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, ſince Singularity and Converſation is ſo taking to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Errour, and ſuch damnable Errour too; how ſhould it provoke the
<pb facs="tcp:47209:7"/>
children of Truth, that prize and would promote it, to preſs more after
an excellent converſation, that the poor world ſeeing their good works, <hi>viz.</hi>
the humility, love, patience, meekneſs, zeal, courage, temperance, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

thee a Deceiver, and ſaid thou teached the way to others, and knew'ſt
it not thy ſelf: Although the words ſeem to be improper to thee, yet thou
maiſt read how the Apoſtle ſaid, Some preached Chriſt who was the
way, the truth and the life, and yet ſuch who ſo preached him, knew him
not, but were, alſe Apoſtles, transforming themſelves as the Miniſters
of Righteouſneſs. And now I would have thee mind, whether thou thy

And anſwer me theſe Queries as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1. Whether thy way never fell?</p>

from the body of ſin and death, while he is on this ſide the grave?</p>
                  <p>5. And whether Chriſt doth enlighten every man that comes into the
world with a ſaving Light?</p>
                  <p>6. Whether is bread and wine, Chriſt the ſubſtance?</p>
                  <p>7. And how long haſt thou taken bread and wine in remembrance of
Christs death till he come?</p>
                  <p>8. And whether or no when he is come, thou wilt take it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

death, than to take bread and wine in remembrance of his death, and ſo
keep alive in the old nature? And is not this the deceiver?</p>
                  <p>12. Hast thou known the death, the pangs and the ſorrow? And
art thou become a fool for Christs ſake? And is the wiſdom of the
world fooliſhneſs to thee? And in what place buriest thou thy own?</p>
                  <p>13. And how comes thou to receive that which is fooliſhneſs to the
world? and how wast thou wakened out of ſleep? and when did the
grave open? and when did the Priſoner ſhew himſelf forth?</p>
                  <p>14. And when did the tongue of the dumb ſing?</p>
                  <p>15. And when was the tongue of the first-born ſilent?</p>
                  <p>16. And when wast thou come to thy wits end?</p>
                  <p>17. And how often hast thou watered thy couch?</p>
                  <p>18. And what is the tongue of the learned?</p>

received the annointing from the holy one, even the ſame Spirit that
was in the Prophets and Apoſtles, and gave forth the holy Scriptures,

thy words are at beſt improper. And whereas thou writeſt that

namely, <hi>That the Light wherewith every man is lighted that
comes into the world, is not a ſaving Light.</hi> This I told him I owned,
and ſhould be ready to make good when we had debated the other,
which we were agreed upon, as appeared by their own paper. With

            <p>My firſt argument was laid down thus.</p>
            <p>Chriſt lightneth no man with a ſaving light, but by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt doth not give his Spirit to every man that comes into the

The firſt propoſition is clear from the great; promiſe of the New
Covenant. Iſa. 59. 21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them,
ſaith the Lord, my ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have
put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
of thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seeds ſeed ſaith the Lord, from
henceforth &amp; for ever.</hi> And from the promiſe of Chriſt, John 14. 16, 17.
<hi>And I will pray the Father, &amp; he ſhall give you another Comforter, that
he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, &amp;c.</hi> And from
the end of his giving the Spirit, namely, to be a Spirit of Wiſdom and
Revelation unto them, for the acknowledgement of Chriſt, &amp; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the eyes of their underſtanding, that they might know what is
the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17, 18. and to lead them into all truth,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide
you into all truth.</hi> Neither is there any other way by which Chriſt
doth infuſe a ſaving Light into any man, but by his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10,
11, 12. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit, for his ſpirit
ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, even ſo the things of
God knoweth no man but the spirit of God. Now we have received,
not the spirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might
know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> It is onely by the
unction of the Spirit received from Chriſt, and no other way that
men come to ſee and know theſe things, 1 John 2. 20. <hi>But ye have an

            </p>
            <p>The aſſumption is proved from Jud. 19. Some are <hi>natural, not having
the ſpirit;</hi> and from John 14. 17. <hi>Even the ſpirit of truth whom the
world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but
ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the
ſpirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the ſpirit of
Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> From all which Scriptures it is evident, that
ſome have not the Spirit of Chriſt. Many other teſtimonies I had to
produce for the further clearing of this propoſition, <hi>Viz.</hi> That
Chriſt doth not give his Spirit to every man that comes into the
world.</p>

               <note place="margin">Joh. Stubbs <hi>Anſwers.</hi>
               </note>But here <hi>John Stubbs</hi> began to anſwer, not denying either Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
but as diſliking the proof of the Aſſumption, he ſpake to that
Scripture, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. and ſaid, Thoſe that had not the Spirit were ſuch

                  </hi>
               </note>But, I replied, That it could not be that thoſe ever had the Spirit of

               </gap>, ſenſual or natural, for the ſame

oppoſed to the ſpiritual or regenerate man, ver. 15. And therefore it
is ſaid,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a natural man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know, nor diſcern the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not the Spirit.

               <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God,
for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they
are ſpiritually diſcerned; but the ſpiritual man diſcerneth all things.</hi>
Now the reaſon why one diſcerneth, and the other cannot, is becauſe
one, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpiritual man hath received the ſpirit; the other, <hi>viz.</hi>

To this purpoſe, as far as I can remember, was my Reply. And now,
(notwithſtanding our agreement that the debate might be orderly,
and without confuſion, and my deſire that but one might ſpeak at
once) great diſorder began; for whereas I expected to have reaſoned
with one, or at leaſt but one at once, divers took liberty to ſpeak one
after another, and ſometimes many at once, running from the matter
in hand, to other points, and many asking new queſtions, that it was
hard for me to get convenient time to ſpeak.<note place="margin">Who were obſtrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> Beſides, they were ſo
<hi>obſtreporous,</hi> eſpecially <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>Margret Fell</hi> (as many can

thoſe Scriptures alledged by me, but his endeavour was to prove,
That every man that comes into the world hath the Spirit of Chriſt;
in the management whereof he uſed many under valuing and taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expreſſions towards me, and ſeveral times went from the Table
with theſe words, <hi>The leaſt, or meaneſt Babe will anſwer thee;</hi> as if
the preſence of their Leader, or rather Miſleader, was not needful;

which he would have forced to have ſpoken in his dialect, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the people for attention, as if his work had been more to

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47209:13"/>
That which he would have made out,<note place="margin">The firſt Scripture brought to prove his Aſſertion.</note> was, that every man that
comes into the world, even wicked men have the ſpirit of Chriſt,
one Screpture alledged by him, or ſome other was 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The

were ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 2. And that
if every one of theſe had ſome manifeſtation of the ſpirit, it will not
follow, that every man that comes into the world hath either the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the ſpirit, or the ſpirit it ſelf, and that the Apoſtle ſpeaks
not of every man that comes into the world, but only of every man
that by one ſpirit was baptized in to one body, and had been made to
drink into one ſpirit, is very evident from the whole ſcope of that
Chapter, and eſpecially from the 13. ver. <hi>For by one ſpirit we were all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jewes or Gentiles, whether we be

cannot receive him, therefore hath him not, yet the world do vex and
reſiſt the ſpirit of God, ſpeaking in the Prophets, Apoſtles, or
other ſervants of God, by ſlighting, and rejecting, their reproofes,
exhortations or counſels, or by undervalluing and not regarding the
wonderous works of God wrought by the power of his ſpirit; thus
when <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith, Ye do reſiſt the holy ghoſt, it was the ſpirit in him
by which he ſpake, compared <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>and they were not able to
reſiſt the wiſdom and the ſpirit by which he ſpake.</hi>

when the mighty power of God was put forth in ſigns and miracles

not his ſpirit, (not in themſelves) but put forth in thoſe mighty
works, and ſpeaking in <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and other faithful witneſſes for God

after his departure, it is evident enough that this ſcripture can be no
proof of their aſſertion, to wit, that every man that comes into the
world hath the holy ghoſt; for if every man had him when he came
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47209:14"/>
into the world, what need was there he ſhould be ſent to them, after
Chriſts aſcention, nay rather, this ſhews they had him not before he

               </gap> after Chriſts departure, which deſtroyes
their opinion.</p>
            <p>2. But ſeccondly this promiſe is made particularly to the diſciples
of Chriſt, (<hi>I will ſend him unto you</hi>) and not to the world.</p>
            <p>3. As for that ſaying, <hi>when he is come, he ſhall reprove the world of
ſin &amp;c.</hi> admit it were granted (as it is not) that when he came, he
was within every man reproving him, this would contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the proof of their aſſertion, for then he would only be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man after Chriſts aſcention, not in every man that comes into
the world ſince the fall, or ſince Chriſts manifeſtation in the fleſh,
which is the point they ſhould prove. But further I ſay, That when
the Holy Ghoſt (according to the promiſe) was poured out upon the
diſciples, he ſo mightily wrought in them, and by them, in bearing
witneſs to the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 32. and in doing many
wonders and ſigns, <hi>ver.</hi> 43. that the world was hereby juſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and yet the Holy Ghoſt was not poured out upon all fleſh,
(that is as was urged upon all mankind) or every individual man,
but only upon ſuch as were thereby enabled to repent and believe,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. 39. <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, repent, and be baptized
every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins,
and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, for the promiſe is unto
you and your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the
Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> And Jo. 38. 39. <hi>He that believeth on me, as
the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
ſhould receive, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus
was not yet glorified;</hi> ſo that it is apparent in ſeveral reſpects, that
this Scripture proves not their aſſertion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A fifth Scripture.</note>Further it was ſaid that <hi>Balaam</hi> was a wicked man, and yet he had
the ſpirit of God, and ſaw the ſtarr of <hi>Jacob, Numb.</hi> 24. therefore
every man that comes into the world, hath the ſpirit of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is one thing to have the ſpirit of the Son, which is the

2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. and another thing to have the ſpirit of God come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

thus it was with <hi>Balaam,</hi> and thus with <hi>Saul,</hi> and his meſſengers,
1 <hi>Sam</hi> 19. 20. 21. 23. but this proves not that every man that comes
into the world, hath the ſprit of Chriſt, for the Scripture doth not

ſay, that theſe men had the ſpirit of God before it came upon them;
only theſe Scriptures do ſhew that God can, and ſometimes doth by
the power of his ſpirit, impreſs upon a wicked man, and make him to
declare ſome future glorious things for his own praiſe, and his peoples
comfort, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 1. 2. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 50. 51. may be ſeen, neither

hence, that he had the faith of <hi>Job</hi> to ſee him his Redeemer <hi>Job</hi> 19. 25.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Anſ. <hi>There is a light and law in every man that convinces and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves

which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts,

            <p>But this light, or Law, in every man is not the ſpirit of Chriſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. 8. which was promiſed to be ſent to reprove, or

all that was ſaid, the plain and poſitive Scriptures, brought

            </p>
            <p>As I could get liberty, other Arguments were propounded for
the proof of that which I had undertaken to make good, viz.
<hi>That Chriſt doth not lighten every man that comes into the world
with a ſaving Light,</hi> which are as follow; though in that confuſed
Aſſembly they could not be ſo orderly, and with that enlargement
urged, as they are here ſet down.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Arg.</note>Whom Chriſt enlightens with a ſaving Light into their hearts,
he cauſeth the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt to ſhine,
to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus
Chriſt, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>For God
who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He brings life and immortality to light
through the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. And he doth no otherwayes
manifeſt the Grace of God, our Reconciliation, Peace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhining in our hearts;
and he that wants this Goſpel-light, hath no ſaving-light, but is
loſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are
loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> But Chriſt doth not cauſe this light of the glorious Goſpel
to ſhine in the heart of every man that comes into the world,
for the Goſpel is hid to ſome, and the light of it doth not
ſhine in their hearts, as the Scripture teſtifies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.
<hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom
the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt who
is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt doth not enlighten every one: that comes
into the world, with a ſaving light.</p>

               <hi>Whom Chriſt enlighteneth with a ſaving light, to them is given

John 14. 17. Even the ſpirit of Truth whom the world cannot
receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye
know him, &amp;c. <hi>And the things that are freely given them of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10, 12. But God hath revealed them uuto us by his
ſpirit—Now we have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the
ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are
freely given to us of God. <hi>So Matth.</hi> 13. 11. He anſwered and
ſaid unto them, (<hi>viz. his Diſciples</hi>) Becauſe it is given unto you to

            <p>
               <hi>But there are ſome who know not the Father nor the Son,</hi>
John 16. 3. And theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe
they have not known the Father nor me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. No man
knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Nor the Spirit, John</hi> 14. 17. Even the Spirit of Truth whom the
world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not; neither knoweth
him, nor the things of the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. But the natural man
receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs

therefore they cannot diſcern ſpiritual things</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Yea further, they cannot diſcern nor know theſe
things, becauſe their underſtanding is darkned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18.
and as to theſe things, they are meer darkneſs,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 8. <hi>Yea,
the light that is in them, is darkneſs, according to the words
of Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 6. 23. If therefore the light that is in thee
be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs? <hi>And Chriſt himſelf
gives another reaſon why they cannot know theſe things,
Matth. the</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; the</hi> 11th, <hi>Becauſe it is not given to them;</hi> It
is given to you to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but to them it is not given. <hi>And in Matth</hi> 11. 25. <hi>he
tells us plainly it is becauſe they are hid from them.</hi> And at that
time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47209:16"/>
and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe
and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt doth not lighten every man that comes into

            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Argum.</note>To ſuch as Chriſt enlightens with a ſaving Light, he alſo gives a

and eventually ſaving, it quickens and regenerates, and

hence it is that Chriſt is a live-making Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. becauſe
who ſoever is enlightened with a ſaving Light, is alſo quickened, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 21, 5. <hi>You hath he quickened, &amp;c, even
when ye were dead in ſins, hath he quickened us together with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Chriſt doth not quicken and regenerate every man that
comes into the world, every one is not a new Creature, ſome are
born of the fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. and are in the fleſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>So then
they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> ſome are dead in ſin,

therefore unto you, that ye ſhall dye in your ſins; for if ye believe not
that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt doth not lighten every man that comes into

            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. Arg.</note>Whom Chriſt enlightens with a ſaving Light, to them he alſo

to receive him as a glorious light to dwell in the heart. And
thus Chriſt by his Spirit and Faith, and no other way, dwells in the
heart, irradiating the whole ſoul with the bright beams of his
glorious light, according to theſe Scriptures. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17. <hi>I

and that many ſimple hearts, who being yet ignorant of

of the wicked into pernitious wayes, may be more effectually
undeceived and reclaimed, I ſhall endeavour briefly and plainly
to ſhew,</p>
            <p>1. What the light in every man is.</p>
            <p>2. Of what uſe it is, and the utmoſt it can do.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>What it cannot do</hi>—That if God peradventure may pleaſe
to give unto any Repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth,
they may be recovered out of the ſnare of the Devil, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of that which is to be ſpoken of
the light in man,<note place="margin">Five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars premiſed.</note> it is neceſſary that theſe things following be
premiſed.</p>
            <p>1. That God is light, 1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>and dwels in the light which
no man can approach unto,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. and is the fountain
and originall of all light. And hence</p>
            <p>2. That all light is of God, all light is Gods light, that is, it is
his off-ſpring, he is the Author and efficient cauſe of it, and
thence is called the Father of lights, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. And yet</p>
            <p>3. That all light is not God, for there are created lights; light
was the firſt diſtinct part of the whole creation, <hi>Gen</hi> 1. 13.
<hi>He made two great lights to rule the day and the night;</hi> he
made the Stars alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 16. which are called Stars of light,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 8, 3. Now what God creates, forms or makes, that
is not God.</p>
            <p>4. As External, proper, ſenſible light is Gods creature, ſo alſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47209:19"/>
is internal light, intellectuall light, inviſible light, both in
Angels and men; the Angels, thoſe miniſtring ſpirits, thoſe
flames of fire, thoſe ſtar-like ſparkles of light, are Angels of
light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. yet they are but derivative lights, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by the Father of lights, and ſpirits, <hi>Ja</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Heb,</hi> 12. 9.
created by him, by whom all things were made, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16.
<hi>For by him were all things created, that are in Heaven and
that are in Earth, viſible, and inviſible, whether they be
Thrones or Dominions, or Principallities, or Powers, &amp;c.</hi> So
the ſpirit of man is a light in man, an inviſible light, called
the candle of the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. 27. formed in man by the
Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 1. of which more will be ſaid afterwards.</p>
            <p>5. As all derivative lights which God hath made, are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to himſelf, ſo are the inferior one to another; the light
in man when he was at his beſt, was far inferior to the light
of wiſdome and knowledg in Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 5. the light
in Angels is far inferior to the light in the man Chriſt
Jeſus, as he is the anointed Saviour, and ſuſtains the office
of a Mediator; he, as ſuch, is the Sun-light, far above all other
lights, lighted up by the Father of lights, in him are hid all
the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I come to ſhew what the light in
every man is.</p>
            <p>The light that is in man may be conſidered either,</p>
            <p>1. With reſpect to the will and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

peace, comfort, joy and gladneſs, which is oppoſed to the
darkneſs of inward trouble, griefe and ſorrow; and thus I find
the Scripture frequently ſpeaking of light and darkneſs, metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. <hi>Light (that is joy) is ſowne for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and gladneſs for the upright in heart. Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. <hi>He that
walks in darkneſs, and hath no light,</hi> is one that hath no peace, no
comfor, no conſolation; when the Jewes were delivered from
<hi>Hamans</hi> conſpiracie, they had light, and gladneſs, joy, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. 16. ſo <hi>Job</hi> 18. 5. <hi>the light of the wicked</hi> (that is
their joy and comfort) <hi>ſhall be put out;</hi> the Church ſaith, <hi>Micah</hi>
7. 8. <hi>When I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord will be a light unto me,</hi> that
is, of joy and comfort.</p>

ſo it is ſpoken of in this queſtion) with reſpect to the intellectual

form a ſpirit in every man, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Who formeth the ſpirit
of man in him,</hi> or as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Lord breathed into man
the breath of life,</hi> and man became a living ſoul, agreeable to that
of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a
living ſoul;</hi> ſo that without this ſpirit, he could not be a man; now
this ſpirit in every man is the light in every man, according to
the teſtimony of that Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. <hi>The ſpirit of a

            <p>Together with this light ſet up in man,<note place="margin">There is a Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in every mans heart</note> which ſhewed him his
Creator, and that he was to be ſerved, and how he was to be

written in his heart, (which Law is called light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 23.)
whereby the will and mind of his Creator, was impreſt upon him,
and made known unto him, ſo that by the Spirit, or light ſet up
in him, he could reflect upon this Law, as a rule to every motion,
and operation, and underſtand the reaſon, and reaſonableneſs
of it; yet here by the way it is to be obſerved, that this Law is not
God,<note place="margin">This Law is not God.</note> God is the Law-giver, or the Law-writer, whether in the
fleſhly Tables of the heart, or in Tables of Stone, but the Law
giver,<note place="margin">Proved.</note> or the Law writer, is not the Law, nor <hi>è Contra &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law was written in the natural mans heart, to be a Rule,

but it is not the Father of Lights who is an infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
Fountain of perfection and glory, but a borrowed ray
or beam of Divine Glory, confined to its Orb, and limited to its
uſes (as all other lights are) beyond which it cannot go. And thus

            <p>Since the fall of man,<note place="margin">The Light in man ſince the fall, not ſuch as it was before the fall.</note> this Candle of the Lord in him (that is,
his Reaſon and Underſtanding) is become exceeding dim in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what it was before, as the Scripture teſtifies, Eph. 4. 18.
<hi>Having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the Life
of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their heart;</hi> In the fall the Devil got into this Candle, the
mind of man, whereof he hath ever ſince kept poſſeſſion, and will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47209:21"/>
keep it ſtill, except a ſtronger than he caſt him out; he is the Spirit
that works in the children of diſobedience, and ſo blinds their
minds, and darkens their eyes, that they cannot look up to God,
or diſcern the things that concern his glory and their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but their Candle doth moſtly give light downward, to things
below, Eph. 2. 2. <hi>Wherein in time paſt ye walked ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ording to the
courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the Power of the
Air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi>
2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds
of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of
Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> Inſomuch
that it may be ſaid of every man in the fall, how wiſe ſoever he may
conceit himſelf to be, That he is a vain, empty man, born like a
wild Aſſes Colt, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 12. and that he is in reſpect of man in his
Innocency, but a beaſt; in regard of his ignorance, man that was
made like unto God, hath made himſelf by his fall, like unto a
beaſt, according to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 18. <hi>I ſaid in my
heart concerning the eſtate of the ſons of men, That God might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
them, and that they might ſee that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yet is not this Light wholly extinct, for then he could not exiſt, but
would ceaſe to be a man; where there is no ſpirit of a man, there
is no man.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Law written in mans heart,<note place="margin">The Light and Law remaining in faln man, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render God righteous when he iudgeth the diſobedient</note> which at firſt was
plainly to be read, is not ſo oblitterated, but that there is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
left to render God righteous in his proceedings againſt men,
who do hold that meaſure of the knowledge of God (which is left
in them) in unrighteouſneſs, and to leave them inexcuſable before
him in the day of the revelation of the righteous Judgement of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. I ſay, there is ſo much of the Eternal Power and
God-head manifeſted and made known to men by the things that
are made, that ſuch as like not to retain God in their knowledge,
nor to glorifie him ſo far as they do know him, ſhall be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuſe in the day when God ſhall render to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, becauſe
that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them</hi> (or to them)
<hi>for God hath ſhewed it unto them; for the inviſible things of him
from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47209:21"/>
by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead
ſo that they are without excuſe: Becauſe that when they knew
God, they glorified him not as God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In aſmuch therefore as there is a Light remaining in every man
ſince the fall, though far inferiour to that which was in man in his
innocency, I ſhall endeavour in the next place further to declare
theſe two things:</p>
            <p>1. What this remaining Light can do, or what the utmoſt
uſes of it are. And</p>
            <p>2. What it cannot do.</p>
            <p>There is a fourfold uſe of the Light that is in every man ſince
the fall.<note place="margin">A fourfold uſe of the Light in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. To make manifeſt:</p>
            <p>2. To direct.</p>
            <p>3. To convince.</p>
            <p>4: To feel after God.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. To make manifeſt.</note> This Light (as the Scripture teſtifies) ſearcheth all the
inward parts of the belly, Prov. 20. 27. <hi>The Spirit of a man
is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of
the Bedy:</hi> That is, Whatſoever is moſt ſecret in our minds;
for as in the Belly natural conceptions are wrought and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
ſo in the Mind Moral Conceptions of good or evil, are
wrought and ſhaped. To this alſo agrees the ſaying of the
Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.) <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man,
ſave the ſpirit of a man whech is in him?</hi> That is, No other
man knows what his own thoughts are, or what they are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but his own underſtanding. This Spirit of a man ſees all
the inward motions and outward actions of a man, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
act of the underſtanding, which is called Science; and
this ſimply conſidered, makes not any thing that is diſcovered,
good or evil: And this is the firſt uſe of the Light that is in
every man, <hi>viz.</hi> To make manifeſt the things of a man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. To direct</note> This Light in every man is uſeful for direction in a
double reſpect:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47209:22"/>
1. As it looks upon the Law written in his heart, it preſents
unto him the principles of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Equity, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs,
and other Moral Vertues, and ſhews him what is right
to be done, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>For
when the Gentiles</hi> (that is, unconverted Gentiles) <hi>which have not
the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not the Law</hi> (that is, formally publiſhed and preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them) <hi>are a Law unto themſelves:</hi> Which ſhew the work
of the Law written in their hearts, their Conciences alſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As it looks upon the works of the Creation, which are
ſeen, ſuch clear beams of the God-head may be underſtood by
the things that are made, as might direct and induce man
to glorifie God as God; which the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
18, 19. makes the ground of the Righteouſneſſe of God in
that dreadful Revelation of his Wrath againſt all ungodlineſſe
and unrighteouſneſſe of men, (who ever they be) who hold
the Truth in unrighteouſneſſe; Becauſe that which may be
known of God, is manifeſt in them, (or to them.) But how
or where hath God manifeſted this to them? The Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
in the next words, Verſe 20. <hi>For the inviſible things of
him from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being
underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and God-head, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> So that,
though every man have not a Light in him that is able to
ſave him, (as will be further cleared hereafter;) yet he hath
ſo much as will make him guilty, and leave him without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the light in every man is uſeful for conviction,<note place="margin">3. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note> for
though (as was ſaid before) when it looks upon the things of a
man with a direct act, it makes nothing good, or evil, yet when it
reflects upon the Law within, which ſhall be the Rule of every
motion, and operation, and compares the Action done, with that
Law, the goodneſs, or evilneſs of it is diſcovered, according as it
bears conformitie,<note place="margin">What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is.</note> or non-conformitie thereunto; and now Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or a bare knowing of an Action done, is become Conſcience;
for this reflex Act of the ſoul is called Conſcience; that is,
a knowing, together with ſomething elſe, as when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
conſiders what is done, in conjunction with a Law,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47209:22"/>
according to which it ought to be done; thus the Spirit of a man,
which is the Candle of the Lord, doth manifeſt the deed done,
and the Law diſcovers the quallitie of the Action, according to
that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſin is by the Law.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledg of ſin;</hi>
were there not a Law, there would be no Tranſgreſſion, and were
not the Law looked upon, and the Action compared with it, there
would be no ſuch thing as Conſcience; but when deeds are laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law, as a Glaſſe ſhews not only the face, but the ſpots
that are in it, ſo it will give a true report of their regularitie, or
irregularitie, of their goodneſs, or badneſs; and ſuitable thereto
will its Sentence be, and Anſwerable to the Sentence the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth,
will be the excuſations or accuſations of the perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Which ſhew the work of the Law written in
their hearts, their Conſciences alſo bearing witneſs, and their
thoughts mean while excuſing, or accuſing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I ſay it comes to paſſe, that when a man, a meer natural
man, refuſeth to follow this light of direction, in doing what is
right,<note place="margin">What is the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

troubleth him, and judgeth him, and is a Witneſſe for the Lord
that he is righteous when he judgeth, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Now we know that what things
ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law; that
every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guiltie
before God,</hi> or be ſubject to the judgment of God, not having a
word to object, why Sentence ſhould not be executed, becauſe
they have Tranſgreſſed.</p>
            <p>This light was that which manifeſted to <hi>Adam</hi> his Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">What it was that manifeſted to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Juda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him hide himſelf from the preſence of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>I
heard thy voice in the Garden, and was afraid, becauſe I was naked,
and I hid my ſelf;</hi> and as it was then, ſo it hath been ever ſince,
and will be ſtill, that if any man tranſgreſſe that Rule, and Law
that is written in the heart of every natural man, there is a light
ſet up in his conſcience which will accuſe him, be a witneſs againſt
him, torment him, and condemn him, according to that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
before mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. this manifeſted
to <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin, and cauſed him to bring again the money, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
he had ſinned.</p>
            <p>And more then this is not needful by way of Anſwer to <hi>H. W.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:47209:23"/>
or any other perſon, demanding where that witneſs is that doth
condemn, and what that was which cauſed <hi>Judas</hi> to bring again
the money, and to confeſs that he had ſinned, in that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the innocent blood.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. To feel after God as Creator.</note> there is yet a further uſe of this light, common to all
men, it doth not only make manifeſt, direct and convince, but is
able alſo to know much of God as a Creator, and Law giver, at
leaſt his eternal power and Godhead, by the works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which are ſeen; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and to feel, and ſeek after
him, as ſuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27, 28. <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the Lord if
happily they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not
farr from every one of us, for in him we live move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus for the light in all men, or common to all men good and
bad, believers and Infidels, may go &amp; ſerve for the fore mentioned
excellent uſes, even ſince by traſgreſſion man fell from his created

or non-conformitie thereto, may have peace, (a legal

Chriſt as the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>life,</hi> is not ſo much heard of,

                  </gap>h he hath conſecrated for us, through the

and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Matth. 11. 27. Nor
can any come to the Father, but through this new and living way.
Theres no other entrance into the Paradiſe of God, and to the
Tree of Life, but onely by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch Teachers as (excluding the Mediator) do affirm,
That as <hi>Adam</hi> fell from God by departing from the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, even ſo is he recovered and reſtored by returning
and yeelding obedience to that Light within; do lead people
from Chriſt Jeſus the true way, to the Law, that old deadly
Gate, through which it is impoſſible for any of the ſons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
to enter and live. They that would lead men unto God by a
perfection of obedience in themſelves, and not by ſaith in a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Chriſt, as the only way into the holieſt, inſtead of bringing
them into. Heaven, to life and peace with God, do ſhut up the
Kingdom againſt them: No man by the endeavours of the
higheſt perfection of Reaſon, or natural ſpeculations of the
Divinity, will ever find acceſſe to God upon a Mercy-ſeat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he come to acknowledge the fleſh or dead body of Chriſt
to be the only way conſecrated and prepared for him, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That the Light that is in every man knows not this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of Chriſt, nor is able to make any diſcovery of it, as is
evident from</hi> Eph. 3. 9. <hi>where the holy Spirit teſtifies, That
it hath been hid in God from the beginning of the World:</hi>
And to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the Myſterie
which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, to the intent that now
unto Principalities and Powers in heavenly places, might be
known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God.</p>
            <p>Mark here, it was hid from the beginning of the World;
ſo that neither all the Light in <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, nor
in the holy Angels, knew it, how much leſs could the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light
of mans Spirit ſince the fall, by any force remaining
in it, enter into this great ſecret? Doth not Chriſt himſelf
tell us plainly, That theſe things are hid from the wiſe? Matth.
11. 25. <hi>I thank thee. O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47209:25"/>
thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and the prudent,
and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> And doth not <hi>Paul</hi>
ſay when he preached the Goſpel, That he ſpake the wiſdom of
God in a Myſterie, which none of the Princes of this World
knew, 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8. <hi>But we ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
even the hidden Myſtetie which God ordained before the
world to our glory, which none of the Princes of this world knew;
for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
Glory?</hi> And doth not the ſame <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a learned man,
brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and inſtructed according
to the perfect manner of the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the righteouſneſſe thereof, blameleſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. plainly
declare, That before his Converſion (notwithſtanding all his
Light and Learning, and all his care to follow that Light to
the utmoſt, for he had lived in all good Conſcience before
God until that day, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1.) he was ignorant of theſe
things, and utterly unable with all his natural and acquired
parts, to come to the knowledge of them: Why elſe (if it
was not ſo) did he ſo violently perſecute the Saints, as appears
at large in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 3. &amp; 9. 1. and 22. 5, 9, 19, 20—and 26. 10,
11. And how elſe could he think with himſelf, That he ought to
do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,
Acts</hi> 26. 9. And kick againſt the pricks, and perſecute the Lord
Jeſus, ver. 14, 15. But that the Light within (which he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to) was unable to make known unto him the true Jeſus, and
that it was ſo, he himſelf doth yet further declare in thoſe
words, <hi>Who are thou Lord? Acts</hi> 26. 15. and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where he confeſſeth he had been a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and

Salvation to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. So it is
altogether unable to diſcover the way and means whereby the
Redeemer, and with him life and happineſs is to be received and
enjoyed; that is, it knows nothing of the Law of Faith men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. The tenor whereof is this,
That whoſoever believeth in Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">The tenor of the Law of Faith.</note> ſhall not periſh,
but have everlaſting life, according to <hi>John</hi> 3 15, 16. <hi>For God ſo

loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting
life.</hi> The knowledge of this Law ſprung not up with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in nature, it was not written in the heart of natural man
as a thing juſt and equal. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Light onely ſhewed him what
was juſt to be done, and when he had ſinned, convinced him,
and paſſed ſentence upon him, and there left him in his miſery, not
affording any direction or help for his recovery, which made him
fear, and hide himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>Then was the great fountain of free Grace opened, and by the
occaſion of the tranſgreſſion and miſery of man, this Law of
Faith was added, and founded upon Chriſt in that Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the

               <note place="margin">The law of Faith is not natural but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</note> this Law is not natural, but ſupernatural, not ſpringing up

of a natural man to know, as the Heavens are above the Earth,
yea as the thoughts of God are above the thoughts of man,
<hi>Though vain man would be wiſe, yet he is born like a wild Aſſes
Colt, Job</hi> 11. 12. Its above the reach of his reaſon, to conceive how
Faith in a crucified Chriſt, ſhould be the way to ſave a ſinner; and
hence it is, that the preaching of a Chriſt crucified, for the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Chriſt, God, the Lord God, and the Lamb, the object of faith; and
this true light which is Chriſt, lightens not ſome, but every man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that this light can be meant of no other then of Chriſt, they further

               </note> by whom the world was made: for as it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1.
<hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;</hi> So that
which is ſpoken of in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10. verſes following,
is to be referred to the <hi>Word God</hi> the Creator of all things, and not
to the Word, as the Word is made fleſh, as ver. 14. or as the Word is
God manifeſt in the fleſh, as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. or as the Word is in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the humane nature, according to his name <hi>Emmanuel, Matth.</hi>
1. 23. Let the impartial and unprejudiced Reader conſider what is
ſaid in every verſe, and I doubt not but he will finde it according to
the report given, as in the 2 verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>The ſame was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
that is, the ſame <hi>Word God,</hi> diſtinct from the humanity; and ſo
it is in the verſe following. As in the 3. verſe, <hi>All things were made by
him;</hi> that is, by the <hi>Word God,</hi> in the 4. verſe. <hi>In him was life, and
the life was the light of men:</hi> That is, <hi>God the Word,</hi> the Creator,
who gives life and light to all men, according to that in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28,
29. <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being;</hi> and <hi>we are all his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi>
in the 5. verſe. <hi>And the light ſhineth in darkneſs, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
comprehended it not:</hi> That is, <hi>The Word God,</hi> as it is explained
in the 10. verſe, <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him,
and the world knew him not.</hi> Though the Word the Creator ſhined as
light in the world, and was not far from every one of us, as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. and had ſet up a Candle in them, whereby the
eternal power and Godhead might be known by the things that were
made; yet ſuch was the darkneſs of men, that they did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
and acknowledge him.</p>
            <p>In the 7. and 8. verſes it's ſaid, <hi>John was ſent to bear witneſs of that
light,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Word God,</hi> to wit, that God the Word was
come to manifeſt himſelf in the fleſh; he bare witneſs, that the light
which was in the world, and by whom the world was made, and
whom the world knew not, was now come to appear in the fleſh. It's
true, that <hi>John</hi> alſo bare witneſs of Chriſt in both natures; as when
<hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> verſe 14. it's ſaid in the 15. verſe, <hi>John</hi> bare
witneſs of him: and afterward, when he ſaw Jeſus coming unto him,
he ſaith, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the
world,</hi> verſe 29. Where he ſpeaks of him as the Word made fleſh, and
Tabernacled amongſt us: But in the verſes before mentioned, he
onely aſſerts, and proves his Divinity. In like manner are we to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the 9 verſe, <hi>That was the true light,</hi> that is, the <hi>Word God,</hi> the
Creator and former of all things, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 28. was (to wit, in the
beginning, for thither the Verb in the Original in every verſe, doth
carry us) the true light; not a borrowed, or derived light, but the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47209:29"/>
fountain and original of all light; according to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
1. 5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> This I ſay is proper
to the Creator, who is the fountain of Life and Light to all beings
according to their capacities; whereas Chriſt as Mediator, deriveth
Light from the Father, as he doth Life and Subſiſtance, as he himſelf
doth witneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 57. <hi>I live by the Father,</hi> &amp;c. And thus we ſee
who this true light is, <hi>Viz. The Word God.</hi> And hence it may be
that the word Chriſt is not once named in any of the firſt 9. verſes of
the firſt of <hi>John,</hi> but only the Word.</p>

further evident by conſidering theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That Chriſt is the onely Mediator between God and man, as
the Scripture teſtifies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That in Chriſt there are two whole, perfect and diſtinct natures,
the Godhead and the Manhood, inſeparably joyned together in one
perſon; which is an Article of faith to which the Scriptures give full
teſtimony, as may be ſeen in theſe few inſtances:</hi> Luke 1. 35. And the
angel anſwered and ſaid unto her, The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and
the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo that holy
thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God. <hi>Col.</hi>
2. 9. For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 4.
But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a
woman, made under the law. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 16. And without controverſie
great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the
ſpirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
received up into glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3, 4. —Concerning his Son Jeſus
Chriſt our Lord, who was made of the ſeed of David according to the
fleſh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit
of holineſs, by the reſurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>3. That Chriſt is often mentioned where the two natures, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
joyned together in his perſon, are diſtinctly ſpoken of; that is,
the matter may reſpect, and be applicable to the properties of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not of the other: as when he ſaith, <hi>I and my Father are
one,</hi> Joh. 10. 30. he ſpeaks of his divine nature; but when he ſaith in
the ſame chapter, verſ. 15. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to his humane nature. As he is God, he is equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as he is man, he layeth down his life for the ſheep: and yet one
and the ſame Chriſt, who is God and man, ſpeaks in both places. This
is alſo evident in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. In like manner when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I
am the root and off-ſpring of David,</hi> Rev. 22. 16. he ſpeaks diſtinctly of
both natures: he is the root of <hi>David,</hi> as he is God; the off-ſpring
of <hi>David,</hi> as he is man. So when it is ſaid of the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>That
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47209:30"/>
the world was made by him;</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>that by himſelf he
purged our ſin:</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh, and ſay, The world was made by
him as God, and he purged away ſin as Mediatour by the ſacrifice of
himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. &amp; 10. 12. <hi>This man, after he had offered one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for ſin for ever.</hi> Thus, rightly to diſtinguiſh the natures of Chriſt,
is not to divide the Father from the Son, nor the Son from himſelf;
but to give to either nature that which properly, under a diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
belongs to it; and to both in union, that which belongs
to both. Without which, the works of the Creator and Mediator,
which are manifeſtly diſtinct, would be confounded. As in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under debate, concerning the Word, and the Word made fleſh;
the Word is God the Creator, the Word made fleſh is the Mediator.
The Creator ſets up a light in every man; the Mediator gives a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
light, but, to ſuch onely as believe on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 46.</p>
            <p>Thus having anſwered their Objections, though I queſtion not but
a judicious Reader, who hath taken a ſurvey of their Principles, and
ſhall ſeriouſly conſider what I have hitherto aſſerted and proved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

their Tenents, eſpecially of their Fundamental Opinion hitherto op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
I ſhall endeavour in a few Inferences from the premiſes, to
ſhew how injurious it is to the true Jeſus, who is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the

God-man was ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on in the world. But this people (as the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly
ſome ſhould do in the later times, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.) do revolt or depart
from the faith of this great myſtery; affirming, that the light that is
in every man is Chriſt, the Redeemer. And if ſo, where then is the

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47209:31"/>
in their ſaying that the light without the fleſh is the true Chriſt;

            </p>
            <p>Now this people do ſet up, and call the light that is in every man,
God, Chriſt, the Spirit; which yet is not God, nor Chriſt, nor the
Spirit, as hath been proved: Therefore they ſet up an Idol in ſtead
of Chriſt. And inaſmuch as it is light, and a light within, and hath a
greater likeneſs to God then other repreſentations of him have which
are ſet up in ſtead of the true light; by ſo much it is a greater and
more dangerous Idol.</p>
            <p>The more like any thing is to God, the ſooner is man induced to
call it God himſelf: therefore Satan, who ſeeketh the poſſeſſion of
Gods throne, doth more effectually deceive, and draw men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him as God, when he appears as an angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. It opens a way to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and the worſhip of the Devil.</note> admit this Idol, this grand lye, for the corner ſtone, and

1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. when men have revolted from the faith of the
great myſtery of godlineſs, they preſently attend to erroneous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
to wit, the doctrines of Daemons; either to doctrines taught
by Daemons or devils, or to doctrines concerning devils, (as <hi>Mede</hi>
underſtands the place.) Thoſe are the very Rocks which this people
(concerning the faith having made ſhipwrack) do further run their
ſouls upon.</p>
            <p>For, having ſet up this Idol (the light that is in every man that
comes into the world) as God, and as the Anointing, which is to be
attended and obeyed as their Teacher; they do not onely open a way
for Satan being transformed as an angel of light to ſuggeſt unto them
as many lyes and erroneous doctrines as he pleaſeth, (of which I ſhall
name ſome afterwards) but while they do worſhip that light as God,
they do deifie and worſhip Angels.</p>

are true unto it, to walk according to the ſuggeſtions and motions of
their own mindes, without any reſpect had to the Scripture as a rule:
for, as they affirm that the light in all men is Chriſt, and is the ſame
Anointing both in believers and unbelievers; ſo they ſay, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
rule in every mans conſcience, whereby he ought to be guided.
Whence it will unavoidably follow, that whoſoever ſhall give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to obey and be guided by this light as a perfect rule, will no
longer hold himſelf obliged to walk after a certain Scriptural rule, but
muſt follow the uncertain motions in his own minde, whether thoſe
motions lead to actions good or evil. And hence it hath come to
paſs, that ſome who have followed this guide, have been led to many
heady, raſh, unclean, unjuſt actions, altogether unwarrantable by the
rule of the Scripture of truth. Of ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. where he foretels that in the laſt days there ſhould come

for inſtruction in righteouſneſs: that the man of God may be perfect,
thorowly furniſhed unto all good works. <hi>Hence it is that Water-baptiſm,
the Supper of the Lord, and Cenſures, and other appointments of

that it leads thoſe that are obedient to it, to purity, holineſs, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.
Hence they ſay, what they do in obedience to this light,
is done in obedience to the Lord, and therein they ſin not. So that
though they ſpeak untruths, falſly accuſe, perſecute with the tongue,
or otherwiſe do acts of injuſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they will not be brought

            <p>9. That there is that in the Spiritual man, which being turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and followed, can redeem, and make atonement, and that in him
the atonement is made: which deſtroyes the atonement made by
the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>10. They teach, that there is no coming of Chriſt but that within,
and ſo deny the Aſſumption of Chriſt, God and man, to the throne of
glory, and his ſecond coming in his glorified perſon; contrary
to the Scriptures of truth.</p>

upon the means, or occaſion of the great ſucceſs, which their way hath

that their pleading for thoſe good things (which ought to be owned
by all) hath rather proceeded from the Serpentine ſubtiltie acting
principally in their leaders, to cloake and more inſenſibly to carry on
a pernicious deſigne againſt Chriſt, then from a true zeal of a godly
reformation, for the honour of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>1. From the ignorance, pride, covetouſneſs, idleneſs, formality,
looſeneſs, corrupt cuſtoms, Idolatrous ſuperſtitions, and cruelty of
Pariſh-prieſts, and the generality of their hearers.</p>
            <p>2. From the too great formality, legality, and manifold diviſions
of ſeparated Congregations.</p>
            <p>3. From the open Teſtimony this people have borne againſt the
forementioned evils, together with a greater pretence of ſpirituality,
unity, purity, holineſs, righteouſneſs, gravity, zeal, and perfection in
them, then did appear in any of the former.</p>
            <p>Antichriſt doth never oppoſe Chriſt more, then when he appears

pretends to be all for Chriſt, reproving much that is evil, and
pleading for many commendable things. Thus our Saviour tells us,

were never able to this day to look this people in the face, who in the
mean while crying out, Lo here is Chriſt, not in the multitude, not
in the publique aſſemblies, not in the common way of worſhip, but
amongſt us a ſeparared people, gathered and called out of the world
into a more ſpiritual way.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe fair ſhews,<note place="margin">Whence ſo many have embraced the falſe doctrine and way.</note> it is no wonder, that many poor harmleſs

no better way to get the flies off their gauld backs, then to cruſh them
all at once, and with them the good and the evil together: which
when many well-meaning people perceived, they magnified theſe
ſufferers, and received their doctrine as the orracles of God, and ſo
eaſily fell into their net, to do Homage to their <hi>new God.</hi> In the
mean while theſe ignorant, looſe, and raſh prieſts and people, who
thus dealt with them, loſt themſelves, injured the truth, and gave this
people ground to glory over them.</p>
            <p>Whereas the right courſe to be taken in this caſe,<note place="margin">The right way to ſuppreſs their errours.</note> is to diſtinguiſh
between good and evil; and what is brought, either in doctrine or
manners, that is good, let it be owned, embraced, and cheriſhed;
and what is blamed as evil, (if upon tryal it be found evil) let it be
put away: thus ſhall we be in a better capacity to ſee, and deal with

An Appendix to a Relation of a Debate

Between the QUAKERS and J. W.
Wherein the Evil language of the Quakers is
diſcovered, and compared with the language
of the FALSE PROPHETS.</head>
            <p>IT is foretold that thoſe falſe prophets,<note place="margin">Characters falſe Prophet in the laſt days.</note> deceivers and Antichriſts

Whether theſe characters do not eminently appear in ſome of theſe

their boaſting of perfection, and a ſinleſs ſtate) they declare not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the ſervants of corruption: I leave to be conſidered by
all that are ſober, impartial, and wiſe; yea, even by ſuch of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            <p>For my own part,<note place="margin">The ſpirit of the Quakers and of the Dragon com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared.</note> though I can ſay that (through the goodneſs of

ſend forth many infamous Libels, ſtuft with Invectives, moſt of them
being put into the hands of the Gaoler and Priſoners before they
came to mine; wherein, beſides the unſavoury language following,
they do their utmoſt to render me odious, and obnoxious to the

            <p>Margaret Fell in one Letter:</p>
            <p>Thou manifeſts thy gainſaying ſpirit, <hi>Core</hi>-like, gainſaying and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the truth, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did; that is to ſay, the light
with the which every man is enlightned, is not the light of Chriſt, nor a
ſaving light. Thou art without God in the world. Thou haſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
thy ſelf to be out of the firſt ſtep that leads to Chriſtianity, and art
a miniſter of darkneſs. Thy foul ſinful prayers are abominable.</p>
            <p>They fleſhly performances are but graſs and chaff.</p>
            <p>All thy rotten bypocritical performances.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt committed ſacriledge, and haſt blaſphemed againſt the holy
Spirit of God; which never will be forgiven thee in this world, nor in
that which is to come. Thou art under it, and it remains upon thee for
ever. That foul and unclean ſpirit that thou art of. Thou manifeſts
thy dark ſottiſh ſpirit.</p>
            <p>In a ſecond Letter:</p>
            <p>Thou begins with a lye, and ends with the devil, and ſets <hi>John Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
next to him, as if thou waſt his head-Vicegerent: but certainly thou
art a great zealot for him. All ſuch unclean ſpirits as thine is. Thy
black defiled heart and conſcience. Thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf to be a
childe of darkneſs. What haſt thou to do to take the Name of God and
Chriſt in thy mouth? Thou enemy of God. Thou art a thief. Thou
are not a believer of Chriſt. Thou art yet in thy ſins. Thou art a man
ſeparated from God. Thou never kneweſt nothing of the worſhip of God.
Thy envious poyſonous heart. Thou art under the chain, and it is over
thee. A fighter againſt God and his truth, and the reward thou wilt be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47209:36"/>
ſure to have. And never look that that which is curſed will be bleſt. Thou
art accurſed, and no other portion can thou have: and this is Scripture,
and truth to thee.</p>
            <p>In a third Letter:</p>
            <p>Thou can do ſomething in writing a Book of thy own dreams, and thy

anſwers thus: <hi>I never heard ſuch words, but from an idolater, and a
blaſphemer againſt God and Chriſt. Thou art an enemy of God, thou art
worſe then the Jews. Thou art a fit man to joyn with the Turk to ſet up</hi>
Mahomet. <hi>O thou infidel, O thou childe of darkneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Speaking of Chriſt, ſhe ſaith,</hi> I am a witneſs for him againſt all
ſuch Antichriſts, and deceivers, and blaſphemers as thou art. Thou art
a miniſter of the night, and of darkneſs, in the Apoſtacie. Thou art
a night-bird. The curſe and the judgement that's written therein,
(<hi>ſpeaking of the Scripture</hi>) Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtle hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it upon thee. Thou art the man. Thou haſt loſt God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe I asked this Queſtion,</hi> viz. <hi>What Pariſh-prieſt in</hi> England
<hi>had got more money with his tongue then</hi> George Fox <hi>ſince he was
Journeyman-Shoomaker in</hi> Mancheſter? <hi>ſhe ſaith,</hi> Thou art a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
ungodly, impudent lyer. Thou lyer. A proud diſdainful ſpirit.
A heatheniſh ſpirit, which torments thee, and many more ſuch night-owls
as thou art. Thou wicked lyer. The devil the God of this world is thy
God, and thou haſt done what thou canſt in oppoſing the Quakers to get
him glory. Thou haſt a great meaſure of the ſpirit of envie, malice, and
cruelty, and bloud.</p>
            <p>Thus far are her expreſſions, whom <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> affirms to be

            <p>Another writes thus:</p>
            <p>Thou oppoſes the truth, and manifeſts thy ſelf to be an enemy of Chriſt
the light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an oppoſer of the Goſpel which is the power of God, of which
power thou art ignorant, and a ſtranger unto. Thou art gone into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,

an enemy and oppoſer of him by deceit and deceivableneſs. Thou
hardens thy heart, and ſtiffens thy neck againſt the Lord, and heaps up
wrath againſt the day of wrath.</p>
            <p>Another writes thus:</p>
            <p>Thou hardens thy ſelf againſt the truth more and more. It hath been
evidently manifeſted that thou art an enemy to God and his truth. Thou
art in thy will worſhip and carnal ordinances, as Baptiſm, and bread and
wine. Thou art vainly puft up with thy fleſhly minde, and art in the ſteps
of the falſe Prophets of old, and the falſe Apoſtles in the days of Chriſt.</p>

thou art more like a ruſtical Door-keeper, to tear off peoples coats off their

teeth like a Lion, a paw like a Bear, and mouth like a Dragons beaſt,
poyſoning the peoples ſouls with thy Sorcery, which makes them to vomit,

               <hi>Viz.</hi> That he will ſeriouſly, and impartially reſolve in himſelf
theſe following Queries.</p>
            <p>1. Whereas it can be found in all the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Queries to conſidered.</note> that any of the true
Prophets, or Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, ever uſed ſuch language as is before
mentioned, to any perſon profeſſing Repentance towards God, and Faith
towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; or whether it be not clearly the fruit of an
Antichriſtian ſpirit, as hath bin hinted.</p>
            <p>2. Whether there can be any other aym in the aforeſaid cenſures, then
to caſt an odium upon, and to cauſe a diſeſteem of the perſon oppoſing them.
And whether this was not the practice of the falſe Prophets, and falſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
of old, thereby to gain more credit to their own cauſe.</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be not a manifeſt abuſe of the Scriptures, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
intruding into the office of Chriſt, poſitively to affirm that the
ſins of any man ſhall never be forgiven in this world, nor in that which is
to come, meerly becauſe he denies that light that is in every man that
comes into the world to be ſaving; In as much as the Scripture no where
ſaith that that light is ſaving.</p>
            <p>4. Whether do not this people cenſure all the men and women in the
world, (as well as the Author of theſe papers) to be out of the firſt ſtep that
leads to Chriſtianity, to be infidels, and to be accurſed, if they deny the
light that is in every man that comes into the world to be ſaving. And
whether is not this aſmuch as to ſay, that they only, and none beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are Chriſtians; And whether is not this a great appearance of
pride in them, thus highly to extol themſelves above all others.</p>
            <p>5. And whether, are not all theſe cenſures directly contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and ſuch as make them lyable to greater Judgment. <hi>Matt.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>6. Whether do not theſe clamours, and evil ſpeakings, for which there

malice, as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31.</p>
            <p>7. Whether any wiſe experienced Chriſtian can judge this people to be
in a perfect ſinleſs eſtate, who appear with theſe open ſinful revilings, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
judgings, in their mouthes. Nay-ſince they boaſt and glory
in this their ſhame; Whether is it not evident that they are ſervants
of Corruption?</p>
            <p>8. Whether this hath not bin their manner all along, to ſtrive to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſince no ſpiritual weapon is yet employed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement

               </gap> badneſs of it, and that as the weapons are carnal, and deviliſh, ſo is
their cauſe ſupported thereby.</p>
            <p>9. Whether it be not abominable wickedneſs to father all their evil
ſpeeches upon the Holy Ghoſt, and to ſay when they curſe, rayle, revile,
ſpeak falſly and frothily, that it is by his inſpiration and command.</p>
            <p>10. Whether can any man rationally conclude, that theſe people beare
any true love to that perſon whom they judge to be an enemy of God, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>curſed, and whoſe ſins ſhall never be forgiven in this world, nor in the
world to come? Or rather, when they profeſs love, and ſay they deſire his
eternal welfare, is not there juſt ground to believe that they ſpeak lyes in
Hypocriſie, as it's ſaid <hi>Apoſtates</hi> ſhould do in the later times, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.

revilings, and may not any man in reaſon conclude, that whom
they judge an enemy of God, and accurſed, they would uſe as ſuch if they
had power.</p>
            <p>12. Laſtly, I leave it to be conſidered, by ſuch as will take the paines
to read the account which I have given of the light within, whether
they do not ſpeak all this evil of me, merely becauſe I have told them the
truth, and not for any other cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
