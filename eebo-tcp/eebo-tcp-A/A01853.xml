            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The Wolfe was Tutor to the Sheep,</l>
               <l>And to amaze a plainer man,</l>
               <l>The thiefe was made the guardian.</l>
               <l>But can a Wolfe forget to prey?</l>
               <l>Can Night be lightned into Day?</l>
               <l>Without reſpect of lawes or blood,</l>
               <l>His charge he makes to be his food.</l>

               <l>Oppreſt, not bonour'd with a Crowne,</l>

               <l>Vengeance and He at once doe wake,</l>
               <l>And on the Wolfe their fury ſlake.</l>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Odovicke Sforza,</hi> after hee had cunningly ſupplanted the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe from the wardſhip of her ſonne <hi>Galeazzo,</hi> as cunningly practizeth to beethe murtherer of him, of whom he would ſeeme to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. To this end he was to remoue this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. <hi>Iſabella</hi> daughter to the Prince of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and Grand-childe vnto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> was wife to <hi>Galeazzo.</hi> A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a ſpirit as high as her birth, and equall to <hi>Sforza</hi> in all things but the ſex: ſhee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſtupidity of her husband, and how that whatſoeuer ſhe proiected for his ſafety, he diſcouered to his vncle, for his ouerthrow, makes her father ſecretly acquainted with all the paſſages, deſiring him to vindicate his ſon in law from the vſurpation of his Protector. This could not be ſo priuately diſpatched, but that <hi>Sforza</hi> had an incling of it, whether out of his owne reach hee gueſſed it: or by his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes ſottiſhneſſe he vnderſtood it. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent then his owne ruine, whilſt he intends his Nephews, he ventures on thoſe remedies which the height of feare rather ruſheth on, then chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb facs="tcp:3375:7"/>
which more expreſſe and exchange, then remoue, or auoyd a danger. He knew the French claime to <hi>Naples,</hi> to the proſecution of which he ſollicites the yong King; whom either his right, or inconſiderateneſſe quickly armes vnto the action. But before his comming, hee by continuall meſſengers deludes the old King, and makes him beleeue that there was no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his comming, and that the French iourney vnto <hi>Naples,</hi> as it was onely the childe of rumor, &amp; had no being but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fame, ſo in a very ſhort ſpace, in the age of a wonder it would vaniſh and expire. Thus was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his neceſſary defence, till hauing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vnderſtood that all defence would be too late, the French being already very ſtrong vpon his frontires, cheated, not conquer'd, hee dyes and leaues his ſonne <hi>Alphonſo</hi> heire of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his troubles. The French King being now entred in perſon into <hi>Italy, Galeazzo</hi> dyes of a poyſon at <hi>Pauia,</hi> when <hi>Sforza</hi> has brought this worſe poyſon into his Country. But the French growing prodigiouſly victorious, and almoſt by the very ſeeing ouer comming their oppoſites, <hi>Sforza</hi> begins to be apprehenſiue of his owne danger, and ſtriues to rid himſelfe of theſe incumbrances, in the which a too much prouidence had intangled him. A conſideration
<pb facs="tcp:3375:7"/>
without doubt neceſſary, but almoſt paſt the ſeaſon, it being neer vnto an impoſſibility to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him now, whom it was far from any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at the firſt not to admit. So that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reſolution did onely proclaime the folly of the firſt, which either in wiſdome hee ſhould not haue ventur'd on, or, in honeſty not haue altred. But howſoeuer, hee enters into a new league with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and giues the French after their victorious returne from <hi>Naples</hi> halfe an ouerthrow at <hi>Taro.</hi> And now when hee thinks himſelfe confirm'd in his Dukedome, when he as little fear'd ruine, as he deſeru'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation; the French King dyes ſuddenly, to whom <hi>Lewis,</hi> the true Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> ſucceeded, with him <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaes</hi> late friend, the <hi>Venetians</hi> conclude a league. Thus <hi>Sforza</hi> being left alone, raiſeth two armies vnder the conduct of the two <hi>Sanſeuerins,</hi> men, whom hee had highly fauour'd and aduanced. But it is ſcarce ſeene, that a faithleſſe Maſter ſhould haue a truſty ſeruant, and hee that hath no reſpect to his owne word, ſhall in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt of his neceſſities, finde all others promiſes but words. The elder reuolts, and the yonger, without the leaſt ſhow of reſiſtance, flyes, and <hi>Sforza</hi> himſelfe is ſo cloſely purſued, that he can ſcarce get away ſafe into <hi>Germany.</hi> The French
<pb facs="tcp:3375:8"/>
abuſing their late victory, the <hi>Millaneſi</hi> with a generall conſent, recall <hi>Sforza;</hi> who, like a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſnow, ouerflowes all before him, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers moſt of his Duchy, with the ſame eaſineſſe that he had loſt it. The ſtrength of his Army conſiſted eſpecially of Swizzers, whom the late ouerthrow of the warlike Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and theſe Italian wars, had raiſed to the height of admiration. But to be valiant is not to haue all vertues: theſe were as ſtrong in treachery, as in battle, they lead <hi>Sforza</hi> in the habite of a Swizzer into the French camp, through which in the ſame habit they had promiſed to conduct him. Thus hauing beene twice betrayd, and now a priſoner, after a ten yeers harſh confining hee dyes in <hi>France,</hi> hauing liu'd in his miſery, longer then in his Duchy, and leauing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſucceeding Princes that height ſhould not be their ayme, but integrity; and that they would not (that I may vſe the words of our Poet) tempt their ſtarres beyond their light.</p>
