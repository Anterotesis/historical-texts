            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of Sir <hi>John Lambert,</hi> Bar. <hi>Samuel Shepheard,</hi> and <hi>John James David,</hi> Merchants of <hi>London.</hi> Humbly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Conſideration of this <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe,</hi> for RELIEF.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>John Lambert,</hi> Bar. <hi>Samuel Shepheard,</hi> and <hi>John James David,</hi> bought of <hi>Henry Bray</hi> and <hi>John Bowden,</hi> Twenty three Tuns and a Quarter, of <hi>French</hi> Prize Wine, taken by the <hi>Succeſs Privateer</hi> of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> lying at <hi>Penryn</hi> near <hi>Falmouth;</hi> and accepted Bills of Exchange for <hi>1050l.</hi> drawn by the Collectors there, for the Cuſtoms thereof; and ſhipped Twenty one Tuns and three Hogſheads of the ſaid Wine, on Board a Coaſter, called <hi>The New Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, William Dair</hi> Maſter, bound for the Port of <hi>London,</hi> who ſailed from <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> with her Majeſty's Tin Veſſels, having for Convoy the <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi> Men of War.</p>
            <p>YET notwithſtanding the Convoy, the ſaid Veſſel called <hi>The New Topſham,</hi> which had on Board Twenty one Tuns, and three Hogſheads of the ſaid Wine, was in the Night, off <hi>Beachy-Head,</hi> taken by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, and carryed into <hi>Calice,</hi> and there ſold.</p>
            <p>WHEREUPON the Merchants above, applyed to be relieved from the Payment of the ſaid Bills of Exchange, becauſe the ſaid Wine never came to Port, but were taken and carryed into <hi>Calice,</hi> and there ſold, as aforeſaid; and therefore did no Ways ſupply the Market, or hinder other Importation, to the Prejudice of Her Majeſty's Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>BUT the Duties of the ſaid Wines being appropriated to the Uſe of the War, they have not been able to obtain further than Time to pray a Bill or Clauſe for their Relief.</p>
            <p rend="indent italic">AND therefore they humbly hope this <hi>Honourable Houſe</hi> will, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Hardſhip of their Caſe, diſcharge the ſaid <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> and not ſuffer them to pay Cuſtom for Goods which never came to Port; or give them Leave to import Wines Cuſtom- Free, to the ſame Value with thoſe loſt, as is allowed where Goods are export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that never reach their Port, in which Caſe, the Merchant hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſuffered to export Cuſtom-Free, to the ſame Value.</p>
