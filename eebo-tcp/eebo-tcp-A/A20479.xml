            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was (when I had ouer read and well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same) maruellously rauished, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly wished, it hadde bene published in our vulgare tong, that many others might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. Bycause (as me thinketh) it is both noble and pleasaunt, as well for the noueltie of the Historie, as also for the varietie and stile, which is right propre, and such one as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth, and chiefly belongeth to a very good Historian: wherein is shewed the vncertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fortune, whiche maruellously may serue and helpe to read, and consider the worldly happes heretofore, to great Kings, Princes, and Nobles chaunced, who sometime were in great dignitie and had high authoritie, and wonderful prosperitie. Wherby in seeing (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great felicitie and maruellous prosperitie) the straunge aduersitie and miserie whiche happened them, and the continual chaunge of their estates and aduentures: may more and
<pb facs="tcp:10248:3"/>
more be vnderstood the instabilitie and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of wordly matters. And chiefly in those great and honorable personages, the successors of <hi>Alexander the great,</hi> by whome is most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the inconstancie of all things subiect to alteration and chaunge: and where Fortune (to speake after the vulgare opinion) hath best shewed the power, and auctoritie. Whiche Booke when I hadde finished, I aduised me to what honorable and Martiall personage I might fitliest addresse it. And as I aboade in this imagination, I at last called to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance your late noble progenitor, who in facts of warre and Martiall pollicies, surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in these our dayes the more parte of this noble Realme of Englande. And forthwith considering, that your honoure is he, who in those noble vertues, rightly representeth the very liuely Image of your most noble progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and also vnderstanding your affabilitie
<pb facs="tcp:10248:4"/>
and naturall inclination to all suche as haue delight therein: I am therefore (all these things considered) the rather enboldened, to take on hande to dedicate this the firste fruite of my trauell vnto your honour: Most humbly beseching the same that it woulde vouchsafe to take in worth, thys small present and gifte, and to consider rather the harte and good will of the giuer (who desireth nothing more than to do you seruice agreable) than the value or qualitie of the present, very small, and in a rude stile, to dedicate vnto so Noble a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. And bycause the sayd <hi>Claude</hi> of <hi>Seis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell</hi> would not that this sayde Historie shoulde remayne imperfect, to leaue the Reader in doubt of the ende and issue of the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne by <hi>Antigone</hi> the great and <hi>Demetre</hi> his sonne, against al the rest of the Kings and Princes successors of <hi>Alexander</hi> in those dayes, somewhat touched in the beginning of

the third Boke by the sayd <hi>Diodore,</hi> he hath therefore taken out of the wise <hi>Plutarche,</hi> the remnaunte, in the life of <hi>Demetre</hi> vnto his death, in whose tyme were almoste all the great and notable factes of warre (worthie memorie) exployted and done. Wherefore in reuoluing the sayd Historie with iudgement, and to the ende it is translated, there may (in my opinion) some commoditie and profit be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued. For as touching the course of worldly things, may be sene the Stratagemes and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies in the facts of war, togither many sundry and diuerse battailles, sieges and enterprises, verie pleasaunt to read and heare: wherein may also be lerned many things apperteyning to that arte.

               <p>Not long before <hi>Alexander</hi> died, he purposed to cal home againe al the exiles and bannished men of the Cities of <hi>Grece,</hi> and restore them to their mansion places and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses, thinking that that woulde greatly redound to his honour and fame: and therby he might haue a number of men in euery citie to be his Pertisannes or garde, if the rest at any time tooke in hande or enterprised any mutany or would reuolt. Wherfore he seyng the time of the <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad</hi> at hand, he sent thether <hi>Nicanor</hi> the <hi>Stagerite</hi> with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, conteyning the edict of the sayde restitution straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charging and commaunding him in the ende of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make proclamation by the sounde of the Trumpets victors of the said letters: which thing he speedily did. The tenor of which letters hereafter ensue.</p>

               <p>When these letters had ben proclaymed and red, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therof were maruelous glad.

                  <hi>Etholians</hi> feared to be plagued for the oultrage they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted against <hi>Eniade,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they chased &amp; expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their land, knowing for certain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the king had sworne that not only his neuewes &amp; others descending from his line, but also the exiles and bannished them selues woulde be reuenged for the iniurie done to him.

But bicause it lay not in them to resist the powre of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they endured the case, always awayting oportunitie, which in the end at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares happened them.

For <hi>Leosthenes</hi> at his pleasure, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the sayde men of warre, so that he had gotten a bande of valiaunte and lustie Souldiers and of great experience, bycause they had serued in many sundry &amp; notable warres in <hi>Asia.</hi> All this was done, before there came any sure knowledge of the death of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after certayn which came from <hi>Babilon,</hi> had giuen it out that they sÃ©e him dead, the <hi>Athenians</hi> arrered open warres, and sent immediatly to <hi>Leosthenes</hi> some part of <hi>Harpale</hi> his money, together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great stoare of Armoure &amp; weapon, willing him no longer to dissemble the matter, but openly to beginne to warre, as to hym should sÃ©eme for the best.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Leosthenes</hi> had receyued the money, he then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, payde al his souldiers their wages, aswell the vnarmed as the armed, and so marched on into the countrey of the <hi>Etholians,</hi> to the intent they might ioyne with him, whom they right thanfully receyued, and with great courage accorded his request, &amp; there vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him seuen thousande Souldiers.

And first by force they tooke the Citie of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi> and killed all the men and made portsale of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faunts and yong children. But bycause the Citie of the <hi>Isaurians</hi> was strong and throughly manned to hold out the enimy: after they had two dayes besieged it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of their Souldiers were lost they (seing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisens wel furnished of all things for the defence thereof, &amp; fully determined to maintayne it to death) retired: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, after thrÃ©e dayes past, they agayne approched the wals and gaue a fresh assault, which the Citisens to their great losse, manfully defended: wherfore being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> disfurnished of able men for the manning of their wals, rampiers and Bulwarks, they purposed an honorable fact &amp; worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>

houses on fire, which being on a light and the flame issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out on euery side, they cast in all their mouable goodes, and all other things which any way might be profitable or gaynefull to the enimy: whereat <hi>Perdicas</hi> greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, commaunded his Souldiers to enuiron the Towne, and gyue the attempt to the wals, but the Townesmen so valiaunly defended the curten, that they ones agayne repulsed the assaylaunts. Then <hi>Perdicas</hi> much more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, enquired the cause why they so couragiously stoode to the defence of the Citie, considering they had burnt both their houses and goods. But after <hi>Perdicas</hi> had retiered his Souldiers from the assault, the <hi>Isaurians</hi> threwe them selues into the fier, and so were buried in their houses with their friends and familiers.</p>

But bycause the excellencie of the workmanship was sumptuous and singuler agÃ©eing with the state of so honourable a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage as <hi>Alexander,</hi> both for the infinite charge &amp; dispence of many Talents, as also for the singularitie and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof: me thinke it not much from the purpose to staie a while in describing and setting forth the maner and order of the same.</p>
               <p>First, a Coffin was forged and beaten out of fine golde, portured and made according to the stature and bignes of the body, verie full of swÃ©ete spices and many other droogs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10248:22"/>
aromatike, aswell for swÃ©etenesse as also for preseruing the body from corruption. The couer wherewith it was couered, well proporcioned and made, fitted to the same, was a fingers thicknesse of golde, curiously and artificially wrought. Ouer that was cast a purple cloth, curiously enbroidered, and wrought with golde with most excellent deuises, standing vpright like a brouche, whereon was hanged the armoure of the dead, to the ende, that all the whole worke standing together, shoulde represent the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his noble actes and inuincible courage. After that was brought out the Chariot whereon the Coffin shoulde be carried, couered with a tabernacle of gold, rered and set vp in maner of a vault, garnished and set within with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious stones &amp; Iewels, eight cubits broad, &amp; twelue cubits long, vnder the same rouffe besides the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe thereof was a place of a state or Throne Imperiall foure square, by which stood a certein kind of beastes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one halfe of them like hartes, and the other parte like goates, thrusting out their forepartes, excellently engrauen and wrought in golde, with great collers of golde about their necks, whereat hong the scutchins of the armes of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> such as customably are borne at hie solemne feasts, pictured and couloured with most rich and orient colours. In the toppes of euery the corners of the place of a state was a valence finely wrought like a net, whereat hong great belles, the noyse of which were heard far of. And at euery corner of the Tabernacle stood a statue or Image of a Goddesse victor, all of golde, bearing a Trophe in hir hande in token of victory. The same vaulted Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle also was supported with small pillers of golde, whose toppes were enbost and enameled like the curious Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Iony.</hi> Betwixt the Pillers was a square netting of golde, whereat hong foure Tables all of a bignesse, at euery corner one, of egall distaunce one from an other, wherein were grauen and artificially wrought diuerse pictures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10248:23"/>In the first was depainted a Charriot vpon whiche sate <hi>Alexander,</hi> holding a Scepter in his hand, royally appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, garded with a bande of <hi>Macedonians</hi> all in armes, &amp; an other of <hi>Persians</hi> called <hi>Portpomes</hi> likewise armed, before whom went the Esquiers for the body.</p>
               <p>In the second table were grauen the Elephants which came after the armed men, appointed as if they shold haue bene led to the warres with their Captaynes and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours on their backs: to say, on the side before <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp; on the side behind <hi>Macedonians,</hi> all apparelled and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they were wont to be in the warres.</p>
               <p>In the third were pictured and grauen the battails and troupes of horsemen as if they had ben ready to fight.</p>
               <p>In the fourth were set forth the whole Nauie of ships, all apparelled and furnished ready to gyue battaill. At the entre of the Tabernacle were two Lions of golde, sitting as if they marked those which entred.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by little and little vp to the toppes.

In the middest, betwixt the two AxeltrÃ©es was a rounde pole fastened in the middest of the Tabernacle, by such artificiall meane, that neyther it, nor the place of estate or throne which stood vppon the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, being dryuen ouer Hils and Dales, euer weaued or

               <p>When <hi>Eumenes</hi> vnderstood his enimies to be at hande, he mustered his men, and arranged them in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taill, but chiefly his horsemen, in whome lay all his hope of victorie, bycause he knew right well his footemen were neuer able to abide the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange.</p>

And <hi>Eumenes</hi> had of sundry Nations xx. thousande foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and about v. thousand horse, with which he thought to gyue the first charge: whereupon he deuided his horse into two wings, and caused them to troup before the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang. <hi>Cratere</hi> likewise with his horse first encountred <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and fighting there valiauntly, was in the prease o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen and smothered.

Then the two Captaynes, which both by their horses and other signes &amp; tokens knew one another, encountered body to body, and with great courage, fel &amp; angry moode, valiauntly fought: which fight was cause of victory, for after they had a while buskled and fought together with their swordes, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke hold of their bridles, and wrestled on horseback, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by playne force to ouerthowe one another. But as they were thus wrestling, their horses drewe backe, &amp; they both fell to the ground, which fal was such, that neyther of them (by reason of the heauinesse of their armour) coulde well recouer their selues. Howbeit, <hi>Eumenes</hi> first reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his fÃ©ete, and comming with his sworde in his hande towardes <hi>Neoptolome,</hi> gaue him such a blowe, that he cut his hamme strings cleane asunder, whereby he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. But his harte which supported the imbecillity of his body was such, that he recouered his knÃ©es and defending him selfe manfully, wounded his enimy on the hande and on both his thighes: notwithstanding, him selfe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bled, and bycause the wounds he gaue <hi>Eumenes</hi> were neither dÃ©epe nor deadly, <hi>Eumenes</hi> at the next encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tre so viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly strake him on the head, that he yelded the ghost.

albeit on eyther side was great slaughter, yet woulde they not gyue ouer vntil <hi>Neoptolome</hi> his death was knowen, and then the horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> gaue ouer and retired towards their Phalange as to their garde and place of suerty.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Eumenes</hi> had considered that he had wonne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ynough in obtayning victory, and especially that he had gotten the bodies of two his chiefest enimies, he caused to sound the retraict.

Who taking the appointment &amp; league confirmed by their othes, prayed they might go to the next villages to prouide them of victuals: whereunto be agrÃ©ed.

But sÃ©eing (what for their manly &amp; noble courages, and also for the dolor and anguishe whiche he felt of his wounds) that he nothing preuayled, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly retired.

For they all which were with him, singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well loued him, bycause that he after <hi>Perdicas</hi> his death,
<pb facs="tcp:10248:33"/>
hauing no trustie Companions or allies in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Asie,</hi> determined by gifts and curtesie to drawe the <hi>Pisides</hi> to his friendship, thinking thereby to get a warlike nation to be at his commaundement, and a countrey very strong and hard to be entred, being full of many inuincible castles and fortes. For this cause in al his warres honored he them more than the rest: and of euery spoyle and butin which he got of any enimies, the moetie he gaue to them. He was very familiar amongs them, dayly inuiting of the chief and principall to dynner or supper, sometime one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while an other: rewarding them also particularly with diuerse and many gifts, as those in whose friendship and alliaunce he reposed his finall trust and confidence: wherein he was nothing at all deceyued, as then appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For as <hi>Antigone</hi> with his whole power encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the towne, and demaunded nothing else but <hi>Alcete,</hi> notwithstanding that the auncient Burgesses of the Citie were of one determinate minde to deliuer him, yet the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie yong gallaunts and Souldiers, against the willes and minds of their owne fathers, concluded and agrÃ©ed rather than to render so noble and worthy a man of warre, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and sustayne all mischiefs and daungers whatsoeuer. But when the auncient Burgesses sÃ©e that neyther coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saill, or reason, could persuade to the contrary, they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an other deuise. Wherefore they secretly in the night aduertised <hi>Antigone</hi> by their intelligencers, that they would deliuer <hi>Alcete</hi> alyue or dead. For accomplishing wherof they willed him after a while to approch the town and make some skirmishes and false Alarmes, and sodenly to retier as though they fled, which woulde be a meane to cause all the lusty young Gallaunts and Souldiers to sally out vpon them, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they being in the skirmishe busied, the rest within would assault <hi>Alcete,</hi> being disfurnished of his said companions, and with ease take him. Whiche thing according to their demaund and request, <hi>Antigone</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For while the yong and lusty Souldiers were salied
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10248:33"/>
out of the towne to skyrmish and chase the enimy: the old men with their sclaues and other lustie fellowes (no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of warre) assailed <hi>Alcete</hi> in his lodging: but alyue they could not get him. For he sÃ©eing the present daunger wherin he was, kild him selfe, rather than he would be rendred aliue to the enimy. Notwithstanding, they layd him dead on a beare couered ouer with a most vile robe, &amp; so carried him through the gates of the towne to <hi>Antigone,</hi> before the yong blouds in the skirmish knew of it. By this meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient Citizens saued their Citie from desolation and spoyle. But after the Souldiers vnderstood thereof, they (for the great loue they bare him) were so agrÃ©eued and angry, that they kept one parte of the towne and held a counsaill, wherein they first concluded and agrÃ©ed to set fier on the towne, and after to gette them out in armes to pille and destroye <hi>Antigone</hi> his countreis hard adioyning to the foote of the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>taynes. Howbeit, after they tooke better aduise than to burne the towne, but gotte them out in armes wasting and spoyling the greatest parte of the playne countrey of the enimy. After <hi>Antigone</hi> had gotten <hi>Alcete</hi> his body, he dyd him all the opprobries he knewe or could deuise, and in the ende of thrÃ©e dayes after, it began to corrupt, he threw it into the fields without buriall, and so departed from <hi>Piside.</hi> Howbeit, the lustie yong Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launts of <hi>Thormese</hi> tooke him vp and honorably enterred the dead.

Notwithstanding, he sent his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours towards <hi>Aride,</hi> declaring to him that he had done verie yll to besiege a frÃ©e Citie of <hi>Grece,</hi> and friend to the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> considering the people thereof had in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abused him, and that he had shewed inough to make him selfe of a Deputie and Gouernour a Potentate and commaunder, commaunding him therefore to gyue ouer his said <hi>Satrapie,</hi> and for his habitation to betake him to one onely Citie. When <hi>Aride</hi> vnderstoode the charge of the Ambassadours, he greatly detesting the arrogancie of <hi>Antigone,</hi> aunswered, that he was not as yet determined to leaue his <hi>Satrapie,</hi> but to kÃ©epe and defend it: and if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigone</hi> would come to expulse him, he should then sÃ©e whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had the better right. After the Ambassadours had receyued this answere and were departed, he soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortified and furnished his Cities and townes. He also sent to <hi>Nore</hi> a bande of Souldiers, to <hi>Eumenes</hi> vnder the leading of one of his owne Captaynes, thinking therby to winne his fauoure and be his confederate. When <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone</hi> had receyued aunswere from <hi>Aride,</hi> he sent one half of his army against him, and him selfe with the rest, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed into <hi>Lydie</hi> to chase out <hi>Clyte</hi> Gouernour thereof. But so soone as <hi>Clyte</hi> vnderstood the cause, he garrisoned his Cities, and made as good prouision against him as he could. That done, he immediatly went to Sea, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freted into <hi>Macedone,</hi> signifying to the Kings, the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Antigone,</hi> &amp; saied that he went about to aduaunce him selfe to some high and honorable estate, and to rebell against them: praying therefore aide for the repressing of him.</p>

For first he considered, that he being a straunger, the gouernement of a realme and so princelie an astate was vnmÃ©ete &amp; not apperteyning vnto him: and that those whome he should gouerne were <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and had condempned him to death: and that al the Captaynes and Gouernours of the Prouinces were honorable personages, and of hie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and pretended great and waightie enterprises. Wherefore he suspected, that if he shoulde take vpon him so great a charge, they woulde contemne him being a straunger, and thereby he shoulde get great enimitie, and alwayes stand in daunger of losing his life. For he knew well, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> woulde in no wyse be at his commaundement, bicause they reputed him a meane man, and much inferior to them, and therefore rather thought that he should be subiect to them, than they to him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all these things considered, he declared to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes and Souldiers, that first, where it had pleased the Kings by their letters to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t him for his reliefe .v. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents, he highlie thanked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, but vtterlie refused the receipt thereof: saying, he nÃ©eded not so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and gift, since he affected neyther Empire or domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: nor to haue any suche charge was his desire, but that by the letters of the kings he was commaunded to do it: neyther was he able any longer to abide the labors &amp; trauails of warre, bycause he was now sore broosed and lame: doing them farther to wete, that he looked not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

to attayne to any principalitie, considering he was a straunger and not a <hi>Macedonian.</hi> He also affirmed, that in his slÃ©epe he see such a vision, that him thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be manifested to them, forasmuch as in his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t it might be an helpe to vnitie and concord, and also very profitable to the common wealth. He thought in his slÃ©epe, that <hi>Alexander</hi> appeared to him as if he had bene alyue: and in the same robes which he commaunded all his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Captaynes, and ministred the Lawes appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Empire. Wherefore quod he) I thinke it good that of the kings treasure a Throne imperiall be forged &amp; made of golde, and thereupon to be placed and set the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or image of <hi>Alexander</hi> crouned, holding a Scepter as he did in his life time. And that all the Princes and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes shall euery morning assemble there, and after the sacrifice finished, to sit in counsaill of the affaires of the warres: and whatsoeuer is concluded on, to take it as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said <hi>Alexander:</hi> which thing was thought good by all the assistauntes, and they all out of hand caused the said deliberacion to be executed, and forged a statue or ymage: bycause in the treasurie of the kings was great stoare of golde and siluer: Whereupon within few dayes after, an image was enstalled in a Throne Imperial with a Diademe, Scepter and other kinglie robes. About the same was an Aulter rered vp, and fire layed thereon, of which all the Captaynes tooke coales, and put them in Censures of golde, wherewith they encensed the Statue with swÃ©ete and precious smelles, making sacrifice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as vnto God. After the sacrifice was done, stooles and formes were brought, whereon sat all the noble Princes and valiaunt Captaynes, consulting of the incident affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. In doing whereof <hi>Eumenes</hi> tooke vpon him no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or title of Gouernour, but shewed him in all points egall to them, and through curteons and gentle language, was voide of all grudge and hatred, and gotte the good willes of all the Captaynes. Moreouer, bycause of the
<pb facs="tcp:10248:42"/>
superstition they vsed towardes the statue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> they hoped to prosper as if some God had gouerned and guyded them. And vsing the same humanitie towards the <hi>Argiraspides Macedonians,</hi> they highly estÃ©emed him and accomted him worthie the charge and gouernement of the affaires of the kings. This done, he sent his principall and wisest friends to assemble and wage other Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Souldiers, appointing large sallarie and entretaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

their gouernour, and <hi>Olympias, Alexander</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had writen to the contrarie, that they shoulde obey <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and to whome they shoulde gyue whatsoeuer he demaunded, as to the Lieutenaunt generall of the kings, hauing full power and authoritie.

<pb facs="tcp:10248:43"/>
By this meane and persuasion they whiche came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traye <hi>Eumenes,</hi> were frustrate of their enterprise.

                  <pb facs="tcp:10248:46"/>DUring the time that these matters were done in <hi>Asia, Antigone</hi> had sent <hi>Cassander</hi> with .xxxv. tall warlike gallies, and foure thousand souldiours to saile into <hi>Pire:</hi> whom <hi>Nichanor</hi> captaine of the Castle, receiued and rendred to him the port and castle. But as for <hi>Munichie Nicanor</hi> garded and helde that with his owne garrison. When <hi>Polispercon</hi> who abode and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>Phocide,</hi> vnderstoode that <hi>Cassander</hi> had taken and enioyed <hi>Pire,</hi> he came into the Countrey of <hi>Athens,</hi> and encamped before <hi>Pire,</hi> with twentie thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> and foure thousand straungers and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and thrÃ©e score and fiue Elephantes, and besieged the same. But sÃ©eing the scarcitie and want of victuals, and the siege like long to continue, he left behind at the siege such number of Soldiours as the Countrey might wel vittell, deputing for his lieuetenant <hi>Alexander</hi> his sonne, and him selfe with the rest, being the greater number, entred <hi>Peloponess,</hi> to the ende to force the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitanes</hi> to come vnder the obeisaunce of the Kings, being greatly enclined to <hi>Cassander,</hi> and the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Oligarchie:</hi> to say, the gouernement of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particular offices and dignities which <hi>Antipater</hi> had appointed them. While <hi>Polispercon</hi> was about this enterprise, <hi>Cassander</hi> with his Nauie hauing alliaunce with the <hi>Eginets,</hi> went and besieged the Citie of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> his enimie: And euery day with shot, whereof he had foyson, assaulteth the town, bringing them in great hazarde and feare. And being almost in despaire, aide came from <hi>Polispercon</hi> bothe by sea and land. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Cassander</hi> was so daunted, that he raised his siege and returned to <hi>Pire.</hi> After that <hi>Polispercon</hi> meaning to set and order and stay about the affaires of <hi>Peloponese,</hi> assembled before him the Deputies of all the Cities: whom with gentle and gratious woordes he allured to ioyne with him, and afterward sent his Ambassadoures to all the Cities, commaunding them that they should

sodainely kill all the gouernors appointed by <hi>Ptolome,</hi> and restore the gouernement to the people. Which commaundement the people incontinently obeyed, so that there were great slaughters and banishmentes throughout the Cities of the friends of <hi>Antipater.</hi> Then the commonaltie being restored to libertie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ioyned with <hi>Polispercon.</hi> And bicause the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolitames</hi> would not obey, but still sticke to <hi>Cassander, Polispercon</hi> fully determined to besiege them. When they vnderstood his meaning and purpose, they inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently caused all their goodes in the Countrey to be brought into their towne, and after mustered and tooke viewe of their people, which were of Citizens and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers, about fiftene thousand besides their slaues, all able men, and deuided them into two bandes: whereof some made rampiers and other workes, some manned the walles, so that at one instant they were all busied and occupied: One companie ditched about the Towne, an other companie carried woode and earth out of the fieldes to make the Rampiers, other repaired and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the walles where they were any thing at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, some forged harnaies and engines of Artillarie, and on this sort was all the whole Citie occupied, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that euery one was minded, and disposed thereto, for so muche as the power which came against them, were men of inuincible courages, and the Elephantes of great violence and might. Not long after that they had brought all things into a readinesse and perfection, <hi>Polispercon</hi> with his whole armie arriued before the same, and on both sides besieged it. On the one side en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and on the other side his allyes and straungers. He builded also many Towers of woode, hygher than the curten and wall, and planted them in places conuenient, and thrust into them Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioures, with verie great plentie of shotte or slings, who stoutly fought with them which manned the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,

Which thyng <hi>Eumenes</hi> perceyuing, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing he went about to win the souldiers fauours to bÃ©e made generall, and to obtaine the principalitie, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited &amp; forged certaine false and surmised letters, by whiche he animated the Souldiers to warre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he soone abated <hi>Penceste</hi> his audacitie and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought him self into greater authoritie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in whome also the men of warre had greate hope and confidence. The contents of the letters were these: How that <hi>Olympias</hi> had brought the yong sonne of <hi>Alexander</hi> into <hi>Macedone,</hi> had slayne <hi>Caslander,</hi> and peaceably enioyed the realm. And that <hi>Polispercon,</hi> with the greatest parte of the armie royall and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes, was gone into <hi>Asie,</hi> to war on <hi>Antigone,</hi> &amp; was already in <hi>Cappadoce.</hi> Whiche letters. were written in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue, subscribed in the name of <hi>Oronte Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapa</hi> of <hi>Armenie, Penceste</hi> his great friend, and therfore bare the more credit. Then <hi>Eumenes</hi> caused them to be caried to all the <hi>Satrapes</hi> and captaines to be sÃ©ene, and after published them to the whole armie. By reason of whiche letters, all the host then thought that <hi>Eumenes</hi> might aduaunce to the kings whome he woulde, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe those he hated. And the more to put and kÃ©epe in terrour and feare suche as were disobedient and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of authoritie, he called to iudgement <hi>Sybirte, Satra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> of <hi>Aracose,</hi> and great friend to <hi>Pencest,</hi> whome he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, saying that he had sent some of his horse against the <hi>Aracothes,</hi> without knowledge of the assemble and counsel, and therfore required that he might be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10248:59"/>
and all his treasure and goodes confiscate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he put him in such perill and danger, that if he had not secretly fled, he had bene slaine by the multitude of the Souldiers. Notwithstandyng, after he had by that meane put the other in feare, and recouered his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, he returned to his accustomed humanitie and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and through faire wordes and large promises he reconciled <hi>Penceste,</hi> and made hym readie and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to employ his seruice in the affaires of the Kings. And to assure him self of the other <hi>Satrapies,</hi> chieftains &amp; captaines, and to haue some maner guage of them, to serue in steade of hostages, he fained the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, praying euery of them to lend him as much as they coulde spare, for the affaires of the kings. Whiche they did, so that he borowed of those whom he chiefly suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the iust summe of .CCCC. talents. By which mean he thought him so sure of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that they would not work him any falshode or treason, nor yet once steppe asyde from him, whom he after kept &amp; reserued for the garde and defence of his person and his fautours, in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires whatsoeuer.</p>

But the left wing or rerewarde which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to amuse the right wing or voward of the enimie he caused to march straight and close together. Howbeit, after they approched, and the trumphets sounded to battail, the horsmen with <hi>Python,</hi> seing no greter power against them, and they more in numbre and farre better moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the enimie, kept not the order of amusing them,
<pb facs="tcp:10248:63"/>
according as they were appointed, but stoutely shewed their corages. And bicause that in the fronte of that wing or voward were the elephantes, whiche they thought not good to assayle, they wheled about. And after they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Elephantes, they charged them on the flanke, in which they slew and hurt with their shotte and launces a great numbre, and the enimy no way could hurt them, by reason they were so heauyly armed, that they were neuer able to pursue them, nor yet saue them selues when they were charged. When <hi>Eumenes</hi> sÃ©e that, he called oute the lightest horsses in <hi>Eudame</hi> his bande, whiche were in the right wing or vowarde, and a certain numbre of footemen lightly armed, and charged the sayde <hi>Python,</hi> and by little and little brought on the Elephantes in the same wing or vowarde, &amp; by that meane incontinente he put the enimie to flight, and chased them harde to the foote of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, during which fight, the two battailes of footemen fought long together, where many men were wounded and killed, but in the ende <hi>Eumenes</hi> phalang wanne the victorie, through the vertue and prowes of the <hi>Argiras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides Macedonians,</hi> all olde trained Souldiers, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes bene in many aduentures and daungers, and thereby became so valiaunt and hardie, that fewe or none were able to abide their force, as clearely by them then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: For being not passyng .iij. thousande men, theyr bande was the bulwarke and strength of the whole armie, and therfore placed in the fronte of the battaile, as theyr chief strength. When <hi>Antigone</hi> sÃ©e his lefte wing or rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward put to flight, and his whole phalang turne the back, and heard his friends counsell him to make to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to put in order his men which were fled, yet would he not: but with the bande of horse about him, he so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe, and vsed the oportunitie of the mountayne, that he both saued his fled men, and also wanne the honor of the fielde. For after he sÃ©e that the <hi>Argiraspides</hi> and the rest of <hi>Eumenes</hi> footemen, had subsecuted and chased his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10248:63"/>
Souldiers vnto the foote of the hill, and had therby broken their aray, and were diuided, he straightways charged the flanke of <hi>Eumenes</hi> right wing or vowarde, which <hi>Eudame</hi> ledde, and put them al to flight, bicause that where as they thought before the victorie had ben theirs, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so sodenly charged, they became so amazed, that many of them were slaine. Then <hi>Antigone</hi> forthwith sent out certain of his light horse to staye the fled foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and retire them to the foote of the Mountaine, which was speedely done, and there he put them againe in order of battail. When <hi>Eumenes</hi> vnderstoode that his right wing or vowarde vnder the conduct of <hi>Eudame</hi> was put to flight, he caused to sounde the retraict, and sent out aide to retire the rest which had the enimie in chase. When both the Chieftaynes by this meane had retired their fledde Souldiours, they somewhat before night got them together, and againe put them in order of battaile: both generals, Captaynes and Souldiers, on either side were so obstinate &amp; fierce. And althoughe it drew to night immediatly after, yet it was so very faire &amp; clÃ©ere, that they might sÃ©e (by reason the Moone was at the full) one another. And besides, the armies were so nÃ©ere the one the other, that they might on both sides heare the neighing of horses, and clattering of armours, that euerie man would haue thought they had ben together by the eares. But being passed aboue thirtie furlonges beyond the place where the battaill was fought, and that the dead laye: about midnight the Souldiers on eyther side all weried and tyered, what with their trauaill sustained in the battaill, as also op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with hunger and thirst, desired they might pitch their camp without any moe blowes. And althoughe <hi>Eumenes</hi> did all that in him was, to persuade them to returne to the place where the dead laye, to the ende to bury them, which was the whole honour of the field, yet could he not bring them vnto it, but all with one

voyce cried, to returne to their Campe and cariages: Wherefore he was forced to agrÃ©e thereto, bycause he was not of that power and authoritie there to chastise and rebuke them: for that many of the Chieftaynes there thought them his egal: and therfore was no time conuenient to vse correction and punishment. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigone</hi> being chief of his armie, after the retire of the enimie into their camp, enforced his Souldiours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their camp and pitch it where the battaill was fought. And by that meane being Lorde of the fielde, to bury the dead, he wan the honour of the fielde, although in the rest he had no whit the better: for there were on his part slaine aboue .iij. thousand .vj. hundred footemen,<note place="margin">

After <hi>Antigone</hi> was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the battaill, and perceyued his Souldiours greatly discouraged, he determined to retire from the enimie: and to the ende he might the spÃ©edylier marche with them, he sent all his hurt men and baggage into a Citie nÃ©ere hand. And after he had about the dawning of the daye buried the dead on his part, he detayned the Herault whiche was come to enterre the bodies of the enimie, and commaunded his Souldiours presently to suppe. When the day was past and night come, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Herault, gyuyng leaue the next daye in the morning to bury the dead. That night remoued he hys camp, and with his armie so hasted, that by morning he had gotten farre inough of the enimie, and lodged hym in <hi>Gamarge</hi> in the region of <hi>Mede</hi> by <hi>Pyton</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a countrey well victualed, and very singular for an armie.</p>

Which was very honorably done. In doing whereof happened a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sodaine thing, and to the <hi>Grekes</hi> very straunge. For after that <hi>Cete</hi> Captayne of the <hi>Indians</hi> had in that battaile ben slaine, two of his wyues which he brought out with him in the same warres, being there, the one newly married, the other many yeares before, shewed the great and excessiue loue they bare him. But first you must vnderstand, that the lawe sometime amongs the <hi>Indians</hi> was, that all or at the least the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts &amp; mariages were by the willes and agreements of the maried made, without asking the consents either of fathers or mothers, whereby oftentimes happened, that many yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g people being neyther like nor matches, for a little light fantasticall loue, married togethers, &amp; so soone after repented. Through whiche sufferaunce, many incontinent and light Dames, made loue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came familiar with others, and bicause that with their honesties they could not forsake their first husbandes, they would poyson them: for in the same Countrey are great stoare of all kindes of poyson which spÃ©edely will do it: and especially there are such vehement poysons, that if they but come nÃ©ere the meat whiche is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or the dishes wherein it lieth, the meat straight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth mortall. And bycause this was a common practise and chaunced ofte, and that many husbands by this meane died, to the ende that the wyues being in such cases attainted might be punished, they made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall lawe, that when the husbande died, if the wyfe were not with childe or had borne him one, she shoulde be burned with him. And they that refused to be burnt, were reputed and taken for whoores and vile women, and neuer after to be married, nor yet receyued with

the honest and vertuous Dames and Matrones to thi administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of their sacrifices or other publique mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. By reason of which lawe, the wicked dÃ©ede before so common amongs the naughtie wyues in poysoning their husbands, was now conuerted all to the contrary. For they considering the necessitie and straightnesse of the lawe, and the shame and dishonour to such as refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the accomplishing thereof, were not onlye carefull for the lyues of their husbands whereon theirs depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but also when it happened any their husbandes to die, the wyues would be at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trouersy (if he had many) which of them shoulde haue that glorie and honour, as then chaunced, for the lawe woulde that one should be burnte, and bycause there were two, eyther of them pleaded hir cause before the Chieftaynes and Captay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the armie to haue the glorie. The yonger woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> saide, that the other was with childe, wherefore by the lawe it was not laufull she should be burnt: the elder said, that since she was the auncienter, she most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the honour. In the end the Commissioners appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the hearing and determining of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> controuersie, enformed by the report of the Matrones, that the elder was with childe, iudged the yonger to be perferred: Wherewith the other sore agrÃ©eued, with great lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

But before the fire was put to hir, all the armie thrice marched about the stake in armes: whiche done, she embraced the body of hir husband hard by hir, and so without either sighe or grone was burnt.

               <p>And firste in the left battaill (where he him selfe ment to fight) he placed two hundred of the choysest horsse within the camp, which alwayes attended about him: amongs whome were his chief and principall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitours and friends, and the same <hi>Python</hi> also who had serued amongs <hi>Alexander</hi> his men at armes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had <hi>Antigone</hi> gyuen him the principall charge and conduct of the armie with <hi>Demetre.</hi> In the front of that he placed thrÃ©e bandes of horsse like vnto a bulwark, and on eche side as many: and without from the battaill to the wings he placed thrÃ©e other bandes of <hi>Tarentines,</hi> so that about and nÃ©ere his persone he had .v. hundred laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and an hundred <hi>Tarentines.</hi> After the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he placed about eight hundred horsse called the Companions or Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. And next to them about a thousande horsse of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse Nations: and before the whole front of that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taill he placed .xxx.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10248:95"/>In the right side adioyning to the Phalange he placed the rest of the horsse to the numbre of a thousand and .v. hundred vnder the leading of <hi>Andronike,</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that when he shoulde come to fight, to slippe by and not to come on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> front, but to stay and delaye the battaill, attending and diligentlie marking what the other poincte woulde doe. He placed moreouer the .xiij. Elephantes which remayned, before the Phalange or maine battaill, and betwene them an other companie of light armed footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. In this order arra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ged <hi>Demetre</hi> his battailles. But before <hi>Ptolome</hi> &amp; <hi>Seleuke</hi> knew <hi>Demetre</hi> his order, they had stronglie appointed and well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed their left corner. But after they were by their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pials aduertised of the order of the enimie, they altered and chaunged theirs, and ordered their battails as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>First they placed in their right corner all their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall force to encountre the battaill wherein <hi>Demetre</hi> was. On the other side in the left corner were .iij. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsse, and the two Chieftayns. Before them went a great numbre of men which carried great store of iron poles, tied to iron chaines, prepared like an haie against the violence of the enimies Elephantes, which was an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t deuise easelie to staie &amp; repulse the Elephants. And by them they placed a great numbre of shot to hurt and galle the saide beastes and their Gouernours. The rest of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they arraunged as to them best sÃ©emed, in the middest of the right poinct and at the wings, and in this order with great shoutes and cries beganne to marche one against an other. And firste the horssemen whiche were in the vttermost places of the poinctes beganne to charge, so that on eche side was a stout fight. Howbeit from the beginning the <hi>Demetrians</hi> dyd vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntest and had the better: but shortlie after they which were in the opposite began so lustely to charge and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironne the old battaill wherein <hi>Demetre</hi> was, that the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10248:95"/>
fight on eche side (by reason of the readinesse and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntnesse of the Souldiours) waxed hoat and terrible, in so muche that at the first encountrie they brake well nÃ©ere all their launces, in whiche were many hurte and ouerthrowen. Then drew they their swordes &amp; fought so cruellie, that the slaughter was farre greater than before: bycause the Chieftaynes them selues preased forth so valiauntlie, &amp; aduentured so many perilous and daungerous attemptes, that by meane &amp; throughe their exhortacions they encouraged the Souldiours violently to fight. And all the horssemen who for their vertue and prowes were all choise men, manfully &amp; stoutly fought togyther in the view and sight of their Chieftaynes, bycause they might beare witnesse of their noble harts and inuincible courages. But after the horssemen hadde fought long, and that no man could iudge whiche parte had the better, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Indians Demetre</hi> his Elephanters with great violence marched against the enimie, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at the first feared, bycause they thought them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing able to resist their power. But so soone as they came against the yron rampier, they stayed, and the shot which flanked the ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pier, shot so thicke, that the greater parte of the beastes were sore wounded and their ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who fÃ©eling their greuous woundes, vrged the beastes with great strokes, so that some of them fell on the rampier, and being sore hurte with the pricking of the poles and shot, ranne quite out of order. And here is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those kinde of beastes so long as the way is playn &amp; short, are maruelous strong, eyther to charge or encountre. But when they shal charge in hard places they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> do nothing, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> softnesse of their fÃ©ete. Which thing they with <hi>Ptolome</hi> right well knew, and therfore prepared this maner of stoppe. At laste, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater part of the <hi>Indians</hi> Elephanters were eyther slaine or sore hurte, the Elepantes were by the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie all taken.

But bycause the maner of life and order of the said <hi>Arabians</hi> is farre different and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grÃ©eing from all other, I thinke it meete and expedient here to make some mention and declaration thereof. First they dwel wildlie abroad without eyther townes or houses: wherefore they saie their lande is vnhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bicause there are neither ryuers or fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tayns wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to maintayne an armie.<note place="margin">

This they hold &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn, bycause they thinke that those which haue houses, and maneured lands and fruitfull, are always subiect to conquerours. But there are amongs them many whereof some haue great flockes of shÃ©epe &amp; other great heards of Camels going abroad in the desertes, neuer tarrying long in one place. And althoughe there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse kindes of <hi>Arabians</hi> whiche inhabit the desertes, yet are the <hi>Nabathians</hi> the richest and wealthiest, and are about the numbre of .x. thousand: whereof some are accustomed to trade by Sea with incense, myrrhe and other drugs aromatique, growing in the fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Arabie.</hi> They are also meruelouslie determined to kÃ©epe and mainteyne their libertie. And when any enimie inuadeth, they draw to the desert and places so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie which serue in stead of castles and forts, where no straunger can liue.

they may the better digge the Caues, the entry of which are little, but within large and dÃ©epe, so that they are more than an Arpent square: and in those they set earthen vessels filled with great store of rayne water, and then they in suche sorte couer the entry of the Caue aboue, that they which passe by can not perceyue it, but them selues knowe it again by a signe which they leaue behinde, and euery third daye they water their cattell with that water, to the ende, if they were put to flight, they should not want drinke: and their chief foode is flesh, mylke, and other things which the lande bringeth forth, verie good and holsome to eate. In this lande also groweth Peper and wild honie, which they drinke with water. There are besides beyond these, other <hi>Arabians,</hi> dwelling in the maneured land, and are tributaries as the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and liue in such order as they doe, saue that they dwell in no houses.

iiij. dayes with spÃ©ed returned &amp; without stay iourneyed aboue two hundred furlongs. Wherefore being through their great speede sore trauailled, and thinking that the <hi>Arabians</hi> could not in two or thrÃ©e dayes ouerget them, without making any great watche, pitched their camp. But the <hi>Arabians</hi> in that assemble aduertised by suche as see it, of the domage the <hi>Grekes</hi> had done them, broke vp their assemble, and with all diligence came to the place where the discomfiture was, and there being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed of the trueth of their losse, and tolde of the waye which the <hi>Grekes</hi> went, in such haste pursued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that they hadde the same night ouertaken them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped hard by.

In this sorte the Souldiours vnder the charge of <hi>Atheney,</hi> after good exploite of their matters in the beginning, were in the end through follie and negligence ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. As com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie happeneth, that with felicitie and good Fortune followeth negligence and contempt of the enimie, by reason whereof many sage and wise men haue said (and not without good ground) that it is more easie paciently to sustaine and abide infelicitie and aduersitie, than in prosperitie, sagely and wisely to gouerne.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10248:102"/>
in Greke to <hi>Antigone,</hi> wherein they complayned them of <hi>Atheney</hi> his assailing, and excused the dÃ©ede by them committed. To whose letters <hi>Antigone</hi> aunswered, that whatsoeuer <hi>Atheney</hi> had done against them, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his consent and knowlege, &amp; that he was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the reuenge thereof. All this saide he to assure and deceyue them: to the ende they shoulde haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or care of him, whereby he might sodenly surprise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. For it was a hard matter without some cautel and wyle to surprise such a people always liuing like shÃ©ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, and hauing for their retraict places inaccessible and impregnable. And although the said <hi>Arabians</hi> were right ioyous to be by that meane deliuered of so great terrour and feare where they were, yet gaue they no such credit to the letters of <hi>Antigone,</hi> but that they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their espialles and watches vppon the mountaines and places eminent, where they might sÃ©e al the entries of that countrey: and beside disposed and ordered their businesse, to their best aduauntage according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the same, attending that whiche might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. When <hi>Antigone</hi> thought he had by his letters suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently abused, deceyued and assured them, he chose out .iiij. thousand of his lightest men, and as many horse, and commaunded them to make prouision of victualles to carry for certen dayes, and be obedient to followe his sonne <hi>Demetre</hi> to whatsoeuer he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunded. Willing him by al meanes possible he could, to chase and expulse the said <hi>Arabians.</hi> Which commaundement he obeyd &amp; followed, and so tooke his iourney &amp; trauailled throughe the desertes the space of thrÃ©e dayes (thinking the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> had thereof knowen nothing) but they forthwith by their espials and watches were aduertised by signes and tokens whiche they made on the hie mountaines w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fiers and other ways as they had amongs them deuised. Wherefore they carried into their strong rocks, al their baggage, wyues, children and olde people, and left with
<pb facs="tcp:10248:103"/>
them a number of their lustie yong fellowes to defende the same, very easie to garde and kepe, bicause it was of a mightie heigth, and but one entrie and way to come in at. The rest deuided them into bandes, &amp; draue their bestiall thorow diuers places amidst the wildernesse.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Demetre</hi> was come to the rocke, and all their cattaile driuen away, he gaue many assautes to take it, but the <hi>Arabians</hi> right valiantly defended it, &amp; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the aduauntage of the place, easily repulsed the <hi>Greekes,</hi> so that the assaut through many attemptes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all day. But about the sunne going downe, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre</hi> caused to sound the retraict. The nexte day in the morning, as they thought to giue a fresh assault, one of <hi>Arabians</hi> standing in the toppe of the rocke, cried oute with a loude voice, addressing to <hi>Demetre</hi> these words ensuing: Sir King <hi>Demetre,</hi> what wickednesse hath moued thÃ©e to warre vpon vs pore wretched men that inhabite the desertes, where is neyther corne, water, wine, nor any other thing necessary and mÃ©ete for thy vse. For we to defend our liberty haue chosen this place improuided of all things mÃ©ete and necessarie for the life and maintenance of any other nation, but liue here like sauage and wilde beastes, doing neither hurt or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to any. Wherfore we pray &amp; earnestly desire thÃ©e and thy father to take such giftes as we are able to yÃ©eld you, and withdraw and call backe your army, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to holde and retaine the <hi>Nabathians</hi> for your frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. For if thou tarrie and continue here any whyle, thou shalt want water, and other things necessarie for the nourishing and relieuing of thy people. And admit thou conquer vs, thou canst neuer force vs to alter and change our maner of life, so that those which thou shalt kepe prisoners, can not nor wil not endure or abyde in seruitude and bondage. Through these words <hi>Demetre</hi> his heart waxed so colde, that he drewe backe his men, and caused it to be declared to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that they

               <p>THis <hi>Lake</hi> surnamed <hi>Asphalte,</hi> is as it were in the middest of the <hi>Satrapie</hi> of <hi>Arabie,</hi> about .v. hundred furlongs long and .lx. broode: the water thereof is meruelous foule and stinking, so that no fish can lyue therein, nor any other thing accustomed to lyue in the water. And albeit there entreth and runneth into it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ryuers of fresh and swÃ©ete waters, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they are through the great and maruelous stenche of the water of the Lake incontinent infected, which of it selfe yÃ©erely casteth a great quantitie of plastry all hoale as bigge and great oftentimes as thrÃ©e Arpentes: and many times not passing as great as one Arpent. And when there is great store and abundaunce, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitaunts cal it the Bull, and when lesse, the Bulchin. This amasse and heap of plaistry in such sorte riseth and swimmeth aboue the water, that they which sÃ©e it farre of, thinke it to be some Island. And when it beginneth to arise as we haue before saide, they may perceyue it

xx. daies before: bycause there issueth oute of the Lake such a vapoure smelling like plaistre, many furlonges round about: and of such efficacie and strength, that all the golde, siluer, and all other metall within the limites and compasse thereof, lose their colour. But after the plaistre is once risen aboue the water, it getteth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. Whiche vapoure scaldeth all the Regions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and drieth them as if they were half burnt, and maketh the people verie pale and wanne &amp; also sicklie, so that they are not long lyued. Notwithstanding the land round about is fruitfull for Date trÃ©es, whereas is any ryuer or fountayne to moyst them. And in a place lying in a valley nÃ©ere thereto, groweth the swÃ©ete and odoriferous Baulme whiche is of great price: bycause there is none in the whole worlde but there,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The sweete Baulme.</hi>
                  </note> whiche the Phisicions vse in their receytes as an excellent and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing. And as touching the plaistre rising oute of the Lake, the people of the Countrey runne thyther to spoile and gather it as it were the butine of the enimie. The boats which they row in are made of great rÃ©edes, and in euery boat but thrÃ©e men, whereof two rowe, the third hath bowe and arrowes to defende them against those which would let them from gathering. And when they are come to that amasse or heape, with their axes and hatchets they cut thereof as a man shoulde do on a Tuph or softe stone, and therewith fraught their boats, and then returne. And if it happen at any tyme that the boats breake that they fall into the water, yet thoughe they cannot swymme, they sinke not to the grounde as in other waters, but remayne aboue as if they swam. For the nature of the water is to beare and hold vp the bodyes of any thing whiche hath humiditie and breath. And such things as are whole and massife, as golde, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, lead and such other mettals sinke not so soone to the ground as they do in other waters. With the same plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre the Paisaunts gather &amp; get great store of siluer, for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10248:104"/>
they carry it into <hi>Egipt,</hi> where they sell it very dÃ©ere, bycause it is verie excellent and soueraine to preserue dead bodies from steach and putriture: and if the other dredges be not mingled with that, they can not long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and keepe them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Demetre</hi> was returned to his Father in <hi>Sirie,</hi> he recompted all he had done against the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and also the nature of the Lake whereof we haue spoken. Howbeit his father was no deale contented with the league and amitie made with the <hi>Arabians:</hi> saying they would hereafter become more cruell and fierce, seing they hadde not now bene chastised and brought vnder: and farther, they woulde thinke that the same conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peace was made not for anie pitie or compassion he tooke of them, but bycause he was not able to correct and punishe them. Notwithstanding he much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hym for fynding oute the Lake by which he trusted the better to encrease hys reuenue and possessions. Wherefore he charged <hi>Ierome</hi> the Historian to assemble and get togyther a numbre of shippes and to fraught them all with the plaistre he coulde there finde, and to carrie it into some place to be safely kept. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happened all other wayes. For the <hi>Arabians</hi> who were therof aduertised, had assembled to the numbre of vj. thousand or thereabouts, and with their boats with shot of arrowes so charged <hi>Antigone</hi> his people vppon the saide Lake in their ships, that they had almost slain them all.

And if suche Oratours and Rhetoriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wil by such orations shew their skill and learning, and the elegancie of their spÃ©eche and language, they may particularly by them selues couch the orations and Ambassades apperteyning to Ambassadours, the prayses and disprayses able and mÃ©ete, and other suche like: and so vsing their arte and elegancie in such tales, and busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in this and that matter particularlie, shall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mended therin. Howbeit, at this day some writers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vsing the art Oratory, reduce the greater part of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into Orations &amp; tales: whiche to the Readers are verie tedious and yrkesome, not only for that they haue naughtely written and made them, but also bycause they no whit regarded the order and nature of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie. By reason whereof suche as do read them, verie ofte passe ouer vnread the saide orations and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which by great arte and cunning had bene compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and made: or else for the length &amp; impertinencie are so weried, that they leaue all vnread.

and continued without interruption: like as when the bodye of a man is dismembred, it loseth hys kindely vertue, but when it is whole ioyned togyther, it hath then the full grace and perfect strength. And so in like case, the narration and setting forth of an History gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the Reader thereof a manifest and delectable pleasure, if it be playne and continued. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I wil not altogyther reiect and forbidde the vse of Rhetoricke in an Historie, for that to make it pleasant, it ought with some varietie and copie to be garnished, &amp; is therfore very requisite that in some corner &amp; place thereof be orations and declarations. Neyther will I my selfe be altogyther voide of that facultie and arte, when I shall come to the talke of any Ambassadoure, Counsailour or other such graue personage, but I will recite what he hath saide. And they whiche haue not the knowledge to do that, might find manie excuses and say they had forgotten to put it in, which had ben expedient and necessarie in the same place to haue ben interlaced. Therefore where things be worthie memory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, whereby the Historie should be garnished: they ought not negligentlie to be passed ouer (as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour that they nothing serued to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose) &amp; not properlie couched and placed. But where the matter &amp; effect of the History is euident and of importaunce, it is not conuenient that the declaration thereof be inferior to the dÃ©edes. It is also sometimes mÃ©ete and necessarie to vse the arte Oratorie, to saye, when any thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth otherwise than is looked for. For it is expedient by copye of wordes to make the orations artificially as it falleth oute. And nowe, since we haue sufficiently aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered this matter, it is mÃ©ete we returne to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Historie, and deuide the things whereof we haue spoken, according to the times they were done in.</p>

Howbeit, that serued to no purpose, nor was the cause of his ende, but died of a wounde on the muscle of the arme by vs called the brawne. It is to be vnderstood, that a mouse in Latin is called <hi>Mus,</hi> and a little Mouse, <hi>Musculus:</hi> and thereby was signified, that he should take hÃ©ede, he died not by a mouse, and after his death, some enterpreted that it was of the muscle, which in Latin may be said a little mouse, &amp; also the brawne.

They also sent into <hi>Egipt</hi> to <hi>Ptolome,</hi> signifying to hym of their estate aud daunger, solliciting him to send hys ayde and helpe.

For exploiting wherof he sent for a wonderful number of workemen and artificers, &amp; plentie of yron and such other stuffe out of <hi>Syrie,</hi> so that in short tyme he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and made readie all things to batter and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the walles.

foure score and ten cubits hie, in which were .ix. stories or sellers deuided one from another with planchers of wood, all running vppon foure great wheles .viij. cubits hie. He had also many other engines called Rammes, very large &amp; great to batter any wall, &amp; two great and puissaunt Tortoises to helpe them. In the lowermost sellers of the <hi>Helepolis</hi> he planted store of engines and ordinaunce which threw and shot stones, the greater sorte waying thrÃ©e Talents. In the middle stories he planted engines made like boltes shooting long &amp; sharpe shot, and in the hier stages were other whiche shot lesse and lighter. He placed also in the saide roomes or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries two hundred experte Souldiours to shoote off and handle the said ordinaunce and engines. After he hadde placed his engines of battery against the wall, he in short time beat down the toppes and batlements of the curten, and after sore battered and shaked the walles: Howbeit the besieged so valiauntly defended their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with such weapon and engines as they had prepared against the assaultes, that for certen dayes no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> could iudge of the winning of the citie, suche were the noble hartes and courages inuincible of the honorable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes and lustie Souldiours on eyther side. But to be short, the wall was so sore battered and shaken, and a long breach made, that the citie was disfurnished of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and no remedy but to yelde or be taken the nexte day following, if there were not found some newe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of defence that night, before the assault ceassed. Wherfore the <hi>Menelayans</hi> hauing great store and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drie wood and suche like stuffe whiche soone would take fire, about midnight so nÃ©ere approched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> engines of the enimie, that with long poles and other which they had lighted, they cast in fire: so that in lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> an houre, the fire grew so quicke and terrible, that they had burnt the greater part of the engines and the souldiours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them: which thing the <hi>Demetrians</hi> coulde not helpe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10248:118"/>
and auoide by reason of the sodainenesse therof. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe <hi>Demetre</hi> for that time was frustrate of hys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination &amp; purpose, yet had he good hope and still vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take the citie, continuing the siege both by Sea &amp; land, not doubting but in the ende to winne it. In this meane while <hi>Ptolome</hi> hauing intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of the affaires and slaughter of his people, departed oute of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and tooke sea with a great power sayling towardes <hi>Salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and being dryuen into the Porte of <hi>Paphe</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Cypres,</hi> he there landed and got togyther all the ships of the cities thereabout, and from them made his course to <hi>Syrie,</hi> distaunt from <hi>Salamine</hi> two hundred furlongs. He had in his Nauie an .Cl. Gallies, wherof the greater were of .v. tier of ores on a side, and the lesser of foure: he had also aboue two hundred Barques, wherein were enbarqued aboue ten thousand souldiours, and the reste laden with baggage and other prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. He sent by land likewise certen Messangers to <hi>Menelaye,</hi> commaunding him if it were possible to send the .lx. Gallies lying in the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of <hi>Salamine,</hi> which ioyned with his, &amp; he thought to be much stronger at sea then <hi>Demetre,</hi> hauing two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gallies or better. When <hi>Demetre</hi> vnderstoode of <hi>Ptolome</hi> his comming, he left the siege furnished before the citie, and enbarqued the rest of his Souldiours with great store of shot and engines which shot far off, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in the noses of his Gallies, and when he had arranged them all in order of battaill, he enuironed the Towne, and in the mouth of the hauen cast ancre, and road there all that night withoute the daunger of the shot, bothe for stopping of the Gallies which laye in the Port, that they should not get out to ioyne with <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> and also to sÃ©e what course <hi>Ptolome</hi> kept, to the ende that which waye soeuer he came, he would be arranged and readie in order of battaill to fight. But after the day once appeared, he might descry a mightie and terrible Nauie of <hi>Ptolomes,</hi> sayling towards the citie, whereat
<pb facs="tcp:10248:119"/>
he was astonied:<note place="margin">

And first in the left wing or rereward he placed .vij. <hi>Phenician</hi> Gallies of .vij. tier, and of the <hi>Athenians</hi> .xxx. of foure tier, appointing <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>

Now had <hi>Ptolome</hi> in the night loosed, and with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible speede sailed towardes <hi>Salamine,</hi> thinking to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the enimie, if he could gette into the Porte of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> But when it waxed nÃ©ere daye, he might discry not farre of the Nauie of the enimie in order of battaill. Wherefore he got togyther hys Gallies and arranged them as followeth: First he commaunded that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques should come a good way behinde, and arranged the rest in good and compotent order, placing him self in the left wing or rereward, wherin was the greatest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and strength. When he had ordered and placed hys battaill, the Souldiours on eyther side made the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and supplications to the Goddes in loude maner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their custome. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chieftayns considering
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10248:119"/>
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hazard of their liues &amp; whole estate stood thereon, were very carefull and sore troubled in mynde aboute the same. But so soone as they were approched within thrÃ©e furlongs one of an other, <hi>Demetre</hi> first gaue the signe and token of battaill to his Souldiours, halsing a terge of golde in the poupe of hys Gallie in the view of the whole Nauie: and shortlie after, <hi>Ptolome</hi> did the like.</p>
               <p>Then sounded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trumpets to battaill, and forthwith beganne a fierce and violent fight with shot and dartes, being a pretie distaunce asundre, wherein on eche side were many sore hurte: but after they drew neerer, there was flinging of great mightie stones, and the Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for their liues rowed as harde and forcibly as they could, so that at the bording was a terrible affray, for they violently rushing one by another, brake and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away one anothers ores, to the ende there should be no flight nor yet any great forcible assayling.

most valiauntlie bare him selfe, for he getting vp to the poupe of a Gailie of .vij. tier of ores which he had wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ne, so stoutely fought against the Souldiours within, that what with dartes and Iauelings he slewe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> a great number, and some with playne hand stroks. And althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe great store of shot came against him, yet put he by and eschewed some, &amp; receyued the rest on his armoure. And for the thrÃ©e men whiche continually were aboute him, the one was with the pushe of a pyke slayne, &amp; the other two with shot sore hurt.

And <hi>Ptolome</hi> with his greatest and most warlike Gallies put to flight the leaft wing or rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of the enimie, sinking some and pryzing the rest with so many as were within them. And returning as victor to the ayde of his right wing or vowarde, whiche was discomfited and put to flight, he sÃ©eing the <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians</hi> pursuing and chasing them, and after making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, was so afraid, that he fled into the Citie of <hi>Citin.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Demetre</hi> had at Sea atchieued and gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this victory, he deuided hys Nauie and gaue the charge to <hi>Neon</hi> and <hi>Burick</hi> two of his Captaynes,<note place="margin">

But the <hi>Rhodians</hi> thereof aduertized, draue hym quickly backe, and chased him quite from those Seas.

When <hi>Demetre</hi> had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his armie at the Porte of <hi>Elorym,</hi> he trymmed his Nauie to saile to the siege of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in whiche were two hundred Gallies of sundrie mouldes, and of other shippes to carry men and victualles .Clxx. and in them aboue .xl.

There were besides aboue a thousand Foistes and Barques of Marchaunts and diuerse other sundrie kind of people, who followed the Campe to traffique. For knowing that the <hi>Rhodians</hi> had ben long without wars, they thought there would be such store of wealth in the Countrey, whereby the Marchaunts should be great gayners. When <hi>Demetre</hi> had set all things in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, he went to Sea, and so ordered his shippes as though he would fight. And first he placed his Gallies in the first front &amp; in their noses he couched great engines, which shot great sharp arowes of wood .iij. spa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nes about: next them came the shippes whiche carried the horses whiche were haled out by the Gallies and other small pynnaces rowed with ores. In the latter flote came the Pyrats and Marchaunts aforesaide, so that all the Sea betwene the citie and the firme land was couered with shippes: which sight sore dismayed and troubled the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Neuerthelesse they with their Souldiours and so many as were able to beare armes, manned their walles and bulwarkes, awayting the approche of the

Shortly after, <hi>Demetre</hi> landed and encamped before the citie without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger of the shot, &amp; incontinent after he had pitched his camp, sent out his Pyrats &amp; a nother co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>panie thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Isle, to spoyle and robbe it both by sea and land: And further himselfe caused to fel the trÃ©es &amp; pull down the houses in the fieldes to make and buyld vp the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings and fortifications in hys Campe, which he with a treble of wood &amp; earth fortified, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might be the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger against the force and power of the enimie. He likewise filled the voide ground and places betwixt the Citie, &amp; the Porte: and left at the Sea side onely a space for the Nauie to ryde in. In the meane while the <hi>Rhodians</hi> sent many and sundrie tymes Ambassadoures to praye hym not to do them any hurte.

During this time, it was put to choise of the inhabitaunts within the citie able to beare armoure, aswell Citizens as Forainers, whether they would tarry and abyde the daunger of the siege, or else departe the towne: and so many as would not tarry, as also those which were vnmÃ©ete for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof, they excluded the citie, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the little hauen, wherein were men, crosbowes, shot, stones &amp; other things necessary, of great force to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and repulse the enimie, were it eyther to set men on land to wynne the said bulwarke, or else to approche their engines of Artillary. They also built and set vppe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the other carracques which laye in the great Port, certen receptacles of weapons to shoote, mÃ©ete for the engines, called boltes. And as eyther parte hadde made ready all things for the fight, and that <hi>Demetre</hi> purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forthwith to approche and bring nÃ©ere his engines of battery of the entryes of both Portes, sodenly arose a great tempest at Sea, which lasted and continued vntil night. But when night came and the wynd calmed, he secretly sayled about the hauen vntill he came to the great Bulwarke aboue in the great Port, and wonne that, being from the walles of the citie about .v. acres, &amp; fortified it with strong rampiers and dÃ©epe trenches of stone and wood, and thrust into it foure hundred souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours well purueyed of all kinde of shot. But so soone as daye appeared, he with great noyse of men and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes brought nÃ©ere his engines to the Porte, and with his crosbowes and other small artillary, hurt and slewe the garders of the rampiers of the Porte. And with his greater engines he so battered the Wall, that there he brake some and there ouerthrewe some, bycause it was neyther very strong, nor yet hie. Neuerthelesse the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens all the whole daye right valiauntly repulsed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, where was on eyther side great slaughter and mischief gyuen and taken. And after it began to drawe towards night, <hi>Demetre</hi> retired and haled backe his shippes with his engines of battery, out, and from the daunger of the shotte. Then the Townesmen fraughte their cockes with drie wood and such like stuffe, and pursued the said engines, and so soone as they were come neere, they cast fire into the shippes. Notwithstanding they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to retire, both bycause of the rampier before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

which swa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>me aboue the water, &amp; also by reason of the shot wherewith they were by the enimie galde. But when they see they could do no good, some quenched the fire of the boates wherein they were, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Port, and the rest which coulde not, let all burne and leapt into the Sea, and by swimming saued them selues. The next day in the morning <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> by Sea a freshe assaulted the Porte, and at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant with as great noise of men and Trumpettes as was possible, attempted the walles of the towne round about, thinking thereby so to affray the townesmen (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on euery side assaulted) that they woulde leaue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the curten and come to some treaty, who for their partes ment nothing lesse, but valiauntly sustey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the atteintes &amp; assaults that were giuen, during viij. dayes. When <hi>Demetre</hi> see he coulde not daunte the courages of the defendaunts, he caused to be planted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the toppe of their Bulwarke whiche he had wonne about the great Port, his greatest artillarie, which shot stones as waightie as three Talents, wherwith he flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and battred the curten betwene the Towers, and the Towers also. During this broyle certen of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre</hi> his Souldiours had wonne the toppe of the Wal right ouer the Porte: but the <hi>Rhodians</hi> in suche numbre came thyther, that they slewe very many of them, and stoutely repulsed the reste.

them all on fire. Amongs this entrefactes <hi>Demetre</hi> hys Souldiours sailed about the towne and set vp ladders all alongest the sea side, and violently assailed them, and the Souldiours on land did the like, so that there were many which without feare aduentured maruelous dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and sealed the very toppes of the walles.

After this assaulte and slaughter, <hi>Demetre</hi> riti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his owne shippes into the road where the rest laye, and his engines of batterie, which at the two assaultes were sore broused and torne and newe trymmed and amended them. When the <hi>Rhodians</hi> hadde thus repulsed the enimie, they enterred the bodies of their people and sacrifised to the Goddes the armours and beakes of the enimies shippes, and for the space of .vij. dayes in al cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners repaired their Walles sore battered and broken downe. During which tyme <hi>Demetre</hi> newe built and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne trimmed his engines. When <hi>Demetre</hi> hadde the vij. daye set in good order all hys whole businesse a fresh to assault it, he came directly with hys shippes well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished against the hauen, for to winne it was hys onely studie, bycause he would cut them from victualles. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he was with in an arrow shot approched the Port, he beganne violently to set vppon the <hi>Rhodian</hi> shippes with fire brandes and other fire workes, wherof he had plentie, and with long bowes and crosbowes slewe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which manned and defended the curten, and with his great artillary sore battered and shaked the Walles. Neuerthelesse, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> in this fight tooke suche paynes to defend their shippes, that they clerely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the fire.

all the lustiest Souldiours, at that pinche stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to stand to it or else neuer, which thing they spÃ©edely did. And amongs other things they enbarqued in thrÃ©e of their tallest shippes the most hardy and valiaunt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they had, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunding them with all their force to borde with their beakes or Gallie noses on the enemie which bare the engines of battery, and drowne them, who (notwithstanding al the shot which came against them) so violently ranne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the enimie, that they first brake the rampier whiche swamme vppon the water before the shippes, and after so lustely borded them which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the engines, that the water broke in on euerie side and drowned two of the greatest engines. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the third was by the Gallies haled out and carried back. When the <hi>Rhodians</hi> sÃ©e al things prosper thus wel, they waxed so proude and bold, that nÃ©edes they woulde pursue the third engine amiddest the enimie: wherfore they were so surprised, assailed and ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the numbre of the enimies shippes: that <hi>Exaceste</hi> Chieftayne of the band,<note place="margin">

After this assaulte <hi>Demetre</hi> made an other engine of battery thrice so great as the firste: but as he was sayling towards the Port, there arose such a wind, that the shippes and engine were all drowned. When the <hi>Rhodians</hi> see such opportunitie, they salied out of the Towne and assailed the Bulwarke aboute the Porte, which a while was manfully defended.

The fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dation thereof was foure square, eche waye .L. cubits long, made of great square pieces of timber, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and bound with yron, in the middest were great beames layed ouer, a cubit betwene eche, to set in men which shoulde thrust and runne the engine against a wall.

And for defence of the engine against fire and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shot, it was before and on both the sides armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thicke yron plates nailed to with great yron nayles. In the front of the stories were windowes, out of which they might lay out and shotte any kinde of artillary y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>  was within. To euery window was a couer which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and shut by cunning and arte as occasion serued, for suertie of the enginers, made of cowe hides farsed with wolle to breake the blow and dint of shot. In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry storie also were two broad ladders: the one to go vp on for carrying of such things as were nÃ©edeful, and the other to come downe on, to the ende one should not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and let another. When the engine was throughlie finished, they chose out thrÃ©e thousand and foure hundred of the mightiest and strongest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the armie, to moue

and dryue it: whereof some were thrust in, and the rest stood withoute at the brÃ©eche with cables &amp; other things made for the purpose meete to runne it forward. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so built Tortoises and couers to defend the other engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of artillary as rammes and such like. He forced and cast a trenche also couered ouer, wherein men might go and come in safetie from the place where the engines stood, to the place they should be brought. He made hys Marryners and Gallie sclaues likewise to smoothe and playne the ground where the engines should be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; brought on, being about foure furlongs broad, whiche is halfe a myle Englishe: ouer against whiche place of ground in the wal of the Towne stood .vij. great towers or Bulwarks, and sixe little Turrets, against which he planted his engines. And althoughe the workemanship was maruelous, and suche that in long tyme it was thought impossible to finish and end, yet had he quickly atchieued and brought it to passe, by reason of the great store of workemen he had of all sortes, being .xxx. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand or more: all which things in the sight of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were very terrible.

And besides, if peraduenture the citie hadde ben taken, they might well haue aunswered no breach of peace in them, bycause they had alwayes desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue continued amitie and friendship with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre</hi> his father, which of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> was very wisely and circumspectly considered. But when they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized by one who fled from the campe, that <hi>Demetre</hi> had with his Myoners vndermyned one corner of the wall, they digged a very dÃ©epe trenche and countermy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the enimie, so that they could no farther passe, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them at the entry and mouthes of the mynes kept diligent watche. And as <hi>Demetre</hi> was thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myning to ouerthrow the curte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, certen of the <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had practized to corrupt <hi>Anathagore</hi> of <hi>Mylete,</hi> sent thyther by <hi>Ptolome,</hi> with the charge of shippes as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to the <hi>Mylesians,</hi> that he would suffer <hi>Demetre</hi> to enter the Citie by the mynes, wherunto <hi>Anathagore</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.<note place="margin">

                  </note> So there was a day taken betwene them, when <hi>Demetre</hi> should send one of his chief Captaynes, whome he promised to thrust into the town by the mynes, that he might sÃ©e how to bring in the rest of the Souldiours withoute. But after they were agrÃ©ed vpon the practize wherein <hi>Demetre</hi> had great hope, the <hi>Mylesian</hi> reueled
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10248:131"/>
the matter to the Senate. Notwithstanding at the day prefixed and assigned, <hi>Demetre</hi> sent one of the friendes and domesticals of the King of <hi>Macedone,</hi> named <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> to the said myne, whome the townes men incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent tooke prisoner, and after crowned <hi>Anathagore</hi> with a Crowne of golde, and rewarded hym with fiue hundred Talents of siluer, to the ende to gyue greater encouragement to the other Mercenaries and straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers within the Town, iustly and truly to serue in the said siege. When <hi>Demetre</hi> see he could thereby nothing preuayle, and hauing finished and made readie all hys engines, and playned the waye wherein they should be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, he planted in the middest the great <hi>Helepolis,</hi> and the .viij. Tortoises without rammes, he planted on eche side the <hi>Helepolis</hi> foure, wel couered and porched, and the wayes couered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> one to another like porches, so that men without daunger might passe to and fro. Ouer and besides these engines he hadde two other rammes of wood, of a maruelous greatnesse, which were brought thyther, eche of them sixe score fÃ©ete long, and the beaks or points armed with yron like vnto the Gallie nose, so that there could not be fewer than a thousande men to driue and runne them against a wall, albeit to conducte and bring them fewer would serue, bycause they went vpon wheles. When he had brought his engines nÃ©ere the Wall, and had appointed in euery storie of the <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> such number of shot of all sortes as hym thought good. He sent to the porte and to his men about the Sea and all other quarters of the towne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunding them to approche and seale the wall: And forthwith marched on with the footemen to gyue the attempt and assaulte, so that in one moment the towne in euery corner was assayled, and the walles with great engines of artillary battered, and they whiche manned the curtens were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> quarrelles &amp; stones sore hurt: But to sÃ©e how the <hi>Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> defended was wonder. While these matters were
<pb facs="tcp:10248:132"/>
at this point, and that the assault had long tyme conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the Ambassadours of the <hi>Guidians</hi> came to entreat <hi>Demetre</hi> for their Citie to leaue of and raise hys siege, promising to persuade the <hi>Rhodians</hi> to performe hys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes which with reason might be graunted, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he gladly agreed. But after the assault ceased, and that the Ambassadours had long gone aboute all partes of the curten, debating with them to and fro to yeld and to consider the daunger they were in, the King sÃ©eing yt impossible to persuade them, gaue a freshe assaulte more fierce and terrible than the first, and with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary so beate them, that he battered and ouerthrewe a great square Tower of stone and the wall it stoode on all to pouder, so that the Souldiours of the towne could not that waye passe to go to their other towers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses. Notwithstanding the Attemptaunts (throughe the wonderfull and valiaunt defence of the Citizens) could not all that daye enter the Town. In this meane while arriued at the Hauen a great number of barques laden with corne and great plenty of other victuals, by King <hi>Ptolome</hi> sent out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> who with a prosperous wind, sayled a maine vnder all sayles, and entred the Hauen maugre all <hi>Demetre</hi> his Nauie, who did al that in them laye to barre them the Porte. And as it were al at one time, certen other shippes laden with victualles sent from <hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Lysimache,</hi> arriued. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Citizens which before were in great feare and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, tooke now such courage, that they wholie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to sallie oute on the enimie and set on fire their engines. And thereuppon they made great prouision of drie wood and such other stuffe for fire workes: &amp; when they had appointed all their shot to that side on the wall where the engines were planted, they which were put out of the Town began about midnight al at one throw to cast fire in diuerse sorte against the engines and their garders; and the Souldiours from the curten so luste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10248:132"/>
applied them with shotte, which came to the rescous, that the whole armie was in maruelous terrour, as of a thing not precogitated or thought on. But the <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians</hi> fearing the burning and spoyle of all their Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fiersly ranne to their rescue, and by reason of the darknesse of the night, the fire carriers being alwayes in sighte, were very sore hurte and stryken downe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not in the darke auoyde the shot which came on them. Neuerthelesse, after the <hi>Rhodians</hi> hadde once perceyued that the plates of yron wherewith the great <hi>Helepolis</hi> was armed were fallen of, they then in all they might, cast fire aboute the bare &amp; naked places. But they within diligently quenched the fire with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they had for the purpose made readie. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit when <hi>Demetre</hi> sÃ©e the fire stil encrease, &amp; fearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> consummation of all his engines, he caused them at the sound of the Trumpette to be drawen awaye by those who had the charge. The nexte daye in the morning he commaunded his Souldiours to gather togyther all the shot which came out of the Towne, to the end he would haue a gesse what furniture they hadde within, whiche thing was spÃ©edely done: and by the reporte that was made, they coniectured to be within, engines of artilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for fire workes, aboue .viij. hundred of diuerse big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and of other artillary as crosbowes and such like, aboue a thousand. Wherefore when he hadde sÃ©ene such plenty of shot in so short tyme, in one night, he greatly wondred at the maruelous wealth and dispence of the Citie, and yet he more wondered at their furniture. Neuerthelesse, after he had taken order for the burying of the dead and healing of the hurt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, he then repaired and amended his engines of artillary.</p>
               <p>During which time the Citizens being at reaste and without daunger of battery, made a crosse wall within the Town, enuironning all that part of the wall which was in daunger, and besides cast a dÃ©epe trenche at the
<pb facs="tcp:10248:133"/>
corner of the Wall whiche was beaten downe, to staye the King, that he should not by any great or impetuous force entre the Citie by assault. They sent oute also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <hi>Amynthe</hi> with a number of their fittest saylers, who before anie thing was perceyued, had gotten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coast of <hi>Asie,</hi> right ouer against the Isle where <hi>Demetre</hi> had thrÃ©e tall and mightie shippes, whiche the Pirates had brought in the ayde of the King, whom he there borded, and after a whiles fight, tooke them and all that were a borde, amongs whome he had <hi>Thimocles</hi> Prince of the Pirates.

When the two armies were in viewe one of an other, <hi>Antigone</hi> was maruelously troubled and very pensife. For there ranne in hys fantasie many things, and especially the great daunger and hazard of that battaill, whereof he no lesse doubted the losse, than he had good hope of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And although one waye (by reason of his continual victories) he well hoped: but chiefly for the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by him newly gotten for hys laste victorie in <hi>Cypres,</hi> yet he agayne as a wise man, and one experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in martiall pollicies, considered the varietie of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who is neuer firme or stable, but still delighteth in mutation and chaunge. All whiche things throughly wayed, he became so sore troubled and grÃ©eued, that where he before in other warres and battailles was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to speake lowde and fiercely, in reproche and despite of the enimie, and set forth hys stoutenesse and
<pb facs="tcp:10248:142"/>
magnanimitie: he then without words was altogyther heauie &amp; pensiue, which imported a maruelous thought and care in him, as if he had had some present infelicitie in his head, which sodaynly happened him. He did also at that time (as they said) many things whiche he neuer woonted to do. For he there openly in presence of al, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and named his sonne <hi>Demetre</hi> successor of hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, as thoughe he should presently haue died: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tooke him into his Pauilion a great while, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with him alone, whereat the whole armie was maruellously abashed, bycause he neuer before vsed a parte to talke, nor yet communicate with him in secret of his affayres, but trusting to his owne wyt, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all matters after his owne fantasie, and withoute demaunding aduise or counsail of any, would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maund that to him seemed best. In so muche that at one tyme, (they said) when <hi>Demetre</hi> his sonne, being but a yong Souldiour, demaunded when he should returne to hym with the armie, with a troubled and disdainfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, aunswered: Arte thou so very a boy &amp; cowarde that thou canst not without me heare the sounde of the Trumpets? Ageyn, besides these his fantasies and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, many things then happened whiche might be iudged pronostications of euill lucke and misfortune to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him. For <hi>Demetre</hi> one night sÃ©e in his dreame, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great al armed in white, who asking him what signe and token he should giue to hys Souldiours in that battaill: aunswered that <hi>Iupiter</hi> gaue victorie, and by and by hym thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> saide, and I also will take parte with your enimies. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reported, that after <hi>Antigone</hi> had aranged his Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang or battaille of footemen, and comming oute of hys Tente, that he stoond one of his fÃ©ete, and therewith so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fel flat to the ground. And after he was lift vppe, holding vp his handes to heauen, made his humble pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Gods, that they would eyther gyue hym victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10248:142"/>
or at the least, that he might be slayne, rather than with shame to be enforced to flie: and all at once wholy went to the battaill, which on eyther side beganne very hoate and cruel. It happened soone after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

For during the time he had them in chase, the <hi>Seleukeans</hi> sÃ©eing the footemen left naked without horse (whiche shoulde haue ben their garde and succoure) so encompassed them, as though they would on euery side haue charged. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon some seeing all their horssmen gone, forthewith rendred, and the reste whiche stood to the defence, after they see their inabilitie to withstand, fled, so that when <hi>Demetre</hi> was returned from the chase, he could no way bring them ageyne into order.

And so soone as he had them, he sailed in all haste to the straight of <hi>Peloponnese,</hi> called <hi>Isthmus:</hi> being there arriued, newes were brought hym out of al quarters, that his case daily empaired, and that his garrisons euery where were expulsed, &amp; his townes without resistaunce rendred to the enimie.

During this time arose such matters betwen them, that the one greatly suspected the other: For as <hi>Demetre</hi> was by <hi>Alexander</hi> bidden to supper, he was willed to take good hÃ©ed to him, bycause that <hi>Alexander</hi> had practized by treason to slea him. Notwithstanding he by no meane shewed any contenaunce of mistrust, but ment to go to the banquet, to whose lodging <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming, to bring him on his way, but he diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly detracted the time, &amp; went a soft and treatable pace, to the end his souldiors might haue leasure to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and commaunded his gard being a greater number than <hi>Alexanders,</hi> to enter with him, and also to wayte nÃ©ere his person. When <hi>Alexanders</hi> Souldiours sÃ©e them the weaker companie, they durst not once attempt it. And after they hadde supped, bycause <hi>Demetre</hi> woulde haue some honest occasion to departe, he fayned him to be something yll disposed in his body, and therfore forth w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tooke leaue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and went thence. The nexte day in the morning <hi>Demetre</hi> fayning that he had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued certen newes, sent word vnto him that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised of matters of great importaunce, that he must of necessitie with hys armie returne into <hi>Peloponnese,</hi> praying <hi>Alexander</hi> to haue him excused. Neuerthelesse, he offred him his ayde and helpe, whensoeuer he nÃ©eded,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10248:148"/>
and desired him to vse him as one in whom he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and put his whole trust. With whiche message the yong <hi>Alexander,</hi> who greatly doubted him before he came, and muche more after hys comming, was nowe maruellous gladde that of hys owne accorde he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of his Realme and Dominions. And bycause he would better let him vnderstande some signe of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of his good will and loue, he accompanied him into <hi>Thessaly.</hi> But after they were arriued in the citie of <hi>Larisse,</hi>

And firste, <hi>Alexander</hi> to put <hi>Demetre</hi> quite out of suspicion, withoute armoure or garde visited him, hoping to make him do the like, but he was in his so thinking greatly deceyued. And as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> one night, according to his accustomed woonte, came to supper to <hi>Demetre</hi> without company, and that they were in the chief of their supper, <hi>Demetre</hi> soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arose from the table, whereat <hi>Alexander</hi> was so sore abashed, that he arose and followed him to the Haldore. But so soone as <hi>Demetre</hi> was withoute, he gaue signe &amp; token to his Souldiours, who incontinent fell vppon <hi>Alexander</hi> and slewe him and certen of his men whiche would haue defended him, among whome one as he was killed, saide, <hi>Demetre</hi> hath preuented vs but a daye onely. With this slaughter were the <hi>Macedonians</hi> all that night and the next daye in the morning maruelous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly astonied, and in great feare. For sÃ©eing to oultrage was to no purpose, and that <hi>Demetre</hi> after <hi>Alexander</hi> his death was very strong to bring his purpose to passe: before they vnderstood what he would do, they durst not trust him, nor yeld, vntill such time as <hi>Demetre</hi> sent to them certen of his men, which in his behalfe sayde, that they nÃ©eded not to feare him, for it was not his will to do them any hurte, but prayed them to come to him, and then he woulde shewe them a good reason why he hadde done that he dyd. Whereupon the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ioyed
<pb facs="tcp:10248:149"/>
that they were deliuered of that feare and daunger. Wherfore they went all togyther vnto him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gyuing eare or attending his oration, salued him as their King, and nÃ©edes would bring him into <hi>Macedon.</hi> Of this chaunge was all the countrey maruelous glad: for they so mortally hated <hi>Cassander,</hi> for the cruell facts and great villanies, by hym (against the great King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> and his ligne after his death) committed, and also for the great oultrage and impious murder whiche <hi>Antipater, Cassander</hi> his sonne had vsed towards his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thessalonicke,</hi> that they desired nothing so much, as a new King.

And after his returne into <hi>Macedone,</hi> considering that the aide of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> would more preuayle him in warre than in peace, following his owne nature and inclination, which was neuer to be at rest and in quiet, incontinent arrered new warres against the <hi>Etholians,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>  great power went thyther, where he robbed, burnt, and wasted the greater parte of their countrey, and that done, left <hi>Panthauke,</hi> one of his Captaynes with a braue band of souldiours to gard and kept it: and he with the rest in all possible spÃ©ede marched against King <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> with whome he had many quarrels. Who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aduertised, came with so great will to fight against him, as the other to assaile him.

Whereupon <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> got him not so muche hatred and euill will of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> whome he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, as he for this victorie wanne honour and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, bycause all men wondred and were abashed at his vertue and valiauntnesse. Wherefore they sayde it was he amongs al the rest of the Kings, which should
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10248:153"/>
renue the vertue and courage inuincible of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. And that the reste all inflamed with honour and prodigalitie, and enuironned with Souldiours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes went accompanied with whores, and minstrels, as common daunsers. And amongs them was none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controuersie, but who shoulde surmounte other in pompe, deceipt, and vaine glorie. And that was spoken by <hi>Demetre,</hi> who (as they saide) dyd not onely weare a Crowne royall, and robes of crymosin tynsell, but also shoes of golde. It was also said that he caused a robe to be made like vnto heauen, with starres in it, a verie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; sumptuous worke, which fashion he there long tyme ware, but the alteration and chaunge thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained imperfect. And neuer before or since was any King of <hi>Macedone,</hi> were he neuer so proude and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous, that once durste enterprise or take on hande to cause such a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t to be made to weare. These things abouesayd greatly troubled the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> yet were there other fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s that <hi>Demetre</hi> vsed, which more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, both for his straungenesse in gyuing audience, as also for his hie and stoute annsweres, besides the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie and grauitie intollerable. But one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongs other whiche is talked &amp; noted of hym, was that he helde and kept the Ambassadoures of <hi>Athens</hi> two whole yeares, being more his friendes than any of the rest of <hi>Grece,</hi> and made them follow him which waye so euer he went, without any dispatche: and in the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him in as great hatred as they came. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time was an Orator sent to him from the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> wherat he maruelously grudged, thinking they estÃ©emed him not, for sending of so simple an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doure. Wherefore he wonderfully reuiled &amp; with mina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory words menaced them, and after turning his talke to the Orator said: And arte thou he whome the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> haue sent hyther alone? Whome the Orator very gently aunswered: yea for so the Sir King to thÃ©e

alone. Another time also, when he hadde caused it to be published, that he would giue attentiue audience to all suters: a numbre of people at the day appointed came with many supplications, and deliuered them to him in writing, whiche he verie curteously receyued, and put them in the skirte of his gowne, but at hys departing thence, going ouer the bridge of the Riuer <hi>Axie,</hi> in the sight of all those whiche had put vp and giuen him their supplications,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and followed for aunswer, he caste them all in the ryuer, whereat the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended and discontent. For they thought it not the office and honour of a King of hie and noble courage, nor yet a good officer, but rather of a iester and decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the people, and of one who made no accompt of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. And a great deale the more thought the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> it straunge, for that they hadde vnderstoode of their auncesters, the great curtesie and facilitie that King <hi>Phillip,</hi> father to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, vsed in gyuing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his subiects. It happened one daye aboute the same season, that a poore woman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming to <hi>Demetre,</hi> &amp; desiring him to heare hir, he aunswering that he was not at leysure,<note place="margin">

were not onely maruelous great and full of good work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, but also the vse of them where for the warres mÃ©ete and necessarie.

Whereupon considering the daunger he was in, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to slie towardes <hi>Seleuke,</hi> but before he would so do, he wrote vnto him his pitifull letters, conteining

all his misfortunes and aduersities, grÃ©euously complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his miserable estate, praying him to haue pitie and compassion of so wretched a man, his familiar, and neere allie, who alreadie had had so many aduersities, that his verie mortall enimies thereof ought to haue compassion and pitie. These letters receyued, <hi>Seleuke</hi> hauing pitie and compassion of one so noble a personage, by fortune come into such calamitie and miserie, writte to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Lieutenaunts in those quarters, that they should vse and entreat him, as apperteyned vnto so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Prince: and farther, to cal backe the men of warre which pursued him.

For men (quod he) ought not to make light accompte of so quarrelous a man, which hath alwayes inuented and deuised straunge and hie enterprises, and chiefly of one in so great aduersitie, which were inough to moue a man of small courage, to enterprise and execute a very great oultrage, to his best and dearest friende.

Wherfore he with his armie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the strongest places of the mount <hi>Thaure,</hi> and sent towardes <hi>Seleuke</hi> his Ambassadoures, praying of him ayde and helpe, for the obtayning and getting some principalitie and Seigniorie in some of the prouinces nÃ©ere hand, which had no King, wherein he might staye him selfe, ende his banishement, and there leade the rest of his life, and mainteyne his armie: and further, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe

Wherevpon <hi>Seleuke</hi> greatly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, aunswered him: That he was content, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> and his armie should remayne two monethes in the countrey of <hi>Laconie:</hi> alwayes prouided, that he send cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his principall friends for hostages.

And with the reste of his own, kept him in the places of most aduauntage, not meaning to fight. In this sorte began <hi>Demetre</hi> to gette ageyne courage and strength. But as he stood vppon the point to exploite some notable matter, he was sodenly with a grÃ©euous maladie (which troubled and hindred al his enterprises) taken. For his Souldiours who throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe victorie hadde gotten courage, and in good hope to worke wounders, seeing their chieftayne so sore sicke, faynted ageyne, so that some fled from the armie: some rendred to the enimie: and other thinking by straunge and vncouth wayes to retire home, villanously died.

the enimie to assaile them are they were prouided. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, he was not so soone approched the sayd ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pe, but that certen of the scoultes were come in extrÃ©eme haste, to aduertise <hi>Seleuke</hi> of his comming, who at the newes all dismayed, sodenly arose and tooke his gowne and slippers, and ranne out of his Tent, crying alarme, alarme, making the Trumpettes sounde to armes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and praying the Captaynes, lustely to resiste such an enraged beast. But when <hi>Demetre</hi> knew by the noise in the enimies campe, that his enterprise was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, he would not attempt Fortune but retired. Soone after, <hi>Seleuke</hi> with ensignes displayed, assailed his campe: and bycause <hi>Demetre</hi> woulde shewe that he was no whit abashed or afeard, he sent out a band of his Souldiours ageinst the enimie, which so lustily charged a corner of <hi>Seleuke</hi> his battaile, that they stood at a stay whyther to tarry or flie. Which thing <hi>Seleuke</hi> sÃ©eing, &amp; knowing the daunger of the case and his estate, threwe of his headpece, and fiercely on horsbacke galloped hard to the forefronte, shewing hym selfe barefaced to them all, praying them to returne to the battaile, saying he had long absented him from them, not for want of good will, or feare of <hi>Demetre,</hi> but to obey those who were his good and loyal friendes. Then his Souldiours tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row these exhortations were so encouraged and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and chiefly bycause they see and behelde the face and Maiestie of their King, that they incontinent retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brauely to the battaile, and so impetuously rechar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the enimie, that <hi>Demetre</hi> being well mounted, and sÃ©eing him not able to abide the violence of his power, got out of the campe, and vppon the spurre fled harde to the <hi>Amanipiles:</hi> and immediatly from thence with a few of his owne folks got into a forest hard by, and there tarried till night: to the ende to gette to the Porte of <hi>Caune,</hi>

And after they had long debated their matters, he in the ende by persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his friends was content to send towardes <hi>Seleuke</hi> some of them, signifying that he was willing, frankly to yeld his life and all that Fortune had left him, to his pleasure. Of whiche Ambassade was <hi>Seleuke</hi> right ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and by reporte, sayde these wordes: Certes, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune doth not so much for <hi>Demetre</hi> in sauing of him, as for me.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber made them ready to ryde, and meete with <hi>Demetre,</hi> euery man studying and deuising to do him the greatest honour he coulde: thinking that he being so great and renoumed a personage and allie to <hi>Seleuke,</hi> shoulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent haue all the whole authoritie about him.

For the lodging was honorable and royal, and therein great orchyardes and gardens full of maruellous faire and pleasaunt trÃ©es and other delices, in whiche he might at his pleasure, solace him: and left with him hys owne seruaunts and familiar friendes whiche serued and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him at his commaundement. And they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes repayring to <hi>Seleuke,</hi> and eftsoones returning towardes <hi>Demetre,</hi> reported vnto him all the good and curteous language and communication by <hi>Seleuke</hi> sayd and talked in his behalfe, exhorting and praying him to make good chere, and to hope well of his deliueraunce: and not to mistrust the bountie and liberalitie of <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</hi> They farther declared vnto him for certen, that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuke</hi> looked for the comming of <hi>Antioche</hi> his sonne, and <hi>Stratonice</hi> his wife, daughter to the sayd <hi>Demetre,</hi> whom he had sent for, to the ende they should haue the honour and thanke for his deliueraunce, and that after their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

him. Notwithstanding <hi>Demetre</hi> sÃ©eing him selfe in this captiuitie, and voyde of all hope of deliueraunce, sent certen messangers to the Gouernours of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> his subiects, to signifie vnto them, that they neuer after that time should giue any credit to his seale or letters, but hold and take him for dead. He moreouer willed them as they had alwayes loued him and kepte their faith to him, that they would in the best sorte they might, conserue the Realme and estate to <hi>Antigone</hi> hys sonne. Whiche <hi>Antigone</hi> after he had heard the pitifull newes of his fathers captiuitie in the citie of <hi>Patras,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereof so sorowful,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patras.</hi>
                  </note> as he could not be more. And incontinent when he had made him his mourning gown to mourne, he sent letters and Ambassadours into euery countrey, towardes the other Kings, praying and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to make intercession to <hi>Seleuke,</hi> for deliuerie of his Father. He sent also Ambassadoures to <hi>Seleuke,</hi> praying him to take all such goods as Fortune hadde left him for the ransome of his father, and besides offred, if it so liked him, to come him self to be an hostage or pledge for his sayd father. He farther desired him presently to shewe and declare his humanitie and curtesie, wherein he had euer surmounted all the rest of the Kings. The like request made al the other Kings, except <hi>Lysimache,</hi> who was so cruell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The crueltie of Lysimache.</hi>
                  </note> that where the reste entreated for his deliueraunce, he not onely refused to make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but contrariwise offered <hi>Seleuke</hi> a great summe of money to put him to death. Whereunto <hi>Seleuke</hi> gaue no eare, but blaming and detesting his crueltie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie, refused his request and money. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he still looked for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming of <hi>Antioche</hi> his sonne, and <hi>Stratonice,</hi> bycause he would at their requestes and pleasure deliuer him: to the ende, they shoulde for that deliueraunce receyue all the thanke, fauoure, and good will at his handes. Howbeit, the matter (vnder colour of long looking for them) was so procrastinate, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:10248:162"/>
in the end had no nÃ©ed of their helpe. For although he see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miserie ineuitable which happened him, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined he paciently to endure and abide it, and after hir comming, he made semblaunce that he mÃ©ekely bare it. And although from the first houre he was brought in to that place, he in hunting, running, and exercising his persone, aswell on foote as on horsbacke passed the time, yet neuerthelesse after a while he helde and kepte an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of life. For, where before he tooke pleasure in trauell, he nowe gaue him selfe wholy to reste, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing but banquets, feastes and other suche like pleasures, done without trauell of the body: were it by that meane to passe awaye hys melancolie humour, or else bycause it sÃ©emed he had founde out the right order of life, which he alwayes desired: detesting and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his labours and trauels heretofore taken, and the daungers and miseries which he through ambition and vaine glorie had oftentimes aduentured. For to that only ende had he beaten and trauelled the Seas and all Countreys, hoping euer after to take his rest and ease: whereby he might vse the remnaunt of his life in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delightes, which ease and rest he there found, vnlooked for. And surely, these are the endes and issues of the warres which vicious &amp; couetous Princes so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely desire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Against ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Princes.</hi>
                  </note> and with great laboure and trauell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, placing their whole pleasure and felicitie in them: wherein after my iudgement they not onely greatly erre, in reputing vices for vertues: but also in desiring to liue an idle and voluptuous life, sÃ©eke after, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low those things which are quite contrarie to pleasure. But after <hi>Demetre</hi> had about thrÃ©e yeares bene at <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronnese:</hi> what with banquets, rest and ease, pleasures, and ydlenesse, he fel into so grÃ©euous a maladie, that in the ende he died thereof: when he hadde liued. lxiiij. yeares. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the news soone after were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole worlde diuulged and spread abroade, and
<pb facs="tcp:10248:163"/>
so many as vnderstood it, greatly blamed <hi>Seleuke,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so vngentle towardes his Allie. Him selfe also was very pensiue and heauie in that he had greater suspicion of his friend and Allie than nÃ©eded, and shewed him selfe more wretched and fearefull than <hi>Dronichete</hi> the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> a barbarous and vnciuill man, who after he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Lysimache,</hi> frankly and frÃ©elie set him ageyne at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Howbeit, he commaunded, that for his sepulture and buriall al the honours, ceremonies and solemnities that were possible should be made, whiche woulde be to tedious to recite, and sÃ©eme rather a Tragedie than an Historie. In so much that when his sonne <hi>Antigone</hi> was aduertised of his death, he with his whole Nauie went to Sea and sailed into <hi>Syrie,</hi> to get togyther his Fathers Ashes. But being about the Isles, he mette certen mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sangers which brought them, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he receyued them &amp; enclosed it in a box of massiue gold, and sette it in the Poupe of his ship Royall, making his course directly to sayle to <hi>Corinthe.</hi> And as he sailed alongest the Cities of the countrey of <hi>Cheronnese,</hi> the Citizens with solempne processions came oute, some bearing Crownes of gold, other brought Mourners to accompanie the dead body. In this sorte was borne and accompanied <hi>Demetre</hi> hys body in the very top of the poupe of the ship which was couered with purple, and crowned with golde, hauing also about it a great numbre of lustie yong Souldiours, all armed in white, which renued the remembraunce of the dead. He had also an excellent Musician, named <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophante,</hi> who in all swÃ©etnesse and hermonie, soong the Psalmes and songs accustomed in suche a case, and the Gallie sclaues, with so great consonance haled their ores, that they aunswered <hi>Xenophante</hi> his song:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Xenophante.</hi>
                  </note> and al with one voyce, made dolorons and lamentable noyse, very pitifull to heare. Finallie, when he was arriued at the Porte of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the townes men came out to mete it, and sÃ©eing the yong <hi>Antigone</hi> in mourning apparell,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10248:163"/>
al sadde, and besprent with teares, were so moued with pitie, that they all at one present gaue a maruelous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable dolorous shoute and crie. From thence was the body carried into the Citie of <hi>Demetriade,</hi> whiche he him self founded, and called after his owne name, and it peopled with the places nÃ©ere about, as if it had bene in his owne propre domicile. Of the sayde King <hi>Demetre</hi> descended a right noble and honorable ligne or steme. For he left behind him by hys wife <hi>Phile, Antigone</hi> and <hi>Stratonice:</hi> and by <hi>Deidame, Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>der,</hi> who liued in <hi>Egipt.</hi> Ouer and besides these, he left two other yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, both named <hi>Demetre,</hi> whereof the one named <hi>Demetre</hi> the long, he had by his wife <hi>Illiriade</hi>: and the other he got of <hi>Ptolomayde,</hi> who after reigned Lorde and King of <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> There are some also which saye, that <hi>Barrabe</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Euridice,</hi> was likewise his sonne. Thus after hys death the succession and posteritie of the sayde <hi>Demetre</hi> obtayned and enioyed the realme of <hi>Macedone,</hi> vntil the reigne of King <hi>Perse,</hi> whome the <hi>Romaynes</hi> after vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and expulsed.</p>
