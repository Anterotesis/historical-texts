            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Of that we call the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> of all</l>
            <l>It was the best, then happen'd no contest;</l>
            <l>No Points of Honour was our interest:</l>
            <l>All mov'd for Peace, Justice her self did Reign,</l>
            <l>No trespass then was done; no projects fain'd.</l>
            <l>But when <hi>Astrea</hi> fled, then men began</l>
            <l>To share the Earth, to parcel out their Land;</l>
            <l>And by their sweaty brows they gat their Bread,</l>
            <l>Now Masters Rule, and Slaves by them are fed:</l>
            <l>An Age of Brass soon follows this, be'ng worse,</l>
            <l>Strife now takes place, the Earth becomes a Curse.</l>
            <l>Proceeding careless, they themselves did wrong,</l>
            <l>For raging malice in their breast did throng;</l>
            <l>The Sea not limited was in discourse;</l>
            <l>And by our power and excelling force;</l>
            <l>We soon became Lords of the Narrow Seas;</l>
            <l>And who then dare resist! who dares displease?</l>

            <l>The <hi>Dutch</hi> no sooner thriv'd, no sooner grew,</l>

            <l>What would you not if that you power had?</l>
            <l>Why were your Nets not spread? why was your care</l>
            <l>Slackn'd to fish the last foregoing year?</l>
            <l>Sure <hi>Neptunes</hi> rage was stir'd, you did not pay</l>
            <l>His duty due; so he gave Haddocks way</l>
            <l>To seize your Corps; your brawny sides to eat,</l>
            <l>To let the remnant know you prov'd a cheat.</l>

            <l>What ails your Spirits, do you courage lack?</l>
            <l>Then soon renounce, and right us as before,</l>
            <l>Or from the <hi>Texel</hi> we'l increase our store.</l>
            <l>Six shall not one resist, one six shall beat,</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Diamond</hi>'s true, it is no eounterfeit.</l>
            <l>If Tar or Cordage lies within your close,</l>

            <l>Our souls are generous, and wo'nt become</l>
            <l>The scorn of <hi>Pedants</hi> twice; but hate your Drum;</l>
            <l>Rejoyce you may, since that prosperity</l>
            <l>Attend not vertue alwayes, but do fly</l>
            <l>
