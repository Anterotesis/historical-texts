            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>JOhn Cory,</hi> of the Pariſh of S. <hi>Clemens Danes,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Gent maketh Oath,
That about the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1689. he this
Deponent was deſired by the Right Honourable
the Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to bring one Mr. <hi>Michal Levy,</hi>
a Merchant and Jew to ſpeak with him; which ſoon
after this Deponent accordingly did, at his Lordſhip's
Houſe at <hi>Parſons Green:</hi> where, in this Deponent's
hearing, his Lordſhip told the ſaid Mr. <hi>Levy,</hi> That the
occaſion of his ſending for him, was to acquaint him,
That their Majeſties wanted Mony, and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Jews to be a wealthy People, and could
lend them a conſiderable Sum upon the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at ſeven <hi>per cent,</hi> for carrying on the War
againſt <hi>France,</hi> and that if ever they expected Favour
from the preſent Government, then was the time to
deſerve it, by complying with their Majeſties Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Words to that effect. To which Mr. <hi>Levy</hi>
replyed, in this Deponent's hearing, That there was
not above ſeventy or eighty Families in <hi>England,</hi> and
of them not above ſeventeen or eighteen were Men of
any conſiderable Eſtate; nevertheleſs he would uſe
his Endeavour to ſerve their Majeſties in what they
deſired; but nothing further was done in it. And
this Deponent did ſoon after receive intimation,
That the Jews had made Entry in the Months of <hi>June</hi>
and <hi>July</hi> of one hundred forty eight thouſand and two
hundred Ounces of Silver, or thereabouts, for beyond
the Seas, as by the Cuſtome-houſe Books may appear,
to which this Deponent refers himſelf. And this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
did ſoon after intimate the ſame in Writing to
the Right Honourable the Lords Commiſſioners of the
Treaſury; who ſent it incloſed to the Commiſſioners
of the Cuſtomes: Who ſent to this Deponent to
ſpeak with him upon the ſaid matter; which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did, and averred the Entries of the ſaid Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
But the Commiſſioners were pleaſed to anſwer
this Deponent, That Forreign Silver imported might
be exported; and Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> in particular gave him an
undue Reprimand for his endeavouring to ſerve their
Majeſties in ſuch an important affair: So that it went
beyond the Sea unſearched, as this Deponent verily
believes.</p>

Dodſworth</hi> Merchant, ſheweth,</opener>
               <p>THat of late Years the Exportation of Silver out
of this Kingdom has been ſo great, that the
Working Goldſmiths, the laſt Seſſions of Parliament,
petitioned for Redreſs thereof, and in their Petition
and Paper they aſſert, That the Mill'd Mony of this
Kingdom is uſually melted down and exported, not
only to their own Diſadvantage, but to the Nation in
general, (a Copy of which Petition and Paper are
annexed).</p>
               <p>That your Petitioner taking notice thereof, hath
examined and found, That by the Entries at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
houſe <hi>London,</hi> from the third of <hi>March</hi> laſt to
the 11th of this inſtant <hi>September,</hi> about 600000 Ounces
of Silver hath been publickly ſhip'd off for <hi>Holland</hi> or
other Forreign Markets.</p>
               <p>That the Law gives leave for Exportation only of
Forreign Bulloyn, and that he was informed if it were
melted down here, 'twas an Engliſh Manufacture, and
ought to pay Cuſtome outwards; and being adviſed,
that above 60000 Ounces was lately ſhip'd and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off, your Petitioner acquainted Captain <hi>Leneve</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> two Officers of the Cuſtomes therewith,
and went in perſon with them on board one of the
Ships, where they found about 35000 Ounces, and
that about 16000 Ounces was found mix'd Metal, not
worth 4 s. <hi>per</hi> Ounce, when the Standard was 5 s. 2 d.
and thereon concluding it an Engliſh Manufacture,
the Officers ſeized it, as <hi>per Affidavit.</hi> annexed appears.</p>
               <p>That ſoon after they acquainted the Commiſſioners
of the Cuſtomes thereof, who drew up a <hi>Quaere</hi> to be
put to Mr. Attorney General (a Copy whereof is
likewiſe annexed) and both Parties concluded to be
guided thereby, as to point of Law; But Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's
Opinion favouring the payment of the Cuſtomes,
Sir <hi>John Worden</hi> declared againſt breaking an old
Cuſtome, and would not give any order for bringing
that which was ſeized on Shore; and in fine diſcourag'd
the whole Proceeding, ſo that the Officers are fearful

               <p>THat your Petitioner having for ſome Months paſt
taken notice of the unuſual ſhipping for <hi>Holland</hi>
great quantities of Silver, by the Jews and ſome others,
and alſo being acquainted that the Working Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths
had, the late Seſſion complained thereof in this
Honourable Houſe, aſſerting that the Mill'd and other
heavy Coyne of this Kingdom was melted down, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
him to enquire, Whether the Silver thus
ſhip'd out was really Forreign Silver, as entred in the
Cuſtome-houſe, and ſo by Act of Trade 15 <hi>Car</hi> 2. to
paſs out free, or Silver melted down here, and ſo an
Engliſh Manufacture, which by the Act of Tonnage and

went on Board one of the Ships outward bound,
where they found about 35000 Ounces of Silver, all of
Engliſh caſting, about 16000 Ounces was found on
the Teſt to be worth not above 4 s. <hi>per</hi> Ounce, and
conſequently a mix'd Metal; this the Officers ſeized,
and on <hi>Monday</hi> following acquainted the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

that Seizure, but ſuffered about 70000 Ounces
more to be ſhip'd off, without Examination whether
Engliſh or Forreign, and without Payment of Duty,
though Mr. Attorney General was of Opinion, That
ſuch as was altered in <hi>England</hi> was lyable to the Duty.</p>
               <p>That thereon your Petitioner laid the caſe before
the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, who refer'd
him to the Commiſſioners of Cuſtomes, from whom no
Report came till the Ships were gone. Copies of all
his Papers relating thereunto are ready to be produc'd.</p>
               <p>That for 16 Months paſt about 1400000 Ounces of
