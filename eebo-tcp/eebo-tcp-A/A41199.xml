            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And albeit he did after such entreaty, scarcely permit these first fruits to appear in publick: Yet we are not afraid (being well aequainted with him) to recommend it to thy favour able acceptance: And are confident that thou wilt finde in it, that measure of solidity and sweetnesse, joyned with perspicuity and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as may help thee to converse more profitably with God, speaking in his Word to his Church, and excite thee to blesse God for him, and the pains he hath taken for thy good: We hope also that by thy acceptance hereof, he shall be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to give further proof of the Gift and Grace

of God in him, by opening more of that precious Treasure; Yea, and that others also may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by invited to put their hand to so necessary and usefull a work upon the whole, (or, at least, the most difficult and most profound) Scriptures, That so the Lords People (whose callings and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary affairs do force them to make most use of this brief way of writing) in their ordinary read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditation on the Scriptures, may have an easie help, ready at hand, to furnish them with matter of meditation, and direction for their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and applying of the Scriptures, according as their duty and present case may require: And this, We say, without prejudice to those, whose abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to buy, and leasure to read, shall suffer them to make use of other larger Commentaries of holy and learned men. But howsoever, This way of brief Exposition of Scripture, among other means, We humbly conceive may prove a profitable help to propagate the knowledge of the Gospel, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the truth of the Religion professed in this Island, when men, even of an ordinary capacity, shall see that We professe in Our CONFESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON OF FAITH nothing, but what imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately riseth from the text of Scripture, and what is very often confirmed and inculcate therein.

Whence it is that Atheism, Irreligion and Profanity do every where abound, and that the Lord (justly recompencing men's wantonness of wit, love of their lusts more than of God, and their not receiving the love of the truth) hath let loose so many errors and delusions, and

And for our encouragement, we may be confident, that the Lord, who knows how to be good to such as seek Him, in the worst of times, whatever may befall the Lords People for a season, shall make Truth still at last to triumph; And that the Labours of His Servants shall not be lost, nor their expectation perish for ever.

So to make a man exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally holy, to be called and esteemed federally holy, as every member of the visible Church is said to be holy, and in Christ, requireth a visible and externall union with Christ, consisting in external covenanting and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous professing of Truths relating to him; the effect of


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94357:6"/>
which union is the communication of common gifts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one according to his measure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6, &amp;c. for this cause the Apostle here calleth all the professed Christians in Philippi, <hi>Saints in Christ Jesus.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. which supposeth some to be in Christ, to wit, in the way presently mentioned, who yet may be found fruitlesse, and consequently unregenerate. 7. The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and parts of a Minister, or of any Church-Officer, do not exempt him from a necessity of being taught, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, reproved and comforted: for, <hi>Paul</hi> directeth this Epistle (wherein he teacheth, exhorteth, &amp;c.) as to the people, so to the Church-officers; <hi>to Bishops and Deacons.</hi> 8. The Bishops mentioned in Scripture, are nothing else but ordinary Pastors, and Overseers of particular Flocks, of whom many might be, and were in one City, such as Philippi; which could not have been, if they had been trusted with the actual oversight of many Congregations, and of whole Provinces, as is now alleaged by those who distinguish betwixt Bishops and Pastors, and make them Office-bearers of a higher degree in the Church: for the Epistle is directed to the <hi>Bishops at Philippi.</hi> 9. As the Lord Christ hath appointed some Office-bearers in his House for the oversight of the souls of his people, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and Elders, here designed by the name of <hi>Bishops,</hi> or Overseers; see <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17. compared with ver. 28. So he hath appointed others, to take inspection of their bodily necessities, that those who are indigent may be supplied by their care, and the charity of the Flock, who are here called <hi>Deacons.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>He giveth reasons for his joy on their behalf: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first, is, Their embracing the Gospel (whereby they were brought unto fellowship with Christ and his Church) and that so readily after the first preaching thereof amongst them; together, with their constancy therein unto that very time. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a real fellowship and communion, which those who embrace the Gospel have one with another, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. and all of them with Christ, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. which consisteth in those nigh relations, and the exercise of mutual duties founded upon these relations, under which one of them standeth toward another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. and all of them towards Christ, and Christ towards them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Hence he calleth their embracing of the Gospel, <hi>their fellowship in the Gospel.</hi> 2. That a people, or person doth readily assent to the call of the Gospel, and remaineth constant in the profession of, and obedience unto it, is matter of thanksgiving and praise unto God: for, this was <hi>Paul's</hi> joy for those Philippians; <hi>even their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Gospel from the first day until now.</hi> 3. It is not


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94357:7"/>
fit that any man, especially a Minister, should boast much of the reality of grace in any upon a profession newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, until after a times trial, it be seen how the person holdeth up in his profession, by walking equally in the latitude of duties, and constantly in variety of cases and conditions, lest haply he be afterwards ashamed of his confidence: Therefore, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not boast much of those Philippians, untill he take some proof of them; <hi>from the first day until now.</hi>

                  <p>A second reason of his joy, was, The confidence which he had of their perseverance in grace unto the end, and of their being carried on by the same power, which did begin the work of grace in them. This he speaketh unto the whole Church, not as if every one in it, to his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, in the judgment of infallible verity, had been truly gracious; But, because in the judgment of charity (which supposeth the best, where it hath any probable appearance, and no evidence to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies) he found it equitable to think so of all, especially, being perswaded that there were many such among them, in whom only this and the like expressions were verified, which were spoken generally unto all. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. compared with Chap. 11. 21. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. They who have received grace, shall never totally lose it, but undoubtedly persevere therein to the end: for, <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>confident of this very thing,</hi> to wit. Of their perseverance. 2. The certainty of the Saints perseverance, is not grounded upon the stability of their resolutions, <hi>Psulm.</hi> 73. 2. nor yet upon the stability of gracious habits in themselves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. But upon the power of God, which is engaged for their preservation against all opposition: for the ground of his confidence is, that God is engaged for the thing; <hi>He who hath begun a good work in you, will

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94357:8"/>
all the foresaid duties for them. 2. That which knitteth the hearts of Christians in the straitest tie of mutual love, is, not so much carnal respects and natural relations, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.) as the real evidences of Gods grace in the person loved: for, <hi>Paul had them in his heart,</hi> because they were <hi>partakers of his grace.</hi> 3. Albeit no precept, or practice, in the whole Scripture, doth evince, That visible Churches are to be constitute of those only, who ought to be accounted truly gracious by discerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; <hi>(Matth.</hi> 13. 28, 29, 30.) Yet this impedeth not, but the Gospel hath been so far blessed in some places, as that the whole members of some particular Churches, by their godly and sober conversation, have given positive evidences of true grace in them, even to very discerning Christians; and that the Gospel may have the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in some particular Churches is yet possible: So <hi>Paul</hi> thinks it meet to judge of them all at Philippi, as truly gracious, to wit, all who were of age; <hi>It is meet for me to think this of you all.</hi> 4. The judgment which one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian passeth upon the inward gracious estate of another, is not alwaies according to the verity and truth of the thing; but it is grounded upon, and flowing from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hopeth the best in things which are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7.) and so may be deceived: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth not affirm possitively that they were all gracious, only it was meet for him to judge so of them, and that because of his charity and affection towards them, which did, and justly might, preponderat with his judgment in the present case; <hi>because I have you in my heart,</hi> saith he. 5. There must be some positive, though not infallible, evidences, of the inward work of grace in a person, before we can warrantably pass a judgment, even from charity, upon him, as truly gracious: for, <hi>Paul</hi> groundeth his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon such evidences; <hi>in somuch as both in my bonds, &amp;c.</hi> 6. It is the part of each professor, to avow, support, speak for, joyn with, and by all lawful means defend those who are suffering for the truth of the Gospel, or employed any other way for the defence or confirmation thereof; for,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94357:9"/>
they were <hi>partakers with him, both in the defence and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Gospel.</hi> 7. When a person, living other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise without offence, is zealous for the Truth of God, owning those who do suffer for it, contributing his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost to uphold it, even when the powers of the world would bring it down, and doth not draw back for fear of any hazard; it is ground sufficient for <hi>Charity</hi> to judge of that person, as truly gracious: for, <hi>Paul</hi> thinketh it meet to judge so of those Philippians, because they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>both in his bonds, and confirmation of the Gospel.</hi>

Such knowledge as enableth a man to discern betwixt Truth and Error, right and wrong, is then worthy to be sought after, when sincerity in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing what is right, and rejecting of what is wrong, is joyned with it: for, he conjoyneth those two, <hi>Ye may discern things that differ, and be sincere.</hi> 3.

It is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Christians to walk without offence, by abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what is grosly evil; but they must also set about the doing of what is good: <hi>being filled with the fruits of righteousness.</hi> 6. It is not the doing of one good work, or of some few, which will sufficiently evidence a man to be righteous, except he aim at the constant practice of everything which is good: for, that is to be <hi>filled with the fruits of righteousness,</hi> or with good works, whereby the sincerity of our righteousnesse is tried, as the tree by the fruits, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 44, 45. 7. That a work be truly good, or, a fruit of righteousnesse, it is necessary that the work be done by one who is in Christ by faith, and by vertue of strength drawn from Christ: for, these fruits required <hi>are by Jesus Christ,</hi> that is, by strength drawn from him: which presupposeth the person to be ingrafted in him, <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 4. 8.

The observing of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that cometh to the Gospel by the suffering of the Saints for Christ's Truth, serveth greatly to remove the scandal of the crosse: for this end would the Apostle have them <hi>to understand that what had befallen him, was for the furtherance of the Gospel.</hi>

                  <p>A second evidence, is, That contrary to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enemies, (who concluded that <hi>Paul</hi> one of the chief Apostles being put in bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> no Minister should have the courage ever to preach again) many Ministers of Jesus Christ, having heard of his constancy under sufferings, were encouraged to shake off fear, and preach Christ more boldly than ever. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

power of unmortified corruption, that it will make a mans most excellent gifts, and the exercise of them in the choicest duties of divine worship, subservient to his basest lusts: for, <hi>some even preached Christ out of envy and strife.</hi> 3.

The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Jesus Christ had need to resist the very first motions of the fore-mentioned evil; seeing, where it is once rooted in the heart, it will make a man prostitute his parts and gifts; yea, the very preaching of Christ, to the service of it: So those of whom the Text speaketh, having once given way to a spirit of sinful emulation against <hi>Paul,</hi> they rest not, until they even <hi>preach Christ out of envy.</hi> 6. Where there are self-seeking men in the Ministery, making a trade of their excellent preaching and other exercises of their gifts and parts, (mainly to get themselves much thought of, and others vilipended) unity cannot long continue in the Church of Christ: but, such spirits, before they fail of their intent, will rather trample upon the Churches peace: for, those two are conjoyned, they preached Christ <hi>out of envy and strife.</hi> 7. Though a man preach Truth, and exalt Christ in preaching Truth; yet if he do it from a spirit of envy, to get others decryed, and himself extolled, he is but an unsincere rotten-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hypocrite (notwithstanding of all his preaching) in Gods sight: for, those men preached Truth, else <hi>Paul</hi> (ver. 18.) would not have rejoyced in their preaching; yet, seeing they preached of envy, they are spoken of as unsincere, and unfaithful Preachers, who preached <hi>not sincerely.</hi> 8. Envie, and sinful emulation, because of the


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94357:13"/>
parts and esteem of others, is a cruel and unsatiable lust, thirsting after the very blood of those against whom they have emulation: for, those men who envied <hi>Paul,</hi> would gladly <hi>have added affliction to his bonds,</hi> and have stirred up <hi>Nero,</hi> by occasion of their preaching, to have taken his life. 9. Though some that preach Christ are but hollow-hearted men, yet all are not so; and the sincerity of those that are honest, is sufficient comfort against those discouragements which might arise from those who are otherwise: for, though some preached Christ out of <hi>envy;</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> comforted himself in this, that others <hi>preached of good-will.</hi> 10. This is prais-worthy in a Minister, when he is stirred up to preach from love to Truth, good will to the work, and to Christ whose work it is, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what in him lieth to encourage all, even the meanest who have their hand at the Work: for, that is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, even to <hi>preach Christ of good will and love,</hi> to wit, love to Christ, to Truth, and unto <hi>Paul.</hi> 11.

A suffering Christian, especially a Preacher, may attain, not only to present sweetnesse and joy under a bitter crosse; but also to a sweet strong perswasion of the continuance of that joy in the time to come: for, <hi>Paul</hi> not only rejoyceth in the mean time, but also confidently resolveth, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> 2. The joy of a Christian under a crosse is grounded, not only upon good presently enjoyed and felt, but also upon that, which by faith is apprehended as yet to come; so <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyceth, and promiseth to rejoyce, because he knew by faith, that <hi>this should turn to his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. So powerfull and wise is God in working, that out of the eater he can bring meat, by ordering our sad afflictions so, that our salvation both temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, shall be advanced thereby: thus was it with <hi>Paul; I know that this shall turn to my salvation.</hi> 4. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are kept constant under sad sufferings, and made to advance in the way towards salvation thereby, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neither from the nature of the crosse, nor yet meerly from the power of inherent grace; but chiefly from the actual influence and renewed supply of furniture from the Spirit of Christ: for, that <hi>this</hi> did turn to his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, <hi>through the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</hi> 5. Prayer conscientiously gone about, is an excellent mean for drawing from God through Christ the choicest of his mercies, not only to our selves, but also to others, <hi>for whom we pray:</hi> So, <hi>through the prayer</hi> of those Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, <hi>supply from Christ</hi> was to be communicated to <hi>Paul.</hi> 6. They who pray best and most spiritually, are not most taken up with the conceit of their own prayers: for, <hi>Paul</hi> imputeth his receipts more to their prayers, than to his own; though none will question but he prayed as much, and as well as any of them: <hi>through your prayers,</hi> saith he.</p>

                     <hi>Paul's</hi> envious adversaries aimed at two things; either to drive him to apostacie, or to incite <hi>Nero</hi> to take his life; and in the preceding Verse it is showen, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew they should be disappointed in both these: Now he explaineth his knowledg and perswasion of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in the first, and sheweth the ground of that perswasion. His perswasion had two parts; the Negative part is, No terrour of flesh should ever make him deny the truth, as a man ashamed of it. The Positive is, That he should continue in the stout avowing of truth, and magnifying of Christ, whether he died or lived: The grounds of this his perswasion were, hope in Gods Word, his earnest expectation, flowing from his hope and by-past experience. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. To turn our back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truth, for eschewing of suffering, saith as much, as that we are ashamed of Christ and his truth: and there fore they who do so, may expect that Christ will be ashamed of them. See <hi>Luke</hi> 9. ver. 26. hence in place of saying, he will not deny truth in any thing, he saith, <hi>in nothing I will be ashamed.</hi> 2. Christians in the case of tryall especially, would be very strict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, so as not to recede from the least point of truth or dutie. Thus the Apostle resolveth, <hi>I will be ashamed in nothing.</hi> 3. The first step towards defection is, a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of, and relenting in the professing and bold avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of truth, when God calleth us to it: and to avow truth boldly, as occasion offereth, is a soveraigne mean to keep us from being ashamed of it. For, <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth those two, his being <hi>ashamed</hi> of truth, and his bold <hi>avowing</hi> of it; the latter as preventive of the former: <hi>in nothing I will be ashamed; but that with all boldnesse.</hi> 4. The avowing of truth boldly under persecution, tendeth much to the magnifying of Christ his truth, for which


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94357:15"/>
we suffer; and his strength which beareth us up under sufferings, being thereby much commended: Hence he calleth his boldnesse for truth, under his bodily suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, a magnifying of Christ; <hi>so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body.</hi> 5. A Christian is not to hesitate much in the matter of his death or life, if so he may get Christ magnified by either of them; for, <hi>Paul</hi> standeth not much, if so <hi>Christ be magnified, whether it be by death or life.</hi> 6. The hope of a Christian, having a word of promise for its ground <hi>(Psal.</hi> 130. ver. 5.) shall never be disappointed: for, <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth all this should turn to his salvation, and that he should be carried through under sufferings, because there being a generall word of Promise for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 28. he hoped in that word; <hi>according to my hope,</hi> saith he. 7.

The frequent experience of Gods being nigh unto us, and honouring of himself by us in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tryals, is a ground for hope to rest upon, that he will not leave us in the present strait; so <hi>Paul</hi> gathereth present confidence from former experience: <hi>that as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, so now also, &amp;c.</hi>

Death is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the godly, but a separating of the soul from the body, a flitting from one place to another, a releasing of the soul from the captivity of the body, wherein it was inclosed, and a setting of it at liberty: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh use of a word to expresse death, rendred here to <hi>depart,</hi> which signifieth to dissolve things before conjoyned, to change our abode, or, our dwelling, to set sail for another Country, and to be released from prison. 2.

Then is our longing after death commendable, when it proceedeth not from desperation, or wearying of the crosse which God hath laid on <hi>(Ionah</hi> 4. 3, 4.) but from a desire to be with Christ: for, here those are conjoyned. I <hi>desire to depart</hi> and <hi>to he with Christ.</hi> 4. The souls of men and women are not annihilated after death, neither do they sleep until the Resurrection; nor are they detained by the way from immediate passing into glory, if they have been Believers, as the souls of others do enter into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting condemnation: for, <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory

after death; but he expected presently <hi>to be with Christ.</hi> 5. There is no proportion betwixt the choicest contentments (even those that are spiritual) which can be attained here, and that exceeding weight of glory which the Saints shall enjoy hereafter, the latter doth so far exceed the former: for, <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, is far better.</hi> 6. Though Christ be present with, and dwell in the hearts of Believers by faith, even while they are here, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. yet all that presence and nearnesse, is but a distance and kind of absence, being compared with that measure of nearnesse to, and presence with him, which shall be enjoyed hereafter: the former being but mediate, through the glasse of Ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. frequently interrupted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 7. and no waies full, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. But the latter shall be immediate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. constant, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. and so full, that they who shall enjoy the meanest degree, will finde no inlack, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15. for, he saith after his departure, <hi>he will be with Christ,</hi> as if he had never enjoyed his presence until then. 7. The Church of Christ hath much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by injoying of faithful Ministers, and suffereth much by their removal; for, <hi>my abiding in the flesh is needful for you,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> 8. It is only the publick good of the Church, and others of whom we have charge, and not particular contentment which can be enjoyed here, that ought to cast the ballance of our affections towards a desire of having our life prolonged: for, only this hath weight with <hi>Paul,</hi> while he saith, <hi>to abide is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you.</hi>

The Lord in mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prolongeth the life of useful instruments, and keepeth them from Heaven the longer, that the Church may reap advantage by their labours: So <hi>Paul was to abide and continue with them all.</hi> 2. A faithful Minister, though he be not tied to submit to the losse of Heaven and salvation; yet he ought contentedly to spare the enjoyment of it for a time, if so be his life may do good to the Church of God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> is content upon this accompt that his life be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed: <hi>having this confidence, I know I shall abide.</hi> 3. God alwaies can, and sometimes doth so calm the rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, that they do not execute the evil by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against his Servants, whom he still preserveth and doth deliver from death and bonds, so long as he hath work for them: for, saith <hi>Paul, having this confidence, I know, &amp;c.</hi> His confidence, that he should be delivered, doth import, that God may deliver when he pleaseth, and that at least, considering the present posture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, it was very probable that he should be delivered: If it do not also import a certainty of faith, grounded upon some particular revelation, that it should be so: for, the word most frequently signifieth an assured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. ver. 16, 17, 18. Where <hi>Paul</hi> doth seem


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94357:17"/>
to insinuate, that after his first captivity and compear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before <hi>Nero,</hi> he was set at liberty, and did preach the Gospel among the Gentiles; though he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apprehended and put to death. 4. They who have received a great measure of gifts and graces, and have the opportunity of enjoying the fellowship of others, should improve their time and parts, in their place and station, for the spiritual advantage of those with whom they converse: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> look on his continuance with them, that it should be for <hi>their furtherance.</hi> 5. As there is no grace, wherein Christians ought not to aim at progresse and growth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. So, especially, they would labour to grow in faith, as being that grace, which by it's growth, is cause of growth in all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it is the mouth which sucketh the milk of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: and therefore Satan obstructeth our growth in that grace most, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32. Hence the Apostle would aim at their growing in this grace especially: <hi>for your furtherance and joy of faith,</hi> saith he. 6. As there is a joy of sense, <hi>Job.</hi> 16 24. So there is a joy arising from the solid satisfaction which the heart doth receive from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on Christ and the Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60. 6. which is here called the <hi>joy of faith.</hi> 7. The several instances of Christs kything his power and good will in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Church, or of any particular member thereof from a desperate strait, should be improved for streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our faith, and increase of holy boasting and gloriation in God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth the fruit of his deliverance <hi>should be the furtherance of their faith,</hi> and that their <hi>rejoycing might be more abundantly in Jesus Christ for him;</hi> that is, because of Christs power and good will to them, manifested in his delivery. 8. Where there is sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with Christian sufferers under their crosse, there will be a sharing with them also in all the choice advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which are to be obtained by their delivery: for, the Philippians did partake with <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds v. 7. and as a fruit hereof, they are to reap much spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by his delivery from them: <hi>that your rejoycing

The more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected mercies are, before they come, the more of God will be seen in them, and the more of joy in God will be because of them, when they come: for, <hi>Paul</hi> was a gone man in humane appearance, being prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his delivery almost hopelesse, and therefore their <hi>rejoycing</hi> was to be the <hi>more abundant in Jesus Christ by his coming to them again.</hi>

                  <p>In the third part of the Chapter, he exhorteth them.

There is nothing concerneth Christians wherewith they should be taken up so much, as how to beautifie the Gospel which they professe, by a holy conversation suitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: for this is the only thing he would have them minding: and that more than any thing which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him; <hi>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel.</hi> 2. As there is nothing which gladdeth a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Minister more than the holy life of those that are committed unto his charge: So the joy and contentment of an honest Minister, should be conscientiously sought after by the people: for, he useth this as an argument to incite them to walk as becometh the Gospel, that his hearing, or seeing of it, would make him glad, <hi>that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs:</hi> which words do not necessarily import his

doubtfulnesse of his coming, contrary to what he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to speak, ver. 25. he onely hereby sheweth. 1. that they were not so much to be taken up with that, whether he came or not, as with their own duty. Secondly, how much their living like the Gospel would refresh him, so that although he should be deprived of that comfort, which he was confident to injoy in their fellowship, yet, to hear of their Christian conversation, would refresh his spirit under that want. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. This is one part of a conversation becoming the Gospel, to be zealous for truth, standing to, and striving for the defence thereof against errour, and unstability in truth, which reflect as much on the Gospel, as profanity of life: for <hi>Paul</hi> explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this conversation, which becometh the Gospel, by <hi>a standing fast, and striving for the faith of the Gospel,</hi> that is, for the doctrine of faith held forth in the Gospel. 4. It concerneth Gods people much, to be throughly one among themselves in this conflict for truth against error: therefore doth he presse them so much to be one, while he saith, <hi>that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one minde, striving together;</hi> where every word expresseth a part of this unity, to wit, union in <hi>spirit,</hi> or judgment and opinion; union in <hi>minde</hi> or affection; and union in design and endeavour, while they <hi>strive together.</hi>

                  <p>The second branch of living like the Gospel (which also explaineth the first) is a spirit of courage under suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from the enemies of truth, which he presseth from the consideration of two things, which they might read in their couragious sufferings, to wit, namely, that their so doing, portended destruction to enemies, and salvation to themselves. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the people of God have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes some to be their adversaries for truth; so they may attain to such a high pitch of courage, that the utmost of adversaries malice and rage, will not terrifie them, to

The more of sufferings for truth the people of God are made to under-go, and the more there be of Christian courage, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of enemies rage and boasts under sufferings, there is the more evidence of delivery unto the Church, and of ruine here and hereafter to her enemies, <hi>which is to them an evident token of perdition.</hi> 4. Christian courage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sufferings for Christ and his truth (which alwayes pre-supposeth faith in Christ, ver. 29.) though it be not, meritorious of heaven; yet it evidenceth our right unto it: <hi>but to you of salvation.</hi> 5. It is of Gods free grace, and from his speciall disposing, that crosses and sufferings for truth (which in themselves look like displeasure and wrath from the Lord) should contribute any thing unto the salvation of the sufferer, or be a promising evidence of it: this much is meant by the last words, <hi>and that of God.</hi>

                  <p>Here is another argument exciting them unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courage under sufferings for truth, to wit, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was required of them, but what was given unto them: for, as grace to believe in Christ, so grace to suffer couragiously for Christ, was a part of Christs purchase for them, and for his sake to be gifted over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. To believe in Jesus Christ, or to suffer christianly for him, goeth beyond the reach of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall strength. It is an honourable gift, and that freely

Faith in Christ must go before Christian suffering for Christ: so that to suffer for him, is of greater importance, and in some respects more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, than simply to believe in him; for, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, <hi>it is given to believe,</hi> in the first place; and then, <hi>to suffer;</hi> but there is a gradation in his speech from the lesse to the more, <hi>not onely to believe, but also to suffer.</hi> 4. This may incourage very cowards to be stout under Christian-sufferings, that grace to suffer, and all things necessary to make us suffer aright, are purchased unto our hand, and freely given unto us in behalf of Christ: for, this is the force of the Argument contained in this verse: <hi>for unto you it is given, &amp;c.</hi> 5.

                  <p>He giveth a third reason to inforce the same duty, to wit, That their sharpest sufferings would put them in no other condition then that, wherein he himself was, as partly they saw when he was at Philippi: see <hi>Act.</hi> 16. ver. 19. &amp;c. and partly they had heard by the relation of others since. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The first, <hi>that ye be like-minded,</hi> signifieth in general, their unity in judgment, love, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and action: which is sub-divided in the three particulars following. The second, <hi>having the same love,</hi> expresseth unity of will and mutual affections. The third, unity of design and endeavours. The fourth, unity in judgment and opinion. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The most famous, and prais-worthy Churches have their own failings and infirmities: So this Church, though highly commended, Chap. 1. yet hath had their own differences and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of minds, renting of affections, and carnal emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions flowing from their differences, as appeareth from this vehement exhortation to concord and unity. 2. As unity and concord is necessary in it self, and at all times: (Hence the Apostle doth so earnestly presse them unto it) So it is most necessary and comfortable, especially in suffering-times: Therefore the Apostle, having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94357:21"/>
in the close of the former Chapter, of those sufferings which they were to undergo for Christ and Truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth as a conclusion from thence this exhortation unto unity, <hi>If there be therefore, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As they who have received any spiritual good from Jesus Christ, by the Ministerie of the Word, ought to have those in high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, whom the Lord hath made instrumental for their good; and to evidence that respect unto them, chiefly, when they are in a suffering case: So the servants of Jesus Christ ought to improve any personal respect or weight which they have with people, for working of them up towards that, wherein their spiritual good doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist: for, <hi>Paul</hi> obtesteth them by all that good, for the working whereof in them, his ministery had been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; as also by that compassionate and tender respect which they did owe unto him, being now in bonds, that they would tender his joy and comfort; and chiefly that they would evidence their respect unto him, by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after unity and concord, which was more for their own good, then his; and is here mainly pressed-after by him, the fulfilling of his joy being sought-after onely as a mean to that end, and as an argument to perswade the thing pressed: <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ &amp;c. if any bowels and mercies; fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> saith he. 4. So necessary is unity and concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God, that the enjoyment of Christ's presence, and of spiritual consolation flowing from it; the reaping of any spirituall advantage, by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and love of the Saints; the entertaining of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God through the operation of his Spirit in us, do in a great part depend upon it: our own differences, carnal emulations, renting of affections, crosse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary actings, do in a great measure obstruct all those, by making Christ withdraw his presence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. and one of us coldrife and uselesse unto another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15. and by grieving the Spirit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. compared with 31. Hence the Apostle obtesteth them by all those, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

is God equall with the Father, having the same divine Essence: for, the divine Names, divine Properties, Works and Worship, are ascribed unto him: See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23.

Then is ones abasement a vertue, and worthy to be imitated, when it is voluntarily under-taken for the glory of God and the good of others, and not when it is constrained, or only imposed upon us, as a just punishment for our self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting, or any other sin: Christ's humility propounded here for our imitation, was such, as is imported in the sense and scope of these words; <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equall with God:</hi> The drift whereof, is, to shew, that Christ, knowing himself to be the true God, and not to have usurped that divine honour, did willingly under-go that low condition, and was not constrained to it, as a punishment for usurping upon that, which was not his own by right, as the Devils were thrown down from Heaven because, as is commonly conceived, they would by robbery have usurped divine honour, or to be equall with God. 8.

Jesus Christ, by his Incarnation and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the nature of man, did empty himself of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, splendour and majesty, which before he had: not by ceasing to be what he was but by assuming something to himself, which before he was not, to wit, the humane nature: in which respect, as being now God-Man-Mediator, he is lesse than the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 28. under the infirmity of which nature, he did hide for a time his divine glory, so that very little of it did appear, and to some few only, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 2. <hi>he became of no reputation.</hi> In the Greek, it is, he emptied himself. 11. Such was the love of Christ unto lost sinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13. and to the glory of his own and his Fathers mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to be manifested in their salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. that willingly, and of his own accord, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint (except that of love) he laid aside his glory, and became low and empty for their good: for, <hi>he made himself of no reputation.</hi> 12. Jesus Christ, the second Person of the Godhead, did assume to himself the true and reall nature of man, having the same essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties with the natures of other men: for, <hi>he took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likenesse of men:</hi> which <hi>likenesse</hi> denoteth, not onely a similitude in outward shew and appearance, but in the very essential parts: See <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3. 13. Christ assumed to himself the humane nature, not as it shall be in glory, perfectly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; but as cloathed with sinlesse infirmities, even such as are in us the punishment of sin; and did dimit himself to be one of the lowest condition of men: for, <hi>he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the form of a servant,</hi> and not of a glorified Saint. 14. Though Jesus Christ did take upon him the whole nature of a man, consisting of a true body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and a reasonable soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38. Yet he did not assume the person of a man; so as to be two Persons, one as God, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as Man: he is one Person still, the humane nature subsisting in the second Person of the Godhead: so, <hi>he


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94357:25"/>
took to himself</hi> not a servant, but <hi>the form,</hi> or, nature of <hi>a servant,</hi> and he remaineth the same <hi>he,</hi> or, person, after incarnation, which he was before: <hi>be took to himself:</hi> See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. 15. Though there be but one Person in Christ; yet there are two distinct Natures, the Divine, and Humane, without confusion or mixture, every one reserving their own distinct properties: so he <hi>took on him the form of a servant;</hi> but did not change the form or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a servant, to the nature of God: See <hi>Luk. 2. 52.

The truth and reality of Christ's humane nature, was evidently known unto those who did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him, by the fashion and proportion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the whole strain of his carriage and actions, they being such as are in, and use to be gone about by other men: for, so much is meant by his <hi>being found in fashion as a man.</hi> 17. Jesus Christ, though God equall with the Father, and so above all Law given unto men, yet being incarnate, did take upon him the yoke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the Father's will revealed in the Law; that by the obedience of one, many might be made righteous: see <hi>Rom. 5. 19.

Philippians to humility, and self-abasing for the good of others: because, as Christ after his humiliation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, so might they expect to be exalted also in their own kind. 2. The Lord Christ having abased himself to the lowest degree of misery, which he engaged to undergo for our Redemption, was afterwards (and that by vertue of the Covenant of Redemption, see <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10.) exalted by the Father, to the highest pitch of divine glory: so he maketh his exaltation depend upon his humiliation, the one as the necessary consequence of the other; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God also highly exalted him.</hi> 3. Through vertue of the personal union betwixt the divine and humane nature in Christ, those things which are proper only to the one nature, are ascribed unto and spoken of the whole person: So here, though somwhat of this high honour, bestowed on Christ in his exaltation, be verified only in the divine nature, to wit, in so far as this exaltation speaketh the manifestation of divine glory and majesty, which was before hid: and though somwhat of it be verified only in the human nature, in so far, as it includeth his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ascension; yet the whole of it is ascribed unto the whole person: for, he <hi>exalted him,</hi> to wit, the person God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and <hi>hath given him a name:</hi> So that divine glory and majesty, though it be not in the humane nature, yet is, and doth shine forth in that person, which is man; and though not the Godhead, yet the person, who is God, did rise from the death, and ascend from earth to heaven. 4. As the giving unto Christ a name, which is above every name, doth prove him to be true God, enjoying honour and majesty truly divine: for, what else can be meant, <hi>by a Name above every name?</hi> So, the bowing of every knee unto him, as of right belonging unto him, doth evince the same truth: for, hereby is intended that divine honour, due to God only, should be given unto him, as appears from <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. 5. This <hi>Name, which is above every name,</hi> or, the Divine Nature, Divine Properties, Majestie and Splendor truly divine, is said to be given unto Christ, not, as if in the


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94357:26"/>
dayes of his humiliation he had not been God; or, as if the humane nature after the resurrection had been indued with the divine properties; but because his divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, before hid, was now manifested, and the humane nature so highly honoured, that though it be not changed into the divine, yet that person who is man, is true God, and was to be acknowledged as such. 6. The worship and honour due to God, though it consisteth mainly in the inward affections of faith, love, fear and joy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. yet it doth not exclude the manifestation of these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by the outward gestures of the body, such as <hi>bowing of the knee,</hi> and <hi>confessing with the mouth.</hi> 7. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals in worship are no infallible discriminating evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of these who have true grace, from those who have it not: for here, at the Name of Jesus <hi>every knee shall bow,</hi> both of Elect &amp; Reprobate; <hi>and every tongue shall confess.</hi> 8. The disgrace, contempt and reproach which Jesus Christ did meet with when he was here upon earth, do contribute much for making his glory illustrious now: therefore he saith not, <hi>at that Name which is above every name,</hi> but, <hi>at the Name of Jesus</hi> (which before his resurrection was contemptible, and almost execrable,) <hi>every knee shall bow.</hi> 9. However a small part of the world onely doth acknowledge Christ to be God and Lord, being compared with those who acknowledge him not; yet his glory shall be still upon the growing hand, untill all reasonable creatures in Heaven, Earth, or Hell, subject themselves unto him, and acknowledge him to be the only begotten Son of God: for, <hi>to him every knee shall bow,</hi> &amp; <hi>every tongue shall confess, whether of things in heaven,</hi> as Angels, and the Souls of them who sleep in the Lord; <hi>or things on earth,</hi> as Men yet alive; <hi>or things under the earth,</hi> as Devils and damned souls: For, though Angels and Spirits have neither corporal knees, nor fleshly tongues; yet they have some means whereby they are bound, and shall, whether they will or not, expresse and testifie their subjection to our Lord and Saviour: All which shall have its full accomplishment at the last day,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94357:27"/>
when Devils and damned men shall be made to stand at the Tribunal of Christ to receive their doom: see <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. 10. To bow the knee, and uncover the head at the pronunciation of the syllables of the name <hi>Jesus,</hi> is but a superstitious custom and will-worship, having no warrant from this Scripture: for by the name of <hi>

As the giving of divine honour to Christ doth no wayes impair the glory of God the. Father: so, whoever detracteth any thing from the honour of God the Son (as those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks do, who deny his Godhead) they in so far detract from the glory of God the Father: for the bowing of the knee, and confessing with the tongue, that <hi>Jesus is the Lord, is to the glory of God the Father.</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle, from this excellent example of Christ, so sweetly enlarged, and by a new argument taken from their by-past obedience, when he was present with them, presseth, and enlargeth the former exhortation, exciting them to make constant progresse in the way of salvation, and that with fear and trembling: whereby he dehorteth them from security, pride and presumption, vices oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to these vertues of modesty and humility, which from the beginning of the chapter he hath been pressing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to union. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Then do we take a right view of Christ's most excellent example, when the beholding of him maketh us walk like him, by imitating him in these vertues, which were eminently in him: so <hi>Paul,</hi> having


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94357:27"/>
enlarged the example of Christ, exciteth them to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof; <hi>Wherefore my beloved,</hi> saith he. 2. A Minister may, and in some respects ought to commend the People of God committed to his charge, for their willing obedience unto the Word of the Lord from his mouth; yea, and make known even to themselves the good esteem he hath of them: so doth the Apostle here, <hi>as ye have alwayes obeyed,</hi> saith he. 3. Whatever appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation one Christian receiveth from another, or from their judicious discerning Minister, it should be made use of as a spur to excite to further diligence; and is not to be rested upon, as if having it we had enough: for so the Apostle commandeth, as <hi>ye have alwaies obeyed, now much more work out, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The lesse we have of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward excitements to our duty, and the more of discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to drive us from it, we ought to be the more intent upon it; as hereby giving evidence of our since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that what we do, floweth not meerly from outward principles, but from inward respect and love to that which is commanded: so the Apostle bids them, <hi>now much more obey in his absence,</hi> when he was not present to excite them to go forward; and many seducers were now discovered to draw them backward, that hereby they might evidence the sincerity of that obedience which they gave unto him when he was with them present, as not being eye-service unto <hi>Paul,</hi> but from respect to the command of an omnipresent God. 5. In times of schisms and heart-divisions, it is too ordinary for people to be taken up with trifles, neglecting those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their salvation is most concerned: his pressing of them to <hi>workout their own salvation,</hi> importeth, that through their divisions this work was much neglected. 6. If people were imployed as they ought about that great work, how to get their own souls saved, they would be lesse in Church-renting, and dividing one from another for matters of smaller importance: therefore he presseth them to <hi>work out their own salvation,</hi> that he may hereby divert them from their contention and strife. 7.

                  <p>He gives a reason why they ought to work with fear and trembling, holding off the extreams of lazy security, and carnal confidence: because the beginning, progresse and accomplishment of every good work is from God working freely; and therefore they were not through se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to neglect the motions of his Spirit in them to good, nor yet be puffed up with conceit of their own strength. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The very first motions unto and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of any thing which is spiritually good, are the work of Gods grace: for, <hi>he worketh in us,</hi> not only <hi>to do,</hi> but also <hi>to will,</hi> and that by infusing into the soul a power to will that which is good; and by actuating that power, making us actually to will: So, he not only giveth new supernatural faculties, but also the use and exercise of


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94357:28"/>
them. 2. Though the first motions and beginnings of that which is spiritually good be wholly from God; yet he doth not constrain, or by force necessitate the will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but by his omnipotent power he moveth sweetly, and worketh effectually upon the will, so that he maketh it willing to will that good which is by him intended: <hi>he worketh in us to will.</hi> 3. The natural faculties and powers of the soul, are not made uselesse by grace, as if they were laid aside to do nothing, the grace of God in us in the mean time doing all things; The will of man is indeed renewed by grace, and the will being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, doth also work: for, he <hi>worketh in us to will:</hi> we do will, being wrought upon by God. 4. The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Spirit in working grace, is more than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked moral swasion, which consists only in propounding of the object, and holding forth inducing considerations to make the will close with that object, there being still an indifferency left to man's free-will to accept or refuse, as liketh him best: There is besides this a real influence from the Spirit of the Lord upon the will; a pull of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power, whereby the will is moved infallibly and certainly to close with the object: for, <hi>he worketh to will,</hi> and so determineth the will. 5. Not only are the first principles of, and motions unto that which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good from the influence of Gods grace; but also the flowing forth of these motions, and acting according to these gracious principles, doth flow from the same free grace of God working powerfully in us: for, as he <hi>worketh to will,</hi> so also <hi>to do.</hi> 6. This powerful work of God, whereby he worketh the beginnings, increase, and accomplishments of grace in us, is altogether free, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his good will and pleasure, and is not merited by any thing wrought by us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35. His giving of more grace, is not merited by our use-making of the first grace, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 6. nor yet the first grace by the right use of our natural parts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. for, he <hi>worketh of his good will and pleasure.</hi> 7. Though Christians be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to the diligent performance of all commanded


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94357:29"/>
duties; yet this impedeth not, but the beginning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, and accomplishment of every work spiritually good, is wholly from God; for, exhortations shew what we <hi>ought,</hi> but not what we are <hi>able</hi> to do: hence, though they are commanded, ver. 12. <hi>to work out their own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> yet, it is affirmed here, <hi>it is God who worketh.</hi> 8. To ascribe, with Scripture, the whole work of grace in us, to God as the author, is a strong engine to batter down all confidence in our own strength, and to shake off carnal security, and stir us up to diligence: so far is it from rendering men lazie and secure: for having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, and so to shake off security and self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he giveth this as a reason, <hi>It is God that worketh in you, &amp;c.</hi>

Where a spirit of pride and contention, together with private whisperings and publick hot debates, falleth in upon a Church, it will be found hard for any, who is engaged in that strife, to carry himself so, but somwhat worthy of blame will escape him: for he maketh their living blamelesse, to be the fruit of doing all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmurings and disputings: <hi>that ye may be blameless.</hi> 2.

their doing all things without murmurings: <hi>that ye may be the sons of God.</hi> 4. There is nothing which maketh Atheists and enemies of the Gospel take more occasion to vomit out their spite and malice against it, and the professors of it, than the schisms and sidings, murmurings and backbitings, publick contests and bitter reflexions, which are among Christians themselves: for, he maketh the stopping of the mouths of godlesse Pagans to be a fruit of unity and peace within the Church: <hi>that ye may be without rebuke, in the midst of a perverse nation.</hi> 5.

Then do we stop the mouths of enemies unto truth, when our conversation, for piety unto God, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse unto our neighbour, is such, as may discover unto them their failings, and point out that good way wherein they ought to walk: for, he shews how we may be free of their rebukes, even when <hi>we shine as lights in the world.</hi> 9.

This is imported while the Gospel, which holdeth out Christ, is called by way of excellency, <hi>The Word of Life.</hi> 12. The office of the Ministery, being faithfully gone about, is so painful, weighty, and full of labour, that it may take up any one man wholly, and will prove as wasting of his natural spirits, as any other imployment which can be chosen: hence the Apostle expresseth his pains taken in the Ministery, by running in a race, and other strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consuming exercises: for the word rendered <hi>laboured,</hi> signifieth exercises of that kind; <hi>that I have not run, neither laboured.</hi> 13.

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and assistance sometimes of one man eminent for piety, parts and reputation, will prove so steadable to the Church, labouring under schisme and feared perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that the very intimation of a purpose to send such a one, will adde much spirit and courage unto those who are honest: therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> to keep them from fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, maketh known his purpose to send <hi>Timotheus.</hi> 2.

The crosses and comforts of a Christian, indued with a truly publick spirit, depends not so much upon those things which are of particular concernment to himself, as those which are of publick concernment to Jesus Christ, and to his Church in the World: so <hi>Paul's</hi> comfort, though now in bonds, depended much upon the state of this Church at Philippi: <hi>I may be of good comfort, when I know your state,</hi> saith he.</p>

He concludeth from what is said, his purpose to send <hi>Timothie,</hi> having once seen how himself should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of, in relation to his present imprisonment and bonds, ver, 23. and withall, giveth them hopes, that he himself being set at liberty, should give them a visit shortly, ver. 24. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>The reasons, why <hi>Paul</hi> thought it necessary to send <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> unto them, are subjoyned in this and the two following verses; whereof the first is taken from <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his great desire to be at his Charge, together with his great grief and heavinesse for them, as knowing they would be exceedingly weighted for him, having heard that he was sick. <hi>Dost.</hi> 1. A faithful Minister's affection unto, and longing after his absent Flock, will go beyond his desire after family, friends, and other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for his longing after them <hi>all,</hi> his whole Flock; and not his natural friends only, was that which necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Paul</hi> to send him home: <hi>he longed after you all.</hi> 2. The affection of a Minister unto his Flock, and to their advancing in the way of grace, ought to be such, that even when through necessity of sicknesse, or of other lawful employments, he is withdrawn from them, he may yet still long to be among them: so <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> though detained by sickness, and his necessary attendance upon <hi>Paul, yet longed after them all.</hi> 3. There ought to be that love and sympathy betwixt Minister and People, as to make each of them grieve for the affliction and grief of another: so the Philippians hearing their Minister was sick, are weighted with it, and he knowing they would be grieved for him, becometh full of heavinesse for them: <hi>he was full of heaviness, because ye had heard he was sick.</hi> 4. Grief or heavinesse of mind, because of the hand of God upon our selves, or others, is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with christian patience and submission to provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! Patience moderateth those passions, but doth not destroy them: so <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is commended from this, that <hi>he was full of heaviness, because of their grief.</hi>

                  <p>He sheweth the report of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his deadly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease was true, and commendeth the especial mercy of God, both to <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> and himself; whereby the one was restored to health, and the other thereby delivered from further occasion of great grief. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord doth sometimes suffer his preclous servants to fall in dangerous diseases, not exempting his most faithful Ministers, who, by reason of their labours in the work of the Lord, and the many discouragements whereby their spirits are assaulted in it, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 49. 4.) are as much liable to diseases and infirmities of body as any other: for <hi>indeed he was sick.</hi> 2. The Lord doth sometimes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his servants to fall into desperate dangers, for which there is no humane remedy, that his mercy may be the more seen in their delivery: so <hi>he was sick near unto death;</hi> his disease was deadly and incurable by humane art: hence his restoration to health is looked on as an act of Gods mercy; <hi>but God had mercy on him.</hi> 3. That God preserveth the life of faithful Pastors, is an act of no small mercy, especially unto those who enjoy the benefit of their labours: and the removal of such by death, should be looked upon as no small stroak: <hi>but God had mercie;</hi> and his removal by death would have been <hi>sorrow upon sorrow,</hi> even to <hi>Paul.</hi> 4. Seeing death, considered in it self, is terrible, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 4. the reward of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and a privation of present life, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 26. Deliverie from it, though but for a time, is a mercy even to believers, who by death lose nothing, but gain much, Chap. 1. v. 23. espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if their delivery from death be a mercy unto others: hence it is that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his delivery from death was a mercy even unto himself, <hi>but God had mercy on him.</hi> 5.

Then do mercies weigh with us as they ought, when we look upon the sad effects which would have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the not bestowing of such a mercy: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> taketh a view of the extremity of sorrow which the death of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> would have caused unto him, which maketh him look upon his recovery as a mercy; <hi>but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</hi> 7.

                  <p>Having given and enlarged one reason for his sending <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> he addeth other two.

Secondly, That <hi>Paul's</hi> own grief might he somwhat eased, their Minister being once restored to them, of whom they were deprived for his cause. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

carefully.</hi> 2. The weights and griefs of the godly do prove an occasion of rejoycing afterwards; their even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sorrow, endeth in a morning of joy: So, the grief which these Philippians had, because of their Pastours sicknesse and apprehended death, endeth in joy, when they see him in health again: <hi>that when ye see him again, ye may rejoyce.</hi> 3. It will be somewhat burdensome to an ingenuous spirit, whatever otherwayes be his straits, that others should suffer prejudice, and be at any losse by reason of their kindnesse unto him: So it was matter of sorrow unto <hi>Paul,</hi> that those Philippians, because of their respect unto him, were so long deprived of their own Minister: this was the sorrow which he was to be eased of by his return: <hi>that I may be the lesse sorrowfull.</hi> 4. It is sufficient for modest, submissive, and exercised Christians, to meet with some mitigation of their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though it be not removed from them wholly: So <hi>Paul</hi> looks on this as satisfactory to him, that of the great weight of sorrow and affliction, wherewith he was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, a part was to be removed: <hi>that I might be the lesse sorrowfull,</hi> saith he.</p>

               <p>In the second part, being to oppose his own practice, to their dangerous opinions in the matter of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he sheweth, he had as much to boast of, as they, v 4. which he instanceth in eight privileges, v. 5, 6. In none whereof he did now place any confidence, v. 7. nor yet upon any thing imaginary, without Christ; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this his resolution &amp; practice, by shewing the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to be hereby gained, namely, 1. access to Christ, v. 8. Secondly, his being judged, not according to his own righteosnesse, but Christ's, v. 9. Thirdly, experimentall knowledge of the worth and power which is in Christ, v. 10.

                  <p>THat he may guard those Philippians against the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the false Teachers in the doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he premits an exhortation <hi>to rejoyce in the Lord Christ,</hi> as the author, purchaser, and worker out of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all their other happinesse; excusing himself for his often inculcating of the following admonition, because it was not wearisome unto him, nor yet unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Unity in judgment and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would be so pressed upon us by others, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by our selves, as not to prejudge the purity of doctrine: for, having pressed unity, chap. 2. he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth purity of doctrine as much in this. 2. According as people are tainted with, or tempted unto Error, so should Ministers be more or lesse in the publick refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: Thus the Apostle, writing to the Galatians, entereth a just dispute with the false Apostles, urging reasons, and answering objections, because many in that Church were already seduced by them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. But here, because the Philippians were only tempted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and not much overtaken with Error, he doth not so much dispute, as admonish and exhort. 3. To rejoyce in Christ, that is, to keep our hearts affected towards him, and the doctrine which speaketh of him, to be constantly and with delight making our recourse unto him, and imploying him as the author, procurer, and worker out of all our happinesse here and hereafter, is a choice guard against any Error, which is contrary unto those Truths relating to him: for, the Apostle being to guard against Errors in the doctrine of justification, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth this as a foundation to the whole work, <hi>rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient to know what Jesus Christ is, what he hath done for us, or what use may, and should be made of him; except that the knowledge which we have of him do produce suitable affections in


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94357:39"/>
the heart towards him: for, having made Christ known, chap. 2 v. 6, &amp;c. he inferreth from thence with a <hi>finally</hi> that their hearts should <hi>rejoyce in him,</hi> the word saith as much as there remaining one thing yet necessary. 5. The often repeating and frequent inculcating of such points of Truth as are most for edification of the hearers, ought neither to be burdensome to a Minister, nor yet wearied of by the people: so, to inculcate often the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing admonition was not <hi>grievous unto</hi> Paul, neither were they to weary of it, <hi>because unto them it was safe.</hi> 6. Temptations unto Error; for, the most part are covered over with such pious pretences, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. and lovely baits, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. that there is need of many guards and frequent warnings to keep them off; so the Apostle thinketh it necessary to reiterat again and again, both by preaching while he was present, and now by Letter while he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, this following exhortation, To beware of false-Teachers: <hi>But for you it is safe.</hi>

                  <p>He exhorteth them particularly to beware of false-teachers, who did labour to conjoyn, in the matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, the righteousnesse of works with that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which is of Christ by faith; whom he calleth, first, <hi>Dogs,</hi> because of their barking against the sincere Doctrine of the Gospel, and their railing against the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Preachers thereof; and this all, to get wherewith to satisfie their unsatiable greed. Secondly, <hi>Evil workers;</hi> because under pretence of working well to establish Truth, and build up the Church, they did what in them lay to destroy them both, and were men of wicked lives, ver. 19. However they pretended much zeal for the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and good works. Thirdly, <hi>Concision,</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Circumcision, whereof they gave out themselves to be Patrons and defenders, and designed themselves by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. which name he taketh from them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94357:39"/>
unworthy of it, and calleth them <hi>concision,</hi> as it were, the destroyers and renters of the Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There ought to be a spirit of wise and godly zeal in faithfull Preachers, against the spreaders of Errors, how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their reputation be among the people: so <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>Dogs, &amp;c.</hi> 2. That Ministers may guard the Lords People against seducers, they would labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them, by taking off the vizard of piety, zeal, and other seeming vertues, under which the spreaders of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors do usually lurk that so they may be seen in their own colours; thus they pretended to puritie, to be patrons of good works, and upholders of Circumcision, one of God's Ordinances; and the Apostle taking off the vizard, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them prophane <hi>dogs, evil workers,</hi> and <hi>concision,</hi> or, Church-renters, under pretence of pleading for a divine Ordinance. 3. It is the Duty of the Lords People to know and discern those who preach Truth, from those who preach Error, that they may cleave to the one and flee from the other: <hi>beware of dogs;</hi> the word signifieth <hi>see,</hi> and know them; and from knowledge, eschew them. 4. It is not unbeseeming piety, to use merry words, witty and pleasant allusions; yea, and upon some occasions, piercing jests or taunts; providing alwaies there be no scurrility or basenesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 4 for, as often elsewhere, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 27. So the Spirit of God here maketh use of such, while alluding to Circumcision, he calleth them <hi>Concision,</hi> giving them a name like in sound, but much different in the usual signification, and as much to their disadvantage.</p>

                  <p>He giveth a reason why he did not daign them with the name of Circumcision; because not they, but he, and true Believers had right to that title, they only having the thing signified by circumcision, whereof he maketh

three parts: first, Worshipping God with the inward and spiritual affections of a renewed heart: Secondly, Confiding in Christ alone for salvation, as being the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all these shadows: Thirdly, A denying of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in any of these fleshly priviledges, or in any thing but Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though fair pretences to piety and purity of Worship be alwaies on the side of those who erre from Truth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15. yet the reality of that piety unto which they pretend, is frequently to be found in those who oppose them most: so was it here, <hi>We are the Circumcision;</hi> that is, we have the reality of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and they only a pretence unto, and shadow of it. 2. Circumcision, and the rest of those Levitical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances may be said in some sense yet to continue, in so far as the thing signified by them doth remain: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> calleth true Believers the Circumcision, because they had the thing signified by it, <hi>We are the Circumcision, who serve God in the spirit.</hi> 3. Circumcision was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for this end, that by the outward cutting off the flesh the People of God might be carried on; first, To cut off the sinful fleshly affections of their heart, that so with renewed spirits they might serve God. And secondly, To lay hold on the blood of the promised Messias for pardon of sin, and salvation: for, <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth those two as the thing signified by Circumcision, <hi>We worship God in the spirit, and rejoyce in Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. Though it was sufficient for <hi>Paul</hi> to oppose the inward Worship of the heart to the practice of Circumcision, once an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but now abolished; yet it followeth not that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, while standing in force, may upon that accompt be wholly neglected, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. for if the outward rite of Circumcision had been yet in force, his pretending to the thing signified, would not have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his omission of it. 5. External performance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Worship, without inward exercise of the spirit in faith, love, hope, and mortification of fleshly lusts by the power of Gods Spirit, is scarce worthy of the name of Worship to God, neither will it be owned by him as


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94357:40"/>
such: for, it is this exercise of the spirit unto which <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the name of true Worship; <hi>We are the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which serve God in the spirit.</hi> 6. We should so go about commanded Duties in spirit and truth, as not to rest upon, or glory in them, but in Christ alone and his righteousnesse, as the only meritorious cause of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: So, though they worshipped God in the spirit; <hi>yet we rejoyce in Christ Jesus,</hi> saith he. 7. Confidence in Christ for salvation, and upon any other thing besides him; such as are outward priviledges, external perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, are so inconsistent with, and opposite to one another, that if the one be, the other cannot be: so <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth them here; <hi>We rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle in the second part of the chapter, being to demonstrate the vanity of relying upon any thing besides Christ in the point of justification, from his own practice, sheweth; 1. That he had as much to boast of, upon the accompt of outward priviledges, as any of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yea, or any other whatsomever, if he had found it safe to venture his salvation on such a bottom; and this he declareth, first, in general in this verse. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord in his deep wisdom raiseth up such, as are most fit to oppose seducers, who come not short of them in any thing whereof they glory most; that even wherein they glory they may be found but as others: see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12. Thus, against those who boasted so much in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, as to oppose them unto Christ's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in the matter of justification, he raiseth up Paul to batter down both their pride and error, who had as much matter of boasting that way as they, or any other: <hi>Though I might have also confidence in the flesh.</hi> 2. Then may a man commend himself by making notour what

he hath of graces, parts, or priviledges, equally with, or above others, when his doing so tendeth to beat down the vain glory of those who boast more of what they are than is meet: for, Paul here declareth at length his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, wherein he would yeeld to none: which he could not have done without ostentation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it had been to shew the vanity and pride of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. 3.

                  <p>What he spake in general of his ceding to none in those things, whereof his adversaries boasted most, he maketh now to appear by reckoning forth eight priviledges.

Those things which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, especially the finer sort of hypocrites, rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they come to Christ, are such, as are here rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned forth, and may be reduced unto three heads; first, Church priviledges; such were the first five. Secondly, Strictnesse and zeal in profession; such were the sixt and seventh. Thirdly, A life free from scandal, and as to men, blamelesse; such was the eigth: for <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth all those, as props whereupon men who are destitute of Christ do rely; yea, and himself did once place his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, as appears from v. 7. <hi>Those things were gain unto me. Doct.</hi> 2. A profession of more than ordinary strictnesse in religious observances, is no infallible mark of grace: for, natural men without Christ, yea Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renters and dividing Sects, such as were the Pharisees, may pretend to it: So <hi>Paul</hi> once, to wit, when he was out of Christ, and a renter and persecuter of the Church, boasted in this, That he was a Pharisee, that is, one of that Sect, which pretended to more nor ordinary strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. 3. Where men do once engage themselves in Sects and Schisms, their furious zeal will drive them on to prosecute their nearest relations, and those who have nearest interest in Christ, if they oppose themselves to their damnable Errors; and to place the very substance of Religion, and of doing service unto God, in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of them: So Paul being a Schismatick Pharisee,

Before a man do quite his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and all his other props of vain confidence, to rely wholly upon Christ, he must first know somewhat of Christ's worth and sufficiencie to do his turn; so <hi>Paul</hi> hath some knowledge of a matchlesse excellencie in Christ, which serveth as a motive to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value all other things, to be at him: <hi>for the excellencie of

The bare knowledge of Christ's excellencie and worth, is not sufficient for righteousnesse and salvation, except the heart by falth fasten upon, and adhere to him, being so known: for, the word <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> according to the custome of the Hebrew language includeth the acts of the will, and affections following upon it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 6. and so it is afterward expounded in these words, <hi>that I may gain him, be found in him, having his righteousnesse.</hi> 4. He that hath taken his confidence from off his own righteousnesse, and placed it wholly upon Christ, may and should plead interest in Christ, and boast of him as his: so doth <hi>Paul; the knowledge of Christ my Lord.</hi> 5. A man will not attain to quit his own righteousnesse, and his other props of vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be-take himself wholly unto Christ, untill he be made to do it: the Law and a wakened conscience must drive him out of those lurking holes, before he quit them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. hence, he saith, <hi>for whom I have suffered the losse of all things,</hi> that is, as the merchant suffereth the losse of his goods, by casting them away in the time of a storm, which is sore against his heart if he could do otherwayes and were not through fear of the losse of his life driven unto it: the originall word signifieth such a suffering of losse as this. 6. So excellent is Christ, that all things compared with him, and set in opposition to him, have that much of basenesse in them, that hardly a word base enough can be found to expresse them: so, he counteth, even <hi>all things,</hi> compared with, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to him, <hi>not only losse, but dung.</hi> 7. So compleat is that satisfaction which is to be found in Christ, when he is throughly ventured upon for righteousnesse and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the man which hath so done, needs not, yea, will not repent himself of so doing; or, for under-valuing, quiting, and trampling upon every thing which impeded him from closing with him: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> who had suffered the losse of all things for him, taking a review of what he had done, seeth no reason to recede from it; and herefore in the mean time saith, <hi>I do count them but dung.</hi>

8.

To rely wholly upon the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ for justification, and nothing at all upon our own, conduceth much to the increase of holinesse,


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94357:45"/>
and in no wayes doth prejudge it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. for, the fruit of not having his own righteousnesse, but Christs, is his knowing by experience the vertue of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in raising him from the death of sin to the life of grace: <hi>and the power of his resurrection.</hi> 4. The suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which Believers do undergo for Christ, and for his Church, are a partaking with Christ in those his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he still endureth in his mystical body, the Church: for, so much is taught by those words, <hi>the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his sufferings,</hi> to wit, which he endureth in his mystical body, the Church; see <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. 5. As ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified persons are not exempted from sad sufferings, such as others of Christs mystical body, the Church, are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with; so they enjoy a desirable sweetnesse in them when they meet with them: <hi>Paul</hi> expecteth this, else he would not have desired <hi>to know the fellowship of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> 6. The experience and tast of this desirable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is only felt by him, who by denying his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and laying hold upon the imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, hath made his peace with God: for, the fruit of <hi>Paul's</hi> counting all things losse to gain Christ, is his knowing by experience that sweetnesse which is in <hi>the communion of his sufferings.</hi> 7.

                  <p>Having shown the advantage flowing from closing with Christ, he holdeth forth more of his own practice, and thereby sheweth the duty of a man already ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ, which is, from the sense of his own short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in the knowledge of Christ, his imperfection in grace, and conformity with Christ to endeavour constant progresse, and to aim at no lesse than perfection in all those; that being the scope which the Believer is called to aim at, when he is first laid hold upon by Christ in his effectual calling. Now the Apostle propoundeth this his practice to obviate a mistake which might arise from his former speech, as if he had been perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the knowledge of Christ, and fully conform unto him already, and so needed not to busie himself about Christ further, but might aspire after an higher perfection by conformity with the Ceremonial Law, as the false Apostles did. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>He doth again acknowledge his own short-coming, and sheweth also his constant endeavour after perfection, which he inlargeth and cleareth by a similitude taken from runners in a race, who, without looking behinde, to count how much of the way is already past, as carryed on with such a vehement desire to promove in the way, that they bend their bodies forward, having their heart, eye, and whole course, streight toward the end of the race, untill they attain unto it: Thus was <hi>Paul</hi> carryed on in his christian course, being incouraged by the hopes of the rich reward unto which he was called, and which was purchased for him by Jesus Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is much divine wisdome and prudence required in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94357:47"/>
as in all the duties of their calling, so especially, while they are about to fasten conviction of guiltinesse upon any; left they do irritate their corruptions in stead of curing them. Thus the Apostle wisely points out the vanity of their conceit, who looked upon themselves as having already attained unto perfection in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, not by his expresse taxing of their pride and vanity, but by professing his own humility: <hi>I count not my self to have apprehended.</hi> 2. They who have made furthest progresse in the knowledge of Christ, are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly most sensible of their own imperfections, and most forward in the acknowledgement of them, when God's glory, and the edification of others call them unto it: So <hi>Paul,</hi> who (v. 10.) had nothing so much in his desires as to know Christ, and so doubtlesse knew much of him, yet standeth not again and again to acknowledge his own short-coming and ignorance: <hi>I count not my self to have apprehended.</hi> 3. Progresse in the knowledge of Christ, and holinesse is to be minded seriously and above all other things, not superficially, and upon the by only: so it was <hi>Paul's one thing: this one thing I mind,</hi> or do. 4. The approved exercise of a Christian endeavouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in the way to Heaven, is much like to the carriage of those who are running in a race. First, as the runner casteth not back his eye to reckon how much of the way is already past; so the Christian who would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to any purpose, though he may take a review of what he hath already done, so as therein not only to see his own short-comings, for humiliation, but also to see matter of praise unto God, and incouragement unto himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. Yet he is not so to be taken up with it, as to rest upon it, be puffed up with conceit because of it, as if he had already done enough, or any other way which may retard him in his further progresse: in which respects <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>forget those things which were behinde,</hi> as if he had done nothing. Secondly, as the runner is most taken up with that part of the way which he is yet to run, and bendeth himself forward in it: So the


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94357:47"/>
Christian who would make progresse, must be much in counting what of his way is yet before him; what sins are yet to be mortified; what duties are yet almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched; what hard exercises he may yet be called to undergo; and the more he seeth of that kind, he is to take the more pains for advancing forward: so was <hi>Paul reaching forth unto those things which were before.</hi> Thirdly, as the runner holdeth his eye upon the mark, and steereth his whole course in order to it, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside, or, halting, because of difficulties in the way: So the Christian who would make progresse, must fix his eye upon the end of his race, which is perfection in holinesse, levelling all his actions and endeavours at that mark, pressing forward through all difficulties, discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and stumbling-blocks which are in the way betwixt him and it: So did <hi>Paul; I presse toward the mark.</hi> 4. As the thoughts of the prize and worth of the reward, do adde spirits to the runner, making him run more swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so there is a rich prize, a free reward of grace, though not of merit, to wit, Heaven and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. which the Christian who would make progresse to purpose, should have much in his thoughts; that thereby he may be heartned against all hardships and discouragements, faintings and failings, which he will be assaulted with, and tempted unto: So did <hi>Paul; I presse for the prize of my high calling.</hi> 5. Though Heaven and glory be given as a reward to those onely, who continue in their chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian course, untill they come unto the end of the race; yet it is not merited by their running and persevering: for, as it dependeth upon their effectuall calling, which hath not its rise from man's low endeavours, but from above, even from God's high grace: so it is conveyed unto them through the merits of Jesus Christ: thus it is <hi>the prize of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>In the third part of the Chapter, he exhorteth even those of them, who either had made, or seemed unto themselves to have made furthest progresse, to follow his example, and be of the same mind with him in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before-mentioned: and because some of them, being seduced by the false Apostles, were of a contrary mind in some things, he giveth them ground of hope, that God, who had brought them to the knowledge of the Gospel, would reclaim them from this their errour, and discover unto them the danger of it, v. 15. but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he exhorteth them unto unity and orderly walking, according to the Canon and rule of Scripture in those things wherein they were yet harmonious, keeping mutuall love, and holding off further rents than were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though none can attain unto ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute perfection in holinesse, yet as there are several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in grace; so there is diversitle of growth among Christians; some are but weak, infirm, and babes in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2. others are come to greater ripenesse, indued with a larger measure of grace, and confirmed by much experience, who being compared with the former, are here called <hi>perfect: Let us as many as be perfect.</hi> 2. The greatest perfection attainable in this life, is, to renounce all considence in our selves, to rely wholly upon Christ, and from the sense of our own imperfection in grace, to be constantly aspiring to a greater measure: for, this he prescribeth unto the choicest Christians to be exercised in; <hi>Let us, as many as are perfect, be thus minded.</hi> 3. The approven exercises of holy men mentioned in Scripture, are a clear glass, wherein we are to see our duty &amp; strong incouraging motives to make us go about it; examples being of more force, than bare and naked precepts: So <hi>Paul</hi> draweth an argument from his own practice: <hi>Let


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94357:48"/>
us therefore, &amp;c.</hi> that is, being sensible of small progresse, and of a great way yet before us, let us presse forward: for, so was lie minded, as he sheweth in the preceding verse, and so would he have them minded in this verse. 4. There are usually some within the visible Church, who, being be-misted with errour, do not come up to give through assent unto all divine truths: <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth so much; <hi>if in any thing ye be otherwise minded.</hi> 5. We are to deal more tenderly with some of those who are be misted with errour than with others; as 1. We are to keep charity towards them, and expresse our charity of them, that God who hath begun to inlighten them in other things, would discover unto them those truths, whereof they are yet ignorant: such is the Apostle's charity here, <hi>God shall reveal even this unto you:</hi> even this, as he had revealed other things already. Secondly, they are to be waited on patiently, without proceeding to the severe exercise of Discipline, untill some competent time at least be given, wherein, through Gods blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own endeavours, and the labours of others with them, they may attain to the knowledge of those truths, whereof they are ignorant; or otherwayes be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable: This is supponed to have been <hi>Paul's</hi> mind toward those to whom he speaketh, <hi>the Lord will reveal even this unto you. Doct.</hi> 6. Every one who erreth from truth, is not to be used with this tendernesse; as 1. not seducers, but those who are seduced: for, the Apostle hath spoken, v. 3. and doth speak afterward otherwayes of seducers. Secondly, it is onely those who are seduced, not in fundamentall truths, which are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; but in others, which are not so necessary: for, the Apostle supponeth those, whom he would have thus used, to have attained unto the knowledge of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truths according to the Canon of Scripture: <hi>Neverthelesse in what we have attained, &amp;c.</hi> So that their errour did ly only in some circumstantial truths, relating to those greater ones; as he seemeth also to import, while he saith, <hi>if in any thing, any be otherwise minded:</hi> besides


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94357:49"/>
that it appeareth from the body of the Epistle, the false Apostles had prevailed with few or none in this Church to draw them on to their grossest errours. Thirdly, as their errour is onely in inferiour truths; so, they must not be so devoted unto their own opinions, as, from a desire to propagate them, to rent the Church, and make schismes in it: but, are to walk in a joynt and orderly practice with others in those things wherein they do agree: not creating strife and division, whether in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or practice, about those things wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for, this may be taken as a condition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to be given, and of God's revealing further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: <hi>Noverthelesse,</hi> or only <hi>if we walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.</hi> So there is no ground here for a boundlesse toleration of all hereticks, sect-masters, seducers of others; nor yet to all those who are seduced; except their carriage do evidence them to be studious both of truth and peace. <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. As it is onely God who can reveal truth unto those who are over-taken with errour, by his blessing upon ordinary means, made use of for that purpose: so there are promising grounds of hope that he will do so unto some, to wit, those unto whom he hath discovered many soul-saving truths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and who are labouring by their orderly walking according unto those truths, to edifie both themselves and others: <hi>Pauls</hi> hope is, that <hi>God will reveal even this unto them;</hi> not by any immediate revelation, or any other way without the Word; but by his blessing upon the Word preached, and their own endeavours, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. And that because he had revealed much unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, imported in the words <hi>even this,</hi> or, also this, and withall subjoyneth the condition, <hi>whereunto we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, let us walk,</hi> to wit, unitly and orderly, as souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers keeping rank, without disturbing one another. 7. The Church of Christ, ought not upon every difference of judgement, to be rent in Schismes and Factions, setting up a Church against a Church, or, using crosse endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for under-minding and down-bearing of one


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94357:49"/>
another; but unity and orderly practice according to an uncontroverted rule, so far as is possible, is to be kept, notwithstanding of different judgments: for this the Apostle exhorteth unto; <hi>Let us walk by the same rule.</hi> 8. Upon divided practice, because of different opinions in a Church, there doth necessarily follow further divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and renting, both in judgment and affections: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having exhorted unto joynt practice, he subjoyneth, <hi>Let us minde the same thing,</hi> that is, Let us keep unity, both of affection and judgment, to wit, in those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we do yet agree; importing, this cannot be, except there be a joynt practice.</p>

                  <p>He giveth reasons to inforce the exhortation. 1. There were many, whose example was not to be followed, to wit, the false Apostles: From following of whom, that he may deter them, as he had often before, so he doth now in great grief (as seeing the Church of Christ peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with such false Teachers) point them forth in their blackest colours: First, As being enemies to the crosse of Christ, because they opposed the vertue of Christ's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by which alone salvation is obtained, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. and because they pressed the observation of the Levitical Ceremonies, that, gratifying the Jews thereby, they might shift Christ's crosse, or persecution for the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. Secondly, Eternal destruction should be their reward, if they persisted in that damnable doctrine, without repentance.

The abounding of such Seducers ought not in reason to detract any thing from the respect which is due unto sincere and orthodox Preachers; yea, such will be the more esteemed of by all sincere lovers of truth: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this a reason, why such men as he should be imitated; <hi>Be followers together of me, &amp;c.</hi> v. 17. <hi>for many walk,</hi> saith he, <hi>that are enemies, &amp;c.</hi> 3.

Jesus Christ in his bodily presence, is now in Heaven, and not in Earth; for, saith he, <hi>from whence wee look for a Saviour.</hi> 5.

This second coming of his, although it be abhor'd, and hated by wicked Atheists, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. he being to come unto them as a terrible Judge, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. yet it is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Godlie's expectation; a thing hoped for, and much longed after by them: <hi>from whence also we look.</hi> 7. The reason why his second coming is so much looked for by the Godly, is, Because he is to come, not as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pursuing- Judge unto them, but as a Saviour with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect salvation, and healing under his wings: <hi>We look for a Saviour.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. 8. The consideration of this, That Christ is in Heaven, and to come as a Saviour from thence, hath an Adamantine vertue to draw up the thoughts and affections of the Believer thither: for this is given as a reason why their conversation was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>from whence we expect a Saviour,</hi> saith he. 9. Our bodies now since the fall, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. 19.) are vile and base, liable to death and corruption, to several sores and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; <hi>our vile body.</hi> 10. That vilenesse and basenesse which is in our mortal bodies, is properly <hi>ours,</hi> as being contracted by our sin, by which they were brought down from that glory wherein they were created, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. Thus <hi>our vile body,</hi> or, (as it is in the Original) <hi>bodies of our vileness:</hi> the vilenesse is more ours, than the bodies are. 11. The bodies of Believers, however they be now vile and base, and subject to as many miseries as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of others are; yea, and are liable to the crosse for Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 18. which the bodies of the wicked are not. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. yet Christ in the last day shall work a glorious change in them, a change, not in their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and proportion of members; for we shall still have an organick body with distinct members, <hi>Job,</hi> 19. 27. but delivered from those base and low qualities


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94357:52"/>

                  <p>FRom what <hi>Paul</hi> hath said in the former chapter, he inferreth a vehement exhortation, inforced by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of affectionate compellations, That they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main constant in the doctrine and practice of the Gospel,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94357:53"/>
so as they had done hitherto, and as he had presently prescribed, chap. 3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So ready are we to weary in well-doing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. so unwearied is the Tempter in his assaulting of us, what by reiterating old tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what by presenting us with new ones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. That even those, who for a long time have given great proof of their constancy both in profession of Truth, and practice of Duties, are not so far beyond the reach of backsliding, but they stand in need of frequent and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exhortations to make them stand on their guard against it: So <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth those Philippians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, notwithstanding they had already given large proof of it; <hi>so stand fast in the Lord.</hi> 2. The faith of glory, and rich reward which is laid up to those who persevere unto the end, is a strong motive unto constancy and perseverance: so, from what the Apostle spake in the close of chap. 3. of that glorious change to be wrought upon the bodies of Believers, he inferreth, <hi>So stand fast.</hi> 3. As a peoples profiting by the Ministery of the Word, ought to indear them unto a faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor; so a Minister may, without imputation of flattery, make it known unto the people, and that in the most pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick way, how much they are esteemed of by him; that hereby he may excite them to further progresse. And this use only should be made by people of the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their faithful discerning Pastors, or of any other whose approbation they think worthy to put a price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thus the Apostle here gives them a number of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate compellations, all of them breathing forth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and love unto them, such as <hi>Brethren,</hi> as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the same faith; <hi>dearly beloved,</hi> being such as for their piety had much room in his heart; <hi>and longed for,</hi> his absence from whom was his burden; <hi>my joy,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of whom made him sing under all his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and <hi>my crown,</hi> they were as an ornament unto him, his glory and diadem, being gained to Christ by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and having remained constant, when others had fallen away.</p>

                  <p>He speaketh to two women, who being of some note in that Church, did in some things, as appeareth, relating to Religion, differ as well the one from the other, as both of them from the Doctrine publickly professed in that Church; Them he exhorteth, that laying aside their contention and strife, they would endeavour peace and unity betwixt themselves, such as God would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, ver. 2. And because divisions of that kinde are not easily composed, he exhorteth some one of his once-fellow-labourers in that Church, to contribute his endeavours for helping them to union, because they had been useful to him in their stations, while he was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, and planting a Church at Philippi, with one <hi>Clement,</hi> and some other private Christians; all which in charity he did judge to be truly gracious, and in the number of Gods Elect Children. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Pastors to instruct, exhort, rebuke and comfort, not only the whole Church in general, but also particular persons by name, as occasion offereth, and their necessity requireth: so doth <hi>Paul, I beseech</hi> Euodias, <hi>and beseech</hi> Syntiche. 2. Difference of judgment among professors, in things relating to Religion, is of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as being an occasion of strife and discord, of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of heart and affections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. as causing hurtfull diversions from that which should be our main work, to wast our precious time, and the edge of our spirits upon things lesse necessary, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 4. Paul</hi> looks upon this difference as worthy to be taken notice of, even by an Apostle; <hi>I beseech,</hi> saith he. 3. It is very casual for such differences to fall in among professors, who have been other wise pious and useful in the Lords work: thus


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94357:54"/>
                     <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntiche,</hi> who helped <hi>Paul</hi> in the Gospel, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at ods among themselves: <hi>I beseech</hi> Euodias, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Peace and unity in the Church, and among all the members of the Church, is a thing much to be studied for and sought after: <hi>I beseech they be of the same minde.</hi> 5. But by all means it would be seen to, That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Churches differences be an union in the Lord, and such as he will approve of: so <hi>he beseecheth them to be of one minde,</hi> but, <hi>in the Lord.</hi> 6. We ought to make use of our familiarity with, and interest in others, to set them upon imployments honourable unto God, and profitable unto the Church of Christ, and the true members thereof, so far as their station will permit, and their abilities can reach: so <hi>Paul</hi> maketh use of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirenesse with one above the rest (whom he calleth his <hi>true-yokefellow,</hi> because, as appears, of their being joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed in the work of the Ministery, as Oxen draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under one yoke) to set him upon the reconciling of those two, who were at distance, <hi>and I intreat thee also true yoke-fellow.</hi> 7. As Church-divisions, though ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fallen into <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 37, &amp;c.) are not easily cured; so it is the duty of all, who have power and parts, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them all for the curing of them, and this especially, when the scandalous rent is among such who have been reputed gracious, and have proved steadable to the work of God in their several stations: hence he exhorteth to help those women to union, because they had <hi>laboured with him in the Gospel.</hi> 8. As the Gospel, when it first cometh in power to a place, meeteth with no small op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; so it is the duty, not only of Ministers but also of private Christians, and that of both sexes, keeping still their own stations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. to contribute their uttermost for making of the Gospel successefull: so did they at Philippi, <hi>who laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow-labourers;</hi> the word rendered <hi>Laboured,</hi> signifieth to strive as wrestlers, who make use of all their strength. What their labour was, is not expressed, but certainly it was such as became them


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94357:55"/>
in their stations. 9. The Lord knoweth who are his with as great certainty, as a man knoweth those of his family, whose names he hath written in a book: so much is imported by this phrase, <hi>whose names are written in the book of life;</hi> not that God hath, or standeth in need of any such book for the help of his memory; the speech is only metaphorical, bearing this much, That God hath fore-ordained them to life, and so knoweth certainly they shall be saved, as if their names were all inrolled. Sec 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. 10. Though none can passe a certain and infallible judgment upon others, whether they belong to the election of grace, or not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. yet there may, and ought to be a judgment of charity passed upon all, and every one of such, as elected and chosen, whom we see constant in the doctrine of Faith, studying to be holy themselves, and contributing their utmost for promoving the work of God among others; for <hi>Paul,</hi> from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, pronounceth of such, <hi>whose names are written in the book of life.</hi>

                  <p>He further exhorteth them in all their affairs to the exercise of moderation, whereby they should rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit somwhat of what was their right according to the rule of strict justice, then do any reall hurt unto others, and that because of Gods presence, to wit, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence presently, and by his second comming to judge the world, before it be long. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

or the suspicion of it, to cover all they do from the view of others; but are bound to make their good works ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that others therein may see their duty, and have matter of blessing God on their behalf: See <hi>Matth. 5. 16.

Here is a further exhortation to beware of anxious heart-cutting diffident care, about things worldly, and the successe of what we do undertake in our lawful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: for curing whereof he prescribeth this remedie, that in the conscientious use of their Callings, they would have recourse unto God by prayer, wherein by supplicating for good things, by deprecating deserved wrath, and thankfull acknowledgement of mercies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, they might pour out their hearts in God's bosome, leaving the disposall of all their affairs upon him: <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However there be a lawfull care about things worldly not prohibited, but frequently comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. Yet there is a care not lawfull, to wit, when 2 man exceedeth in care; and so, as to care for nothing but the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 11. and so, as to keep himself upon a continuall rack, as fearing want of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in what he doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 5. and so, as to joyn issue with any thing, though never so sinfull, for preserving or bringing about the thing cared for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. This excessive care is sinfull, and here forbidden; <hi>be carefull in nothing.</hi> 2. As this excessive care doth hinder the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of moderation, by driving men to the utmost of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in all their dealings with others, as fearing, lest by the smallest condescendencie, they undo themselves: so nothing contributeth more to make a man mercifull, gentle, and condescending to the necessity and good of others, though even to his own seeming prejudice than to keep his heart above this anxious, vexing, diffident and heart-cutting care: hence unto the former exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making their <hi>moderation known to all men,</hi> he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth this as an help, <hi>be carefull in nothing.</hi> 3. The best remedie against this excessive diffident care, is, not to run upon the other extream of casting by all lawful care and diligence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 7. but that in the conscientious use of our lawfull imployments, we make our addresse unto God by prayer, deprecating deserved wrath, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for desired successe, blessing him for favours already received, and so to leave the burden of all our care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94357:57"/>
him: this is it which the Apostle prescribeth; <hi>but in everything by supplication and prayer, &amp;c.</hi> 4. All our Prayers would be so composed, as that they may be known to God, that is, approved of him, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the sense of our want, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. put up in the Name of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 16. 23. and for things according to his will, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 14. Let your requests be made known unto God.</hi> 5. There are severall sorts of Prayers set forth here, by three distinct expressions; for the word <hi>requests,</hi> is generall to all the kindes: First, there is <hi>Prayer,</hi> whereby we seek those things which we want from God, acknowledging how unworthy we are of them. Secondly, there is <hi>supplication,</hi> whereby we deprecate evils and judgements, whether felt or feared, acknowledging our sins, whereby we have deserved them. Thirdly, there is <hi>thanks-giving,</hi> whereby we blesse God for favours already bestowed; <hi>by prayer, and supplication, and thanksgiving.</hi> 6. Blessing of God for favours received, is necessary to be joyned with prayer and supplication, there being constant matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving under all conditions, v. 11. and to suppresse that fretting, quarrelling, and impatient humour, which often venteth it self against God in our prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, where thanksgiving to God for favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not joyned with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 7. compared with v. 10, 11.

                  <p>For inforcing the former exhortation, he subjoyneth a promise, that upon their so doing, <hi>the peace of God</hi> (a mystery so deep, that it transcendeth the reach of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason) should, as with a guard of armed souldiers, defend their understandings, will and affections, against


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94357:57"/>
the assault of any temptation, which might otherwayes drive them to discouragement, and vexing diffident cares and fears of suffering from men, upon their exercise of moderation in all their actions. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and tranquility of spirit attainable by believers, flowing from their peace made with God in justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wrought in a believer by the Spirit of God, (hence it is called, <hi>the peace of God)</hi> which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of all created understanding to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, it being a thing almost incredible, that those who are most under the lash of divine rods, should yet have Gods peace; who of all others are most tossed with storms &amp; tempests, should yet injoy a sweet calm in their own mind; who are often destitute of all things, should yet be as little anxious, as if they injoyed all things. A Christian is made up thus, of so many seeming contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that no wonder the Apostle doth speak here of this <hi>peace of God</hi> as <hi>passing all understanding.</hi> 2. This peace of God cannot be preserved, but in the due practice of commanded duties, especially in the exercise of prayer: for, it's promised, if they be diligent in prayer, v. 16. <hi>the peace of God shall guard their hearts.</hi> 3. Where this peace is intertained, it doth marvellously guard the whole soul, wit, will and affections from being overcome by, or disquieted much with the apprehension of losses or injuries, whether felt or feared: This peace with God, and with a mans own conscience in God, is of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worth, that so long as it is injoyed, no other losse is much valued; for, it's promised as a guard against the fore-mentioned heart-cutting care; <hi>The peace of God shall guard your hearts.</hi> 4. All that is in man, especially his soul, and every faculty of it, is as so many patent ports to receive most dangerous temptations, so that there must be a guard set to defend every one of them, otherwayes the temptation getteth most ready passage: thus much is imported, while he saith, <hi>the peace of God shall keep,</hi> or guard <hi>your hearts,</hi> that is, the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>and mindes,</hi> that is, the understanding: It is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever preservation against the on-sets of temptation, be a promised fruit of diligence in the use of prescribed means; yet all the efficacie of those means cometh through Jesus Christ and his vertue working with them, who therefore would be eyed above means: hence this safety from the temptation, though promised upon their diligence in prayer; yet it is <hi>through Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>Lest they had mistaken the Apostle, as if his so much joy for their gratuity had argued him to have been of a dejected spirit through reason of want; he clears himself, denying his joy to have proceeded from any thing of that kind, and that because he was gifted from God with full contentment under every condition, ver. 11. and so he reckoneth several particular conditions, under which he had learned to live contentedly at all times, and in all places: As first, under disgrace, and abundance of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applause. Secondly, store of meat and drink, and utter scarcity and want.

2. The Child of God is subject to change of conditions in things outward, being sometimes in credit, sometimes in disgrace; sometimes rich, sometimes poor; sometimes sick, sometimes in health; sometimes injoying all things necessary for his sustentation and life, sometimes almost wholly deprived of them: so was it with <hi>Paul, I know how to be abased, and how to abound, &amp;c.</hi> 3.

The knowledge of this Lesson is attained, not so much by reading Books, and infixing in our memories directions to that purpose; as by frequent change of condition, and the Lords blessing of our changes for begetting in us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge, how to carry our selves in each condition: thus <hi>Paul</hi> did learn this Lesson, <hi>I have learned and am instructed;</hi> The latter word signifieth, to be initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in holy things, or religiously taught: so there is a piece of divine skill necessary for teaching folk this lesson. 6.

The danger of being mistaken, should hinder no man from going on in his duty, he is to do what he can to take off mistakes, and in the mean time be going on in what is right: so Paul, having cleared himself, proceedeth in his duty, commending those Philippians for their charity; and thereby wipeth off another mistake, which might have risen upon his guarding against the former; <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, ye have done well.</hi> 3.

                  <p>The Apostle sheweth himself mindfull, not onely of the present favour, but also of their by-past liberalitie towards him, ever since he began to preach the Gospel among them; and this not onely when he was labouring among themselves, but also when he was at Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica; and withall doth guard against their suspecting of him, as too greedie in receiving so frequently from them, by shewing he had received nothing as a reward for his work from any other Church in those parts; for the truth whereof, he appealeth to their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a rule of equity to be kept betwixt Pastour and People, that, as he bestoweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them spirituall things by preaching of the Gospel, so they should furnish him with things carnall, by giving an honourable maintenance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. and this a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister may expect and crave, not as a meer gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, but as due debt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. this is imported in the phrase here used by <hi>Paul,</hi> when speaking of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which was bestowed on him by those he laboured amongst in the work of the Gospel, he useth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving,</hi> which is used by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who in their Books of Accompts, do mark what they give out, and what they receive in, as the due price of their ware. 2.

of many, that hardly can they be driven to quit any thing for up-holding of the Gospell, though even an Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> were preaching among them: this <hi>Paul</hi> did find, <hi>no Church did communicate with me, as concerning giving.</hi> Though it may be also, the Apostle did for bear to receive any thing from others, were they never so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for the reasons mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 18, 19. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 8, 9. 3. A faithfull servant of Jesus Christ, who is taken up with a desire after the gaining of souls, will digest many unkindnesses of that sort, passing them over as he best may, especially so long as the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth for him otherwayes, as he usually doth, making some to shew the more of kindnesse, that others shew but little: so doth <hi>Paul</hi> meekly passe over his not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from those other Churches, mentioning with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse the help which he received from Philippi: <hi>no Church communicated with me, but ye only.</hi> 4. This speaketh much to the commendation of a People, when the generall neglect of duty by others, doth not onely not make them neglect their duty, but also exciteth them to be more forward in it: for, from this are the Philippians commended; <hi>no Church did communicate with me, but ye only;</hi> and <hi>ye sent once and again;</hi> they did not look so much unto that which others did, as what they themselves were bound to do. 5. As the Lord may suffer his choicest servants to be driven to worldly straits through want of things necessary; so, usually he makes providence to tryst with their necessity, and answereth it by those who are least obliged, when others who are more bound, doth take no notice of it, or, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently make use of their help: so, even in <hi>Thessalonica, ye sent once and again to my necessity;</hi> when the Thessalonians, to whom he was preaching, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him; or, he could not receive from them, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians sent him supply.</p>

He doth yet guard against their suspecting him of greed shewing that his praising of their liberality, and charging of others with ingratitude, was not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might incite them to give him more, but that they might be incouraged to grow more and more, as in all grace, so in this of liberality, whether towards him or others: the advantage thereof should accresse to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, more than to any other. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Though a man be never so trust-worthy in himself, and never so much trusted by those who do imploy him; yet he ought in wisedome to guard against any sinistrous suspicion which may be taken up against his honestie and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse: so <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> though their Minister, and doubtlesse in great reputation among them, as a man who would have been loath to convert any of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charity to his own private use; yet returneth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Paul</hi> give it under his hand, that he had received the whole sum from him, <hi>I have all,</hi> or, <hi>I have received all,</hi> as it is in the Originall: he knew not but times and peoples esteem of him might change, and he might be brought to an accompt, or at least some might vent their own suspicions of him privatly, to under-myne him. 2. Where there is frugality to manage, and the grace of contentation with what the Lord is pleased to bestow, a little portion of things worldly, will be thought suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: so, though a covetous man, and prodigall spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, doth never think he hath enough; yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth think it; <hi>I abound, and am full, having received the things which ye sent.</hi> 3. However there are no expiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for sin to be offered up by Christians, Christ having offered up himself once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. and though the outward rite of sacrifizing in any kind be now abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, all those rudiments ceasing with the non-age of the Church which was under the Old Testament, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. yet the substance of the Eucharistick sacrifice used among the Jews, or the thing which was pointed out by that sacrifice, doth yet remain as a morall dutie, never to be laid aside, to wit, an evidencing of our

Seeing our charity and beneficence unto those who are in straits, is a part of our christian sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: Then, first, it must be willingly bestowed, and not through constraint, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. Secondly, It must be offered unto God in obedience to a command, and to evidence our thankfulnesse unto him, and not to the creature, not to the Idol of our credit and estimation, or for other selfish ends, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. Thirdly, It must be offered on the right altar, to wit, Christ, (see <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10) that through his worth the offering may be accepted by God; for, all those were requisite unto orderly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable sacrificing: see <hi>Lev. 22. 19.

Though there be no such measure of obedience attainable here, with which the Lord will be so well pleased, as to judge the performer to be perfect, or adjudge him to eternal life for the worth that is in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. Christ's obedience and sacrifice only being acceptable, and thus well-pleasing unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. yet he may be so pleased with his obedience, as to judge him sincere in what he doth, and to look on his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, as his own gracious work in him; and that is, when the thing performed is in it self good, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32. done by a man in Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4. by strength drawn from Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. and for the right end, Gods glory, and not worldly applause, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5.

His engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his credit and honour in those words, <hi>my God,</hi> as if he had said, He is the God whose Ambassador I am, and so cannot in honour but recompence you for what ye have given to me in my strait. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.

                  <p>The Apostle, in the third part of the chapter, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Epistle, first, in contemplation of all the former mercies, ascribeth lasting praise and glory to God, as God, and as the Father of Believers, through vertue of that gracious Covenant made between him and them in Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

That Christians may be much and real in this wish, they would seriously consider that worth, excellency, and goodnesse of God manifested to themselves in his works, particularly in his works of creation and general providence, in relation to which he is here called GOD; but most especially in the works of Redemption and Salvation purchased for, and actually bestowed upon lost sinners: in relation to which he is here called <hi>Our Father;</hi> that so our own hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once affected and filled, even to overflowing, we may with greater fervency and sincerity break out with this wish, That the same excellency, and more of it may be manifested unto, and constantly acknowledged both by our selves and others: So the Apostle, having considered his many favours spoken of through the whole Epistle, and looking on him as God and our Father, breaketh out

                  <p>Secondly, In the conclusion, there are mutual saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commendations: some were to be saluted by them in his name, others who were with him did salute, or remember themselves unto them, of whom he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three ranks.

External duties of civility ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their own nature to entertain and increase love among men, are not to be neglected by Christians; of which sort are civil salutations: Though civility and good manners be not Religion; yet Religion destroyeth them not, but injoyneth them: So <hi>Paul,</hi> and those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians, did mutually salute each other; <hi>Salute everie Saint.</hi> 2. Whatever a man be in his inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before God, or in his outward condition worldly, whether rich or poor, noble or ignoble; yet, so long as he standeth a Church-member, a Minister should put that respect upon him, and do those duties to him which are due unto one in such a relation; for, he injoyneth them, in his name, <hi>to salute everie Saint,</hi> that is, all the Church-members, who are Saints all of them by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,

or sederal sanctity, or holinesse: according to which, in regard of the Covenant made betwixt God and the visible Church, every one professing subjection unto that Covenant are separated from other people, and in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner dedicated unto Gods service, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. Now that <hi>Saints</hi> are taken in this latitude here, is very probable: for, if the command had been to salute only those, who are Saints by inherent holinesse, how could it have been obeyed? for, real saving grace cannot be known infallibly by another, and so inevitably they should have saluted many Hypocrites in place of Saints, passing by others who were Saints indeed. It may indeed bear thus much, That if any had more real evidence of grace than others, the Apostle would have himself more specially remembred unto such; but this is not all, for he will have them saluting every Saint, and so those who were well known unto them to be such: Neither doth the words following, <hi>in Christ Jesus,</hi> militate against this sense; for, even those, who are externally and federally Saints, are in Christ by an external and visible union, consisting in the serious profession of those Truths which relate to him; the effect of which union, is, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of common gifts of the Spirit to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their measure: see <hi>Job. 15. 2. Everie branch in me which beareth no fruit,</hi> which supposeth some to be in Christ in the way mentioned, who yet are fruitlesse branches, and so unregenerate. 3. Christian charity will so far cover the infirmities and failings of others; as not to disown them as Brethren, nor yet neglect those christian duties which we owe unto them, or are obliged to do for them as Brethren; for, although (ch. 2. v. 20, 21) he complains of all who were with him, except <hi>Timotheus</hi> only, that <hi>no man was like-minded,</hi> and all <hi>did seek their own things;</hi> yet neverthelesse, he doth in their name sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Philippians, calling them <hi>Brethren; the Brethren which are with me greet you.</hi> 4.

Though all the members of the visible Church be externally Saints, and federally holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. yet there are some, who, besides that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holinesse, are really Saints, inherently holy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with gracious vertues and qualifications, and such God respecteth most; for whose sake mainly he sendeth his word unto others, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 14. for, Paul writeth to the <hi>Saints</hi> in this latter sense mainly, though not excluding the former. 2. Whoever are Saints, are also faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Believers; whoever are Believers, are also Saints; and so far and in the same sense that a man is a


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94357:69"/>
Saint, he is a Believer also: they who are externally Saints, and federally holy, do professe at least the doctrine of Faith, either personally, or parentally; and they who are inherently holy, are also inherently and savingly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as not only professing the doctrine, but also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the truth of it, and imbracing it in their hearts; and again, all such Believers are really changed from sin to holinesse: So these two are here conjoyned, as being of equal extent; <hi>To the Saints, and faithful.</hi> 3. All Saints and Believers, are also Brethren, because of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the same Religion, and worshipping the same God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 20. because of their brotherly love and affection, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 9. because they have one Father, God, and one elder Brother, Jesus Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. and because they are all ingrafted in one mystical body, and quickened by one and the same Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. as natural Brethren have their birth from the self-same pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; so the <hi>Saints and faithful are</hi> also <hi>Brethren.</hi> 4. There is no sanctity, faith, or fraternity of any moment unto salvation, except it be founded upon Christ, flowing from him, and relating to him: whatever is of those among Heathens, and men otherwise destitute of Christ, is only counterfeit, not real; civilizing, not saving, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 46. so they are <hi>Saints, Faithful, Brethren in Christ.</hi> 5. After Christ's incarnation and death, free-grace hath enlarged it self much beyond its ancient bounds: for, whereas before, the bounds of the people were according to the number of the children of <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 32. 8. there is now a Church of <hi>Saints and faithfull brethren at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the salutation, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Gods favour and free-grace is to be sought after in the first place, whether for our selves or others, and all other things which tend to our happiness here, or hereafter, as streams flowing from that fountain; thus Paul wisheth for <hi>grace</hi> first, and <hi>peace</hi> next. 2. Where Gods grace and favour is obtained, all other things prosperous will undoubtedly follow, in so far as God seeth them to conduce for our good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94357:70"/>
11. as appeareth from the connexion between the good things wished for by the Apostle: <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace.</hi> 3. Gods grace and favour, together with all good things flowing from it, is the peculiar allowance of those who lay claim to God as theirs, according to the tenor of the Covenant of grace: for, Paul, in seeking grace and peace, owneth God as Father; <hi>from God our Father.</hi> 4. As God hath fulnesse of grace, and of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to be conveyed unto lost sinners; so there is no accesse unto him, to receive of that fulnesse from him, but through Jesus Christ, who is Mediator betwixt God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. for, he wisheth grace from God the Father, <hi>through Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>That the Apostle may excite those Colossians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and progresse in faith and piety, and in order thereto, procure their attention and benevolence, he sheweth that he and <hi>Timothy,</hi> did make conscience of giving thanks to God on their behalf; and this they did alwaies when they prayed for them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

As it is our duty in relation to God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 8. so it speaketh much our hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto others, when the graces of God, parts, and abilities that are in them, do not produce carnal emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or envy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 29. nor flattering commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the men themselves, <hi>Job,</hi> 32. 21. but furnisheth us with matter of thanksgiving unto God: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth evidence his affection to those Colossians; <hi>We give thanks to God.</hi> 3. God is the Father of Jesus Christ, not

only as God, by an eternall generation and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his whole essence unto him in a way unspeakable <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. v. 7. but even also as man through vertue of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal union of the two natures in Christ, and in a special way, which doth far excell all other wayes, whereby he is a father to other men and angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32: thus <hi>God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> are one: for, the particle <hi>and,</hi> is exegetick of the same thing, and not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative of things different. 4. In all our performances we should eye God, with a respect had to Jesus Christ; seeing the Father is well pleased only in him, both with our persons and duties, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. for, in giving thanks, he eyeth God, with a relation to Christ: <hi>We give thanks to God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 5. Then is the fittest time to give thanks to God for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours bestowed, when our hearts are somewhat eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and our affections somewhat warmed in the duty of prayer; and the duties of prayer and praise do mutually contribute for the help one of another: thus the Apostle <hi>gave thanks, alwayes praying for them,</hi> that is, alwayes when he prayed for them: for so are the words to be ordered, and not <hi>praying alwayes,</hi> as if he had been constantly praying for them.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94357:71"/>
whereof, is a ground of thanksgiving; faith is among the first: for, thereby we are united unto, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. hereby we are justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. and our hearts purified, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. and all our performances accepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.

Though there be no Scripture-truth, unto which, being once made known, the grace of faith giveth not a firm assent <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14. yet Jesus Christ, and those truths which speak of him, are the principall object of saving and justifying faith; and therefore it is called, <hi>faith in Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. There is a necessary connexion betwixt the graces of faith and love, the former without the latter being dead, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 17. and the latter without the former, being not reall, but in appearance onely, or at the best but a morall vertue, and no saving-grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. so they are here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>of your faith in Jesus Christ, and your love.</hi> 5.

God bringeth the Gospel unto a people before they send for it: he is found of them who sought him not, <hi>Isa. 65. 1. which is come unto you,</hi> saith he. 2.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94357:72"/>
fruit, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Christ can most swiftly drive the chariot of his Gospel when he pleaseth, as appears from this, that within a few years after his death, <hi>it was in all the world,</hi> that is, in all the Airts and principall parts of it, and in opposition to that astricted dispensation under the Old Testament. 4. This may serve abundantly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a doctrine preached, so that hearers may safely venture on it, as the truth of God, that First, It is the same which the Apostles did preach through the world, which may be known by their writings, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it differ much from that which is taught in the Romish Church, or any other particular Church on earth. Secondly, That it bringeth forth fruits of an holy life, as the Gospel hath alwayes some of those fruits, among some of them who heard it; and no other doctrine, whether humane Philosophie, morall precepts, or the Law it self, as distinct from the Gospel, can throughly and inwardly sanctifie those who have the knowledge of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. Thirdly, That the fruits brought forth by it, are early and constant, not as the morning dew, which passeth away: for, the Apostle, from these three, commendeth that doctrine which <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi> had taught them; <hi>as it is in all the world, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth fruit since the day, &amp;c.

                  <p>Having commended the doctrine, he commendeth the Preacher, <hi>Epaphras,</hi> in opposition to the false Teachers, who, it is like, did labour to weaken his authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not an Apostle. He is commended, First, From his relation to <hi>Paul,</hi> as being dear unto him, and a fellow-servant with him. Secondly, From his office, as being a Minister, enlarged from his fidelity in it, and relation to them, ver. 7. Thirdly, From his respect unto them, evidenced by the good report which he had brought to <hi>Paul</hi> of them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whoever loveth the successe of the Gospel, would by all means labour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and entertain a good understanding betwixt a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister and his flock: for, to this end, doth <hi>Paul</hi> commend <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as his <hi>dear fellow-servant, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters especially, should be so far from bearing down the deserved estimation of others, &amp; envying of their zeal in the Lords work, lest it may detract somewhat from them, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 15.) that the more zealous a man be for God, the more diligent and faithful in the work of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing souls, he ought, and will (if they themselves be honest) have a greater share of their affections: so, because <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi> was <hi>faithful,</hi> he is dear unto <hi>Paul; our dear fellow-servant, who is a faithful Minister.</hi> 3. Whatever odds there be among Ministers in their gifts and parts, they ought all to draw together in one yoke for advancing of the Lords work; seeing there is work for all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 37. and the meanest may be helpfull, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. So Paul looketh on Epaphras as his <hi>fellow-servant,</hi> though he was much above him for estimation and parts. 4. As the dignity of the Ministerial-Calling is such, that it challengeth reverence and respect from all, unto those


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94357:73"/>
who are intrusted with it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. So, a Minister who would be respected either by God or man, ought to be <hi>faithful,</hi> eying his Masters glory in the first place, and not his own, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. and promoving to his uttermost the spiritual good of those who are committed unto his charge, by omitting nothing which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for that end; doing nothing which may hinder it; preferring their profiting to his own profit, pleasure, and ease, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33. yea, and upon all hazard preferring their profit to their sinful humours, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. and where this is, it commendeth a Minister much; so Epaphras is commended in that he was a <hi>faithful Minister.</hi> 5. As people would respect all the Servants of Jesus Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 29. so chiefly those who are their own Ministers, and actually trusted with the charge of their souls: for, he will have them respecting <hi>Epaphras,</hi> because he was their own Minister: <hi>who is for you a faithful Minister.</hi> 6. To speak unto the deserved commendation of those that are absent, without detracting any thing from their just worth, is praise-worthy, and evidenceth a man's faithfulnesse much towards those of whom he so speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: as the contrary doth argue a man to be unfaithfull, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 4. for, this was an evidence of his being faithfull for them; <hi>he also declared unto us your love,</hi> faith he. 7. Then is love praise-worthy, when it is in the spirit, or spiritual, that is, wrought by the Spirit of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. when it is in a spiritual, or renewed heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23. and drawn out by spiritual considerations and motives, chiefly such as the work of grace already in the person loved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. or some hope at least that this work may yet be, where it is not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. and not by carnal, natural, or civil motives only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46. for which reasons their <hi>love,</hi> is said to be <hi>in the Spirit.</hi>

Having shewen how he had thanked God for them, he mentioneth now his praying for them: and this as a further mean to procure their good-will. In this verse is, first, the cause moving him to pray, to wit, that he heard by <hi>Epaphras</hi> of their love. Secondly, the manner of his prayer, it was timeous, constant, and servent. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the first of those things which he prayed for, to wit, increase and fulnesse of the knowledge of Gods revealed will: which knowledge he divideth in two. First, <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> whereby we know celestiall mysteries revealed in Scripture. Secondly, <hi>understanding,</hi> whereby, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from <hi>wisedome,</hi> we know our duty, and the right way of reducing all our knowledge to practice. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the graces of God's Spirit in any, are matter of thanksgiving to God; so they are incitements also unto prayer for those who have them: for, the graces of the best are but imperfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. subject to decay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. and may be abused, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> takes occasion from their graces, for which he had blessed God, verse 4. &amp;c. to pray to God for them: <hi>for this cause we pray.</hi> 2. As our praying to God for others, doth evidence much our affection to them; so, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our sympathie that way, would be timeously begun, and constantly continued in: Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his affection towards this Church, sheweth, he prayed for them, and that timeously: <hi>Since the day we heard it,</hi> and constantly, <hi>we cease not:</hi> which is not to be understood, as if he had done no other thing but that, he had a rooted desire after their good, which was alwayes expressed by him in prayer, when opportunity did offer. 3. The knowledge of God's will revealed in Scripture, is to be studied above the knowledge of any other thing besides; as being more sublime, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and so more pleasant, yea and more profitable, verse 27. nor any other: for, whileas he prayeth, that they may be filled <hi>with the knowledge of Gods will,</hi> he speaketh of his revealed will <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. 4. They who know most of God's will revealed in Scripture, come far short of what they


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94357:74"/>

Our desires after spirituall good, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and in a manner insatiable: great things would be sought from God; for, he is a great King, <hi>Ps.</hi> 95. 3. whom it becometh to give largely; so he seeketh, <hi>that they may be filled.</hi> 6.

It is not every sort of walking which is required as the fruit of knowledge; but a <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy of the Lord,</hi> which doth not import a dignity or worth in our walking, to recompence the Lord, but onely a beseemingnesse, and not repugnancie to that state whereunto we are called by him (as the same word is well rendered, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27.) which may consist with many failings and sins of infirmity, where there is self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. 3.

                  <p>The Apostle, in the second part of the chapter, being to propound a short sum of christian doctrine, doth by way of thanksgiving, make mention of God the Father his gracious work, whereby he maketh the Elect fit to partake of Heaven, the bright and glorious Inheritance of the Saints. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>He explaineth further how we are meet for Heaven, and delivered from the power of darknesse, to wit, by our Redemption in Christ, from sin, Satan and wrath, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a price paid by the Mediator to the Fathers justice, even his blood, which Redemption he explaineth from its principal part, remission of sins in justification: for, <hi>Redemption</hi> is not here taken for the laying down of the price by Christ (as <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 38.) but for the fruits flowing from it, not for that compleat redemption and freedom from sin and misery, which the godly shall enjoy at the last day, <hi>Rom. 8 23.

Though Jesus Christ did pay this ransom unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. and not to Satan, whose slaves we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet, by vertue of the ransom paid, we are delivered from Satans slavery, and sins dominion: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle clearing what he had said, ver. 13. of our being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of darknesse, he giveth this as a

reason, <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood:</hi> When God the just Judge was satisfied, Satan the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and unjust Tyrant, did lose his right to keep us lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in bonds; so that Christ doth justly deliver the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Ones from him by force, <hi>Heb. 2. 14.

Though Christ by his obedience and suffering, did pay unto the Fathers Justice a sufficient ransom for our Redemption; yet we do not actually partake of that freedom until we be in him, and by faith united to him: <hi>In whom we have redemption.</hi> 7. Sin is the fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our slavery and bondage, so that it must be removed before our bondage cease: thus, speaking of our Redemption, he instanceth it in <hi>the remission of sin.</hi> 8.

As the Son is of the same essence, and one God with the Father; so he is a distinct person from him: for, he is the substantial image of the Father; and an image must be somewhat distinct from that, whereof it is an image. 4.

                  <p>The Apostle giveth a reason why the Redeemer Christ was to be such a Person, as is before described, taken from the Father's will and pleasure, that he should be one filled with all fulnesse, both of the Godhead dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him, chap. 2. 9. and of the graces of the Spirit without measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 34. that so he might be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished to discharge that great work of Mediation, in reconciling the universality of the Elect.

That any be the Churches Head, it is necessary that he be full of God, and of all created graces, even both God and Man; and therefore it is no lesse than blasphemie for sinfull man, Pope, or any other, to assume this Title unto himself: for, giving a reason of this, among other things, why Christ is the Churches Head, he saith, <hi>for it pleased the Father, that in him all fulnesse should dwell;</hi> importing that none destitute of this fulnesse, is fit to be the Head of the Church. 3.

up with their present good condition, despising others, to be frequently minding that woful case wherein they were when first free-grace did lay hold upon them; so <hi>Paul,</hi> to commend this peace-making mercy in God, doth mind them: <hi>they were sometimes alienated, and enemies in their mind.</hi> 3. The state of man by nature is most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; as being first, estranged from God, having no spiritual communion with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 9. 24. nor any right or claim to that happinesse which floweth from the the enjoyment of him, <hi>Psa.</hi> 58. 3.

                     <hi>you who were enemies, yet now hath he reconciled.</hi> 5. The reconciliation of the Elect unto God, is not from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor the time of Christs death, nor at any time before the sinner doth beleeve in Jesus Christ: Election indeed is from eternity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. and satisfaction for sin was given to the Father's justice by Christ upon the crosse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. but justification is not until the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned sinner assent to the bargain, and enter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self heir unto Christ's purchase by faith: for, he speaks of them as <hi>now</hi> being reconciled, having imbraced the Gospel, when before they were <hi>enemies.</hi> 6.

That Christians may continue constant in the faith of the Gospel, as well by assenting to the truth of it, as by imbracing the good things offered by it; it is not sufficient to have some flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating opinion about the truth of it, but they must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a rooted and well grounded perswasion that it is the undoubted truth of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. Nor is it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to imbrace the good things offered slightly, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, or with a reserve; but sure hold would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, as we would grip to a thing upon life and death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.

As the hope of life eternal, and of those other good things held forth in the Gospel, is a grace which is hardly maintained; there being so many blasts of several tentations to drive us from it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31, 32.

It is the duty of Ministers to keep up the credit and esteem of their fellow-labourers among their Flocks; (though they be much inferiour for parts and graces unto themselves) if so they teach sincerely the same truth, that the work of God may succeed the better in their hands; for, probably because the person and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as being no Apostle, but an ordinary Minister, was the lesse esteemed of by many; <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliates

sufferings, when God calleth them to suffer, or from grudging, or heartlesse discouragement under sufferings, <hi>(Luke</hi> 9. 26.) that they ought to think it their glory to suffer any thing for Christ and Truth, and so to rejoyce in sufferings: And Gods Servants may attain to such a frame of spirit as this is under sufferings; So did <hi>Paul; who now rejoyce in my sufferings,</hi> saith he. 2. As people are apt to stumble and cast at the Gospel, because of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, reproach, and other hardships under which those who preach the Gospel do for the most part labour <hi>(Mat.</hi> 13. 55, 56 57.) their stumbling might be in reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, if they would consider, that all those sufferings are occasioned in a great part by them, in so far, that if it were not for respect to the souls of people, Ministers might do much to shift the crosse, as well as others; <hi>Paul</hi> removed the scandal of his sufferings, thus; <hi>My sufferings are for you,</hi> saith he. If he had not preached the Gospel to the Gentiles, he might have been free of the crosse. 3. The sufferings of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of any other Saint, are the sufferings of Christ, and the filling up of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: not as if Christ's personal sufferings for the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of sinners were imperfect, and so to be supplied by the sufferings of others, see <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. but such is that sympathy betwixt Christ and Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. and so strict is that union among them whereby he and they do but make up one mystical Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. that in those respects the sufferings of the Saints, are his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to wit, the sufferings of mystical Christ, which are not perfect nor filled up, until every Member of his Body endure their own allotted portion and share: <hi>I fill up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ.</hi> 4. All that <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Elect suffereth, are but small relicts, being compared with that which Christ hath suffered, as the drops upon the brim of the cup: the great wave of affliction did first beat on him, and being thereby broken, some small sparks of it only do light upon us; <hi>I fill up that which is behind,</hi> or the relicts and hinder parts <hi>of the sufferings of Christ.</hi> 5. The cup of affliction and


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94357:85"/>
sufferings goeth about by course and round: as Christ did drink of it first, the Apostles only standing by, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 8. so their course came next, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. and thus it hath gone from hand to hand ever since: all are not made to drink of it at once, that some may still be in a capacity to pity, help, and sympathize with others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14. so the word rendred <hi>fill up,</hi> signifieth to do a thing in our own course or turn. 6. As the personal sufferings of Christ were for the Churches redemption, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Fathers justice for the sins of the Elect, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. v.—28. which he did compleatly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. So the sufferings of the Saints are also for the Churches good, though not for her redemption or expiation of sin, neither in its guilt nor punishment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. yet to edifie the Church by their example, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 10. to comfort her under sufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 6. and to confirm that Truth for which they do suffer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 17.

As the main subject of Ministers preaching ought to be Jesus Christ; so, the reproving of sin, exhortation to duty, instruction in knowledge, is no wayes inconsistent, but agreeth well with the preaching of Christ: for, <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94357:88"/>
did run upon both those, <hi>whom,</hi> saith he, to wit, Christ, <hi>we preach, warning and teaching.</hi> 2. Ministers in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and pressing of duties, would beware of drawing people off Christ, to seek a righteousnesse in themselves; but would thereby labour to drive them to Christ for righteousnesse, to cover the guilt of the sin reproved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. and for furniture to inable them to go about the duty which is pressed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. that so while they warn and exhort, they may be still preaching Christ; thus did <hi>Paul, whom,</hi> to wit, Christ, <hi>we preach, warning and teaching every man.</hi> 3. The understanding of man by nature is dark and wholly blind in the things of God; else there were no need of <hi>teaching:</hi> and his will and affections are most perverse and backward; else there were no need of warning; <hi>warning every man, and teaching.</hi> 4. The great part of a Minister's work lyeth in those two, to inform the understanding by <hi>teaching.</hi> and to rectifie the will and affections by admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and consolation, which here goeth under the name of <hi>warning:</hi> and these duties are to be discharged by a Minister unto all within his charge, without respect of persons; <hi>warning every man and teaching every man.</hi> 5. As it is the duty of a Minister to conceal nothing of saving truth revealed in Scripture: so, all saving truth, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the doctrine of Jesus Christ revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, containeth in it much wisdome, yea all wisedome, so that any other wisedome without this, is nothing else but meer folly; for, this makes men wise unto salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 3. 15. So he <hi>taught every man in all wisedome,</hi> that is, in the doctrine of the Gospel. 6. The publick Ministery is God's ordinary mean for the reducing of straying and wandering sinners, to Jesus Christ; that being cloathed with his righteousnesse, and renewed by his holy Spirit, they may be made perfect in him, and presented so in the last day; <hi>that we may present every man perfect in Jesus Christ.</hi> 7. It ought to be the great end which all Ministers should aim at, to get all of those who are committed to their charge (as being ignorant

All men are naturally destitute of solid comfort, and even the People of God, when driven to extremities, (chiefly when the truth of the Gospel, from which they did draw their consolation, is questioned) do finde their comfort much brangled: <hi>That their hearts might be comforted,</hi> saith he: So, for the time their comfort was shaken, the truth of the Gospel being by those Masters of error que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned. 2. It is only the doctrine of the Gospel which setleth a disconsolate and afflicted spirit most: and to have that doctrine confirmed, when erring spirits would call it in question; and to know also that others, dear to God, sympathize with us in our strait, contributeth much to our establishment and comfort: so the Apostle's care and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Unity of heart and affections in the Church, is so necessary, that the want of it doth obstruct much that solid comfort, which might other wayes be reaped by the Gospel: for, he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spendeth their comfort, upon their being <hi>knit together in love,</hi> as a piece of timber joyned by a Carpenter; for, so the word signifieth. 4. Unity of heart and affections, dependeth much upon union of judgments and constancy in Truth: where there is discord in the understanding about main and substantial Truths, there can be no

through and lasting concord of the will and affections: for, he makes <hi>their being knit together in love,</hi> one fruit of their constancy in Truth, for procuring whereof his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict was. 5. Christians are not to rest contented with the knowledge of common and easie principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 6. 1.) but are to grow in the knowledge of other more difficult truths, such as relate to various cases, and the defence of Truth against Adversaries; and growth in these, doth follow upon perseverance in Truth: for, such a growth is meant by the <hi>riches of understanding</hi> here spoken of, as another fruit of constancy in Truth. 6. Neither are they to rest upon a fluctuating doubting knowledge, but to endeavour a full perswasion and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, both of the truth of the Gospel in general, and of their own particular interest in the promises thereof: and this also is attained by stability in the Truth: for, it is the <hi>full assurance of understanding</hi> here spoken of as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit of constancy. 7. Neither are they to rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on simple knowledge of Gospel-truths, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 7. 21.) but are to know them with affection and love to them; they are to take a proof of the truth which is in them and so from experience to know them: this much is imported in the word rendered <hi>acknowledge,</hi> signifying to know again, and with knowledge above ordinary. 8. As God is the author of the Gospel, his eternal wisdome having found it out, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. and as Christ was the Fathers Ambassador to preach and reveal it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 18. So God, and the Father, and Christ are the prime object of the Gospel: the unity of the Godhead, and distinction and order of the persons, the incarnation of Christ, his person, natures, and offices, his saving benefits, and love to sinners (which are all in themselves dark and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) being plainly revealed therein; hence the Gospel is called <hi>the mysterie of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>The words are read by some as relating to the Gospel, in which is contained the knowledge of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, both of those which are only to be known and believed, and of those which are also to be practised: but they are taken more commonly as relating to Christ, in whom, as in a house of store, is laid up all saving knowledge, to be imparted unto those who labour to know him. Both senses come to one, Christ being the main object of the Gospel, and both tend to the same scope, which is to hold forth a sufficiency in Christ and the Gospel, in order to the salvation of sinners, without the help of Angels, or vain traditions; the necessity of whose help was urged by the false Apostles. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is in Christ and the Gospel, sufficiency of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all things necessary to salvation; Christ being the very way to life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. and the Gospel that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which holdeth forth this way compleatly <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. Christ having also received the habits of all created knowledge, as of all other graces without measure; that therby he might be fitted as Mediator to bestow the grace of saving knowledge upon all the Elect in a competent measure, <hi>Joh. 1. 16. In whom are all the treasures.</hi> 2. The knowledge of Jesus Christ is a thing most precious, and most inriching of those who have it: hence is it called <hi>treasures.</hi> 3. Notwithstanding of all that is revealed of Jesus Christ; yet his worth is unsearchable; the most able of created understandings cannot reach the depth thereof; so, <hi>in whom are hid all the treasures.</hi> 4. This fulnesse of knowledge ascribed to Christ, maketh nothing for the Ubiquitarian error, as if Divine omniscience were inherent in the humane nature: for, though it should be granted, that by these treasures were meant Divine omniscience; yet he saith not <hi>in which humane nature,</hi> but <hi>in whom,</hi> that is, in his person (to wit, according to the Divine Nature) <hi>are hid all the treasures.</hi>

As Satan doth endeavour to sow the seed of Error, where-ever the Gospel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; so Ministers should guard people as well against error in opinion, as against prophanity of life; the one being damnable as the other, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.

Jesus Christ is the sum and substance of all saving doctrine, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.) the marrow of all the promises (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.) the fountain, furniture, and main scope of an holy life, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 21, 22.) so that the receiving of him, is the thing most to be aimed at in all the Ordinances, as that which maketh our knowledge compleat, our faith saving, our obedience acceptable: for, here, the Apostle's pointing at their practice in all those, giveth this as the compend of all, <hi>as ye have received Christ.</hi> 2. It is not sufficient that Christ be once received in our understanding, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and practice; but there must be constancie and

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, abounding in this grace. Thirdly, thanksgiving for the same. The first doctrine which ariseth from the scope, is already marked, chap. 1. v. 23. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. to wit. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The gripe which faith doth lay upon Christ, is like unto that which the tree hath in the ground, and so is most sure: for, though the top of the tree doth shake, yet the root remaineth firm, and its firmnesse is from the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the ground, through which the roots are spred; its fruitfulnesse also is by vertue of sap conveyed from

                  <p>Having ended the Preface, he stateth the controversie, reducing those Impostors, whereof he would have them to beware, lest they should be made a prey of by them, unto three heads. First, Abused philosophy, whereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reason (which was indeed but deceiving) several things; and particularly, as it appeareth from ver. 18. the worshipping of Angels was pressed upon them, contrary unto the Word: all which doctrine he rejecteth as vain and deceiving. Secondly, Superstitious and foolish rites, obtruded as parts of divine worship, having no other warrant but custom, antiquity, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men. Thirdly, Levitical rites, and Mosaical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which were earthly and carnal rudiments, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings fitted for the infancie of the Church under the old Testament: all which he rejecteth upon this general reason, they were not according to the doctrine of Christ, and did draw away Christians from him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are Christ's flock, and the doctrine of the Gospel a sheep-fold, wherein so long as they remain they are safe, and when they depart from it, they fall in the hands of seducing Hereticks, who make a prey of their souls, thirsting after, and rejoycing as much in the drawing of people away from Truth, as Robbers &amp; Thieves do when they carry away the spoil of another mans goods; <hi>lest any man spoil you;</hi> It is a metaphor taken from notorious thieves who carry away the straying cattel. 2. Though Philosophy, as it speaketh the knowledge of truth found out by Natures light, and an accurate way for finding out the same, be not to be rejected, it being in all the parts of it a very usefull help for attaining to the more exact knowledge of religious truths revealed in Scripture: and this same Apostle frequently making use of it in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate method, insinuating proems, accurat and syllogistick


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94357:95"/>
argumentations; and that often from common philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick principles, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. yet if Philosophy be taken for the errors of Philosophers, and if those be obtruded for truths; or, if it presume to reject all religious truths, such as the greatest mysteries of christian Religion, which are not conclusions grounded upon, and flowing from Natures light; or generally, when it is not kept as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to Scripture, but presumeth to lord it over them; Philosophy so taken, and in those cases, is a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceiver in the things of God, and so would be eschewed: for, the Apostle doth not simply condemn Philosophy, but the abuse of it, even that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and vain; <hi>through Philosophy and vain deceit.</hi> 3. The traditions of men, whereby external rites without the authority of the written Word, are obtruded as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God upon the Church, having no other warrant but antiquity, custom and humane authority, is the most vain and uselesse doctrine which ever was taught, and no wayes to be submitted unto; so this <hi>vain deceit</hi> is <hi>after the traditions of men.</hi> 4. The Mosaical Rites and Legal Ceremonies, as they were prescribed by God unto the ancient Church, to be the first A. B. C, and easie Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Religion, fitted for the then infant-state of the Church; so the binding power of them all (Christ the substance being come and suffered) doth cease: yea, the practising of them now, the light of the Gospel having clearly shined forth, is sinfull, and to be eschewed, as speaking really, and by vertue of their first institution, that Christ is not yet come in the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. for, by these <hi>Rudiments,</hi> or, Elements of the world, of which he would have them to beware, is meant those Legal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, see <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. v. 3, 9. <hi>After the Rudiments of the world.</hi> 5. The way of Christ, and of men's own natural wisdom, will not weld together so as to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mixture: if it be their way, he will not own it for his: for, those false Teachers did not quit Christ wholly, but would have joyned other things with him, and yet the Spirit of God calleth their way a deserting of him; <hi>And not after Christ,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>He refuteth all those Impostors, first joyntly, because Christ alone is most perfect, and by consequence his doctrine also; as having God fully in his Essence and Attributes inseperably residing in his Person, and this <hi>bodily</hi> or personally, the Divine Nature, having assumed the humane unto the unity of his Person; for, the word <hi>Body,</hi> is often taken for the Person, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. so that it were folly and impiety to seek salvation in any thing, but in Christ, and in the doctrine taught by him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is nothing more effectual for making us adhere to Christ and Truth, than the consideration of that worth and fulnesse which is in him; for, the Apostle holdeth out the fulnesse of the Godhead in Christ, that they may not be drawn away from him: <hi>for in him dwelleth, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The more a man doth exercise himself in speaking or thinking of Christ, his heart and mouth will be the more enlarged upon that subject: for, this being the third time which the Apostle hath spoken of this fulnesse, first, chap. 1. v. 19. next, chap. 2. v. 3. and now here, we find his speech riseth still higher. 2. We learn hence several things of the Person and Natures of Christ; as first, that he is true man: for, the <hi>Godhead dwelleth in</hi> his humane Nature, as in his Temple. Secondly, he is also true God, and so the same God with the Father; for, the <hi>fulness of the Godhead,</hi> not a portion of God only, or the glorious effects of his power, or his particular gifts and graces, but his compleat essence <hi>dwelleth in him.</hi> Thirdly, That he is a distinct person from the Father, the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head being incarnat, not as absolutely considered, but as it is in the Person of the Son: for, it is <hi>in him,</hi> to wit, in Christ, not in the Father, that the <hi>Godhead dwelleth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</hi> Fourthly, Though there be two Natures in Christ; yet he is but one person: <hi>for, the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily,</hi> that is, personally, or by vertue of the personal


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94357:96"/>
union. Fifthly, This union is inseperable: for, <hi>the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelleth in him,</hi> as in his fixed proper house. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Notwithstanding of this union, the two Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main distinct, as the inhabitant is distinct from the house wherein he dwelleth. Seventhly, That God doth hold out himself in the Person of Christ God-man, as in a glasse, to be taken up and transacted with by lost sinners, or, the drift of the purpose is to show that the fulnesse of he Godhead resideth in him, so as that we may make use of that fulnesse throughly for our salvation, and that there is no need of any thing to be added to him.</p>

                  <p>Here are other two arguments: First, Christ is not only full in himself, but all who are in him by faith, are compleat through him, as having from him all things necessary for salvation.

The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, Believers have in Christ the thing signified by that Ordinance, to wit, spiritual circumcision in the heart, which consisteth in the putting off, by the power of Christs Spirit, that corrupt masse or body of manifold sins flowing from our innate corruption or sinful flesh; so that there was no need of that carnall circumcision by hands, in cutting off the flesh of the foreskin: which is a good consequence against the urgers of circumcision under the new Testament, where these shadows (Christ the substance being come) are abolished, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they urged it upon this pretence, That the Gentiles


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94357:97"/>
could not be purified without it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, such as Circumcision once was, there is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign, which is given by Christ's Ministers, and some inward grace signified by it, the author and worker whereof is only Christ himself; So there was the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rite of Circumcision by the hands of men, and the inward grace of mortification <hi>without hands;</hi> and <hi>by the Circumcision of Christ,</hi> that is, by the inward power of the Spirit of Christ. 2. There is no saving grace enjoyed by Believers but what they have in Christ, to wit, as the fountain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. as the procurer and purchaser of all grace for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. and as the applier of his own purchase to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. So, <hi>in him we are circumcised.</hi> 3. As our manifold actual sins do flow from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of original corruption, frequently called <hi>flesh, (Rom.</hi> 7, &amp; 8.) So the whole bulk of sin is fitly compared to a <hi>body,</hi> because of the weight of guilt which is in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. and the soul is wholly compassed by it, as it is with our natural body, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. yea, and the whole members of the body are made instruments of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. Thus he saith, <hi>The body of the sins of the flesh.</hi> 4. They who are in Christ, must be about the work of putting off this body, setting against, not only some one sin or other, but the whole masse and body of sin; <hi>putting off the body of the sins of the flesh.</hi> 5. This sinful body is already put off and laid aside in some sense by real Believers, to wit, in its guilt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. in its dominion and reign, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. in the Believers sincere purpose and honest resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. as also in his hope, that one day it shall be put off wholly, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.

                  <p>He doth further enlarge the former reason, whereby he


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94357:97"/>
also pre-occupieth an objection against our compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ, by shewing we have in Christ, not only the thing signified, but also an external initiatory seal, to wit, Baptism in the place of Circumcision now abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; the fruits of which seal are mortification of sin, and vivification in grace, by vertue of the death &amp; resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ, being laid hold on by faith, which is wrought in us by the mighty power of God; so that there was no place left for Circumcision. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Sacrament of Baptism under the new Testament succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Circumcision under the old, and is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to Children born within the visible Church, as Circumcision was to Infants of eight dayes age then, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12. for, not only both do seal the same Covenant of grace, and are initiatory seals of it, but also <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that the Christian Church is as compleat now in Christ, as the Jewish Church was, though we want Circumcision, because we have an Ordinance as good as it was, to wit, Baptism: Now if Baptism did not belong to Infants, we should not yet be so compleat as they were, seeing the Covenant was sealed by Circumcision both to themselves and their little ones: <hi>Buried with him in Baptism.</hi> 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation consists of two parts, to wit, first, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, which ought to be a through and constant work, here set forth by our <hi>being buried,</hi> which speaketh more than death: And secondly, Vivification, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in grace, set forth by <hi>our rising again. Doct.</hi> 3. Both those parts of Regeneration are sealed in Baptism, not as if we were of necessity to suppone that those are already in the person to be baptized, but because Baptism obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the baptized person to set about these, and sealeth up the whole Promises on Gods part, even those which are for sanctification and grace; so that whenever the party baptized shall lay hold by faith upon the Promise, he hath God engaged by word and seal, to make it out; thus Circumcision was a seal of the righteousness of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. and yet it was not to be supponed that every Child of eight dayes age had actual faith: <hi>Buried with


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94357:98"/>
him in Baptism, wherein ye are also risen.</hi> 4. Though the Sacraments do seal up grace to us in the way presently mentioned; yet they do not confer grace upon us by any proper vertue of their own, nor yet is there any principle of power in us which can reach the effectuating of such a work, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. although the Sacraments do strongly tie us to the working of it, as said is: It is only the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, which is the fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our dying to sin and living to God, in so far as by the merit, efficacy and example of the former we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the latter; in which respect we are said <hi>to be buried with him, and risen with him.</hi> 5. It is no lesse than the infinit power of God which worketh faith in us, and neither Sacraments, nor the Death or Life of Christ will avail to the subduing of sin, and quickning of grace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Jesus Christ be laid hold upon by faith: <hi>We are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by faith,</hi> and <hi>faith is the operation of God.</hi> 6. In our acting of faith in God, we are not to lay hold upon him in a general confused notion, but should eye that in God most, which is most conducing unto that purpose for which we do imploy him: Thus, speaking of faith, as it imployeth God for quickning in grace, he casteth an eye to that work of God, whereupon our quickning in grace dependeth most, even <hi>his raising of Christ from the dead.</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94357:98"/>
now, especially seeing it was urged by the false Apostles, as a necessary mean to get their natures purified, and their sins pardoned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Every man by nature, through sin is in a state of death, he is thereby spiritually dead, as being deprived of all grace, union and communion with God, (chap. 1. 21.) he is also ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially dead, as lying under the sentence of death, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Covenant of Works, <hi>Gen. 2. 17. And you being dead in your sins.</hi> 2. As this state of death doth totally disable us from quickening our selves, it is onely God who quickeneth: so, no misery of the creature, though never so comprehensive, as extending it self both to our outward and inward state; though never so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate, as being past all remedie by humane help, will impede God from doing good, and bestowing of the choicest good. Thus, though they were miserable for their inward state, as <hi>being dead,</hi> and so incurable by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art; and for their outward state, as being in the <hi>uncircumcision of their flesh,</hi> or, uncircumcised Gentiles, yet <hi>God doth quicken them.</hi> 3. Whenever a man believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Christ, he is in the same moment of time united to Christ, and so, that all which he did or suffered, as sustaining our person, or, which he procured for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof, as being our Head, whether in his death, buriall, or resurrection, is imputed to us by God, and a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them derived to us, as if we had been personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with him all those times, and given our consent to his doing of all those things in our name, and for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: hence is it that He is said to have <hi>quickened these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians together with him,</hi> though Christ had risen from the dead, some years before their coversion. 4. There is no spirituall life attainable, except our obligation to wrath by the pardon of sin, be removed; <hi>you hath he quickened, having forgiven you all your trespasses.</hi> 5. This pardon, though dearly purchased by Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. yet it is freely bestowed upon us; <hi>having forgiven you,</hi> the word signifies, <hi>freely forgiven,</hi> as coming from a root which signifies grace. 6. Pardon of sin is also uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall,

                  <p>The Apostle illustrates the benefit of pardon, and bringeth an argument against the Ceremoniall Law in generall, by shewing, God had not onely forgiven the debt of sin, but Christ also by his death, had destroyed their obligation to wrath, because of sin, making it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uselesse, ever to give faith in Law against them; which obligation he calleth, <hi>the hand-writing of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which was contrary to us;</hi> alluding to written obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations among men, for sums of money, or such like, wherein there is the body of the Writ, and the Debtors subscription: answerable to which, there is in this <hi>hand-writing;</hi> First, the obligation it self, to wit, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and condemning power of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. Secondly, our assent and subscription to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which is the sentence of every man's conscience against himself, whether of Jew or Gentile, whereby he assents to the equity of that curse which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. But particularly, and over and above to the Jews, this subscription was the practice of the Ceremoniall Law, which being separated from Christ and looked upon as service acceptable to God in it self, as it was gone about by many of the Jews before Christ came, and so urged by the false Apostles upon the Gentiles; the practice (I say) of the Ceremoniall Law so considered, was nothing else but a publick testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their own guilt: for example, by killing a beast was testified, that they deserved to die themselves; and seeing the dispute is in this place against the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law, this <hi>hand-writing in ordinances,</hi> is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mainly in this sense, although we are not to exclude


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94357:99"/>
the former: now the argument concludeth strongly, that seeing the debt is payed, the obligation cancelled, it were madnesse and impietie to renew it again, as those did, who practized the Legall ceremonies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is an obligation above the head of every man, through vertue of the curse of the Law, binding him over to under-ly eternal wrath for sin, assented unto, and as it were subscribed by the voice of every man's conscience, and by the practice of the Ceremoniall Law unto the Jews: for, this is <hi>the hand-writing of ordinances</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. 2. This obligation must be cancelled, and so the condemning power of the Law abrogate, before sin be pardoned, and our right to Heaven obtained: for, with respect to the impeding of those, it is said <hi>to have been against us, and contrary unto us.</hi> 3. None but Christ could destroy this <hi>hand-writing;</hi> because none other was able to satisfie the sum contained in it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. for, he speaks of Christ, while he saith, <hi>blotting out the hand-writing in ordinances.</hi> 4. It stood Christ no lesse than his life, to get this bond destroyed; for, he behooved to pay the sum, before the condemning power of the Law could cease, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and to produce the substance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Legall shadows could evanish, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. both which required his death; so he is said to <hi>nail it to his crosse.</hi> 5. It is a matter of no small difficulty, to get the conscience of wakened sinners quieted, and their hearts perswaded, that their obligation to wrath, because of sin, is removed; therefore the Spirit of God useth so many expressions to assure their heart in this matter; <hi>the hand-writing is blotted out,</hi> as it were crosse-strokes are drawn through it; but, left the heart suspect it may be yet le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, therefore he addeth, it is removed and <hi>taken out of the way;</hi> but, left haply it should be again found and produced, he addeth yet, it is torn, destroyed, and <hi>nailed to the crosse,</hi> and so made fully uselesse ever to witnesse any thing against the Believer. 6. Though Christ did compleat this sum contained within this hand-writing, while he was hanging on the crosse, so as the Father's


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94357:100"/>
justice had no more to seek of Christ the Cautioner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. in which sense, he did even then meritoriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy this hand-writing, yet the obligation standeth still in force against the sinner, till he enter himself Heir by faith unto Christ's obedience and death; for, this was the order agreed upon betwixt the Father and the Son: according to which, the fruits of his death were to be applyed, to wit, by faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. So, it is clear from Verse 13. those Colossians were dead in their sins before their renovation, which was long after Christ's death.</p>

                  <p>He in largeth the present argument thus, that Christ by destroying that hand-writing, hath spoiled, disgraced, and triumphed over all our spirituall enemies, especially Satan the great Generall, and his whole Army of sins, temptations, death and hell which fighteth under his banner, and this even by his sufferings: wherein he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth to the ancient custome of Conquerors, who did dis-arm then captives, having joyned them by two, or moe, in chains, made them march before, to their publick shame and disgrace, they themselves coming after in their triumphing chariot; so did Christ: <hi>having spoiled principalities and powers, made a shew of them, &amp;c. Doct.</hi> 1. The power of Devils is very great, as being spirituall substances, strong and mighty Angels, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 6. having the world and sin under them, as their subjects, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. Thus from their power they are called <hi>principalities and powers.</hi> 2. This great power of theirs is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to oppose the work of man's salvation; for, they are spoken of here as opposits. 3. Satans power over souls, doth flow from the sentence of condemnation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Law against sinners, and consists in that dominion which sin hath obtained over them: for, upon the blotting out of that handwriting, he was spoiled of his


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94357:100"/>
power, as appeareth from the connexion. 4. Jesus Christ having satisfied the Fathers justice, and thereby not only enervated the Law's condemnatory sentence, v. 14. but also obtained from the Father, That sin should no more have dominion over the redeemed ones, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. he hath spoiled the Devil of that great power which once he had; so that, though he can, and doth tempt Believers, yet he cannot overcome them; though he hold them in exercise, he cannot mar their salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. he may bruise their heel, but cannot break their head: Thus with Christ's blotting out the hand-writing, is conjoyned <hi>his having spoiled Principalities and Powers.</hi> 5. Christ doth bring about his most gracious works in a way which seemeth most unlikely to carnall sense: so that no eye, but that of faith, can take him up: what other eye could take up Christ as doing all this upon the crosse? when the Jews and Roman souldiers were spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, and parting his garments, that he, even then, and by being spoiled, was spoiling principalities and powers; when they were putting him to shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, that he, even then, was making a shew of Satan openly, and was rubbing disgrace upon him, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him with his own armour; and when they were triumphing and insulting over him, that even then, he was triumphing over all the Devils in hell, as having by his death given the dead blow to their power and kingdom, and so overcame them, by suffering himself to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them; <hi>triumphing over them in it,</hi> to wit, in his crosse. 6. How dear soever the work of our salvation did stand to Christ, it was matter of no small joy unto him to have it throughed, and those who were enemies to it destroyed: for, while he is bleeding, and racked with pain upon the crosse, he is yet rejoycing and triumphing, and that because this work was thriving: <hi>he triumphed over them in it;</hi> the crosse was as a chariot of triumph to him.</p>

                  <p>He draweth a conclusion from the former arguments: That seeing the Ceremoniall Law was now abolished, therefore none should take upon them to judge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others for the not observing any of these Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; or, if any would be so presumptuous, the people of God should not regard their injunctions or censures: and of those ceremoniall observances, he giveth two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; the one relating to that difference to be kept among Meats, according to <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 3. the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that difference observed in Dayes: Dayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served among the Jews were chiefly of three sorts; First, anniversary, that returned every year, here designed by the generall name of <hi>an holy day.</hi> Secondly, Lunary or monethly, which returned every moneth, as the first day of every <hi>new moon.</hi> Thirdly, weekly, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned every week, and on the seventh day of the week: all which are now abrogated, even the Jewish seventh day Sabbath; and the Lord's day, or, the Christian first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Sabbath, substitute in its place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>Here is another argument against the worshippers of Angels, in that they impare the honour of Christ, as head of his Church; making Angels to share with him in it, while-as they imployed them as Mediators with God to obtain grace and salvation, when Christ alone doth discharge the office of an Head compleatly, from whom the whole Body of the universal Church, being knit to him the Head, and one to another by the Nerves

So jealous is Christ in the matter of his own glory, that he will not suffer any other to share with him in it: if Saints, Angels, Pope, or any other be made use of as conjunct collegues with, and helpers of Christ in his Mediatory office, he ceaseth to be a Mediator at all unto those who so do; thus will they give but a share of the honour due unto Christ, as Head, to the Angels: they are said <hi>not to hold the head,</hi> or to be separated from the head, and the vertue which floweth from it. 2. What ever relation is taken on by Christ towards his Church, whether of King, Head, Husband, Brother, Friend, or any other, he will be really forth-coming according to all which that relation doth import; So, as Head, he doth all that which the head doth to the natural body: he furnisheth us with life, motion, spiritual nerves, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. <hi>from whom the whole body, &amp;c.</hi> 3. That suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient influence for grace, and spiritual nourishment may be conveyed from Christ the head, to sinners, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they be unite and knit to him, to wit, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. and the grace of faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. for, those are the <hi>joynts and bands,</hi> by which this <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment is ministred;</hi> he speaks with an allusion to the nerves and arteries of the natural body, whereby it is knit to the head, and hath life and motion conveyed unto it. 4.

The more of spiritual influence Believers do draw from Christ, they will band the better among themselves; for, their being knit together by joynts and bands, as the members of the natural body by their respective liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth depend upon their receiving of nourishment from the head; <hi>from whom the body having nourishment ministred, and knit together.</hi> 6.

His first argument against this head, is to this purpose, That seeing, as he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proven, they were freed from the Leviticall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, (called <hi>rudiments of the world:</hi> see v. 8.) which were instituted by God himself, by what pretext of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son could they submit to superstitious rites, appointed by men? as if they were living in the world, that is, subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in their consciences to the dictates of men v. 20. Of which ordinances he giveth one instance in the matter of meats, and speaketh in the person of some one of those superstitious Rabbies, discharging the people to <hi>touch,</hi> or rather for eschewing tautologie, and as the word doth also signifie, <hi>to eat a little</hi> of such a meat; then, <hi>to taste it;</hi> lastly <hi>to handle it,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Through vertue of Christ's under-taking to die for believers, and the Father's accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his death for them, it followeth, that all those benefits which were purchased by his death, do as much


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94357:105"/>
belong unto them upon their laying hold upon him by saith, as if they themselves had died; Yea, as to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they are reckoned to have died with him: thus they were <hi>dead with Christ</hi> to those ceremonies, and so they had no more power over them, than the Laws of men have over those who are dead: because Christ having by his death fulfilled what was typisied by them, and so purchased freedome to his people from that yoke, they had as much right to that purchased freedome, as if themselves had died for it; <hi>if ye be therefore dead with Christ, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Our being freed from the tye of the Ceremoniall Law and ordinances thereof, though ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, doth much more liberate us from the yoke of significant rites and religious ceremonies, which are onely instituted by men: he did not abrogate his own Ceremonies, that men might appoint theirs: and as it is sinfull for men to injoyn such; so it is no lesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and a very betraying of that liberty which Christ hath purchased, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. to give obedience to any such injunctions: for, he reasoneth from the abolishing of the ceremoniall Law, to our not-subjecting of our selves to any ordinance of that kind: <hi>if ye be therefore dead, why are ye subject to ordinances?</hi> 3. The authors of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are very diligent to have their superstitious fooleries punctually practised, and their commands for that end exactly obeyed. Thus he brings in the Masters of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition delivering their injunctions, as it were to every man in particular: <hi>touch not,</hi> in the singular number. 4. There is no end of superstitious injunctions, when once given way to: they do both multiply and grow also more strict; so here, first, they forbid them <hi>to eat;</hi> secondly, <hi>to taste;</hi> thirdly, not so much as <hi>to bandle,</hi> 5.

This doth not militate against the religious use of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament: for, God hath appointed those Elements to be so used: and the two arguments in this verse are to be taken joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no humane authority can injoyn the use of, or abstinence from, such a sort of meat, as a part of religious worship; <hi>which all are to perish with the using, after the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men.</hi> 3.

                  <p>He mentioneth three fair pretences, whereof use was made to plead for, and commend those superstitious rites; First, they were <hi>will-worship;</hi> a giving of more to God than he required. Secondly, the practising of them, was an evidence of peoples humility, in their submissive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the injunctions of superiours. Thirdly, their voluntary and excessive abstinence from meat, sleep, and their other laborious bodily exercises, did tend to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and was a part of mortification, in <hi>neglecting of the body,</hi> which the most part of men strive so much to pamper: all which the Apostle, having spoken suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to this purpose already, doth refute in one word, to wit, that they had onely a shew or pretext, but no soliditie of reason or wisedome in them; and addeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reason against the practice of those rites, because thereby they withheld that honor or just care: (see 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3.) from the body, which ought to be had in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the necessities thereof. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the maintainers whereof have not somwhat to say in its defence, whereby they labour to extoll it as most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and excellent; Thus the doctrine of those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious rites pretended to <hi>wisedome,</hi> that is, heavenly and excellent doctrine. 2. All that can be said for any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, being rightly weighed, will be found but meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, fair shews, and no soliditie of reason; <hi>they had</hi> but <hi>a shew of wisedome.</hi> 3.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94357:106"/>

And in the first part of this Chapter, he presseth upon them generall duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all conditions of men.</p>
               <p>And first, he exhorteth unto all those duties, in the bulk, under the name of seeking Heaven, and things hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and of neglecting things on earth. First, because of Christ's being there in great state, v. 1, 2. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because they were dead to sin, and things under Heaven. And thirdly, though their spirituall life was now hid, v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Next he presseth those generall duties in two particular bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; as first, mortification, reckoning forth severall sins to be mortified; first, more carnall corruptions, v. 5. and arguments are used, v. 6, 7. Secondly, more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all corruptions, v. 8, 9.—by an argument taken from their regeneration, v.—9, 10. Which he cleareth by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving those things which have no influence upon rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, v. 11. Next he presseth vivification, and the exercise of severall vertues; whereof he giveth some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, intermingling diverse arguments, to v. 16. where he inciteth to the study of Scripture, and giveth a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule for all our actions, v. 17.</p>
               <p>In the second part, he presseth some duties belonging to Christians, as they are members of Families: First, the duties of wives, v. 18. Secondly, of husbands, v. 19. Thirdly, of children, v. 20. Fourthly, of fathers, v. 21. Fifthly, of servants, v. 22, 23, which are inforced by a promise, v. 24, and a threatning, v. 25.</p>

                  <p>He exhorteth from the ground (held forth chap. 2. v. 12.) of their being risen with Christ, that they would earnestly seek, know, and from knowledge, delight in things which are above, to wit, Heaven, happinesse, and all spirituall graces; and not in things earthly, such as riches, honors, pleasures, together with those superstitious rites placed in things earthly and perishing, whereof he spoke before; and that because Christ their Head, their Husband, is above, at the right hand of God, compleatly glorified, and intrusted with full power to dispense all things for his peoples good, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. v. 20. 22. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The doctrine of salvation and free grace, is then rightly learned, when the fruits of an holy life do flow from the knowledge of it; other wayes, the grace of God is turned into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Jude</hi> v.—4. So <hi>Paul</hi> (having given a short sum of saving doctrine) exciteth to holinesse of life, as the most sutable fruits of such doctrine: <hi>seek the things which are above, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As Heaven and glory: so the saving graces of God's Spirit are <hi>things above;</hi> as coming from above, <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. and elevating the heart of him who hath them, above things earthly, to entertain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God here, that he may live above with God for ever, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21.

above; <hi>seek the things which are above.</hi> 4. Heaven, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces which lead to it, are to be sought, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently sought: <hi>seek the things which are above.</hi> The word signifieth a diligent search, and is applyed to those who are vehemently desirous to have that which they seek, 1. <hi>Pet. 5. -8. Mark</hi> 12. 12. 5. That Heaven and things heavenly may be thus sought diligently, we must know somewhat of the worth which is in them, and from knowledge put a price upon them: <hi>Set your affection on things above.</hi> The word rendered <hi>affection</hi> here, in the Originall comprehendeth the operations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, will, and affections: So it is to know them, from knowledge to affect them, and so to seek them, 6. Things earthly, and things heavenly, are in two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ballances; so that the more of the heart is given to the one, the other getteth the lesse: for, he opposeth those two, <hi>Set your affection on things above, not on things on earth.</hi> 7. Though we may use the world, and things worldly, yea, and seek them moderatly, that so we may have the use of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. yet they are to be sought in subordination, and not in opposition to things heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: They must not be sought as our last end and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest shot, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 11. not by unlawfull means, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. or, with neglect of God's worship, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. not so but to reverence and submit to God, when he cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and disappointeth us in them, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. for, in this sense he commands. <hi>Set your affection on things above, not on things on earth.</hi> 8. Not onely are reall Believers risen with Christ; First, judicially, Christ's resurrection (as all his other actions, wherein he sustained our person) being imputed to us, so, as to obtain what was purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them: See chap. 2. v. 20. <hi>doct.</hi> 1. And secondly, in their own persons, all Believers being really and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally quickened and raised from the death of sin, to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, by vertue of Christ's resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. as that, whereby he evidenced his purchasing of holiness for them, by his death, which he doth afterward bestow upon them. But besides, all the Members of the visible

Church are in some sense risen with him, in so far as they are actually tyed by their professing and interest in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 6. and by the Covenant sealed in their Baptism, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2, 3. to make use of the vertue purchased by his resurrection, for raising of them up from the death of sin, to the life of grace, for, he supponeth they are risen with Christ: <hi>If ye be therefore risen with Christ.</hi> 9. From this it followeth, that all within the visible Church, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, or unregenerate, are to make use of this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their being raised with Christ, as a strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make them seek after Heaven, and endeavor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of life: the latter sort being ingaged to make use of the power of his resurrection for this end &amp; having Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and holinesse purchased for them, if they will but by faith slee unto him: the former sort having an actual right unto those things already, as being judicially risen with him, and the begun life of holinesse bestowed upon them, by vertue of his resurrection, and more of that vertue, for compleating of what remaineth, in readinesse to be communicated unto them, if they will but imploy it by faith: for, from this ground he inforceth holinesse; <hi>If ye be therefore risen with Christ, seek those things, &amp;c.</hi> 10. Jesus Christ in his Humane Nature is now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not upon earth; else the Apostle's argument would not hold, <hi>to seek things which are above,</hi> because <hi>he is there.</hi> 11. The love which Christians do bear unto Christ, ought to be such, that the very place where he is, ought to be lovely for his sake: their affections being wholly set upon it, and upon those things which are in it, and slow from it, or tend towards it: for, so he reasoneth, <hi>Set your affection on things above, where Christ is.</hi> I 2. The great glory which Christ our Head injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Heaven, together with the power and authority put upon him for the Churches good, especially for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of grace and glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, is a strong incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to make the Members of the Church, and chiefly reall Believers, set about the study of holinesse: for, this glory and power of his, is signified by his sitting

at the right hand of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22, 23. and from this he reasoneth, that they should seek those things which are above, whereby he compriseth all those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein holinesse consists, even from this, <hi>that Christ is sitting there at the right hand of God.</hi>

                  <p>He giveth further reasons to inforce the exhortation; First, they were spiritually dead to sin, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to those earthly things, so, as not to place their happiness in them, or to be sinfully eager in seeking after them. 2. Though their spirituall life, whereof they were partakers by their rising with Christ, was for the time hid under crosses and infirmities; yet it was surely kept for them by God in Christ, v. 3. and should hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gloriously appear in Christ's second coming, v. 4. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Reall Believers are spiritually dead, not in sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. but to sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. the dominion and reign of sin being shaken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. and its strength much weakened by the power of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. though not totally subdued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. and Christ having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to subdue it wholly in them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. And all the members of the Church (though not as yet real Believers) have ingaged themselves to imploy the strength of Jesus Christ for the subduing of sin; whence in some sense, to wit, <hi>judicially</hi> by obligation, they may also be said to be dead: for, the Apostle supponeth of all of them, every one in his own way, that they were thus dead: <hi>for ye are dead,</hi> saith he. 2. The consideration of this, that we are thus dead to sin, is a strong argument for the not-inslaving of our affections to things earthly: for, that would argue sin to be yet reigning, and were an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of fuell to sin, for keeping of it alive, after we have under-taken to be its death: It's used as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94357:109"/>
here to that purpose: <hi>for ye are dead.</hi> 3. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life of grace here, and of glory hereafter, is a life desirable, and onely worthy of the name of life, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life being but short, uncertain, and common to us with devils, reprobates, yea and with beasts; and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be called <hi>life,</hi> being compared with this, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 6. Our life is hid,</hi> saith he, speaking of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, as if there had been no other life but it. 4. This spirituall life, though really injoyed by Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as having grace in possession, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and a right to future glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. yet it is hid: the crosse which accompanieth godlinesse <hi>Act.</hi> 14. -22. together with the many out-breakings and infirmities of the godly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. and the nature of this life, which consisteth in things spirituall, as adoption, justification &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. those things make this life not at all discernable by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. yea, and hardly by the regenerate man himself, who is carryed much to judge of things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sense, <hi>Ps.</hi> 73. 13, 14. So <hi>our life is hid.</hi> 5. Though this life be hid, yet it is surely kept, being hid with Christ in God, as out of the knowledge, so out of the hazard of the world: God the fountain of all grace and glory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given all the fulnesse thereof unto Christ the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. from which fulnesse he is to bestow so much as is fitting for our condition here, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the rest to be forth-coming for us in glory hereafter. 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2. It is hid with Christ in God.</hi> 6. So near is that union which is betwixt Christ and Believers, that he is their life: His life and theirs are in a kind one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. he having purchased this life for us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9. and possessing the fulnesse of it in himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. that he may communicate it unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. and having communicated the first principles and seeds of it already, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11. besides that, he is the object of this life, their happinesse and life consisting in their knowing and injoying of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. for, <hi>when Christ who is our life,</hi> saith he. 7. As Christ now in his bodily presence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from us: so he is again to appear, when he shall


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94357:110"/>
come the second time unexpectedly, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 2. and with great glory, accompanied with Angels, and flames of fire, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 1. when Christ shall appear.</hi> 8. There is a state of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both in soul (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.) and body <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3. 21.) waiting for the people of God: <hi>then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</hi> 9. This glory of theirs is to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended untill Christ's second coming: There will be alwayes somewhat in-lacking till then; but then their glory shall be compleat, which should make us long for it, <hi>Phil. 3. -20. Then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</hi> 10. The faith of approaching glory at Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a strong argument to make us wean our affections from things earthly, and endeavor earnestly the study of a holy life: an Heir of a Kingdom will not be much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with petty pleasures, his minde is so carryed up to higher things: for, <hi>Paul</hi> presseth them to set their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things which are above, because, saith he, <hi>ye shall also appear with him in glory.</hi>

                  <p>He proponeth the former exhortation more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, by branching out the Christian mans task in two; First, mortification of sin; and presseth them to mortifie or put to death their members, not of their naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for, that were a sin against the sixt Command, but of the masse of corruption, or body of death, which was in them, to wit, their corrupt lusts and affections, which are said to be <hi>upon the earth,</hi> because they draw the soul down towards earth: whereof he mentioneth some, which are carnall and fleshly, as tending to fulfill our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleasures, <hi>fornication, uncleannesse, &amp;c. Doct.</hi> 1. The work of mortification, whereby a sinner sensible of the evill of sin, <hi>(Act.</hi> 2. 37, 38.) doth honestly resolve, <hi>(Job</hi>


                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:94357:110"/>
34. v. -31.) and accordingly endeavor, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.) to subdue sin throughly, root and branch, or to put it to death; and this not onely one sin, but all known sins, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 2. eschewing carefully the occasions of sin, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. and using all means which may tend to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of it; such as prayer, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8.) hearing of the Word, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2.) yea, and in some cases, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 29. But chiefly, acting faith in Christ for strength, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. This is a work so necessary, that the life of glory to be manifested at Christ's second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, cannot be attained without it: for, from what he said, v. 4. of their appearing with Christ in glory, he inferreth, <hi>Mortifie therefore, &amp;c.</hi> 2. This work of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is not perfected at an instant: So much of this body of death remaineth still in life, that the best of Christians must make it their daily task, to mortifie their members, though they be already mortified in part for, v. 2. they were dead, and yet he commands here, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your members.</hi> 3. Scripture-commands for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of sin, do not evince a power in men unrenewed, to obey what is commanded; if we consider that such commands are given, even to those who are already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and are hereby injoyned to carry on the begun work of Mortification towards some perfection, from a principle of habituall grace already infused in them: They are indeed directed also to the unrenewed, who are hereby taught what they ought, but not what they are able to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. and are also inabled to do what they ought; the Lord making use of those exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as means for conveying of strength to do that which he commandeth to be done; So, speaking unto them who were dead, v. 2. he prescribeth, <hi>Mortifie your members.</hi> 4. There is a body of sin, and corrupt nature in us, to which our particular vices, sinfull lusts, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections are as members; Our corrupt nature and will making use of them, and working by them, as the naturall body doth imploy its members: besides that, sin doth spread it self through all the members of


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94357:111"/>
our body, making each of them servants unto iniquity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. Hence he saith, <hi>Mortifie your members,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those sinfull lusts and affections. 5. Not onely are the outward acts of <hi>fornication,</hi> or filthinesse, betwixt parties, both free from the yoke of marriage, to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed; and of <hi>uncleannesse,</hi> whereby are usually sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified all other sorts of filthy lusts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. but also that impotencie of minde, whereby temptations to lust do easily take impression, and are not much resisted, set forth here by <hi>inordinate affection,</hi> or, (as it may be turned) <hi>softness of minde;</hi> which yeeldeth easily to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>fornication, uncleannesse, inordinate affection.</hi> 6. Yea, the first inordinate motions of lust in the heart, which are not followed forth after deliberation and advice, and are set down under the name of <hi>evill concupiscence;</hi> even those are to be mortified: <hi>evil concupiscence.</hi> 7. We do then set against sin to some purpose, when we pursue it to the den, and labour to pluck it up by the very roots, with-drawing from those things which adde fuell to it; for he will have them going from the outward acts of filthinesse to the inward root: <hi>evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence;</hi> and to set against <hi>covetousnesse</hi> also, whereby lust is sed and nourished; <hi>evill concupiscence and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> 8. Covetousnesse, which consists in an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate desire to acquire or keep worldly riches, is a sin which all Christians are to mortifie; not onely because it provideth oyl to make all other sins burn; but it hath a kind of idolatry in it, as drawing our love, trust, fear, and joy, from God and his service, to be taken up with, and laid out upon wealth, and riches, more than any other sins: <hi>and covetousnesse which is idolatry.</hi>

The wrath which is due unto, and is accordingly poured forth upon contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious sinners, is of another kind; as being everlasting, without any mixture of fatherly mercy, and flowing from sin-pursuing justice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 4. for which cause he holdeth forth that wrath, <hi>which cometh on the children of disobedience,</hi> as being most terrifying. 5. As the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the terror of divine wrath is a strong aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to restrain from sin; So it is most moving, when considered in the sad and woful experience of those who have found the dolefull effects of it: for, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the effects of this wrath upon others to fear them, 6. Sin keepeth so much of its old interest in the best; and even Believers sometimes are so much overtaken with spiritual deadnesse, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 64. 7.) that there is need to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the terror of divine wrath unto them, to fear them from sin, and excite them to duty: for, the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth the terror of divine wrath, even to those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Colossians.</p>

It is not some moe, or fewer particular acts of a man's life, but his ordinary strain and way, according to which, sentence is to passe upon his state, whether it be good or bad: It was their <hi>walking</hi> in sin, and making a daily trade of it, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued them to be in nature, or <hi>living in sin.</hi> 2.

A mans walking in sin, or his ordinary strain of breaking forth in the outward acts of it, dependeth upon his living in sin, or upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power and dominion which sin exerceth in him, even as natural life is the cause of outward motion; So that the best way to curb the outward acts, is, to strike at the life and power of sin within; <hi>In which ye walked when ye lived in them.</hi> 4. Our calling to mind of by-past sins, and our long continuance in them, should not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an holy indignation at them, and at our selves for them, so as to scar us from them in time coming: for, the Apostle mentioneth their by-past continuance in those sins, as one argument to scar them from them.</p>

mortifying, or subduing of it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> (having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to mortifie and kill sin, ver. 5.) he biddeth them here <hi>put it off,</hi> which speaks somewhat further, to wit, a removing of it quite out of sight, as we do dead bodies, when we bury them: for so the word sometimes signifieth. 2. Though all sins be not alike throughly mortified, there being some more deeply rooted than others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. v.—23. yet the grace of mortification striketh at all known sin, and spareth none; for, it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth sin, as it is sin. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. v.—9. and so all sin: So the Apostle commandeth, <hi>But now also put you off all those.</hi> And the particulars after mentioned are not for restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for instance, or, example. 3. In the work of mortification we are not to rest upon the subduing of these sins which are grosse and fleshly, but are to proceed against more spiritual sins also, which have as much of guilt in them before God, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 5. 20.) though not so much of infamy before men; So the Apostle exhorteth to <hi>put off anger, wrath, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Anger, which (as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from wrath and malice) is an unjust desire of revenge, is a sin unbeseeming Christians, and so to be put off; chiefly when <hi>wrath</hi> is joyned with it, which (as it is distinguished from anger) pointeth at the gorging and swelling of the blood about the heart, which fireth the eye and tongue, even that passionate commotion which useth to accompany anger, transforming a man to a very beast, thrusting him forward to act some mischief, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 28, 29. and banishing the Spirit of God, <hi>Eph. 4. 30, 31.

scandalous: <hi>Put off blasphemy, filthy communication, &amp;c.</hi> 7. The right order to be kept in mortification, is, to begin with the heart, and from thence to proceed to the tongue and outward man: for, he commandeth them to put off heart evils in the first place, <hi>anger, wrath, and malice;</hi> and the evils of the tongue, as <hi>blasphemie, &amp;c.</hi> in the next. 8. Disgraceful and contumelious speaking against our neighbours, as it is the result of anger, wrath and malice: so it is a sin to be mortified, as very unbeseeming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: whether it be by open railing, secret backbiting, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 22. by derision, or jearing at their sins and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to shame them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 4. or by imprecation, cursing of, and wishing evil unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14. for, seing the rest of the evils mentioned here relate to our neighbor, as their immediate object; we conceive the word <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> relates to him also, and is to be taken for disgrace in words uttered against men, as <hi>Rom. 3. 8-: Blasphemie.</hi> 9.

Here is a further argument, inforcing the exhortation, taken from the work of regeneration, to which, all of them were ingaged by their Profession and Covenant sealed in Baptism, and which was really begun in those who were true believers among them, whereof he assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two parts: First, <hi>the putting off the old man with his deeds,</hi> that is, our naturall corruption, conveyed unto us by carnall generation, and actuall sins flowing from thence, v.—9. Secondly, <hi>putting on the new man,</hi> that is, new and spirituall qualities, whereby our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is renewed, the saving and operative knowledge of God in Christ, being imparted to it, which work, God by his creating power doth carry on, that thereby he may repair his defaced Image in man. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. From this, that our originall corruption is called an <hi>old man,</hi> and is said to be <hi>put off,</hi> by a Metaphore taken from cloathes, we learn several things of the nature and power of it; first, originall corruption spreadeth it self far, even through the whole man, soul <hi>(Gen.</hi> 6. 5.) body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. and all; therefore is it called a <hi>man.</hi> Secondly, Not onely is it born with us, but hath its rise from <hi>Adams</hi> fall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. It then took life, and is conveyed since from father to son, unto all descending from <hi>Adam, Ps.</hi> 51. 5. by ordinary generation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. hence it is called an <hi>old man;</hi> as also because in the godly it is drawing towards expiration and upon the declining hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20. Thirdly, it adhereth very closely to us, as a man's garments, and more closely than any garment, yea, nor a man's skin: for, humane art can draw off the one, but onely the power of God can free us from the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Fourthly, it is not of the substance or being either of soul or body, it is onely an adventitious quality, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. for it is compared to garments. And fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as old as this corruption is; yet it is very active and restlesse; not as other things, which as they grow in age, so fall more quiet; but this <hi>old man</hi> hath <hi>his deeds.</hi> And sixthly, as near unto us, as far spread through us, as old and active as this corruption is, the Child of God


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94357:114"/>
getteth it <hi>put off,</hi> though not fully, yet in its guilt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and in its esteem and reigne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. and in some measure in his practice, and execution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. This is supponed here, <hi>seeing ye have put off the old man. Doct.</hi> 2. According as the old man of our in-bred corruption is put off, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within; So, actuall sins flowing there-from, are weakened without. The old hand and tongue are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with a renewed heart; <hi>ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> 3. From this, that gracious and spiritual qualities are called the <hi>new-man,</hi> and said to be put on as new garments, we learn severall things relating to the nature of grace: First, it spreadeth it self as far through the whole man, as sin doth, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 23. So it's called a <hi>man.</hi> Secondly, it is not born with us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. neither cometh it from the first, but second <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. and is upon the growing hand, towards its full strength in the godly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. therefore is it called <hi>new.</hi> Thirdly, it adhereth closely to us, as sin did, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. and yet is not naturall to us, but an addition to our nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. we are naked without it, and it is a beautifull ornament to the soul, as new garments are to the body, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. from which the Metaphore is taken; <hi>and have put on. Doct.</hi> 4. We once had this new man, those gracious qualities, at our first creation: for, God made man perfect, <hi>Eccles. 7. 29. which is renewed.</hi> It signifieth, to restore a thing deformed and antiquated, to its ancient form and beautie. 5. Those gracious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were all lost unto us, to wit, in <hi>Adam:</hi> the Lord dealing with him in that first Covenant, as with a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick person, representing all who were to come of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. This is supponed, while he saith, <hi>which is renewed.</hi> 6. It is Christ's aim in giving grace, to recover that in his own which was lost in <hi>Adam: which is renewed,</hi> or restored to its ancient form and beauty; <hi>and after the image of him, &amp;c.</hi> that is, the Image of God which was lost in <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 5. 3. and did consist in perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God's Law, in both the Tables thereof, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94357:114"/>
is set forth by righteousnesse and holinesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. 7. The recovery of that which was lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> as it is begun in the first instant of regeneration; So, it's not compleated at first, but is a continued action, even unto death; <hi>which is renewed:</hi> It imports a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued action, the word being in the present time. 8. The sum and compend of this <hi>new man,</hi> is, the knowledge of God in Christ, not theoretick and notionall onely, but practicall and operative, which worketh such a change both in the outward and inward man, that the grace of God in Christ, is really acknowledged by us in our minde, affection and work, <hi>Eph. 4. 21, 22. renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment;</hi> for, so the word signifieth, and is rendered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 18. 9. So dead are we by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to holinesse and grace, that no lesse than creating power is required to work it in us; <hi>the image of him who created him.</hi> 10. There is not any argument more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and effectually exciting unto holinesse of life with a sincere Christian, than that which is taken from his ingagement to it by profession, and the first beginning thereof wrought in him already by the Spirit of God: for, this is the scope, that they would mortifie and put off such and such sins; <hi>seeing they had put off the old man, and put on the new.</hi>

It is usuall for men to dream that they will be the better liked of by God, because of outward relations, privileges and accomplishments, which they injoy beyond others: as that they are of such a Nation and stock of people, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. that they injoy such privileges, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. that they are tight and smooth in their outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. that they are great, wise and rich, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 48. for, it is to obviate this apprehension, that those words are added, shewing that the having of those things doth not help: <hi>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew.</hi> 2.

Though under the Old Testament God did dispense grace, and the means of grace, with respect had to different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, to the severall sexes, and the outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; the Jews being then his onely people. <hi>(Psal,</hi> 147. 19. 20.) and among them the Males <hi>(Gen.</hi> 17. 10.) and free-men, <hi>(Levit.</hi> 22. 10.) being admitted to injoy some privileges, which the Females and bond-men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not: And though the Lord doth yet under the New

Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is <hi>all,</hi> which God regardeth in the matter of regeneration: what is inlacking through want of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges or outward eminencie, is made up in him; and what naturall men expect from those, is to be found in him, and much more: for, he is <hi>all,</hi> to wit, which is required in this matter: whatever a man be otherwayes, he is well, and commended sufficiently to God if he have him; and he is nought if he want him, even him, who is made of God, wisedome, righteousnesse, sanctification and redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and this not onely, because he hath merited all, but by his Spirit he applyeth all to, and worketh all in, us: <hi>but Christ is all.</hi> 5.

It is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of Christians to forbear avenging of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also to forgive and pardon those who have done them wrong; which, besides ceasing from private revenge, doth import the banishing of malice and desire of revenge out of the heart, yea, and loving those who do us hurt, <hi>Luke 6. 27. forgiving one another.</hi> Onely the Magistrate is not hereby bound up from executing his office against publick offenders; nor yet private men are discharged from having recourse to the Magistrate, for attaining restauration to their right, and reparation of their wrongs; providing they be not acted with private splene, and a spirit of rigour, <hi>(Phi.</hi> 4. 5.) but with zeal to justice, and pitty to their party; lest he, and others also be hardened in mischief: for, magistracy is God's ordinance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and so may be imployed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. 4.

                  <p>The Apostle, following the Metaphor taken from garments, exhorteth them to put on the grace of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the upper garment above the rest, and so more precious than the rest, commending it from this, that it is a tye or bond, which knitteth all the Members of the Church together, and maketh all their severall gifts and graces cohere, and so be usefull for the publick good; whereby the Church is made a perfect Body, able to discharge those actions which are competent to it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The grace of Charity, whereby from the fountain of love to God, we do love our neighbour, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 22. 37, 38.) is a most necessary grace: for, whatever we do without it, is not the exercise of any saving grace, but at the best onely of a morall vertue 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, 3. and the acts of all other vertues relating to our neighbour, are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it, and so are ascribed to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. &amp;c. Hence the Apostle commendeth to <hi>put on charity,</hi> as the upper garment <hi>above all those.</hi> 2. As the Church, while rent a sunder, is a disjoynted and lame body, unfit for dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging those actions which are competent to it (the rent and scattered members not working together for the Churches good; but rather imploying their parts, and abusing their esteem for graces to their own mutual prejudice) So, such is the nature and power of this grace of Charity, that it knitteth together all these scattered Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and makes their graces and gifts subservient to the good one of another, and chiefly to the good of the whole; so that the Church is hereby made a compleat intire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was lame without it.

That this piece of Gospel-worship may be gone about acceptably, First, Our Songs would be spiritual, and this not only for the matter, but because of the assistance of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of a spiritual frame of heart which is required for singing aright, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18, 19.

poor is the reward which servants have to expect from their Masters, and what is promised, is often so slightly payed, that for their incouragement, they would cast their eye frequently upon the reward of this heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: for, the Apostle holdeth it out to be eyed by them, while he saith, <hi>of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance.</hi> 3.

That they would deal with God for him and other faithfull Ministers; that in that time of persecution chiefly, wherein he was made a prisoner for Truth, they might be indued with a spirit of boldnesse and freedom in the delivery of their message; the subject whereof was most precious, as being a mysterie, and a mysterie of Christ and so a most necessary and profitable mysterie, v. 3. And that he might be gifted with plainness in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with all other properties requisite in an able and faithful Preacher, v. 4 <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christians are bound to pray for others aswell as for themselves, and chiefly for their Ministers, and for every one, as they are lesse or more instrumental in the work of Christ; so <hi>Paul,</hi> who was much imployed in the work of the Gospel, enjoyneth, <hi>Withall, praying also for us.</hi> 2. Those only are sit to pray for others, who are making conscience to pray for themselves: for, the Apostle, having exhorted them, v. 2. to pray indefinitly, (which certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth principally the duty of every man's praying for himself) here subjoyneth, <hi>Withall,</hi> and <hi>also praying for us.</hi> 3. Whatever a Minister be for abilities and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it becometh him well to seek the help of Gods people committed to his charge, for his further inabling to go


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94357:127"/>
about the duties of his Calling, and especially he is to seek the help of their prayers: for, even <hi>Paul</hi> seeketh this from those Colossians; <hi>Withall, praying also for us.</hi> 4. In times of persecution chiefly, a faithful Minister will be more anxious and careful for the thriving of the Gospel, and work of God, than for his own particular interest: If it go well with the Gospel, come of him what will, he is well; So <hi>Paul</hi> (though lying in bonds) urgeth upon them to pray, not so much for his own liberty, as the Gospels; not that the prison doors might be open, but <hi>that God would open to them a door of utterance.</hi> 5. Holy boldnesse and freedom is much to be wished for in a Minister; that so he may speak all seasonable Truths, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. and to all persons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20, 21. and at all times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. and may speak them as the Truths of God with courage and authority, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 14. This holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and freedom is meant by the <hi>door of utterance,</hi> as the Apostle himself expoundeth it, <hi>Eph. 6. 19, 20. That God would open unto us a door of utterance.</hi> 6. There are many difficulties to be overcome before a man can attain unto this holy boldnesse, and those such, that only God can remove them: There is a difficulty to find out pertinent matter, and to vent it when it is found; partly, through want of courage; partly, through the suspending some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of divine influence: and there is a difficulty to vent it rightly; that is, first confidently, arising either from want of experience, or from an evil conscience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pertinently, through want of prudence. Hence <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of this holy boldnesse, useth the metaphor of a door, and of a door shut until God do open it: <hi>That God would open unto us a door of utterance.</hi> 7. As Christ in his Person, Natures and Offices, and the Gospel, which treateth of those, is a mysterie: So Christ and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel should be the main subject of a Ministers preaching: He ought so to preach the Law, and presse duties, as that the due relation betwixt Christ and those may be clearly held forth; Christ being the end of the Law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <hi>Rom. 10. 4. To speak the mysterie of Christ</hi>


                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:94357:127"/>
8. Persecution for the Gospel tendeth to the advantage of the Gospel; the more it is suppressed, the more it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>in bonds,</hi> and yet he preacheth, <hi>Act. 26. 29. Doct.</hi> 9. Then are people chiefly to bear burden with their Ministers by praying to God for them, when they are under persecution for the Gospel: for, <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth his bonds, as an argument exciting them to pray: <hi>for which I am also in bonds.</hi> 10. It is a great part of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters task, as to preach, so to make what he preacheth, plain unto the people, by dimitting himself in the whole convey of his purpose, for method, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15.) stile, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4.) and close application, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.) so far as is possible unto the capacitie of the meanest; <hi>That I may make it manifest,</hi> saith he. 11. Besides this holy boldnesse and plainnesse, there are many other things which a Minister would advert to in preaching, as that he preach pertinently to the conditions of all, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 4. that he speak affectionatly and with pitty, even to the most stubborn, <hi>

described, first, severally from their respective names and other adjuncts; next joyntly from their Nation, they were Jews; from their pains in promoving the Gospel; and from their usefulnesse to <hi>Paul</hi> himself. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place should not cool those affections of love and good-will, which ought to be among Christians: for, those salutations were outward expressions of their inward love, and they do salute, though at a distance. 2. As little mercy is to be expected from persecuters; So, the crosse of Christ, and suffering for Truth, is a thing not to be ashamed of: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> as it were, glorieth in the style of <hi>Prisoner,</hi> though he was used as a captive slave: <hi>Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner:</hi> the word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, a captive of war. 3. As reall friendship doth not expire with prosperity; So, the sharpest sufferings of God's people, have some sweet ingredient in them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> hath a fellow with him while he is prisoner, even <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> who was his companion in travels, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. and 20. v. 4. and now doth not quit him in his sufferings: <hi>Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner.</hi> 4.

Notwithstanding a man hath fallen, to the grief and scandall of others; yet, after evidences given of his amendment, he ought to be received and conversed with as formerly; So <hi>Mark,</hi> otherwayes called <hi>John,</hi> did desert <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13. 13. whereupon arose that hot contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those two Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 37.

As folk should not follow the multitude of the kinde, from whom they are descended, in an evill course; So this tendeth much to a man's commendation, when


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94357:130"/>
he breaks off his evill kinde, and is not carryed away with them: for, those three were of the Jews, a people for the most part, enemies to the Gospel, <hi>Rom. 11. 28. who are of the circumcision,</hi> which is mentioned for their commendation, that though they were Jews, yet they had become Christians, and companions of <hi>Paul</hi> under his affliction. 7. There is no way which leadeth to the Kingdom of Glory, but that which is held forth in the Gospel, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. And Christ doth rule in the world by the Gospel subduing thereby the hearts of men to live by his Laws <hi>(Psal.</hi> 110. 3.) written in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. and exercising Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in his visible Courts, according to the Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. Therefore the Gospel in this place is called the Kingdom of God, See <hi>Matth. 4. 23. Mark, 4. 11. Fellow-workers unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> 8. This maketh much unto a man's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, when he hath any hand in the promoving of this Kingdom, and especially when his discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are many, and incouragements few, from the example of others who should joyn with him in that work, and do it not: for, they are commended from this, that they onely of the circumcision were <hi>Paul's fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-workers unto the kingdom of God.</hi> 9. It appeareth hence how small ground there is for the Pope's pretended su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie and head-ship over the Church; the main Pillar whereof, is, that because <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop at Rome, therefore the Pope must be his successor: now, beside that, they can never prove <hi>Peter</hi> to have been Head of the Church, it is certain that he was not at Rome, when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epistle, there being onely there then those three of the circumcision, <hi>who were his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourers unto the Kingdom of God:</hi> Neither is there any word in Scripture to prove, that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, but much to the contrary. 10.

God in mercy, doth not suffer them to be destitute of some, who are comfortable and incouraging unto them, when their necessity calleth for it: for, saith he, <hi>Which have been a comfort to me:</hi> The word signifieth, they had been for comfort, counsell or incouragement unto him; which supponeth, that even <hi>Paul</hi> had need of those som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. 11. As most eminent Christians are ready to acknowledge, with thankfulnesse, how steadable any are made unto them in their suffering case; So it is matter of no small commendation, to be in any measure helpfull, by counsell, advice, incouragement, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto those who are suffering for Christ, and any part of his Truth: for, herein are those three commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they had <hi>been a comfort unto Paul,</hi> as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by himself.</p>

                  <p>Here are salutations directed from <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who is described from his Countrey, his Office of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and his affection to those Colossians, testified by his servent and constant praying to God for them, that they might be gifted with perseverance in universall, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and hearty obedience to the will of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A Minister ought not to omit any duty of civility, tending to keep a good understanding betwixt him and his flock: for, <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was their Minister. (chap. 1. v. 7.) <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth them.</hi> 2. The power of a call from God and his People, ought to make a man venture upon apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which other wayes he were obliged to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew: for, <hi>Epaphras</hi> their own Countreyman, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced a call to the Ministery among those Colossians; though Christ showeth, a Minister is in hazard to meet with dis-respect in his own Countrey, <hi>Joh. 4. 44. who is one of you.</hi> 3. As it is the duty of a Minister, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94357:131"/>
to preach unto, pray with; but also to pray for his flock, and that alwayes when opportunity offereth: So, an honest Minister, who maketh conscience of this duty in earnest, will finde it to be no easie task, considering how indisposed he is sometimes to pray for himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 40. and how many in the flock pray not for themselves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 47. &amp;c. and so are an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den unto any who would pray for them; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they are also, concerning whom God will not be be intreated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 14. Thus <hi>Epaphras was a wayes labouring fervently for them in prayer.</hi> The word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to be striving in a battell, and in an agony for them. 4. A Minister ought not to rest satisfied, that he himself preacheth Truth plainly, or that the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, attain thereby to the knowledge of Truth; but practice and obedience to the will of God so known, must be added, together with perseverance and constancie in their begun obedience, lest by their falling away, they lose themselves, and disgrace the Truth: for, he prayeth that they <hi>might stand perfect and compleat in all the will of God.</hi> 5. It is neither the pains of a Minister, nor resolution of a people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. but the power of God, which worketh constancie in the way of holinesse, against the stormy blasts of severall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for, <hi>Epaphras prayeth unto God for it, that they may stand perfect and compleat in the will of God.</hi> 6. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven obedience to the will of God, and that which is to be aimed at, is that, which is, 1. <hi>perfect,</hi> to wit, with a perfection of parts, or sincere, and not hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall; <hi>that ye may stand perfect.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

A Minister's zeal ought to be extended towards others of Christ's Members, than those of his proper charge, and chiefly unto those Churches which ly nearest unto him, as being in a neerer capacitie by their good or evill example, to advance or retard the work of God among his own flock: So, Paul <hi>beareth record, that Epaphras had a great zeal for those in Laodicea, and Hierapolis,</hi> which were neighbouring Churches.</p>

                  <p>Here are some salutations sent from <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Demas. Doct.</hi> 1. As Christ, when he is about to supply his Church with a Ministery, will take men of any calling, whom he pleaseth to choose, and make them Ministers: So, worldly advantage is not to be stood upon when Christ calleth: for, <hi>Luke,</hi> the same, as it seemeth, who wrote the Gospel, was before a Physician, and had now


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94357:132"/>
become a Minister; though his former calling would have advantaged him more, chiefly at those times when Civill Authority did allow no maintenance for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; <hi>Luke the beloved Physician.</hi> 2. Men in place chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, should lay out their love and respect so wisely, that it may tend to a man's commendation to be respected by them, as being known to lay out their affection upon none but such as are worthy of it; So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Luke, beloved,</hi> to wit, by him, that hereby he may commend him to them; <hi>Luke the beloved Physician,</hi> 3. There are many fair Professors within the Visible Church, who may afterwards turn Apostats, who so long as they keep the mask of a Profession, will not be behind with the best in externall duties, yea, and often do out-strip others: for, this <hi>Demas,</hi> (whom many take to be the same who is spoken of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. to have turned Apostate, and as some write, an Idolatrous Priest) is here among the first in saluting those Colossians: <hi>And Demas greet you.</hi> 4. Though judicious Ministers may have their own fears, concerning such fore-mentioned Professors; yet so long as they continue in the externall duties of Christianity, they ought to give unto them that outward respect which is given unto others: but withall, Ministers would be sparing to ingage much in the commendation of any, whom they have ground to suspect will prove such, untill time try what they are: for, <hi>Paul</hi> writeth the salutation of <hi>Demas</hi> among the rest, though it is like he had his own fears concerning him; for, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth him not as he did the rest; <hi>And Demas greet you.</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle directs them to salute in his name, the Christians at Laodicea, that so they might be prepared to hear this Epistle with greater attention: And above all the rest he saluteth one. <hi>Nymphas</hi> (a man eminent for


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94357:133"/>
plety) and the Church at his house; whereby may be meant both a Congregation of Christians, to whom he had given his house for a place of publick assembling to Divine Worship; As also, his own Family, who were piously instructed, and orderly governed, as if they had been a Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. People are not so to make use of the respect and affection which a publick Minister carryeth unto them, as to make others equally deserving, jealous of him, as if he did carry no such respect unto them: for, the Apostle imployeth those Colossians, <hi>to salute</hi> in his name <hi>the brethren which were in Laodicea,</hi> as if he had said, Let them know, I carry the same respect unto them, which I carry unto you. 2. However a Minister be tyed to respect all the Members of the Church, and to evidence so much, by discharging all common duties towards them; yet he is bound to put some more respect upon those who are more eminent for piety among them; that so by his countenancing the appearances of piety, he may make it the more desirable and lovely: for, <hi>Paul saluteth Nymphas</hi> in particular. 3. As the Primitive Church had not the countenance of Civill Authoritie to provide, upon the Publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, places for the Congregation to meet, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick maintenance for Ministers: So, such was the servor of love to the Gospel then; that private Christians did contribute largely and freely for the up-holding of it: Charity did move to give more then, than force of Law can now: for, <hi>Nymphas</hi> gives his house to be a publick Place of meeting for the Church: <hi>and the Church at his house.</hi> 4. Masters of Families should so train up their houshold, in the exercise of Divine Worship, and in a godly conversation, by instructing the ignorant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. rebuking and censuring the disobedient and profane, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 7. and by discharging all duties of worship, competent to the Master of a Family, and causing his Family to joyn with him, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.—15. that they may deserve the name of a Church: So much is imported by

                  <p>He directeth them, that, after they have read this Epistle themselves, they would cause it be read in the Church of the Laodiceans, who, being their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, were infested with the same errors; And that some other Epistle, written from Laodicea, either from the whole Church, or from their Ministers, as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto <hi>Paul,</hi> informing him of their case, should be read by the Colossians, for better clearing of some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in this Epistle. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The helps of other mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, may, and should be made use of for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Scripture: for, this Epistle from Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea, was not written by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, who had never been there, chap. 2. v. 1. but by the Laodiceans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and <hi>Paul</hi> will have it read for the further clearing of this Epistle, which was written by himselfe: <hi>And that ye likewise read the Epistle from Laodicea.</hi>

slack) both to consider the nature and weight of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall charge with which he was intrusted by Christ, and that he would faithfully discharge all the parts of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no ground from this Scripture, for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a power of jurisdiction in People over their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to call them to a judiciall accompt, and to inflict the censures of the Church upon them: for, all that is here said, inferreth no more than an admonition from charity, which any private Christian might have given to their Minister, and not an authoritative censure or rebuke: <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh otherwayes, when he would establish any power of that kinde; As 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. Charge them that are rich, &amp;c.</hi> but here onely, <hi>Say unto Archippus.</hi> 2. As the best of Ministers are ready to fall slack in their duty, and have need of up-stirring, they have so much to do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.—16. and for the most part see so small fruits of what they do, <hi>Isai.</hi> 49. 4. So it is the duty of people to have an eye upon their Minister, how he dischargeth his Office, and when they see a fault in him, to tell himself of it, admonishing him for it: but withall, they would do this in love, and so, as they may evidence all due respect, both to his Person and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, he directeth them to <hi>Say unto Archippus, take heed to thy ministery,</hi> and not back-bite or rail upon <hi>Archippus.</hi> 3. That a man may conscientiously go about his calling, he would know the nature of such a Charge, and what it requireth: Particularly a Minister would know; First, that his Calling is a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> a laborious service, or a working, as it were, through dust and myre: for, so the word signifieth. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that however the designation of the person unto the Ministery be from man, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. and 14. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Office it self is from Jesus Christ, to whom he must be countable for his carriage in it: for, saith he, <hi>Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Archippus, take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This verse containeth the conclusion of the Epistle, which he sheweth, was written with his own hand, and not by a Secretary, as the rest of the Epistle was: And in it, having saluted them, he craveth, they would remember his bonds, and wisheth unto them God's grace and favour, with all spirituall benefits flowing from it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

God hath sufficiently provided in his Word, against the fore-mentioned evill, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such marks upon Scripture, as may be a clear dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt it and all humane writings; <hi>Paul's</hi> own hand-writing did serve for such a mark in his Epistles; <hi>The salutation by the hand of me Paul:</hi> And though this mark doth not extend unto all Scripture, neither can it give faith now, the first Copy of his Epistles being lost; yet there are other marks or arguments taken from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whereby it doth sufficiently evidence it self to be the Word of God, as the consent of all its parts, though written at diverse times, and by severall hands; the fulfilling of its prophecies; the majestie and simplicity of the style; the power of its doctrine. &amp;c. 3. As the most eminent servants of Christ may be put to personall sufferings for Truth; So, it is the duty of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to remember them under their sufferings, so as to pray to God for them, v. 2, 3. to see the worth of Truth,
