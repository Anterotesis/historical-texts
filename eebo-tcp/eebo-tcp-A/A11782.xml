            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The faith promiſed mutually to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they haue violated, the breaking of the couenants confirmed by ſolemne ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, the iniuries offered, the deeds and Inſtruments of the couenants falſified, and
<pb facs="tcp:162:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch like as theſe which follow: all or any one of theſe are eſteemed of all Nations iuſt cauſe of entring into warre.</p>
               <p>Now then muſt we declare how faith hath been violated, and the ſolemne conditions of the League haue been broken by them. The laſt yeare a ſurceaſe of Armes for 15 moneths was propounded of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> accepted of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and vpon certaine Articles vpon both parts agreed vpon, was ſet downe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, ſigned and ſealed. But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and their Complices, both at the very time in which they ſealed the Articles, and alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, did many wayes violate and pervert them, both by leauing out what was agreed vpon, &amp; inſerting vvhat vvas not couenanted at all. That Inſtrument of truce vvas exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and communicated in the Empire in the moneth of March, many weeks before it was either concluded or ſigned in <hi>England.</hi> In the meeting at <hi>Iutterbock,</hi> to the end that the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preparations of the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> might be hindered, and in <hi>Hungarie</hi> to <hi>Gabor</hi> that he ſhould not ſtirre, it was exhibited long before it was concluded, as if it had bin
<pb facs="tcp:162:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fully concluded and ſealed. And marke their cunning and falſe practiſe, by this exhibition of it, and a falſe perſwaſion which they added to it, that all things ſhould ſhortly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, were the Princes of the Empire ſo moued and perſwaded, that they compelled the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> to lay downe armes, and to depart out of the bounds of <hi>Germanie,</hi> denying him all prouiſion and paſſage. But the Inſtruments of the Truce were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but in the 21 of April old ſtile, or the firſt of May new ſtile, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the moneth of Auguſt ratified by the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi> Moreouer in thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deeds giuen abroad there to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> by the other partie, theſe words in the third Article (<hi>Declaring them enemies of the Empire and of our Allies</hi>) were left out, as words that might giue iuſt cauſe of offence to the Princes of the Empire, when they ſhould ſee ſuch a hard declaration extorted and wrung out of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But in the inſtruments ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>England,</hi> thoſe words were expreſly ſet downe, notwithſtanding the exception made againſt them by the Kings Sonne in law.
<pb facs="tcp:162:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. In the laſt Article in their deeds, it was left out, <hi>That the King of England ſhould ſend his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties for the intereſt of his Son in law,</hi> when yet in that conſiſted the very hinge and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie of the buſineſſe, and the foundation of the mind and will of the King of <hi>England,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inſtruments.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a falſhood to be noted in the ſubſcription of the day. In the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the 21 of April, <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtile; in theirs the firſt of May. Moe things may be brought to ſhew, that there was either falſhood or elſe double deeds.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it was alſo expreſly prouided by way of caution, That all things ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in the place and ſtate as they then were during the truce: that all acts of hoſtilitie ſhould ceaſe: that neither Allies nor friends ſhould be offended, but that both parts ſhould enioy the peace of the League. But <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Complices did &amp; doe ſtill in the time of the truce exerciſe all kinds of hoſtilitie, by confiſcating of their goods who haue withdrawne themſelues from the ruine of their countrey, by aboliſhing religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by diſmembring &amp; transferring vnto others
<pb facs="tcp:162:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the better parts of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as was done with the Lordſhip called the <hi>Bergſtras,</hi> with the Dioceſſes of <hi>Bleyenſteine</hi> and <hi>Nevenhane,</hi> &amp; others; by impoſing continuall ſeruitudes, and by often extorting new contributions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the oppreſſed; by drawing out the bloud and ſoule of the afflicted, and by waſting and wearing out all the poore ſubiects with their inſolent tyrannie. The very <hi>Spaniards</hi> alone haue in that part which they hold in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> impoſed an exaction of aboue thirty thouſand Dollars a moneth ouer and aboue the ordinary impoſitions. <hi>Verdugo</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition when he impoſed this exaction, was not afraid to affirm, that it was done with the knowledge and ſufferance of the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> &amp; that he did to moue the people. This extorſion hath now continued diuers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and is yet ſtill exerciſed, Laſtly the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and their complices did neuer for all the truce lay downe armes in the Empire, but went on with victorious warre againſt the friends of the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Sonne in law: yea we yet ſee them to proceed on ſtill ſcorning &amp; breaking this league of the truce, making it a net to catch their enemies in.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:162:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath by force and armes poſſeſt himſelfe of the Patrimony of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent infants the grand children of the King of <hi>England,</hi> hath caſt his Daughter and Son in law out of all their eſtates and dominions, and doth detaine the <hi>Palatinate</hi> againſt the hope he hath giuen and promiſe which hee hath ſo oft made of reſtoring it: he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Citie of <hi>Frankendale</hi> the Dowrie of his Daughter, &amp; invaded it in hoſtile maner; neither would he vouchſafe to raiſe the ſiege at the moſt earneſt entreaty of the King of <hi>England</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he compelled the forces of the king of <hi>England</hi> and his Generall ſent thither, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> ſcoffing and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the protection of <hi>England,</hi> by which hee had falſly perſwaded him that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſhould be ſafe.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:162:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. The ſafety of the King and kingdome requires warre. For it behoues vs then to look to our ſelues, when our next neighbours hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are on fire. Princes loſe both power and ſtrength when their Allies do periſh. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of a potent neighbor whoſe friendſhip is vnſafe, as it cannot be without iuſt ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo is it alſo dangerous and hurtful. The liberty of <hi>Germany</hi> now ready to periſh, is to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and the conſeruation of it doth greatly concerne both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and all the Princes of <hi>Europe. Germanie</hi> is the heart of <hi>Europe,</hi> for ſo Nature ſeems to haue placed it; the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> is the motion in the heart, according to the lawes. If <hi>Germaine</hi> as the heart be poſſeſt by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who ſtriues to get the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer all <hi>Europe,</hi> the reſt of the Princes ſhall not long draw or enioy any vitall life or ſpirits. The heart therefore muſt be ſuccored, if you would haue the reſt of the members or the body to be ſafe. But by theſe weake reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of treaties you ſhal do no good: ſtronger things are to be applyed, the diſeaſe ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neceſſitie requires warre. Great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for warre are made by the <hi>Spaniard</hi>

here neare at hand; his mind and intentions are well enough knowne. A potent Prince makes no reckoning of friends when he finds opportunity to oppreſſe them. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are now brought into that extremity by their owne foreſaid counſels, that vnleſſe they do preuent by war, they wil ſhortly be preuented. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> knows ful wel, that he may not truſt them any longer, and that it is the part of an vnwiſe man to ſtay for the firſt blow, which is commonly the <hi>Criſis</hi> of the future war, by which we may take a ſcantling of the euent of it, which is vſually ouercome by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and diuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the ſaying of that prudent King. Politicians ſay, that he which conſults of breaking and making war, hath already broken; and that he is not well adviſed or wary enough, who neglects to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent his enemy. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> who is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtruſtful, doth without queſtion conſtrue &amp; take this conſultation &amp; alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of minds in <hi>England</hi> for a breach and a war, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſhortly ſhew it, if prudence take not place: but if he ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men remiſſe, he wil ſay that they want not ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth but corage, and that it is baſe feare that keeps them back.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:162:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. The King of <hi>England</hi> in the yeare 1621. the 12 of Nouemb. ſet downe the conditions of peace, &amp; what he would haue to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept by his Son in law, and ſent them to the Emperor for his finall declaration; and did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withal proteſt of the effuſion of bloud that would follow, &amp; of the warre which he ſhould be compelled vnto if the Emperour wold not ſubſcribe vnto thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions. But the Emperour and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> haue not only deluded the conditions, but went boldly on with war againſt the innocent infants &amp; the Kings bloud. And is he not now bound in honor to recouer what he preſcribed by war which he threatned and denounced, that the conditions were not performed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Suſpenſion of arms was promiſed at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> who brought the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors lettets with him to <hi>Bruxels</hi> concerning that buſineſſe: yet by colluſion was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary giuen in charge to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and ſent thither either before or at the ſame inſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that that ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion was changed into a moſt cruell war; which was executed with the more immanity, becauſe the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> hath vndertaken the protection of the
<pb facs="tcp:162:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and was pleaſed to ſtrengthen and defend it with his own garriſons. And 1 when the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> had in the Kings name long and exceedingly ſolicited, but in vaine, the raiſing of the ſiege at <hi>Franckendale</hi>; this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was giuen him, That it was againſt the honor of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to leaue a citie which they had once beſieged without the expreſſe commandment of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> 2. In the very time of the treaty at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> was <hi>Hendel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> taken and ſpoiled. 3. If he could not then obtain by treaties and entreaties, a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and ſubiect to chance, &amp; which was not in their hands, but only in hope, wil reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of thoſe things which they are poſſeſt of, be now procured by thoſe former means? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> as they will doe nothing for loue, ſo will they alſo refuſe nothing when they are compelled by feare and force; as one of themſelues hath confeſſed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Proſcription which is the head of the euils which haue followed, by which the Kings ſon in law was declared infamous, &amp; al his grandchildren pronounced fallen from al right of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was moſt earneſtly ſolicited by the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and was conſulted of
<pb facs="tcp:162:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours houſe. And is there not then iuſt cauſe that the Father ſhould by warre vindicate the honour of his Son?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> cannot be procured by treaty: for this courſe hath bin often tried and vſed, euen by the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but euer in vain. Therefore there is now no other meane to be vſed, ſaue the way of warre.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The honour of the King and kingdom requires, that now theſe wrongs be fought to be righted by warre, the laſt arrow in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties quiuer, and the onely meane now left of preſeruing reputation. He doth but draw on new iniuries, who neglects to reuenge the old, eſpecially ſo intollerable as haue been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But if now, after they haue raiſed ſo good opinion &amp; hope of themſelues in the world, they ſhould grow faint, and fall backe into their former lethargie, they ſhould loſe all faith and reputation. I ceaſe to ſhew how magnanimious Princes are more bound in honour to recouer the eſtates of their friends which they haue taken into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, then their owne goods.</p>
