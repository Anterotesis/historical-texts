         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ed in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
to whom he surmiseth him to haue dedicated hys
Polyhistor. For it is euident that in this woorke,
<hi>Solinus</hi> maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Emperor <hi>Vespasians</hi>
dooings. Furthermore, hee speaketh of <hi>Suetonius
Paulinus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Plinie</hi> saw as he witnesseth himself.
Besides this, <hi>Solinus</hi> hath drawn almost all his mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
out of <hi>Plinies</hi> fountaines, and yet neuerthelesse
in wryting these things, hee desireth hys freende
<pb facs="tcp:18206:3"/>
in the beginning of his worke, to beare wyth hys
simplicitie. But forasmuch as he no where maketh
mention of <hi>Plinie,</hi> (by whom he was furthered) I
coniecture that <hi>Solinus</hi> wrate this work while <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
was yet aliue. And therevppon (by likelihoode)
it comes to passe, that hee made no mention of hys
author at that time liuing. By like reason it might
fall out, that <hi>Plinie</hi> no where maketh mention of
<hi>Dioscorides</hi> a famous wrighter of the same time
that he was, when notwithstanding it is apparant,
that <hi>Plinie</hi> borowed many thinges out of him into
his work. The same fault also might bee imputed
to <hi>Dioscorides</hi> (for it might bee founde in <hi>Ammon</hi>
which of them purloyned from other) if hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing

the very Diamond of the Latin tongue, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
greatly by reading <hi>Liuie,</hi> and yet he wil not in
any wise that <hi>Liuie</hi> the prince of Latin Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
should be partaker of his Nights. Yet
am I not of the opinion of some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thinke
that <hi>Solinus</hi> made no mention of <hi>Plinie,</hi> in hope
that <hi>Plinies</hi> works should vtterly haue perished, &amp;
so his collections onely haue remained, and in
processe of time no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold haue bin able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer

to haue trauelled to the like end &amp; purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would
God there were none other cause then this of the

Furius, Varrius, Actius, Neuius,</hi> and <hi>Pacuuius,</hi> all
noble Authors, (which now are perrished, to the
great hinderaunce of Students) shoulde haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
vnto this day. But howsoeuer the case sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>Solinus</hi> courteously confesseth, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he hath comprehended in hys Polyhistor, pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedeth
out of most allowable Authors, &amp; hecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
nothing for his owne, in as much as (sayth
he) the diligence of men in olde time hath beene
such, that nothing hath continued vntouched to
<pb facs="tcp:18206:4"/>
our dayes. And againe he sayth plainly, that hee
leaueth the auouchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g of the trueth of thinges, to
such Authors as hee hath followed in this worke.
Neither is it to be vpbraided to <hi>Solinus</hi> as a shame,
that hee hath euery where followed <hi>Plinie,</hi> more
then <hi>Virgill</hi> is to be found fault with for translating
into his worke the verses of the auncient Poets, &amp;
specially of <hi>Homer.</hi> For it is no small commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to counterfet singulerly a singuler Author.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Solinus</hi> was a Romaine, it is to be coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both by his phrase of wryting, and also for that
commonly when occasion serueth to speake of the
Romaines, hee is wont in most places to call them
our men, or my countrymen. Not onely the latter
wryters, (as <hi>Sipontinus, Perottus, Domitius, Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,
Angelus Politianus, Hermolaus Barbarus, Ianus
Parrhasius,</hi> and diuers others such like, whom not
without cause a man might account among the
auncient wryters.) But <hi>Seruius</hi> also in his seconde
booke vpon <hi>Virgills</hi> Husbandry, and <hi>Priscian,</hi> two
of the sixe notable Gramarians, haue cited the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of <hi>Solinus</hi> by name. Also the interpreter of
<hi>Dennis,</hi> (whither it were <hi>Priscian</hi> or <hi>Rhemninus</hi>)
hath oftentimes put whole sentences of <hi>Solinussis</hi>
in his verses. If I be not deceiued, all that which
<hi>Macrobius</hi> reciteth of the diuision of the yeere, and
of the odde dayes, are <hi>Solinussis.</hi> Moreouer, the
Doctors of the Church, <hi>Ierom, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18206:4"/>There are some that terme <hi>Solinus</hi> by the name
of <hi>Plinies</hi> Ape, in like manner as <hi>Iulius Capitolinus

that <hi>Titian</hi> was called the Ape of the Orators, and

(vnder correction bee it spoken) there may scarce

and vncertainely. The <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians</hi>

of <hi>Italy</hi> in thirtéene: and this their yéere was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be of thrée hundred threescore and fourteene
dayes. The <hi>Romaines</hi> at the firste, accounted ten mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
for a yéere, beginning at March. In so much
that in the firste day thereof, they kindled fire on the
Altars of <hi>Vesta,</hi> they shifted theyr olde Baye Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes
for <hi>Gréene,</hi> the Senate and people chose newe
Officers, the Matrons serued theyr seruaunts at the

               <hi>Saturne:</hi> the Matrons to the intent through this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
to prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more obedience, the Maisters
as it were to rewarde them in respect of theyr paynes
taken: specially seeing this moneth is the first, and
chiefe of all the rest, which may wel be prooued, in that
the fift moneth from it was called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> &amp; when
the full number was fulfilled. December did close vp
the whole circuit within the three hundred and foure
day. For at that time thys number of dayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
the yeere, so that sixe monethes were of thirty
dayes a peece, and the other foure had thirty and one
a peece. But forasmuch as that account before the
comming of <hi>Numa</hi> differed from the course of the
Moone, they supplyed the yeere to the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Moone, by putting thereto one and fiftye
dayes. To the intent therfore to make vp full twelue
monethes, they tooke from eche of the sayd sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
one day, and put them to these one and fiftye,
and so made iust fifty and seauen, the which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into two monethes, whereof the one contained
twentie and nine dayes, the other twenty and eyght.
So the yeere began to haue three hundred fiftye &amp; fiue
dayes. Afterward, when they perceiued the yéere to
be vnaduisedly determined within the foresayd daies,
forasmuch as it appeared that the Sunne finished not
hys ful course in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three hundreth
threescore and fift day, wyth the ouerplus welneere of
a quarter of a day: they added that quarter and tenne
dayes, to the intent the yéere should consist of ful thrée
hundred threescore and fiue dayes, and the fourth part
of a day. Whereunto they were the rather induced
for obseruing the odde number, which (according to
the doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) ought to be preferred in all
thinges.</p>
            <p>And heerevpon it commeth to passe, that Ianuary
<pb facs="tcp:18206:11"/>
for hys odde dayes is dedicated to the Gods supernal,
and February for hys euen dayes as vnlucky is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Gods infernall. Therefore when as thys
order of account séemed alowable to the whole world,
for the exacter keeping of the sayd quarter, it was of
diuers Nations diuersly added, and yet it could neuer
be brought to passe, to sal out euen with ths time. The
<hi>Greekes</hi> abated out of euery yeere eleuen dayes, and
the fourth part of a day: which beeing eyght tymes
multiplyed, they reserued to the ninth yeere, to the
intent that the number of nine béeing gathered into
one grosse summe, might be deuided into 3. monethes
of thirty dayes a péece. The which being restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the ninth yeere, made foure hundred forty and
foure dayes, which they called odde or superfluous
dayes. The <hi>Romaines</hi> liked well of this reckoning at
the first. But afterward mislyking it in respect of the
euen number; they neglected it, and within short space
forgot it, committing the order of the addition to the
Priestes: who to pleasure the tolegatherers in theyr
accounts, did after theyr owne fancy shorten or leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the yeere as they lysted.</p>
            <p>Whyle thinges stoode in this case, and that the
manner of adding was sometime too short, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
too long, or els dissembled and let slip altogether:
it happened oftentimes that the monethes which had
beene woont to passe in Winter, fell one whyle in
Sommertime, and another while in the fal of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> leafe.
<hi>Caius Caesar</hi> therefore to the intent to set a stay in this
variablenesse, did cutte of all this turmoyling of the
tymes. And that the error foreslypped myght be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to some certaine staiednesse: he added twenty and
one dayes and sixe houres at a time, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the monethes being drawn backe to theyr accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:18206:12"/>
places, might from thenceforth kéepe theyr Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
and appointed seasons. That onely yéere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had thrée hundred and foure and forty daies, and
all the rest afterward had thrée hundred thréescore and
fiue daies, and sixe howres. This notwithstanding,
then also was a default committed by Priestes. For
whereas order was taken that they shoulde euerye
foure yeere adde one daie, which ought to haue beene
doone at the ende of the fourth yéere, before the fifte
yéere began, they reckoned it in the beginning of the
fourth yéere, and not in the ende. By meanes wherof,
in thirtie and sixe yéeres, whereas nine daies had béen
sufficient, twelue daies were reckoned. The which
béeing espied, <hi>Augustus</hi> reformed in this wise. Hee
commaunded that twelue yéeres should passe without
leape, to the intent y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> those thrée daies aboue the nine,
which were superfluously added, might by this means
be recompensed. Uppon which discipline was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grounded the order of all times. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

Onely in one Man, namely <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> it

sée the vndiscernable likenesse of countenaunces, not
onely in straungers, but also euen in such as haue
béene brought together from the furthest partes of the

for thréehundred Sesterties, two Boyes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

<pb facs="tcp:18206:16"/>
thinking hymselfe to haue béene deluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were not Twynnes indéed. <hi>Thoranius</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>santlie
auouched, that that thing was chiefely to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéemed,
which the Chapman founde fault wyth. For
it had béene no wonder to haue had two Twyns like:
But this was it which could by no meanes be prysed
according to the value, that béeing of two diuers Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
so farre distaunt, they were borne more like one

<hi>Antonie</hi> was so appeased, that euer after hee woulde

that he did sette more store by.</p>
            <p>Nowe if wee shall mooue question concerning the

that the ofspring of our time béeing corrupted by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
growing out of kinde, hath through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decrease
of them that are nowe borne, lost the comlinesse of the

that no man can excéede the stature of seauen

notwithstanding, it was founde in the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

that the soules of them that decease returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and othersome thinking that they die not, but
are in a more happie and blisful state. Among most of
them, the birth daies are sorrowfull, and contrariwise
the burialls are ioyfull. In somuch that the Fathers
and Mothers fall a wéeping when they Children are
newe borne, and reioyce when theyr are deade. The
Menne doo glorie in the number of theyr Wiues, and
count it an honour to haue manie bedfellowes. Such
Women as are chare of their chastitie, doo leape into
the fires where their dead Husbandes are burned, and
(which they thinke to be the greatest token of chastity
that may bee) runne headlong into the flame. When
Women come to the time of marriage, they take not

Husbands at the appointment of their Parents: but
such of them as excel others in beautie, set themselues
foorth to sale, and making Proclamation who wyll

are foule or deformed, bring dowries with them to bie

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18206:66"/>By the whytenesse of their téeth it is known that

They goe together in heards. The eldest of them
leadeth the bande, and the eldest next him followeth
the trayne. When they passe a Ryuer, they sende the
smallest before, least the treading of the greater sorte
should weare the channell, and make déepe gutts in

            <p>The Females goe not to make before they bee ten

they neuer ingender but one time, nor bring forth mo

but in anie wyse they can not awaie with cold. They
eate the bodies of Trees, swallowe stones, and loue

they shunne the sauour of a Mouse: and they wyl not

wrythe their tailes in knottes about theyr féete, that

chiefe cause of their fighting is (as men saie) for that
Olyphants haue great store of blood, which is colder
then the blood of other beastes, and therefore the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
doo vnsatiatiably desire it in the excesse of heate.
Finallie, they neuer sette vpon them, but when they

and déepe hayre,<note place="margin">Of the nature and property of Beares.</note> for the littering of them is like in all
places, wheresoeuer they be bred. I will speake therof
by and by. They couple not in like sort as other foure
footed beastes doo: but inasmuch as they are formed
apt to embracinges, they couple together as man and
woman do. Winter stirreth vp their desire of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Males seuering themselues for the tyme,
doo reuerence the Females when they are bagged, and
although they lie all in one den, yet they lie seuerallye
by themselues in couches deuided one from an other
with diches. The time of their whelping is very swift
for they goe not past thirtie daies, whereby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
to passe, that their ouerhastie littering maketh them
bring forth deformed whelps.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18206:68"/>The things that they bring forth are little lumps
of flesh, of colour white, without eyes. And (by reason
of the hastie comming foorth before it be ripe) it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a shapelesse matter, sauing that it hath the
proportion of nayles. These they fashion by little and
little with licking, and sometimes they cherrish them
by laying their warme breastes to them, to the intent
that through the heate of their continuall rucking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them, they may gather the breath of lyfe. All that
while they fast. Surelie for the first fouretéene daies,
the dammes fall into so heauie a sléepe, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be waked with woundes. After they haue whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
they kéepe home by the space of foure months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Afterward when they goe abroade into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
daie, they can so ill awaie with the vnaccustomed
light, that a man would think they were blinded.</p>
            <p>Beares haue weake heades, and their greatest
strength is in their fore pawes, and in their loynes,
wherby it commeth to passe, that sometimes they will
stande vpright vppon their hinder féete. They lye in
waite for Béehiues, lusting greatlie for the Combes,
and they snatch at nothing more gréedilie then at hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
If they taste of the Apples of Mandrake they die.
Neuerthelesse, they preuent the mischiefe before it
growe too strong, and deuoure Ants to recouer theyr
health. If at anie time they sette vppon Bulles, they
knowe vppon what parts it is best for them to catche
holde: and therefore they catch at no parte, but their
hornes and theyr nostrils: their hornes to the intent
to weigh them downe, theyr nostrilles to the intent

of them alike forbeare gorging of themselues: firste

lytter bring forth fiue Whelps, and euery yéere after
they diminish their number by one, and at the length
when the dammes come to bringing forth but one at

hath gyuen these two markes to euerie notable beaste
to be knowne by. Their chiefest force is in their brest,
and their chiefest stedinesse is in their heades. When
they be chaced with dogs, they goe away disdainfully,
and now and then staying, dissemble theyr force wyth
pretence as though they cared not whither they went
away or no: and this they doo when they be followed
in open and champion fields. But in woody places (as
though they thought no body were able to beare wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

When they goe at leysure, they hyde the hookes
of their talants betwéene the fleshe of their toes, as it

that they runne not but wyth their talants turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
When they are enuironed and beset with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:18206:70"/>
they looke stedfastlie vpon the ground, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
they will not be made afraid with the sight of the
hunting staues. They neuer looke a squint, neyther
can they abide that one shoulde looke a squint vppon

the greatest sort. They be shelfishes in whome thys
kinde of stones is sought, which at a certaine time of
the yéere when desire of conception pricketh them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
doo thirst after the deawe as after their milter:
for desire whereof they gape, and when the Moone
sheadeth most aboundance of moisture, they draw the
desired humour by a certaine sucking, whereby they
conceiue and are great with youg, and according to
the qualitie of the thing they haue glutted in, such is
the disposition of the perles that they bréede. For if it
bee pure that they haue taken in, their little rounde
stones are white: if it were troubled, either they haue
a faint pale colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or els are stained with a red. Thus
haue they their séede rather of the ayre then of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sea.
Finally, as often as they receiue in the morning dew
the pearle becommeth cléerer: and when they suck in
the euening dewe, they become dimmer, and the more
they haue haled in, so much the stone groweth greater
If it chaunce to lighten vpon the suddaine, they shutte
for feare, and closing fast for suddaine fearefulnes, they
take in that which they loose againe ere it be ripe: for
then they haue very small stones, or els none at all.

insomuch as when the day is at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hotest, because
their stones shoulde not bee dimmed with the heate,
<pb facs="tcp:18206:110"/>
they ducke vnder the water, and diue into the déepes
to saue them from the heate. Neuerthelesse, age fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
this foresight of theirs. For the whitnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth
