            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of Sir <hi>William Glynne</hi> Baronet, in Oppoſition to a Bill intended for an Act of Parliament to Restore the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> to the Manner of <hi>Hawarden.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HICH BILL turns a Purchaſe made 32 Years ſince into a Mortgage, and Veſts the Eſtate presently in ſuch Perſons as the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> ſhall Nominate; and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the <hi>Chancery</hi> to direct an Accompt of the Profits for 32 Years to diſcharge the Purchaſe Money, and what ſhall then remain due to be paid out of the Rents, or by Sale of Eſtate.</p>
            <p>That <hi>James</hi> late Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> being by the Iniquity of the late Rebellious Times put to Death for adhering to King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, his Eſtate was expoſed to Sale as forfeited. Sir <hi>John Trevor, George Twiſleton,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Ellis,</hi> by Agreement between them and <hi>Charles</hi> then Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Son and Heir of Earl <hi>James,</hi> undertake to purchaſe the Manners of <hi>Hawarden, Mould</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> part of the late Earls Eſtate, of the then Truſtees for Sale of Delinquents Lands in Truſt for the then Earl according to Articles betwixt them, which were to be performed within a year.</p>
            <p>The Earl not performing thoſe Articles, his Mother, the Counteſs Dowager, himſelf and Counteſs, as well by themſelves as by the earneſt Sollicitation of Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> late Lord Keeper, did deſire Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> deceaſed to buy thoſe three Manners, whereby ſome Advantage might come to the Earl.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Novem.</hi> 7. 1653.</note> Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> agrees with the Earl for his Intereſt in thoſe Manners,  and was to pay 1700 <hi>l.</hi> to the Earl and his Lady, and ſuch Sums of Money as Sir <hi>John Trevor, Twiſleton</hi> and <hi>Ellis</hi> had or were to pay for the Purchaſe thereof to the Truſtees, according to the former Articles between the Earl and them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Febr.</hi> 15. 1653.</note> Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> in purſuance of thoſe Articles paid to the late Earl 1700 <hi>l.</hi>  and 9000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Trevor, Twiſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Ellis</hi> by the Earls particular direction, as appears by a Receipt under his Hand and Seal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the late Earl and his Lady did by Feoffment, Deed Inrolled, Fine and Recovery convey <hi>Hawarden</hi> to Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> for 10700 <hi>l.</hi> being as much as <hi>Hawarden.</hi> was then reputed to be really worth; and 'tis believed that Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> might then have bought as good an; Eſtate elſewhere for the ſame Money, free from all manner of Incumbrances and Forfeitures.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>John Glynne's</hi> Contract was with the Earl, and not with the Perſons that Purchaſed from the Truſtees, and paid his Purchaſe-Money to the Earl, and according to his Directions, and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Purchaſe from the Truſtees of <hi>Drury-Houſe,</hi> nor paid them any Money.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1662</note> The late Earl thinking himſelf aggrieved with the Dealings of Sir <hi>John Trevor, Twiſleton</hi> and <hi>Ellis,</hi> brought his Bill in Parliament to be reſtored to <hi>Mould</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> reſting ſatisfied with the juſtneſs of the Purchaſe of <hi>Hawarden</hi> by Sir <hi>John Glynne,</hi> which Bill paſſed both Houſes in favour of the Earl, wherein Sir <hi>John Glynne</hi> was not concerned.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Earl never attempted or pretended to be relieved by that or any other Bill or otherways howſoever as to the Manner of <hi>Hawarden;</hi> And therefore Sir <hi>William Glynne</hi> humbly Objects againſt the ſaid Bill:</p>
            <p>That his Father was a real and abſolute Purchaſor of the ſaid Manner, and therefore kept not any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as Mortgagees do.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>William Glynne</hi> is a Purchaſor by Settlement upon Marriage, and being an utter Stranger to all theſe Proceedings acted 32 years ſince, it is impoſſible for him to Accompt.</p>
            <p>That 'twere better for him to part with his Eſtate for nothing than to be involved in a Suit, and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which is impoſſible for him to make.</p>
            <p>It is humbly ſubmitted that by a future Law, eſpecially after ſo many years, and after ſo many Seſſions of ſeveral long continued Parliaments to deſtroy Aſſurances that are good both by Law and Equity, is not conſiſtent with Juſtice, eſpecially when ſuch Contracts and Aſſurances were deſired on the late Earls part, and in whom there was no diſability to grant, and the Purchaſe ſo fairly tranſacted, that it is without either Errour or Crime.</p>
            <p>This Bill is conceived not only to weaken the Act for Confirmation of Judicial Proceedings by a new Law to take away the force of thoſe Fines and Recoveries which that Act made good, but alſo all other Common Aſſurances of the Kingdom: And if this ſhould paſſs into a Law, it would be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as is humbly conceived. Whereas the intended Act mentions a Recovery obtained at Law for the Manner of <hi>Hope,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Objection</note> by reaſon the Reverſion thereof was in the Crown, the now Earl pretended the like to <hi>Hawarden,</hi> and brought Ejectments wherein he was Non-ſuited; and upon a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> brought by Sir <hi>Will Glynne</hi> againſt the ſaid Earl for the Preſentation of <hi>Hawarden,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to</note> Sir <hi>Will. Glynne</hi> obtained Judgment, and his Clerk was Inſtituted and Inducted to that Living, and is now in Poſſeſſion of the ſame.</p>
