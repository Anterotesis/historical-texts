         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas We the Lord Deputy and Council, in order to ſuppreſs theſe unlawful and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices, have by a late Proclamation forewarned, and ſtrictly Commanded all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects, that they ſhould not preſume by writing or ſpeaking, to utter or publiſh any ſuch falſe News or Reports, thereby declaring that ſuch as ſhould offend therein, ſhould be Proſecuted according to the utmoſt Rigor of the Law. And though We have cauſed the ſaid Proclamation to be publiſhed in all the parts of this Kingdom, and ſo might have juſtly Expected a full Compliance thereunto from all His Majeſties Subjects, yet ſuch is the perverſe humour and continuing malice of ſome reſtleſs ſpirits, that in contempt of Our ſaid Proclamation, and of the known Laws of this Realm, they make it their conſtant practice by Writing &amp; Speaking, to Publiſh and ſpread Falſe News and Reports, and their Iniquity have ſo far prevailed upon them, that they have raiſed a moſt ſcandalous, impious, and falſe Calumny and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as if His Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects here were to be Maſſacred by His Majeſties Roman Catholick Subjects of this Kingdom; Which Report was ſo Induſtriouſly improved, as that not only an Account thereof was ſent into <hi>England</hi> and ſeveral there perſwaded that a Maſſacre was actually <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">

All which Contrivances are ſet on foot in this time of Invaſion by Factious and Rebellious Spirits, with an intention to prejudice His Majeſties Affairs by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and fomenting Animoſities between His Majeſties People.</p>
            <p>We the Lord Deputy and Council in order to obviate the intended Deſigns of ſuch malitious Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and unjuſt practices do hereby Recommend Earneſtly to all His Majeſties Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of what perſwasion ſoever they be in point of Religion, to reſt aſſured of his Majeſties Protection without the leaſt apprehenſion: And that as the Government for the time paſt hath taken effectual care for preſerving his Majeſties Peace within his Realm in ſo for the time to come will take the like care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and Proteſt all His Majeſties Subjects within this Kingdom without any diſtinction, in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Liberty and Properties while they continue ſteddy and firm in their Duty and Allegiance to His Majeſty, And do further in His Majeſties behalf conjure all His Majeſties Subjects of this Kingdom, to lay aſide all manner of Animoſities and Jelouſies and Cheerfully to Unite together in the defence of His Majeſty and their Country againſt all Forreign Invaſion, and to look upon the ſpreaders of thoſe malitious reports to be Enemies to their King and Country, And we do further ſtrictly Charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all His Majeſties Subjects of this Realm, that they preſume not henceforth to meet at unſeaſonable times with fire Arms in great numbers, or in a tumultuous manner to the Terror of His Majeſties People, as they ſhall anſwer the ſame at their peril, We being reſolved to take ſuch meaſurs for the preſervation of the Peace of this Kingdom as ſhall be thought needful upon ſuch occaſion: And we do alſo ſtrictly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that the ſaid former Proclamation againſt the ſpreaders of falſe News and Reports be put in due Execution againſt all Offenders in that Kind according to the utmost Rigor of the Law, And we do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will and require all and every his Majeſties Judges and Juſtices of the Peace, and all other his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Magiſtrats and Miniſters in their ſeveral Stations, that they take ſpecial care to have the Laws put in due Execution againſt all ſuch as have Offended or ſhall hereafter Offend in the matters aforeſaid.</p>
