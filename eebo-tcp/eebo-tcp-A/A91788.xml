         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> THis government in the hand of one ſingle perſon,
is in effect a kingly government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo: that will not prove it unlawfull,
alſo when the power is in one or a few, ſooner and

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo: that were in effect to fight againſt Chriſt, for his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is kingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We did not fight againſt kingly government, but againſt Tyranny
and oppreſſion, but we moſt eſpecially for freedom in matter of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> We are to have no King but Jeſus Chriſt, hee is to bee our onely
lawgiver. Jam, 4. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant it, in matters of Religion his kingdome is ſpirituall and
not of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> This kingly government hinders Chriſt from reigning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a great miſtake, the government of the world, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the bodies and eſtates of men, is another government, and requires
another King, and this hindreth not the government of Chriſt, but may
both in their place well agree together.</p>
            <p>I grant the Kings of the earth have oppoſed Jeſus Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and perſecuted his people, but that was not from their government
as kingly, but by mixing with their civill government matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and made lawes in matters meerly Religious; and ſo perſecuted Chriſt
and his people: which was from their ignorance and wickedneſſe of them
who were Kings. Pſal, 2. 2 Yet are they not forbid to bee Kings, but bid
to be wiſe, <hi>Be wiſe therefore O Kings, be inſtructed.</hi> verſ. 10. (that is) let
Chriſt and his lawes, and his people alone meddle not with them inflict
no corporall puniſhment upon them, nor meddle not with their perſons
and eſtates for things meerely Religious for that belongeth not to you. In
matters Religious no man may make a law, the opinions that the magiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hath a power from God to puniſh Hereticks with corporall punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hath coſt the blood and lives of many thouſands of the precious
Saints and People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167940:3"/>
There muſt of neceſſity be a government and a law in things civill, elſe
there will be great confuſion.</p>
            <p>Men ſay they know not what, when they ſay this government hinders
Chriſt from raigning; for if wee ſpeake of Chriſt raigning in his people
by his Spirit, can that bee hindered by Souldiers, or Kings, no, none can
hinder or ſuppreſſe that.</p>
            <p>If they meane Chriſts perſonall raigne, neither can all the power of this
world hinder that, ſeeing he is God, he can with eaſe breake in peeces all
that oppoſe him, like a potters veſſel, as Pſal. 2. 9. We deſire Chriſt may
come, we truſt we ſhall lovingly embrace him when he comes, wee deſire
you to agree with us and to this government but till he come. It is no
treaſon againſt Chriſt to adhear to this government in things civill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God hath in no place in his word condemned the ſame, if hee hath I
pray you ſhew us where?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If this government bee continued, to what purpoſe hath ſo much
blood been ſpent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is to very great purpoſe, for now wee enjoy freedome from
perſecution in matters of Religion, which is the greateſt outward bleſſing
wee can enjoy; this alone is worth all the blood and treaſure that hath
been ſpent. And what good would all outward things in this world doe
us without this, the Lord make us more ſenſible and thankfull for this
mercy. I am perſwaded that ſince this Nation hath beene a Nation, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did injoy ſo much freedome in this kind as now it doth. If you could
repeat 1000 things one after another that we want, to every one we would
cry, but we have liberty in matters of Religion; &amp; give me leave to ſay the
want of this hath forced me to leave father &amp; mother, wife &amp; friends, and
native Country, and to wander deſolately alone, as forſaken, and almoſt
ſtript of all outward comforts, and in a ſtrange land, and not knowing
how to live, and not willing to beg, nor to endure the want I have beene
in, have ſate down alone and wept bitterly, and not able to ſpeak, becauſe
my griefe was ſo great; I have wandred and hidde my ſelfe in holes and
caves of the earth, and knew not where to beſtow my ſelfe; and thoſe
who are not ſatisfied with the liberty we now enjoy, (excepting only the
buſines of Tithes) never knew what it was to be perſecuted, undone,
or baniſhed, or to leave their native Country to wander a far off in
deſolate wilderneſſes, or have forgot, I am perſwaded, the Martyrs in Q.
<hi>Maries</hi> dayes; if they could have enjoyed the liberty wee doe, though
they ſhould have had only bread and water, would have been content, and

how is it that there is no more in priſon? is there but one or two in

that all thoſe called the ſeperation B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

are out of Priſon? and which is more meet, freely and openly, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Surely ſomething is the matter, that Mr. FEAK and Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ROGERS
are in Priſon, have they not inſtead of preaching Chriſt and the Goſpel, in
the Pulpit medled with wordly matters, and things not fit for that place?
which did (or might at leaſt) tend to a breach of peace, if it did in the leaſt
degree tend to ſtir up ſedition, it was wel don to impriſon them, to prevent
further danger: and if they will not be peaceable, and preach Chriſt and
him crucified, and not meddle with other matters, let them lie there
till they will be quiet: and if this be perſecution, then let all that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
triumph, and ſay, they ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But what if it wil appear, that Mr. FEAK hath perſecuted him, &amp; the way
God &amp; Chriſt? for while his Highneſs was in the diſcharge of his duty, in

<hi>Why perſecute you me? Job 19. 19. 21 22.</hi> hath not Mr. FEAK ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and written more bitter things againſt him, as being a Perſecutor of
Chriſt and of his Goſpel, and of his people? what could bee ſaid worſe,
and more grievous and diſhonourable? alſo hee hath perſecuted the way
God hath taken to carry on his work in theſe dayes, in ſpeaking againſt it,
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I perſecuted that way, Acts 22. 14.</hi> in oppoſing it; and
Chriſt ſaith he was perſecuted in it, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou
me? Acts 9. 4.</hi> and 5. 1. So that it appeares, that Mr. FEAK is the
perſecuter.</p>

our Perſons and Eſtates at their pleaſure? and have levied what money
they pleaſe, which they call the prerogative power, or priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</p>
            <p>If he hath a greater power to hurt that doth not hurt, unleſs he hath a
will to hurt the happineſs of a People, lieth not in the having this or that

2. If in ſome thing they did declare, they think not fit to keep being

            <p n="5">5. Man is changeable, and when mens conditions change, commonly
their mindes change, there is no better to bee expected from man; the
more wee conſider our ſelves, the more we ſee the truth of this; at one

we may well ſay, O Lord, what is Man? a very vanity.</p>

And Chriſt being offered, all the Leviticall offerings which were types and
ſhadowes of him are to ceaſe: upon this ground a Martyr ſayd, hee that
payd Tithe, did deny Chriſt to bee come in the fleſh, becauſe Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the fleſh, was to put an end to Tithes. I heard a good man ſay, he
deſired to ſtarve, rather then to take for preaching one halfe penny of
Tithes. I have lately heard that his Highneſs did promiſe to remove them.
I hope ere long ſomething will be done therein, to eaſe the conſciences of

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167940:5"/>
many. I long to ſee it, and that they doe as 1. Cor. 10. 24. and that the

and that Iuſtice may bee more eaſily had, as it will, when it runs
downe like a mighty ſtreame. And although it doth not appeare in Chriſts
Teſtament that the maintenance of Chriſts Miniſters is to bee by Tithes,
nor by any other forced maintenance, yet this hinders not but the States
Miniſters may have a forced maintenance: for though thoſe that God cals
and ſends will truſt God and preach, without hier, yet thoſe men ſent have
no reaſon to doe ſo, becauſe they are not willing to doe ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And thoſe who have freely received, are freely to give, Mat. 10. 8.

            <p n="3">3. It cannot be denied but the Magiſtrate is to take care of that which

but that it tends to the peace and well-being of the nation as civill, that
there be a Miniſtry of it, if onely as morrall men, to teach men to agree, to
doe juſtly and live peacibly, and be ſubject to authority: if there were no
Miniſters, the people in many places would grow more heatheniſh and
unfit to bee governed: beſides the State hath ſomthing for them to doe:
upon which account it appeares there is need of them; and if ſo, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

ſo great that it were a benefit for him to be without it, and there is reaſon
to conceive he would gladly lay it downe, if it were for the welfare of the
people of God and the peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Seing he hath often deprived himſelfe of ſome of the ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this life, and often adventured his life for the cauſe and intereſt
of the people of God, is a ſufficient ground for us to believe that hee doth
prefer the welfare of Gods people, and of this Nation, above his owne
life or family. Neither doe I know of any of theſe actions hee hath done
but it tends to our welfare (except the ordinance for Tiths) which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
will not continue long.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His preteſtations before God and man, that what he did was for the
welfare of others which cauſed him to do that he hath done, is of waight
to cauſe beliefe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As the intereſt and welfare of the People of God, and the good of
this Nation is to be preferred before a perſonall intereſt, and is ſo preferred
by every good man; Therefore wee ought to believe hee did prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his owne, wee are bound by the law of love to judge the beſt; love

            <p n="5">5. The form of the government being framed for the welfare of
