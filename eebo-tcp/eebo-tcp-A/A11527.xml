            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For in the midſt of the field where the battell had beene found, they ſaw a building erected of a ſtrange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique. The forme thereof was round, divided by ſixty five towers of chriſtall, which altogether did make a Hall of a portentuous greatneſſe. Into it there was a paſſage by one onely gate, before the which ſtood two great Lyons of braſſe, who ſeemed as if they had beene there placed to teare in pieces ſuch as ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to come neere it. Two columnes were fixed about ten paces from them, on either ſide one, whereof each had a Table hanging on it, in which theſe words were written.</p>

                     <p>This Letter held the Prince a while in ſuſpence, for the name being unknown to them, they were not ſure that this advice was without ſome practiſe. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (ſaid <hi>Dorigell)</hi> have invented this tricke to retard our revenge, and having no more ſtrength to reſiſt us, they flye to their tricks; let us follow our fortune. She proſpers ſuch as lay hold of occaſions, &amp; they that make themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her favours, never encounter them according to their deſires. Speaking thus, he had almoſt perſwaded all thoſe Lords to neglect the counſell that was given them, and to purſue the fortune of their victory: but <hi>Floriſell,</hi> who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with no leſſe prudence than valour, fairely demonſtrating that with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation they might too much indanger themſelves, and that matters were to be weighed with more deliberation, ſtaid the fury of theſe Princes. It is true (ſaid he) that we may with reaſon ſuſpect this counſell, ſince we know not him that gives it. But when I conſider this tombe wherein all our anceſtors doe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with ſo much glory, I cannot thinke there is any deceit intended againſt us. Where are the bodies of ſo many Pagan Kings, and what honour is done them in their obſequies? I ſee nothing that can be to their advantage, and all theſe wonders ſerve but to increaſe our greatneſſe. The advice that is given us, is very good: let us I beſeech you follow it. And not buſying our thoughts with the conqueſt of Pagan Empires, let us wiſely preſerve thoſe eſtates which heaven hath beſtowed upon us. For mine owne part I am reſolved to take into my care the governement of Greece, my ſiſter <hi>Alaſtaxeree</hi> ſhall command in Trebiſond, till the deſtinies doe reſtore us the Emperour my Lord and Father: my ſonne ſhall be reſident in Perſia, and <hi>Spheramond</hi> ſhall maintaine the authority that he hath among the Parthians; the reſt of you (my Lords) ſhall every one retire into the Province, which either his birth or valour hath acquired him.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17218:4"/>
ſo perfect an Artiſt, as he ſurpaſſed all thoſe that had travelled in thoſe ſtudies before him, aſwell as thoſe that came after him: yet was it not his purpoſe to make uſe thereof, as many doe, to the hurt or ruine of any, but for the glory of Chriſtendome, which he ſo tooke to heart, that all his actions had no other ayme, but the preſervation of thoſe, whoſe worth was able to mayntayne it at the due heigth, as you may well judge by the ſequele of this Hiſtory. Seeing then that <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> a Prince as vertuous and valiant as could be named, was ſomewhat enfeebled by the battell that he had fought before Conſtantinople, with <hi>Perineo,</hi> Soldan of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the moſt valiant of all the Pagans that then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Empreſſe of Almayne, <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> who might alſo bee termed the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Armes, and <hi>Ariobarcan</hi> Emperour of <hi>Tartary,</hi> he wrought ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the mindes of that brave Pagan, and of that valorous Lady, as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vertue of ſo gallant a man, they determined to turne Chriſtians, and become his friends, upon condition, that the Perſian ſhould marry the Infanta of Greece, named <hi>Sirenna:</hi> which was accompliſhed preſently after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. In which holy Sacrament he was accompanied with <hi>Salinterne,</hi> without <hi>Farre,</hi> his ſonne, and the baſtard of <hi>Don Belianis, Poliſtor</hi> of <hi>Nubia,</hi> and <hi>Poliſtea de la Selva,</hi> whom he had by the Queene of the <hi>Garamantes,</hi> and had followed the Pagan colours before they knew <hi>Don Belianis</hi> for their Father. This peace and this marriage cheered all Greece, and particularly our <hi>Alcander,</hi> who then thought it well and ſufficiently ſupported. But being continually carefull for the quiet of theſe Princes, he had one day a curious deſire to underſtand what good fortune was to attend their deſignes and life; withdrawing therefore himſelfe from all reſort of company, hee began to make his ordinary invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and found onely by the motion and aſpect of the ſtarres, that the houſe of Greece was to ſuffer a totall ruine; and that theſe Princes were threatned with an eminent death. The knowledge heereof did mightily afflict him; but carrying a greater minde then to yeeld to this calamity, hee made new conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: the ſpirits were invoked, and all the powers of Hell were ſummoned to appeare: nevertheleſſe he ſaw nothing but ſignes of death, and preſages of misfortune. Let the ſtarres, ſayd hee, bee froward, let all the Divels in Hell conſpire together, to ſubvert the Empire of the Chriſtians, yet will I change their influences, and overturne their deſignes. For having ſometimes reſtored life to thoſe which breathed no more, I may be permitted to preſerve ſuch as are yet in the world. Thus ſpeaking, hee enfolded himſelfe in a cloud, and tranſported himſelfe into the dangerous forreſts of the great kingdom of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> neere to the Empire of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where long before he had built a Caſtle of wondrous workmanſhip. But doubting that the charms which he had ſet upon it, were not powerfull enough for the great purpoſe he had in hand, hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied all his skill, which ſurpaſſed that of all other men, layd ſuch ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments upon three diviſions of lodgings, that hee had built in a triangular forme, as thoſe which ſhould be incloſed therein, ſhould not grow old, or bee impayred in any ſort whatſoever; yet not deſiring that this his worke ſhould laſt till the end of the world; for hee well foreſaw that the neceſſity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, would one day oblige him to ſuffer it to be diſſolved, ordayned that the enchantment ſhould be defeated by the valour of ſixe the braveſt Knights, accompanied with as many the fayreſt Ladyes of the world. Thinking then that he had done enough, hee preſently tranſported himſelfe to Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and having talked a while in private with <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> hee deſired him to goe into his Chariot, and with him his Sonne <hi>Belforan, Fortiman</hi> of Greece,

This done, having touched the Griffons with a rod that he had in his hand, they cut the ayre, with incredible ſwiftneſſe, and carried him to the houſe, which hee would have called by the name of the Caſtle of Treaſure. Where with ſome teares, hee encloſed theſe Princes in one quarter of the Lodgings, aſſuring them that they ſhould bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged after certayne ages, and at ſuch time as Chriſtendome ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame need of their aſſiſtance. Theſe things being done, his minde might wel have beene contented, but the exceeding care that he had to effect his deſignes, not ſuffering him to be quiet, hee againe turned over his bookes: And finding, that before the time theſe Princes ſhould be diſinchanted, certayne moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Knights ſhould be borne, which yet ſhould not arrive to the perfection neceſſary for the putting an end to his enchantments, hee reſolved alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in the ſame Caſtle with the Emperour <hi>Don Belianis.</hi> For which cauſe therefore, as ſoone as the incomparable warriour, the Knight of the Sun was borne, he was infinitely carefull of his ſafety, aſſiſted him with his Arte without his privity, and knowing that after certayne yeeres, hee was threatned with a diſaſtrous end, by the practiſe of ſome traytors, who ſhould murther him one night in his bed, he carried him alſo away, as he had done <hi>Don Belia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and with him all the principall Knights of his Court, who were to run no leſſe hazard; and placing them in the ſecond diviſion of the lodgings, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them for that furious encounter, wherein the glory of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or the ruine of the Pagans was to be diſputed.

For as often as hee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Chriſtendome ſhould one day triumph over her enemies, by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, he eſteemed himſelfe bleſſed, to be ſo favoured by heaven, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining not to neglect ſuch grace hee perſevered in his good deſire, whence it came that after certayne ages were paſt, being in the caſtle of Treaſure, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the lamentable loſſe, which the Chriſtians were to ſuſtayne, and the death of thoſe great Monarchs, <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule and of Greece, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their blood. Which, for the reaſons before alledged, being deſirous to remedy, hee tranſported himſelfe, the ſame night as that great battell was fought in the fields of the Soldan of Aleppo, to the place where ſo many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies lay extended; gave an honourable ſepulture to thoſe Chriſtian Princes which were dead, as you have heard in the firſt Chapter; and carryed away thoſe, in whom he found any hope of life, to that wonderfull Caſtle, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them the third diviſion of lodgings; the names of whom were; The great King <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, enchanted as you have heard, <hi>Don Silves de la Selva, Ageſilan, Amadis d' Aſtre, Aſtropolo, Fortiman, Anaxartes, Pentheſilea, Argantes, Florartan, Lucentio, Falanges d' Aſtre, Arlantes,</hi> his ſonne <hi>Arlanges</hi> of Spayne, <hi>Lucidamor</hi> of Boetia, <hi>Floreni</hi> Emperour of Rome, <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of Monteſpin, <hi>Zayr, Flores</hi> of Greece, ſecond ſonne to <hi>Eſplandian, Filon</hi> King of Sibila, <hi>Artaur</hi> his Brother, King of Mount Libanus, and <hi>Lindamart</hi>

And then deſiring, they ſhould not be leſſe happy then the reſt, preſented them a little while after, with ſome of the Princeſſes they loved, whom he had brought from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the extreame diſcontent of thoſe that remayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde. There was the Queene <hi>Oriana,</hi> the Empreſſe <hi>Niquea,</hi> delivered not long before of a ſonne, whoſe birth was celebrated by an infinity of fires appearing in the ayre; and whom at his Baptiſme ſhee named <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Trebiſond, Diana, Axiana,</hi> the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> wife of <hi>Anaxartes, Cleoſila, Sestiliana, Radiana, Oriſtila, Anaxarea, Theodorina, Beliſaura, Claire eſtoille, Sclarimena,</hi> and <hi>Timbria.</hi> Having then prepared ſoveraigne baths for them, made with a million of rare ſimples, gathered at ſuch time as they were in moſt vertue, he bathed them eight dayes together; at the end whereof King <hi>Amadis</hi> and his wife ſeemed to bee but forty yeeres old; and every man as freſh and lovely, as they were at that age; the Emperour <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, and the Princeſſe <hi>Niquea,</hi> but thirty five: <hi>Don Silves Ageſilan,</hi> and the reſt, not above thirty.</p>
                     <p>This done, he carried them all into a fayre chamber, and thus ſpake unto them: Mighty Princes, you perceive by the helpe that you have already received at my hands, the deſire I have to doe you ſervice: I will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excuſe my ſelfe unto you, for holding you reſtrayned in this maner, ſince I have no other end for it, but the augmentation of your glory: All things muſt have their courſe, and the malignant influences of the ſtarres, muſt have time to paſſe over. The day will come, when you will ſee your off-ſpring with more contentment then ever; expect it with ſo much the more patience. In the meane time I will go from hence to take care for the affayres of thoſe which concerne you neerely. Saying thus, hee went out of the doore, which ſhut of it ſelfe with a ſtrange violence, leaving thoſe Princes and Princeſſes ſo inchanted, as they did not remember any thing without that place whatſoever.</p>

So that diſpoſing themſelves to ſeeke the mercy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which never refuſeth grace to us, when with humility we ſeeke it, they fell upon the earth, and lifting up their eyes they met with a new terrour when as they eſpied the fearefull Chariot in which <hi>Alcander</hi> appeared, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch a majeſty, that if they had not beene inſtructed by the light of fayth, that one only God was to be acknowledged, they had adored him: never ſo much as dreaming that it was done by art Magicke, or that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter could proceed from the skill of any mortall man. For beleeving that none in the world was more expert in that art then they, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagine that any man could finde them out in their Iſland, unleſſe they pleaſed to permit it. <hi>Alcander</hi> reading their amazement in their lookes and motions, would not keepe them any longer in payne: Moſt venerable perſons, ſayd he, be not diſmayd to ſee me heere at this preſent, and in this maner: That almighty God who hath endued you with the knowledge of things above nature for the good of his people, hath imparted to mee the ſame favours which he hath beſtowed upon you, and made me no leſſe zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his glory and ſervice: I am not come hither now to trouble you, as you imagine, but indeed to conferre with you about certayne things, which ſhall be neceſſary for the welfare of the Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hath begotten ſuch an affection in me towards them, as I will not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne a thought but for the augmentation of their glory. I know that you have alwayes infinitely loved them; that your aſſiſtance was never wanting to them; and that without your ayd they could not ſo eaſily have endured thoſe labours they have paſſed thorow. Wherefore I will endevour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence you for it; imparting to you certayne ſecrets, that as yet are not come to your knowledge, and that I know you will not a little eſteeme: But becauſe your preſervation is no leſſe deare to me then their quiet, I doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you all to goe with me to a Palace that I have, whither wee will carry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17218:6"/>
with us your Bookes, and ſuch inſtruments as are fit for thoſe of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; to the end, that my ſabour being added to your learning, wee may the more eaſily finde out what ſhall moſt conduce to our deſigne. I cannot doubt but you may have ſome cauſe to feare the undertaking of this voyage in the company of a man, whom you never heard ſpoken of, and that you may finde reaſon to decline it in the incommodity of your age; but the good ſervice I have done to Chriſtendome, which hath not undergone ſo great a loſſe as you beleeve, and that alſo I intend to you in your owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, may oblige you not to ſuſpect any malice in me: I love vertue too well to be a traytor, and your lives are with mee no leſſe conſiderable then mine owne. Reſolve with your ſelves then, my deare friends, and make no difficulty in following my advice: Time will make you know mee better, and experience; aſſure you of my zeale to that, which concernes the affaire I have in hand. How pleaſing is reſt after labour, and how ſweet is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance after feare? Theſe good folkes, who expected nothing leſſe then ſo gentle a language, and that made no great account of their lives, judging by <hi>Alcanders</hi> courage, that he had no bad diſpoſition, gave him as many thanks as the favour he did in viſiting them ſeemed great. It is moſt true, ſayd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quif,</hi> that we would never have thought any other could have outgone us in the knowledge of the ſecrets of Magicke. But your comming hither hath freed us of that error: for this our Iſland being indiviſible to all the world, and ſo eaſily diſcovered by you, our ſelves alſo in a maner bereft of our judgement in beholding you, we cannot doubt but your knowledge is farre beyond ours. Wherefore without any maner of diſtruſt of you, wee doe withall acknowledgement accept the honour of your company, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that you make of acquainting us with ſuch ſecrets, as have beene hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to concealed from us. And to teſtifie unto you that I ſpeake ingenuouſly and freely, I proteſt henceforth to depend wholly upon you, ſo that if wee doe heereafter undertake any thing, it ſhall not bee but by your advice: and if our weake indevours may be of uſe to the greatneſſe of your intentions, we will joine them to yours, without expecting of any part in the glory of your actions, but that which ſhall redound from having been your ſervants. Let us goe then, when you pleaſe, wee will carry with us what ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; and if you thinke good, leave nothing behinde us in this Iſland. No, no, anſwered <hi>Alcander,</hi> that ſhall not need: The beſt of your bookes will be ſufficient. <hi>Vrganda</hi> then having made up a bundle of them, they all went into the Chariot of the Griffons, that is to ſay, <hi>Alquif, Vrganda, Zir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Zirenna, Alquifa,</hi> and the yong <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> who afterwards by the ayde of <hi>Alcander,</hi> became ſo perfect in that art, as ſhe much excelled her parents. The beaſts having their load, began to cut the ayre with an incredible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in a little time arrived at the Caſtle of Treaſure, which appeared to theſe Magicians ſo magnificent, that they had never ſeene building equal to it. As ſoone as they were come thither, <hi>Alcander</hi> not to loſe time, deſired them to put off their clothes, and made them goe into thoſe pretious baths, which hee had formerly prepared to reſtore the Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> to the moſt flouriſhing eſtate of their age; where after hee had kept them eyght dayes, the wrinkles which covered their faces, were cleane defaced; their limbes enfeebled by a troubleſome old age, became firme; their backes bending under the weight of yeeres, were ſtraightned; their hayre whited with time, changed colour; in briefe, they found themſelves wholly altered
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17218:7"/>
from what they were in the unknowne Iſland. Behold, ſayd then this great Prince of Philoſophers, the firſt favour I will doe to you, that to me ſeemes of no meane importance: But becauſe wee are not aſſembled heere onely for our ſelves, let us take a little paynes, and ſee how wee may hinder the miſchiefe which is yet to fall upon the houſe of Greece, by the loſſe of ſome certayne yong Princes, who are one day to be the ſtrongeſt pillars of Chriſtendome. I propound this unto you, though I thinke it unprofitable, for the ordinances of heaven are inevitable; howbeit our labour ſhall not bee without fruit; and though wee cannot keepe them from impriſonment, yet ſhall wee doe ſomewhat to helpe and preſerve them among their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This ſayd, they began to make their conjurations apart, which were not altogether unuſefull, as you ſhall know by the ſequel of this Diſcourſe. That done, <hi>Alcander</hi> thought good to returne his friends to their Iſland, not diſcovering to them the enchantment of the Princes of Greece. And having deſired them to watch as till then they had done, for the benefit of Chriſtendome, hee went away, carrying <hi>Caſſandra</hi> along with him, to ſhew her all the ſecrets of Magicke, and to render her perfect in that Art.</p>

But fearing leſt ſome new warre might breake foorth after his departure, he left the moiety of his troopes with thoſe, whoſe Provinces were ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Pagans eſtates, that they might not be ſurpriſed with any new garboyle, and alſo might preſerve the Countreys they had gotten. Matters being thus diſpoſed, they attended the next riſing Sunne, which preſented to them no leſſe wonder then the day before had done: for that vaſt and ſtately edifice, wherein all thoſe Kings, Princes, and Emperours, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, appeared no more, nor was there any thing ſeene in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but onely the playne ground, as it was before the battell. This ſecond loſſe had afflicted them, for they receyved no meane conſolation in ſeeing their parents interred with ſo much glory, but ſtraightway conſidered that this was ſome new device of that Magician, who had written unto them, they were no whit diſmayed; and taking it for a good teſtimony of his love to them in that he had not left thoſe bodies in the middeſt of ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they prepared for their departure with the leſſe griefe. The time then of their remoove being come, all thoſe troopes began to march ſeverall

For <hi>Spheramond, Dorigell, Sylvan, Amanio d'Aſtre,</hi> and the fayre Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, tooke a way farre different from that, which the others had, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſpend ſome time in ſeeking adventures abroad. The beauteous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ſeeing her ſelf alone, renewed her ſorrow for the loſſe of her husband, whileſt <hi>Silvan</hi> travelled with no leſſe diſcontent for that of his fayre <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> of whoſe death he had heard; and that <hi>Spheramond, Amanio d'Aſtre,</hi> and <hi>Dorigell</hi> lamented ſo great a diſaſter, although the glorious death of their kinſmen did yeeld them ſome comfort. Having thus paſſed two or three dayes without meeting any adventure worthy their undertaking, <hi>Sphera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> about the time that the Sunne was in the middeſt of his courſe, felt himſelfe ſo drowſie, that he was conſtrayned to lie downe to ſleepe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Squire to let their horſes graze. The extreame paines that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had taken, and the delicacy of the place, made his reſt ſo pleaſing unto him, as he did not wake till night, nor would peradventure have done till the next day, if the noyſe of a Chariot paſſing by him, had not made him to riſe in all haſte; he was about to have called his Squire for to bridle his horſe, but the voyce of one that lamented, ſtayd him for to learne the cauſe thereof. Liſtening then attentively, and looking that way the voyce came, he ſaw a Chariot paſſe by him drawne with ſixe great horſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſate three dreadfull Giants, every one of them holding a Lady in his armes; two of the which ſeemed to be rather dead then alive; and the third was ſhe that made thoſe cries and lamentations which hee had heard. Iuſt Heaven, ſayd ſhe, will you not ſend ſome ſuccour to theſe great though mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Princeſſes? Or will you permit them to remayne in the hands of theſe villayns, who queſtionleſſe will without reſpect of their quality ſtrive by force to robbe them of what is moſt deare unto them? O God! what a loſſe will Chriſtendome receyve? And you, brave Princes, how much will it grieve you to heare of this diſaſter? I lament your misfortune aſmuch as the death they are going to ſuffer. This voyce being loſt in the ayre, left nodeſſe pity then anger in the minde of this Prince: For finding by this ſpeech that they were Chriſtians of eminent quality, and thinking alſo that he had beene acquaynted with the ſound of that voyce, he was moved with an extreame deſire to ſuccour them: So calling his Squire, hee made his horſe to be brought him; and quickly mounting upon him, he galloped the ſame way that he ſaw the Chariot take, hoping to reach thoſe Giants in a little time, and to fight with them at any rate whatſoever. But the night was ſo darke, that not knowing which way he tooke, hee entred into a Forreſt, where the firſt that he met with, was a reverend old man, holding a torch in his hand, who taking his horſe by the bridle, ſayde unto him: Valiant Prince, be not offended if I take the liberty to ſtay you at this preſent; For deſiring your ſafety, as much as my owne welfare, I cannot let you paſſe without advertiſing you, that you are infallibly loſt, if you ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It is not yet time that you ſhould know mee, nor that you ſhould thorowly underſtand my intentions, as I doe your thoughts.

I do not know, anſwered <hi>Spheramond,</hi> (ſomewhat wondring to meet that man in ſuch a place, and at ſo unſeaſonable an howre) how you can bee obliged to wiſh and ſeeke my good, with ſo much demonſtration of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſince I doe not remember that ever I ſaw you before: But happen what may, I will gladly obey you, my neceſſity and the time alſo adviſing mee therunto: Thus ſpeaking he alighted, leaving his horſe with a little Dwarfe who was there as of purpoſe, and entred the Tent, which hee thought was the fayreſt that ever he had ſeene. Without doubt, ſayd hee then, you love me not a little, that have provided me ſo magnificent a lodging: for I did not expect to be ſo well accommodated to night: But beleeve it, you ſhall not find me ungratefull, if you pleaſe to make uſe of me. Saying ſo, he went to embrace this man, but he was no more to be ſeene: wherat he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amazed, yet ſuppoſing all this to bee done by inchantment, hee began to ſurvey the Tent, and found in one of the corners of it, a Table covered with plenty of delicate meat, which ſo whetted his ſtomacke, that hee ſate him downe to ſupper; where having well aſſwaged his hunger, hee walked about the Tent, and finding a bed ready made hee layd him downe upon it, and fell into ſo ſound a ſleepe, that the ſunne was of a good height before he awaked; and then being much amazed to find himſelfe armed with new and excellent Armes, his Squire ſnoring at his feet, and neyther Wood nor Tent to be ſeene, but a playne, ſo large as it could not limit his view: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his wonder ceaſing by the remembrance of ſuch like encounters, when as hee was a Knight errant, hee jogd his Squire to waken him. And having not forgotten the adventure that he met with the night before, nor the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the old man, he quickly got to horſe, and tooke the firſt way hee lighted upon, wherein he rode till Sunne ſetting, when as hee perceived a Caſtle before him garniſhed with twelve towres, ſo fayre and ſtrong that it was impoſſible to better them: this curioſity inviting him to view this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neerer hand he approached to it, and going about it he was ſo attentive in obſerving it, as hee could hardly give over. But ſeeing night now come on, he tooke the hammer of the gate, and knocked very hard: At the noyſe whereof a Giant appeared upon the Battlements, who with a hoarſe and dreadfull voyce ſayd unto him: Withdraw thy ſelfe, wretched creature, and come not hither to ſeeke that which all men elſe are afrayd to find: the gate may not be opened this night, for ſo are wee commanded, what ever occaſion ſhall fall out; but if thou wilt tarry till tomorrow, I will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to heare what thou haſt to ſay: Therewith he retyred himſelfe leaving <hi>Spheramond</hi> ill ſatisfied with that his arrogant behaviour. Nevertheleſſe, not being able to quit his longing to know what was within the Caſtle, hee fell off to certayne trees, that were not farre off from it: and commanding his Squire to diſcharge the part of a carefull Sentinell, with much adoe he fell on ſleepe.</p>

They were two dayes without lighting on any adventure, at the end whereof <hi>Dorigell</hi> entring into a great field met with a Dwarfe mounted upon the braveſt horſe that ever hee had ſeene: but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo miſhapen and ill favoured, that he wondered how nature could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a rationall creature with ſo much deformity: He was about to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him concerning the occaſion of his journey, but the Dwarfe prevented him: For drawing neere and ſaluting him in a more gracefull maner, then he expected, he ſayd unto him; Knight, I marvell much to ſee you ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone through theſe Launds, which are commonly called The Fearfull, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſtrange adventures which doe happen dayly, by reaſon of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſcituate in the middeſt of them, belonging to an old Sorcereſſe, who doth entrap all the Knights that paſſe this way, finding meanes to entice them to her houſe, where all their valour will not ſerve to free them from captivity, if they bee not ſlaine in fight. For to that end ſhee keepes there twelve Giants of a monſtrous ſtature, and ſo ſtrong withall, as they alone are able to defeat the mightieſt Emperour of the World; You ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you pleaſe, bend your courſe ſome other way, and not tempt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: For it is no leſſe honour to eſchew with diſcretion an unreſiſtable danger, then being ingaged to fight couragiouſly. <hi>Dorigell</hi> more delighted with the diſcourſe then with the perſon of this gallant, anſwered him, Thy counſell might indeed be uſefull to me, if I had leſſe reſpect to my honour, then my life; but doeſt thou not know that worthy Knights muſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuile for any conſideration of danger whatſoever: that glory is not to bee found but in the moſt difficult enterpriſes; and that victory is then moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, when it is purchaſed with bloud. I will therfore follow this way, ſince fortune hath put me into it: but yet before I part with you, I would entreat you to enforme me more particularly concerning this Caſtle; and why this Enchantreſſe doeth live there, to worke ſo much miſchiefe to Knights that have not wrongd her. You could not, replyde hee, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed your ſelfe better then to me, at the leaſt to be ſatisfied in your curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; For I doe belong to a man, who is no leſſe a friend to brave Knights, then this woman their enemy, and one whoſe knowledge is aſmuch as hers: She is ſiſter to the King of the Frozen Iſlands, that was ſlaine in the late and memorable battell of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where all the Pagan Kings ended their lives, except him of <hi>Pentapoly,</hi> who ſaved himſelfe with ſixe thouſand men, which were under his command, for the guard of the Campe. The deſire ſhe hath alwayes had to ruine the Chriſtians, cauſing her often to turne over her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17218:9"/>
bookes (in which ſhe is very expert) ſhe foreſaw the generall defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Pagans, that ſhould unite themſelves for that warre; And for that reaſon would have diverted her brother from it, aſſuring him of his death, if he ſhould bee preſent there: but hee preferring an honourable end before the ill report that otherwiſe hee ſhould have incurred by abſenting himſelfe from thence, would needs make one in that expedition, and was there ſlaine, as I have related: which did ſo inrage this old Sorcereſſe, that ſhe withdrew her ſelfe to theſe Launds, where by Enchantment ſhe built this Caſtle: and for the guard thereof drew hither twelve of the mightieſt Giants in the world; who, without regard to any lawes of Chivalry, do all of them commonly fall upon any one man that preſents himſelfe, if the firſt that encounters him be not able to defeat him: hoping to ſurpriſe in their paſſing this way ſome of thoſe famous Knights of Greece, and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tortures which ſhe meanes to make them ſuffer, in ſome ſort to mitigate the griefe ſhe feeles for the loſſe of the King her brother. Iudge now, I pray you, whether my advice doe not concerne you, and whether it be not a good teſtimony of my love, in deſiring you to retire out of theſe parts, where you can meet with nothing but miſchiefe. Thou haſt, ſayd <hi>Dorigell,</hi> ſo fully ſatisfied me, that I will confeſſe my ſelfe much obliged unto thee for thy labour. Thy counſell I acknowledge for very good, but yet me thinks my reaſons againſt it are much better: ſo that I am reſolved to paſſe on, and ſee what the heavens have preordained for me. Speaking thus, he would have put his horſe forward, but the Dwarfe taking him by the bridle ſayd, Stay a little, Sir Knight, and permit me to ſpeake a few words unto you; He that appointed me to be heere now, hath commanded me to preſent you with this horſe, and the ſhield which you ſee hanging at my ſaddle bow, aſſuring you that you will have occaſion to uſe them in an extreame neceſſity. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he vaniſhed away, leaving the horſe and ſhield with <hi>Dorigell:</hi> who not more wondring, then pleaſed with ſo brave a preſent, gave his own to his Squire; and mounting upon his new horſe, found him upon managing, ſo ready and light, that he liked him much better then he did before. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing then his way he rendred many thankes in his heart to him that had ſo deeply obliged him: but we will let him goe with this ſenſe of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie done him, and return to <hi>Silvan</hi> amidſt his ſorrowfull meditations. This yong Knight perpetually thinking on his <hi>Licinia,</hi> whom death had untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raviſht from him, was even loſt in the anguiſh of his minde, when as he heard the voyce of one that cried for helpe: whereupon he turned head, and galloping mainely away, he came to certain trees, to one of the which he ſaw a handſome woman bound with cords, and a yong Squire of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing preſence, that held his ſword at her throat to make her confeſſe the truth of ſomething which he deſired to wring out of her. Verily, ſaid he then, ſpeaking to the Squire, Nature forgat her ſelfe when ſhe framed you with any kind of perfection, ſince you have ſo little curteſie in you: Why do you ſo ill intreat one of thoſe whom we are all bound to protect? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelf, I ſay, for beleeve it if you were a Knight, I would puniſh you for ſo great a villany. I would, anſwered the Squire without being at all diſmayd, you had known the miſchievous diſpoſition of this woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had been ſo mooved as you are; for then, Sir Knight, you would not ſo readily have engaged your ſelfe in her defence. I met with her this morning, and having converſed a while with her, I perceived by her cariage
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17218:9"/>
that the little beauty Nature hath beſtowed upon me, had wrought ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in her, wherewith I muſt confeſſe I was well enough pleaſed: Not that I found any thing in her which gave me the leaſt ſatisfaction, but that from her love I gathered a teſtimony of ſome merit in my ſelf: Our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at the firſt was ordinary, but as her paſſion tranſported her, ſhe at length could not conceale her damnable intentions, but confeſſed freely to me that ſhe was upon her way onely to wait for ſome Knight of quality, for to bring him to be butchered at the Caſtle of the Towers, where a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſorts of cruelties are daily practiſed. I am a friend to vertue, and would with the hazard of my life preſerve a worthy Knight, ſo that deſiring to prevent her wicked purpoſes, I bound her as you ſee, with a reſolution to make an end of her, which I had certainly done: for the point of my ſword having forced her to confeſſe that her principall plot was upon the Princes of Greece, whoſe vertue all the world loves and admires: I determined to let her breath no longer then would ſerve to recommend her ſoule into the hands of heaven: you may now diſpoſe of her as you pleaſe; but I adviſe you to looke well to your ſelf, and conſider that you ſhall be guilty of all the miſchiefes that ever ſhe ſhall heerafter commit, ſince you give her her life, which for her treacheries ſhe juſtly deſerves to loſe. With that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately mounting on his horſe he departed, leaving <hi>Silvan</hi> ſomewhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed: for his reaſons ſeemed ſo good, and with ſuch appearance of truth, that he was about to paſſe on, and leave the Wench in the eſtate he found her: But being moved with her teares, and not able to perſwade himſelfe, that ſo fair a creature could be poſſeſſed with ſo much malice, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Squire to unbind her: and forgetting the advice of him that but then parted from them, he began to comfort her, in ſtead of repreſenting her vice unto her. I will never beleeve, ſaid he unto her, that a woman e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſo many beauties, can be ſo wicked as was but now reported unto me. Wherefore give over afflicting your ſelf, and tell me truely the cauſe why this Squire entreated you in that faſhion. Not to diſſemble, ſaid ſhe, this cunning was but too well diſguiſed. For according to the report of the baſe villaine made of me, you have reaſon not to truſt me, and to believe that I am the falſeſt woman in the world: but the matter is quite otherwiſe then he hath delivered: for as ſoon as he ſaw me, he proteſted that he was extreamly enamored of me; and not being able (as he ſwore) to endure the violence of his paſſion, he beſought me to receive him into my favour, and to afford him ſome more particular grace; which having refuſed him, he tooke me from my horſe, and notwithſtanding all my beſt reſiſtance, bound me as you ſaw, threatning to kill me if I did not grant his deſire, whereunto without doubt, I ſhould at the laſt have yielded, not having courage enough to ſuffer death, if you had tarried any whit longer. Behold, noble Knight, the truth of this affair, which I have freely and ſimply delivered unto you, hoping that you will not do a curteſie to halfes, and leave me without aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a Countrey ſo dangerous, where I travell without any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the command of a Lady, that is ready to periſh for the love of a brave Chriſtian Knight whom I may not name: having ſo vowed at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture for the reputation of her that emploies me. What cannot the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of a villanous woman effect? <hi>Silvan</hi> taſting this diſcourſe far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then was for his behoofe, was ſo taken with the faire pretext of her reaſons, that caſting away the ill conceit he had of her, he determined to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17218:10"/>
accompany her till ſhe were in ſome place of ſafety; So cauſing her to be ſet on horſeback, he went along with her towards the dangerous Caſtle, where queſtionleſſe he had been loſt, if heaven that took a particular care of him, had not miraculouſly diverted the miſchief that hung over his head. In the meane time, the gentle <hi>Amanio d'Aſtre</hi> followed ſomewhat a different way from that of <hi>Silvan,</hi> being no leſſe buſied with his unquiet thoughts: but he was driven out of his dumps by a Dwarf, who taking his horſe by, the bridle turned him aſide, and giving him a jerk with a wand, ſaid; Knight, take this way, I pray you, and let not the night ſtay you: for your retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be the cauſe of perpetuall ſorrow to you. Saying ſo he paſſed on, leaving <hi>Amanio</hi> infinitely amazed with this ſpeech, whereof he would gladly have known the meaning, but finding no means to be ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for that the Dwarf was no longer appearing, he put on his horſe with more haſte then before; reſolving not to diſcontinue his travell till he might ſee what the end of this adventure would be.</p>

reſolving himſelf, he ſheathed his ſword in the body of his firſt man, who was ſtriving to get up, and ſtraightway mounting on his horſe the better and more eaſily to defend himſelf, he made towards them, but they were by that time ſo neer unto him, as he was conſtrained rather to think of warding their blows, then offending them. For the one of them laid upon his ſhield, and the other upon his cask with ſuch violence, as but for the goodneſſe of his new armes, his life had then been at its period: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he was not much diſmaied, yet thinking that ſuch violent incounters might at length be attended with death, he reſolved to fight with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſtand carefull upon his guard; making them therefore ſpend the moſt part of their blows in vain, he took ſo good choice of his times, as he often drew bloud of them, not giving a blow which pierced not the fleſh, and put them in doubt of their lives: whereat they were ſo enraged, as in ſtead of ſtriking on his armes, they hewed the ſtones in pieces, and filled the ground about them full of clefts. Whileſt their fury did thus tranſport them, the Emperor not willing to let ſlip any occaſion that preſented it ſelf, took his time when as one of them ſtooped to pull his Courtelaſſe out of the earth, whereinto he had ſunk it three foot deep, and hit him with a reverſe ſo juſt upon the neck, that he laid his great head at his feet; leaving his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion much amazed to ſee himſelf alone, covered with bloud and wounds, and with little or no power to defend himſelf any longer, howbeit he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome heart with the ſight of three other Giants, that came out of the ſame Caſtle; who having encompaſt his enemy, began to charge him with ſuch fury, that not being able to ward ſo many blows which bruiſed his bones, he thought that he muſt needs fall under ſuch an oppreſſing violence, but reſolving to ſell his life at a dear rate, he defended himſelf with ſuch courage, and charged them with ſuch force, that he grievouſly wounded two of them, when as the third gave him ſo inſupportable a blow on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, that he laid him quite void of ſenſe on the crupper of his horſe, voiding bloud in abundance at his noſe and ears. The Giant, proud of his fortune, followed him with his ſword advanced for to finiſh the work, when as a great Knight arriving in the inſtant charged his Lance againſt him, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it clean through his body tumbled him dead upon the ground. <hi>Sphera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> who while this was a doing, had ſome leiſure a little to recover his ſpirits, ſeeing himſelf ſo opportunely ſeconded, claſped his ſword faſt in his hand, and with an infinit rage for having been reduced into that eſtate, he let it deſcend with ſuch force upon the firſt Giant, that he divided his head in twaine, juſt at ſuch time as he which came to his ſuccour, having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched the other againſt whom he was oppoſed, taking a new Lance from his Squire, turnd himſelf gallantly to receive thirty Knights, that ſallied out of the Caſtle, under the conduct of three dreadfull Giants, who made ſuch a noiſe as the earth ſeemed to tremble under them.

That done, falling in amidſt thoſe Knights, he kild the two firſt that preſented themſelves before him.

ſhort, that with the aſſiſtance of thoſe raſcals, which would not ſuffer them ſo much as to breath, they had been in extream danger of their lives, if two Knights had not at one time arrived there by ſeverall wayes, who ſeeing a fight managed with ſo much unequality, preſently layd hands on their ſwords, and attaching the Giants that exceedingly moleſted the Princes, charged them with ſuch furious blows, that they were fain to turn head for to defend themſelves, leaving <hi>Spheramond</hi> and his companion amidſt their other Knights; of whom they made ſo great a ſlaughter, that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but two of them alive, who fearing to loſe their lives as their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had done, threw away their weapons and craved mercy. You ſhall (ſaid <hi>Spheramond)</hi> have it granted you, upon condition that you put us in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Caſtle. You may, ſaid they, enter it freely, and without fear, For you ſhall find no body there to reſiſt you, ſo as <hi>Argenea</hi> the Miſtreſſe of the place, doth not frame ſome new inchantment to make you purchaſe it with more danger and pain: howbeit I can aſſure you that ſhe is not now in the Caſtle, ſhe having gone from thence not long ſince, (as I conjecture) to find ſome means from hindring it to be taken. For her ſpirits (without) let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her know the time) had advertiſed her of the misfortune that hath this day befallen us: you may therefore boldly enter in, and your beſt courſe will be firſt to ſeaze upon the ports for your more ſecurity. This counſell ſeeming good to the Knights, the blacke Knight ſtaid at the gate, *whileſt <hi>Spheramond</hi> ſearched all about the houſe. But finding nothing, he returned preſently to view the combat between the two Knights and the Giants, which continued with ſo much fury, that it was not eaſie to determine what the iſſue of it was like to be. But ere long they perceived the advantage on their ſide that came laſt. For their enemies had loſt ſo much bloud, as they fell both almoſt at one inſtant ſo weak, that there was no need of any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to make an end of them. <hi>Spheramond</hi> extreamly ſatisfied with this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, lifted up the viſier of his helmet and addreſſing himſelf to the Knight that had firſt ſuccoured him: Valiant Sir, ſaid he, You have ſo infinitly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me, as I cannot doubt of your affection to me: but to render the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your aſſiſtance and my preſervation accompliſhed, tell me who you are, that in recompence thereof, I may heerafter ſeek out occaſions to be commanded by you. Excellent Prince, anſwered the black Knight, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his face, I will never acknowledge that you are any way engaged to my arms, in the leaſt obligation: For your valour alone was able to defeat your enemies without my aid, yet I cannot but give humble thanks unto heaven for bringing me hither ſo opportunely to teſtifie the deſire I have to do you ſervice; I am your moſt humble ſervant <hi>Dorigell,</hi> Prince of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Iſland, and more contented for meeting you heer at this time, then I could have been for the conqueſt of any enemies Empire. With theſe words they embraced, as if they had not been together in a long time before: and were about to draw toward the other two Knights to give them thanks for their ſuccours; when as they who knew them, came to them with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of reſpect: My Lords, ſaid they, give us leave to kiſſe your victorious hands, as thoſe which will ever depend upon you: You ſee heer <hi>Amanio d'Aſtre</hi> and <hi>Silvan,</hi> brought hither by moſt ſtrange means, but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding happy in that our arrivall hath not been altogether unuſefull to you. Then unlacing their helmets they would have humbled themſelves to <hi>Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond,</hi> but he embraced them with ſuch expreſſions of love, as more could

not be. The entertainment of theſe fowr Knights having laſted a while, they all entred the Caſtle: and having ſhut the gates, they were conducted by the two Knights whom they had ſaved to the priſons, from whence they enlarged thirty or forty Knights; amongſt the which were <hi>Parmenian</hi> of Cyprus, and <hi>Ladazan</hi> of Numidia, who determining to ſeek adventures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, had left the Army the evening before their diſlodging: and as their fortune directed them, met neer the Caſtle of the twelve Towrs; where they were ſurpriſed by two of the Giants, who having aſtonied them with two blows, encloſed them in a Dungeon, with an intention ere long to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them to their Gods, in ſatisfaction of <hi>Argeneaes</hi> revenge. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of theſe Princes was not ſmall, in having thus delivered two of their friends; nor did they take care for any thing more, then how to find out ſome one that could dreſſe their wounds. For <hi>Dorigell</hi> was hurt in three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Spheramond</hi> very much bruiſed with the blows he had received (the goodneſſe of his arms having arreſted the edge of his enemies ſwords,) and <hi>Amanio d'Aſtre</hi> had a ſlaſh on his ſhoulder nothing ſo dangerous as great; but inſtantly they had word brought them, that at the gate there was a Dwarf who deſired to ſpeak with them: Let him in, ſaid <hi>Spheramond,</hi> his preſence will not affright us; only have a care that he be not followed by any other. For the two Knights we ſpared have aſſured me, that three of the guard of this Caſtle are yet abroad, and that it is likely they will return this evening. The Sentinell then perceiving no body but the Dwarf ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gate, and from thence he was brought to the Princes, where at firſt addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Dorigell</hi> he ſaid, Do you know me, Sir Knight? Yes truly, ſaid <hi>Dorigell,</hi> you gave me yeſterday the beſt horſe and the braveſt ſhield in the world; for which curteſie you may ask of me what you pleaſe: and be aſſured you ſhall not be refuſed in any thing that lies in my power. I do not come hither, anſwered he, to requeſt any reward for my ſervice, but to do you ſome more: Go, I pray you preſently to bed, together with theſe Princes that are hurt, and I will dreſſe you. For knowing that your wounds would extreamly incommodate you without looking to, I am come to cure you. You have already done ſo much for me, ſaid <hi>Dorigel,</hi> that I will not now refuſe your aſſiſtance, neither for my ſelf nor my friends. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then three beds to be ſet up in one Chamber, that the time might ſeem the leſſe tedious unto them, they went to bed and were dreſt by this Dwarf, who enjoining them to reſt till the morning, went out with <hi>Silvan</hi> that took upon him the charge of the Caſtle, appointing <hi>Parmenian</hi> of Cyprus, and <hi>Ladazan</hi> of Numidia, to keep the watch with twelve Knights for fear of being ſurpriſed.

Thereat the Princes cald for their arms, fearing leſt that Knight ſhould not be able to withſtand the fury of thoſe monſters: and therefore made all the haſte they poſſible could. The yong <hi>Silvan</hi> who was firſt ready, knowing the Giants to be on foot,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17218:12"/>
went out only with his ſword in his hand, wherewith he entertained his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in ſo rude a faſhion, aided by the valiant Emperour of the Parthians, that followed him, as he made them not only deſpair of the victory, but ſtand in fear of a neer approaching death. The Knight whom before they had circled about, ſeeing himſelf ſo well and beyond his hope ſeconded, did ſo gallantly beſtir himſelf, and charged him that oppoſed him, with ſuch fury, as the graſſe round about him was died with his bloud. In like ſort, <hi>Silvan</hi> entreated his man, and <hi>Spheramond</hi> gave his enemy not ſo much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to breath; but the honour of this combat was ſo well diſputed with them, as they could not vaunt to have lent any thing but upon very good pawns. He that fought with the firſt Knight, deſpaired of his ſafety, and defying heaven for being ſo ill intreated by one man alone, took his curtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ax in both his hands, and diſcharged ſo violent a blow on his adverſaries helmet, that he laid him in the duſt altogether deprived of ſenſe. That blow naving given him ſome hope of victory, he was going to diſarm him, but having in that rage and ſtraining of himſelf, ſpent all his bloud and ſtrength, he reeling tumbled down on the other ſide with apparant ſignes of death. <hi>Spheramond</hi> that had obſerved the misfortune of the Knight who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thoght to be dead, was ſo tranſported with choler, that griping his ſword faſt in his hand he made it deſcend with ſuch fury on the cask of his enemy, as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it together with his head in two pieces, he laid him ſtark dead upon the earth. Thence preſently flying to the Knight, that lay extended by the ſlain Giant, he unlaced his helmet, to ſee if he yet breathed, and found it was the beauteous Savage, who feeling the freſhnes of the air, immediatly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her eies: His amazement to ſee her there, was no leſſe then his content to find her with ſome remainder of life; but thinking that ſhe ſtood in more need of ſuccour then of complement, he went about to help her up, when as remembring the combat ſhe had begun, ſhe roſe with ſuch force and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as made them all to wonder that beheld her; and laying hold of her ſword that was faſtned to her arm, ſhe was going to fall furiouſly on the Giant that fought with <hi>Silvan;</hi> but ſhe ſaw him ſink under a terrible blow which he gave him. I am, ſaid ſhe then, fully revenged of my enemies: but yet I deſire to know unto whom I am indebted for this aſſiſtance. To your own vertue, ſaid <hi>Spheramond,</hi> which had no great need of our arms. God, ſaid ſhe, What do I ſee? and what ſtrange encounter is this? Tell me, my Lord, what good fortune brought you hither? What Knights are theſe in your company? and what have your adventures been theſe three daies? Even ſuch, anſwered <hi>Spheramond,</hi> as thoſe that have rendred you heer; we arrived heer without any particular deſign, and have rooted out of this Country a crew of miſchievous fellows: but that which gives me the moſt content is, that we fell upon this place ſo happily for your ſafety, and the increaſe of our glory. Theſe that you ſee heer with me are at your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Heer is <hi>Silvan,</hi> who ſhewed himſelf the moſt forward to do you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, being the firſt that ſallied foorth to your ſuccour. This is <hi>Dorigell,</hi> Prince of the Fortunate Iſland: the third is <hi>Amanio d'Aſtre;</hi> and theſe two Knights are <hi>Parmenian</hi> of Cyprus and <hi>Ladazan</hi> of Numidia, whom we have freed out of priſon. Then he told her all the circumſtances of his coming thither, his combat, and how without the aſſiſtance of thoſe brave Princes, he had infallibly loſt his life. This diſcourſe having perſwaded them, that all thoſe occurrences had fallen out by the providence of ſome Magician

their friend, ſhe was about after ſhe had infinitely careſſed thoſe Knights to enter the Caſtle; but remembring the women in favour of whom ſhe had undertaken the combat, although ſhe know not who they were, ſhe deſired <hi>Parmenian</hi> and <hi>Ladazan</hi> to go and ſeek them out; for ſhe had obſerved that at the beginning of the fight they fled away from that place: This they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook moſt willingly, and did diſcharge it ſo happily, as the ſame day they returned with unſpeakable content of all the company, as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to you in the Chapter following.</p>

It remains now that we relate unto you the new deſigne ſhe had to render her malice the more memorable: As ſoone as the building was brought to perfection, ſhe took her books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe often entertained her ſelf, and ſtraining her skill to the higheſt pitch, ſhe found that the Empreſſe <hi>Richarda,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Roſaliana,</hi> her ſiſter, were with childe with two ſonnes, who one day ſhould be the ſupport of Chriſtendome, and the ruine of Paganiſm; which did ſo vex her, as ſhe reſolved to deſtroy them before they ſhould come into the world: Having ſought out then from among the cunningeſt of her thoughts, for ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile invention to bring her deſires to paſſe, ſhe departed with three of her Giants a little before thoſe two great Armies came to meet, and imbarked her ſelf in a ſhip, which by the guiding of three Dwarffes, ſhe cauſed to ſail ſo ſhiftly, that in two daies ſhe was in the Empire of Parthia at the foot of a Caſtle by the Sea ſide, where by chance the Empreſſe <hi>Richarda</hi> with her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were at that time, to find ſome diverſion from the grief they were in for the abſence of their Husbands: Being arrived at her deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Upon the noiſe of the trumpets the Ladies looked out at the window that opened to the ſea, with a great deſire to know what the buſineſſe might be: but unable at that diſtance to diſcern the countenance of theſe transformed people, they did with ſome delight lend an ear to the Muſick, that ſeemed to preſage ſome good fortune unto them: and whileſt they thus ſuffered their ſouls to be drawn out at their ears, a damſell came to enform them, that there was a Dwarf deſired admittance, to advertiſe them of ſome affair which neerly concerned them: wherupon having commanded him to be brought in, they withdrew from the window to underſtand what the Dwarf would ſay unto them; who being too well taught for to fail <hi>Argenea</hi> in her deſign, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with much reſpect: and having made an humble obeiſance with a cheerfull countenance he ſaid to the Empreſſe <hi>Richard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But let me not live if I go not my ſelf to viſit them, though for a penance I ſerve in the morning to glorifie the triumph of this forrein Beauty they bring with them. Having then cauſed their horſes to be brought, ſhe went down to the haven accompanied only with her ſiſter, and one maid, where ſeeing the lovely face of her Husband, ſhe could not without ſome trouble bear the little delay which ſhe was forced to endure, before ſhe could be ſet aboord the ſhip; into the which ſhe was with her company no ſooner entred but the Giants reaſſumed their former ſhapes, which did ſo amaze them, that with grief to find themſelves ſo wofully abuſed, they fell down more then half dead upon the deck; <hi>Argenea</hi> ſeeing that which ſhe ſo much deſired in her power, immediatly covered the ſhip with a cloud, took her way back again with the ſame ſpeed ſhe had made thither, and landed at the ſame port from whence ſhe had weighed ancor not above five daies before. But her houſe being ten leagues from thence, ſhe preſently cauſed a Chariot to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, drawn by ſix horſes of a monſtrous greatneſſe; and having found by her laſt incantations ſhe was threatned with a terrible miſchief, ſhe willed her Giants to paſſe on and to beſtow the Ladies in ſafe cuſtody, whileſt ſhe went to conſult with a great Magician, with whom ſhe had formerly been very converſant, to the end that by the help of his skill ſhe might divert the ſtorm which was ready to fall upon her; yet all her devices were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for <hi>Alcander</hi> (to whoſe knowledge all other mortall mens gave place) having foreſeen the miſchievous intentions of this Hagg, had firſt turned

the Chariot ſomwhat out of the right way to make it come within the view of <hi>Spheramond,</hi> to whom alſo he gave the ſame day thoſe excellent arms, by means wherof he eſcaped death, which was otherwiſe inevitable, being to fight with three or fowr of the moſt able Giants in the world, all at one inſtant, aſſembled all thoſe Princes who had been ſeparated from the Army into that one place being aſſured that <hi>Spheramond</hi> would at length be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt ſo many Knights as were to combat him together. Theſe then were the Princeſſes which he ſaw paſſe by when overtaken with the night, he was ſleeping under the trees, and the very ſame that were brought to the Caſtle of the twelve Towrs, by the Giants, when as thoſe Princes ſallied foorth to ſecond the fair Savage, who having met the Chariot followed the Giants to fight with them, being mooved with pity at the lamentations of thoſe Ladies. But it is time to return to our former Diſcourſe of <hi>Parmenian</hi> of Cyprus and <hi>Ladazan</hi> finding theſe Princeſſes under a tree who trembled with fear, alighted from their horſes, and putting off their helmets, that the Ladies might by ſeeing who they were, be the better aſſured, they kneeled down to kiſſe their hands: but they were ſo amazed with the encounter of them, as they were not able to ſpeak a word; which <hi>Parmenian</hi> obſerving, to reſtore them to themſelves he ſaid: I cannot but much wonder (excellent Ladies) to meet you in theſe uninhabited parts, and ſo far remooved from your own Countries. But you will be no leſſe amazed when I tell you, that the Emperour <hi>Spheramond</hi> is at the Caſtle, which you ſee yonder, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with certain Princes of Greece, who are merrier then the loſſe they have endured might ſeem to permit, not knowing as yet of your being in theſe quarters. Do not then I beſeech you, afflict your ſelves any further; thoſe that brought you hither are dead; nor ſhall you find in that houſe any but ſuch as were born to do you ſervice. At theſe words the Princeſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a little courage, yet fearing ſuch another treacherous trick, as had been plaid them before, they made but little ſhew of reſenting that news, and reſted as it were in an extaſie, when <hi>Ladazan,</hi> who marvailed at that coldneſſe of theirs thus purſued his diſcourſe: Why how now, Ladies, are not theſe newes pleaſing unto you? and will you not return with us to glad the Emperour? Verily this cariage of yours doth amaze me; nor can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from whence it ſhould proceed, ſince all feare of danger is paſt. Let us go, I beſeech you, without any more delay. Well, let us go, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Richarda,</hi> who was ſomwhat the heartier of the three, ſince you will have it ſo, at the worſt we can be but once more abuſed: with that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced toward the Caſtle, before the gate whereof ſtood <hi>Spheramond</hi> with <hi>Dorigell</hi> and the reſt. He at the firſt ſight knowing them was ſtrangely ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at ſo unexpected an encounter. O God! ſaid he, can I imagin or believe that my fair miſtriſſe is heer, or can any man perſwade me that I am not in a dream? Tell me, Madam, am I in the Parthian Empire? or is it poſſible that I ſhould meet you in theſe deſert plains, which are not neer it by three hundred leagues? Certainly I am ſo confounded and beſides my ſelf, as I dare not embrace you, fearing that you are heer through ſome enchantment. I ſhould have, replied ſhe my dear heart, a great deal more cauſe to be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed beholding you heer, ſeeing it is not above ſix daies ſince you were with me in Parthia: but you did ſo ſuddenly change your aſpect, that the pleaſure of your ſight was inſtantly followed with an infinit grief for not finding you any more like unto your ſelf; yet I do not now wonder any

But ſince I ſee you heer with me, I do no more fear her charms, and care as little for her menaces: ſpeaking thus, ſhe gave him a million of kiſſes, and did ſo hang upon his lips as he could hardly have leiſure to anſwer the Infanta <hi>Roſaliana,</hi> who came to entertain him, and enquired for ſome news of her Husband. I would, ſaid he, gladly ſatisfie you if I knew how to do it with aſſurance: but not being able to ſay any thing certainly, I beſeech you ſeek not to be informed but with as little curioſity as your love will permit. In the mean time comfort your ſelf in his abſence, and beleeve that heaven will not be ſo much an enemy to your quiet, as not to render him unto you ere it be long, with more content then ever you had. Theſe words were extreamly ſenſible unto her, for ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he was dead among ſo many other Princes; and did therefore bewail him in her mind: but unwilling to diſturb her ſiſters contentment, or make it appear that ſhe diſtruſted the words of <hi>Spheramond,</hi> ſhe reſtrained her tears to return the ſalutes which ſhe received from <hi>Silvan, Dorigell,</hi> and <hi>Amanio d' Aſtre,</hi> who preſented their ſervice unto her, having before tendred the ſame reſpect to the Empreſſe <hi>Richarda.</hi> Some time then being ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt theſe complements, the Empreſſe would needs viſit the fair Savageſſe, who was in her bed with three wounds, being much troubled that ſhe could meet with no body that could dreſſe them. But as they were conſulting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout finding out ſome Chyrurgion, they ſaw the little Doctor come in that had cured them the night before; who commanding them all out, applied ſuch ſovereign ſalves to her wounds, as after eight howrs ſleep, ſhe waked without any pain, and as able to bear arms, as ever ſhe was in her life. The wonder therof being no leſſe then their content, they paſſed on that night without any fear of <hi>Argenaes</hi> power.

content for the return of hers. But ſeeing that their Courts (in former time ſo flouriſhing by the preſence of ſuch a number of excellent Princes) now ſeemed forlorn by their deaths, and the abſence of ſo many Princeſſes as were partly deceaſed, and partly carried away, they were not able to maſter their ſorrow; howbeit time, the common Phyſitian of miſeries, and the conſolations they continually received from thoſe brave Princes, having ſomwhat ſweetned the bitternes of their anguiſh, they began to reſtrain their tears and aſſwage their grief; ſeeing that neceſſity enforced them to ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious a reſolution. When as fortune that was not yet weary of vexing them prepared them a new occaſion of ſorrow: you have ſeen how the Empreſſe <hi>Niquea,</hi> before ſhe was enchanted in the Caſtle of Treaſure, was delivered of a yong ſon, whom ſhe called by his fathers name, for that he much reſembled him in face; and that at his birth there appeared in the air certain ſigns which ſeemed to preſage the excellency of that child. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now to tell you what became of him after the tranſporting of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away. The Chronicle of <hi>Alquif</hi> reports, that in thoſe daies lived a great Magician of the Pagan ſect, who (though he came ſhort of <hi>Alcanders</hi> perfection) yet was maſter of many admirable ſecrets, unknown to thoſe of his profeſſion: This man named <hi>Dorion,</hi> holding nothing in higher eſteem then the propagation of his law, took the ſame care for the preſervation of the Pagans, as our <hi>Alcander</hi> did for the welfare of Chriſtendome: ſo that one night beſtowing himſelf in the invocation of his ſpirits, he learned of them the birth of the little <hi>Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond, knew by his art that he would ſurpaſſe his father in valour, and that he ſhould one day be the ſecond pillar of the Empire of the faithfull, as alſo the ſubverter of Paganiſm. This infinitely afflicted him, and from thencefoorth he vowed his death, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to employ all the ſecrets of his art rather then fail of his purpoſe. But he continued not long in this mind: for turning over his books to find by what means he might beſt bring his deſire to paſſe, he found that he whoſe deſtruction he ſought, ſhould one day ſhed his bloud for to ſave him from an extream danger: changing then his miſchievous intention, he became more carefull of his life, then he had before been eager of his death; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the love of his Religion deeply rooted in his heart, and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the reſpect of his own preſervation to ſee the ruine of it, he took a middle way between the fear of ſeeing the glory of the Pagans defaced, and his deſire to live. This infant, ſaid he, may one day indeed relieve me, for the influence of the celeſtiall bodies are never fall, but yet I will keep him from deſtroying thoſe which profeſſe the ſame law that I do. I will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go and take him out of his mothers boſom, bring him into theſe deſerts, where I reſide, draw out of him the ſervice that he is predeſtined to do me, and then will ſet ſuch ſtrong enchantments upon him, as he ſhall never be ſeen by any man but my ſelf. Having thus ſpoken he incloſed himſelf in a cloud, and went directly to Conſtantinople, where the little <hi>Amadis</hi> was brought up. As ſoon as he came there, the Sun began to loſe his light, the daies brightnes was turned into darknes, and from the cloud wherin he was, ſuch claps of thunder roare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

into the midſt of his cloud, which immediatly riſing up in the air carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the monſtrous Iſland his own habitation, where being ſetled, he preſently cauſed a woman to nurſe him, commanding her with his milk to infuſe into him the directions of their Law, ſo ſoon as ſhe found him capable of any impreſſion of it: howbeit his deſign there ſorted not to his deſire. For <hi>Alcander</hi> who was not able to hinder the carrying of him away, for that the decrees of heaven are not to be croſſed, made him underſtand by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſecret impreſſions, that one only God was by him to be worſhipped. When the cloud was gone, the Sun reſumed his former ſplendor, and the air became as calm as before, but with exceeding grief to <hi>Sidonio,</hi> who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new loſſe ſhe had ſuſtained, ſo exceedingly renewed her ſighes and tears, that if Prince <hi>Floriſell,</hi> which was better able to undergo ſuch croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, had not fallen again to his former reaſons for to comfort her, ſhe would undoubtedly have buried her ſelf with her grief.

This ſaid, he went down the ſtairs, mounted on horsback,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17218:15"/>
and better cheered then he had been in a long time before, went to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where he had not been long, but he heard one that lamented not far from him, which made him to gallop that way the voice directed him, ſo that within a little while he arrived at a place where under a tree he found a good handſome woman, which held in herlap a dead Knight, over whom ſhe made exceeding ſtrange moan. Gentlewoman, ſaid he being moved with pity, if your ſorrow be capable of comfort, I would intreat you to conſider that you afflict your ſelf to no purpoſe, &amp; that it were fit you ſhould demonſtrate your love to this Knight ſome other way rather then by your tears, wherof he is now inſenſible. That which he now is to expect from your hands is a grave; Let us, I beſeech you, beſtow it upon him, and that done we will think of what remains. If he be ſlain by the treachery of any, I will, if it be in my power, work your revenge, otherwiſe it may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you that you have ſeen him die like a good Knight, which is the moſt honourable departure out of this life. And if I ſhall not be troubleſome to you, I will beſeech you to let me know his name, and who it is that hath brought him into this eſtate. For being ingaged by my word to revenge it, I ſhould be glad to underſtand if with reaſon I may do it. This afflicted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then lifting up her eies all drownd in tears, beheld him a while without ſpeaking a word, but judging by his countenance that he was not a Knight of any mean quality, at length ſhe very modeſtly replied to him in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Do not beleeve, noble Knight, that my complaint is exceſſive; for the valour and fidelity of him whoſe death I now lament, deſerves that my tears ſhould be perpetuall, and might juſtly perſwade me to lend no ear to any comfort whatſoever. But ſince with ſo much curteſie you make a tender to me of your aſſiſtance, I will not be ſo ingratefull as to refuſe you the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you deſire. Know then, my Lord, that this Knight whoſe head you ſee divided in two pieces, was called <hi>Balard</hi> of Catabatmon, grandchild to the good King <hi>Manely,</hi> who in the time of the Emperour <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was held in the eſteem of a brave Knight; he ſome moneths ſince left his fathers houſe to be at that great battell, where the reſt of all Chriſtendome was ſet up; but falling very ſick in a Town of Macedon, he could not bring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to paſſe, his malady ſtill increaſing, there was little hope of his life, when as his Squire (the faithfulleſt that ever ſerved in that kind) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that there needed no more to cheer him up but only to ſpeak of me, aſſured him that I was upon the way to viſit him, having had advertiſement of his ſicknes: as ſoon as he heard my name, his love which yet in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his diſeaſe was ſtill the ſame, made him inſtantly rayſe himſelf up, imagining that I had been come. But not ſeeing me, he gently laid his head down again upon his pillow, and began to take a little reſt. In the mean time his Squire not intending to loſe the benefit of his invention, inſtantly diſpatched a poſt to me, knowing full well that my love was powerfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make me undertake more then a voyage of fowre daies journey; And having gives me notice of the eſtate his maſter was in, he put me in a ſtrange perplexity: for loving him to infinity, I almoſt died at the firſt news of his ſicknes: but fortifying my ſelf with a couragious reſolution, I wiped my eies, and taking a good pacing nag, I made ſuch haſte, that three daies after I was by his bed ſide, though wonderfully troubled to ſee him brought ſo low; yet did my preſence ſo work with him, that his bloud returning to all the parts of his body he began to ſhew ſome ſignes of amendment. To

what end ſhould I entertain you with longer diſcourſe of his malady? Time reſtored him to his health, and when he found himſelf able to bear Armes, he departed from thence with me, who would by no means quit him. For I leſſe valued the opinion of the world then the obligation wherein I was tied to my affection. Having travelled then twelve daies without meeting any adventure, his courage coupled with his love, made him undertake to guard this paſſage for my ſake, and to force all Knights that ſhould paſſe this way to confeſſe that I was the faireſt maiden in the world. This his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe though full of danger, paſſed with him very happily, and divers were vanquiſhed by him: but alas! Fortune forſook him this morning. For a great Knight in flaming coloured armes arrived heer; who not ſatisfied with the conditions of the combat propoſed by him, ſaid unto him. Knight, there are two ſtrong reaſons that oblige me to ſight with you; One is, the faith that I ow to my miſtriſſe much more beautifull then yours; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an oath, which I have taken never to ſpare any that are enemies to my Religion. The device which I ſee painted in your ſhield is an infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that you are a Chriſtian, and I know you have an unjuſt cauſe to maintain in affirming your Miſtriſſe to be the faireſt living; ſeeing then that you are in caſe to combat I am ready to follow your example. <hi>Balard,</hi> who wanted no courage, not enduring the arrogance of this Knight, preſently ſet hand to his ſword, and a long time made his party good; but alas! not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a cask of proof ſufficient to bear the furious and weighty blows of his adverſary, he was in the end brought into the eſtate wherein you now ſee him. Iudge now if I have not reaſon to torment my ſelf, ſince I have loſt by his death all that can be dear unto me: and do not condemn my ſorrow, which to me appears but too juſt and reaſonable. I rather ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> do commend your reſentment of ſuch a loſſe; howbeit I have no great reaſon to combat this Knight upon the quarrell, ſince it hath been fairly carried, and according to the lawes of Knighthood, but ſeeing he profeſſeth himſelf an enemy to Chriſtians, whoſe protector I am bound to be, I promiſe you to ſeek him to the worlds end for to revenge the death of <hi>Balard,</hi> and to rid this Country of ſo pernicious a Knight. Saying thus, he ſent for his arms, nor would he returne to the City, but went his way with <hi>Lidora</hi> (ſo was the Gentlewoman called) not being to be diverted from this enterpriſe for any entreaty could be made him.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17218:16"/>
from whence yet he eſcaped, rather by the permiſſion of God, then by the ſtrength and addreſſe of his ſwimming, it being the pleaſure of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he ſhould not at that time miſcarry. That afterwards he fell in love with <hi>Florelle</hi> Queen of Canabea, who died the ſame day that he left her. And that the great Giant <hi>Exceladus</hi> opened her womb to take out the child whereof ſhe was ready to be delivered, being gone nine months and above of her time; which after he had wrapped up in a virgin parchment, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with him, and in brief all the reſt that is particularized in the 97. Chapter of that Book. But for that the Hiſtory of that miraculous Infant is not as yet come to light, at leaſt only vented by an ignorant Tranſlator, I held it no loſt labour to acquaint you with what I have found in an old frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, written by <hi>Alquif</hi> (entituled, the Orientall Hiſtory of the Imperiall Houſe of Greece) which was found in Conſtantinople when it was taken by the French, in the time of <hi>Baldwin</hi> of Flanders, and afterwards brought into France by <hi>Geffrey de Ville Hardovin,</hi> Marſhall of Champaigne, who compiled the hiſtory of that expedition, the rather for that the ſequell of my diſcourſe doth not permit me to paſſe by his name and acts in ſilence. This Infant then (as you have known) was called <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> by reaſon of a little blaze, which being cut out of his mothers belly, appeared upon his breaſt, and brought up with all maner of care by that Magician Giant, who found by his art that he would be infinitely valiant, and one day do ſome great miſchief to Chriſtendome: he daily inſtructed him in the handling of his arms; and often enformed him of the honor that brave Knights had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to themſelves, to the end to render him ambitious of ſuch glory and vertue by their example. And in brief he had ſo trained up his youth, that except the hate of the name of a Chriſtian, which he had deeply engraven in his ſoul, he might boldly vaunt that he had framed a maſter piece of him. As ſoon as he perceived that he was able to beare arms, he made him a Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of the colour of flaming fire, a cask of the beſt temper in the world, and a ſhield of ſo good proof, as with that greatneſſe of courage and ability of body which he knew him endued withal, he might well believe that he was invincible.

You ſhall the refore this night watch the Arms that I will give you, and prepare your ſelf to depart to morrow for to ſeek the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the world. Be gentle and eaſily intreated to pardon, patient in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, love your Religion, and above all things take heed that converſing with Chriſtians do not one day make you of another faith.

This yong Prince, who had naturally a diſpoſition to goodnes, with a courage no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to his father, promiſed the Giant with care to remember his inſtructions, watcht his Arms, was the next morning Knighted by the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and loth to loſe time mounted on a horſ, that had not many fellows on the earth, and departed the ſame day under the protection of his Gods.

the end therof he entred into a great plain, where under certain trees he ſaw an old man ſitting; who riſing up with incredible nimblenes thus ſaluted him: Gentle Prince, I have ever ſince morning waited heer for you, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto you a ſecret that much imports you: You beleeve that <hi>Enceladus</hi> is your father, becauſe he hath hitherto had the education of you; but from hencefoorth be not any more of that opinion; for you are ſonne to one of the braveſt and greateſt Princes in the World, and whom you ſhall never know but with an extream hazard of your life. For the reſt, remember the good counſell your foſter Father gave you; I mean, be liberall, curteous, patient in adverſity, eaſily intreated to forgive, and ready to relieve thoſe that are diſtreſſed: But do not follow his advice of never being an enemy to the Religion which you now profeſſe. The time ſhall come wherin you ſhall feel ſo much delight in another that is better and more conducing to your happines then this is, that you will quickly find how much my counſel is more profitable for you then his. You are amazed to hear me talk to you in this maner, and it may be will make little account of what I ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know me not; but you will one day ſee how much my meeting with you at this time did concern you. Follow now the way you are in, ſince the deſtinies have put you into it, and be aſſured that in the greateſt danger I will not be far from you, as well for your own merit, as for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which Iow to the vertue of your Father. This ſaid, he vaniſhed out of his ſight, leaving our new Knight much aſtoniſhed at that he had ſeen, and extreamly pleaſed to underſtand that his parents were of ſuch eminent quality, although as yet he knew them not. Going on then very joyfully, he intertained his thoughts with infinite deſigns, when as he heard a great claſhing of arms in a forreſt that was not far from him: wherupon clapping ſpurs to his horſ, he entred the wood, where at firſt he ſpied a Coach wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were two Ladies wofully weeping; and a little beſide them three fearful Giants amongſt fifteen or twenty Knights, who (as was eaſie to be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured) diſputed with them the liberty of thoſe women: <hi>Fulgoran</hi> having a while beheld them, and ſeeing that as often as the Giants Curtelaxes light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any of them, ſome of thoſe Knights fell dead to the earth, couched his launce with ſo good both addreſſe and fortune againſt one of them, that having pierced him clean through, he laid him dead in the duſt. This happy blow, the firſt eſſay of his chivalry, having added to his courage, he ſet hand to his ſword which he emploied ſo gallantly, that he ſtaid the fury of the ſecond, leaving the third in the midſt of fowrteen Knights, who did extreamly trouble him. But he was therwith ſo enraged, that as many as he fully lighted upon, he laid on the graſſe: ſo that having diſpatched eight of them, all the reſt betook them to their heels ſaving one, who being richly armed, and obſtinately purſuing his revenge, received ſo furious a blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his helmet, that he fell from his horſ voiding bloud at his noſe and ears: That ſo cruell a blow having extreamly affrighted the women, who were before ſomwhat cheered upon the comming in of the burning Knight, made them ſhrike out ſo lowd that <hi>Fulgoran</hi> hearing it, gave his oppoſit ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thruſt, as having run him clean through the body, he laid him on the ground in the ſame eſtate his companion was in. Turning him then about, he perceived that he which ſurvived, was going to unbuckle the Knights helmet whom he had overthrown, which was the cauſe of the womens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations: this put him in ſuch choler, as inſtantly running to him, and not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17218:17"/>
giving him leiſure to riſe (for he had one knee upon the ground) he ſtrook him ſo juſt on the neck, that he laid his head at his feet. This execution done, he drew to the Ladies, and began to comfort them, telling them that their enemies being dead, they had now no more cauſe to fear: But one of them who appeared beautifull in perfection, although her ſorrow and tears hindred in ſome ſort the diſcerning of her excellencies, interrupted him, ſaying: Good Knight, the time doth not now give me leave to render you condign thanks for this happy relief you have given us, for the fear I am in leſt the King my Lord be dead, doth ſo tranſport me as I ſcarce know what I ſpeak: Continue if you pleaſe, your aſſiſting me, and help me preſently to alight, that if there be any remainder of life in him, I may preſerve it with ſuch help as in this neceſſity I may give him. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> who was naturally very curteous, took her inſtantly in his arms, out of the chariot, and led her to him whom the laſt Giant would have killed; and pulling off his helmet, he uſed ſuch means to him, as he brought him to himſelf again, being much amazed to find himſelf in that eſtate. <hi>Clairangia</hi> (for ſo was that beautifull Princeſſe called) ſeeing her husband breathe, recovered ſomwhat both her colour and courage: ſo that perceiving a yong Squire whom the Giant had bound behind the chariot, ſhe preſently cauſed him to be freed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him with all diligence to ſeek out thoſe Knights, who by flying had ſought their ſafety, and will them to return unto her. In the mean time <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goran</hi> held the King in his arms, perſwading him not to be diſmaid with his wounds, which would eaſily be cured. The Squire having gladly underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this charge, immediatly ran into the wood, but meeting them returning with a reſolution to loſe themſelves with their maſter, ſince he would not ſave himſelf with them, he ſtaid his pace, and having informed them of the iſſue of the buſineſſe, he brought them to the King, where full of ſhame for the cowardiſe they had ſhewed, they began to frame an arm litter, in which they took up <hi>Dardan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

knowing that his brothers were our neighbours, and exceedingly redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the provinces thereabout, we very much feared that a refuſall would ſo enrage them, as they would make a war upon us, and ſo peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſpoſſeſſe us of the eſtate of Romerie. And indeed we could by no means have avoided that misfortune without your aid, conſidering the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wherin you met with us: for <hi>Bracandor</hi> my ſiſters amoroſo not able longer to endure the violence of his deſire, one day took the boldneſſe to move the King therein after this faſhion: Sir, you are not ignorant of my deſcent, and you alſo know (for you have been a witnes of my valour) that I am able to purchaſe Principalities to my ſelf, and when I pleaſe can ſet a roiall Crown upon my head. I will not therfore fear to diſcover my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto you, wherof I make no doubt but you have had ſome conjecture already: I have long loved your ſiſter <hi>Alixea,</hi> and gladly would I be ſo far obliged to your favour as to be pleaſed with my alliance, which will not be of mean importance to you. For the conſideration of my ſelf and my brothers, will make you to be ſo redoubted, that all your neighbours will tremble at the very rumour of your arms, and from my ſelf you ſhall ſtill receive ſo many and ſo agreeable ſervices, that you ſhall never have cauſe to repent of affording me that honour. This diſcourſe did extreamly perplex <hi>Dardanor;</hi> for the bad conditions of this Giant made us ſo to loath him as we reſolved to run any hazard rather then yield my ſiſter unto him, whom by no means ſhe could affect: howbeit not to make him utterly deſpair, he anſwered him, that being a King who deſired to do nothing but that which was good and juſt, he could not abſolutely determine of a matter of ſuch conſequence, without the conſent of my ſiſter, and his people: and that therfore he would firſt propound the buſines to the Counſell of his Eſtates: and that in the mean time it would be fit for him to go and communicate the matter with his brothers, to the end he might not render them his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by neglecting their authority. <hi>Bracandor</hi> being heerby perſwaded that all went according to his deſire, was eaſily carried to take his leave of us, nothing dreaming of the Kings ſecret intentions, who not to loſe time did preſently after his departure ſend foorth commiſſions for the raiſing of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, fortified his ports and frontier Towns; and with all diligence prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf for a war.

Some of our ſervants that had eſcaped from the fury of their ſwords, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven notice of our misfortune to the King, he preſently drew together as many of his Knights as poſſibly he might, and following us with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he overtook us to his certain ruine, without the happy aſſiſtance which you, Sir, ſo luckily brought him. See heer, my Lord, the true narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our diſaſter, which I conclude with a proteſtation, that I ſhall never be ſparing of any thing in my power whatſoever your ſervice ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in, ſince you have hazarded your life ſo nobly for my preſervation. While <hi>Clairangia</hi> was thus diſcourſing to him, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> who never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſuch beauty before, obſerved her with a ſtrange and unuſuall motion, and in his heart ſaid thus to himſelf. Good gods, how bleſſed a man is <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danor</hi> to be poſſeſt of a creature ſo full of perfections? and how much to my prejudice am I to fear the incountring and ſeeing of her at this time? I cannot chuſe but love her, though ſhe be dedicated to the contentment of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and ſpite of my teeth I muſt yeeld to the impulſions of that proud deity which triumphs over all men. Mighty Love, do not, I beſeech thee, refuſe me thy aid; and ſince it is thy pleaſure to be acknowledged by me, grant that the heart of this Lady may prove as pliant, as the glances of her eies are pleaſing; I will then with a liberall hand preſent ſacrifice to thy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and proclaim to all the world that thou art of more power then all the gods that we adore. On the other ſide <hi>Clairangia</hi> finding him wonderfully agreeable to her, did inſenſibly paſſe from a due acknowledgement of his aſſiſtance, to an heigth of liking him, being unable with all her modeſty to keep her ſelf from dearly loving him, and wiſhing that ſhe might in that manes poſſeſſe him, as ſhe might one day receive the contentments which Love doth give us in the fruition of our deſires. Nevertheleſſe not being willing to leave a bad impreſſion in him of her weakneſſe, ſhe concealed her mind, and kept him well enough from diſcerning her affection. Thus ſhortning the length of the way, with the ſweet entertainment of their thoughts, they arrived at a village, where the King had a mind to reſt, and cauſe his wounds to be carefully looked unto. But having intelligence that ſome kinſmen of the Giants had a deſign to ſurprize him in that place, and ſo to be revenged on him, he preſently diſlodged, being much troubled, that he had no more of his people about him to aſſiſt him, if the enemy ſhould charge him: but he was quickly freed of that care, by the comming in of the Knights that he had left in the forreſt, who incountred him on the way an howr after: much rejoicing to find him alive, whom they had given for dead, as ſoon as they heard he was gone to ſet upon the Giants. When he ſaw them he commanded his tent to be pitched, that he might repoſe himſelf being then out of all fear of danger, ſince he had in his company the burning Knight, to whom he did all the honour that poſſibly he could deviſe. The night paſt ſweetly away with every one, but theſe two hearts ſo lately wounded: for fixing their imaginations, ſhe upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what ſhe ought to her honour; he upon the fear of not being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with favour, and the danger that his enterpriſe might draw upon him, they were both of them kept waking till day, amidſt the perplexity of a world of thoughts: but if they were tormented that night, the next was ſo them much more full of torture. For their converſing familiarly together
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17218:19"/>
all that day, having added no little fuell to their fire, made them feel their deſires much more violent, and ſo rendred their pains more inſupportable. Shamefaſtneſſe ſealed up the lips of <hi>Clairangia,</hi> and a due reſpect brideled <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> but remembring that lovers are commonly fortunate, when they are adventrous, he deſired to trie whether boldneſſe would acquire him that, which his faintneſſe had not hitherto permitted him to ask. Wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on calling for pen and inck he wrot theſe lines to diſcover his love unto her, not being confident enough to do it by word of mouth.</p>

                     <p>This Letter being by the means of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> the truſty ſecretary of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateſt thoughts, cunningly conveied into <hi>Clairangiaes</hi> hands, was read with ſome perturbation; but unreſolved as yet to declare her ſelf, ſhe returned no anſwer unto it, leaving the burning Knight in ſuch diſquiet, as his humor before ſo pleaſing and ſociable, became altogether untractable: he was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeen in the Court, little in his chamber, but commonly in the woods and unfrequented places, where he entertained himſelf with the ſad conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his miſerable eſtate; in which being denied the happineſſe of knowing his parents, he was now alſo refuſed the enjoying the firſt thing that ever he had loved. Unfortunate Knight, ſaid he, what doſt thou now dream of, or what canſt thou think of that gives thee not occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? Thou canſt not be happy, only becauſe thou art not worthy of ſo much glory. Retire then in time, and rather blame thy boldneſſe, then the cruelty of thy Miſtris: ſhe is not guilty of thy miſery, it is thy deſtiny that thou muſt accuſe for it. But alas! what counſell is this thou harkneſt unto? Is it likely that thou canſt leave her, and love her ſo dearly? Thou muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, or vanquiſh this hard heart of hers: women do not ſo eaſily yield themſelves; they will be entreated, and do often times feign themſelves cruell, to trie our conſtancy. If thou ſhouldſt poſſeſſe her without pain, her careſſes would not be ſo ſweet, nor thy contentment ſo compleat. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt not be weary of ſerving her, ſince the recompence well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thy labour. This Knight thus loſing himſelf in his meditations made all the Court to wonder at this change of his. The King was much troubled with it, as admiring his vertue, but <hi>Clairangia</hi> much more. For knowing that ſhe only was the cauſe therof, ſhe participated with him in her grief

and ſuffering, which much amazed <hi>Sileſia,</hi> who not approoving this reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſſe of hers, did one day thus ſpeak to her: I wonder at you, Madam, and cannot imagine why you afflict your ſelf in this maner, when you may live contented. You love <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> he adores you; and you have often told me, that you would not be ingratefull to the good offices he hath done you. His valour, beauty, love, and the infinite reſpect that he ſerves you withall, fill you full of deſire; why then do you not ſeek for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof? and to what end is this modeſty, ſeeing it is ſo troubleſome unto you? Madam, it is not well done, you tyrannize your life to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; occaſions are to be laid hold on when they preſent themſelves. This Knight hath too many perfections to be deſpiſed: open your arms to him, ſince he offers himſelf to you; and as he hath not been ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah! how dangerous it is to meet with one that will puſh us on when we have our foot upon the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice:

This advertiſement made him to change his countenance, as the fear of being ill uſed had altered his humour, he became more jolly then he had been in a good while before, and at laſt went to bed with leſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe then before.</p>

the other ſide went with no leſſe contentment thinking on the careſſes ſhe was to receive from a lover of ſuch perfections. But her joy was quickly turned into ſorrow: for ſhe eſpied a Giant comming out of the wood of a goodly proportion, and not of any monſtrous greatneſſe, but every way ſo handſome, that notwithſtanding the trouble ſhe was in by the appearance of ſuch an object, yet took ſhe ſome pleaſure in beholding his gallant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; howbeit conſidering that ſuch kind of perſons are for the moſt part cruell and uncurteous, ſhe began to ſay: O ye Gods! how much I doubt the meeting with this great Knight? and I am much afraid that the death of our enemies will be revenged by this incounter.

Wherfore, ſaid ſhe to her attendants, prepare your ſelves to fight, and ſhew in what eſteem you hold my ſafety. Reward ſhall wait on the valiant, and puniſhment on thoſe that are cowards, and that prefer their lives before their honors. At theſe words every one made him ready to do his duty; but the Giant making no account of this troop, firſt of all addreſt himſelf to the Coachman, whoſe brains he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knockt out with a blow of his armed fiſt; then drawing out his Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar the firſt that preſented himſelf to him had his head cloven in ſunder: after that falling in amongſt the reſt, he dealt his blows in ſuch maner, as from one he cut off an head, from another an arm, cleft a third down to the middle, ſo that within leſſe then half an howr he had laid fowrteen at his feet; and amongſt them the Count of Clina ſo far from himſelf, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not that he was in the world.

                        </gap>reſſing himſelf to the Conquerour, who was going to play the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and had the whip already in his hand, he ſaid: Do not think, Knight, that a treaſure of ſuch value as you think to have, is to be purchaſed with ſo little labour: you have in your opinion, made it yours by the ſlaughter of theſe men, the defeature of whom can give you no true glory; but if you mean to poſſeſſe it without doubt of a competitor, it is my death that muſt give you aſſurance: therfore you muſt reſolve to fight for it with me, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging your ſelf unworthy of ſuch a happineſſe, give over any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claim to it, and ſuffer me to carry it whither I pleaſe. The advantage you have, anſwered he, of a ſecond, makes you ſpeak with ſo much arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; for if you were alone, you would rather think of defending your ſelf, then offer to brave a man of my faſhion: howſoever do not perſwade your ſelf that I will ſo eaſily yield you the fruit of my labours, neither hope to be the conducter of theſe Ladies, to whom I have ſo juſt a title; for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to make way to you for it, but upon very ſtrict conditions. At theſe words enraged like two Bulls that were ready to fight for an heyfer, they at one inſtant diſcharged two ſuch heavy blows each upon the other, as they both ſtaggered ready to fall, had not the ſhame of being overcome in the preſence of her whom they loved tranſported them. This beginning but incenſing them the more, they laid upon one another with ſuch fury, as by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17218:20"/>
the noiſe they made, one would have thought there had been fifty Knight together by the ears. If the one gave a blow, the other was not aſleep. In In brief, they were ſo eager, that their bloud running down on every ſide, did nothing at all a bate their courage. He that came firſt not enduring to be diſputed with about a thing he had gotten, ſtruck ſo furious a blow upon his enemies ſhield, that having divided it in two the ſword deſcended upon his caſque which it entred, giving him a ſlight wound in the head: but well of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was as well returned, he being paid at the ſame inſtant with ſo rude a thruſt that pierced through his armour a good way into the fleſh, which put him into ſuch a rage, as grinding his teeth, he took his Cymitar in both his hands, and gave his enemy ſo horrible a blow upon the head, that without doubt he had determined the combat if he had made it home. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it ſerved not only to give him a ſlaſh in the face, but the point paſſing on with an incredible violence opened his cuirace and wounded him dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in his breaſt. This blow ſomwhat amazing the other, who yet had not drawn his ſword, but was with the Ladies, intreating them not to be troubled with their meeting them, cauſed him to lay hand on his Curtelax, wherwith very rudely he intertained his enemy; who little caring for this aſſiſtance, redoubled his ſtrokes with more fury then before. In the mean time <hi>Clairangia</hi> was more liker a dead then a living woman; for well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that which ſide ſoever fortune ſhould favour, her danger was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, ſhe afflicted her ſelf in ſuch extremity as would have moved any the moſt inſenſible heart to have pitied her, but her ſorrow laſted not long; for a while after ſhe perceived the brave Knight ardant come galloping in, who ſeeing ſo many dead bodies ſcattered on the ground, his Lady all drenched in tears, and ſtretching out her hands as imploring his aid, he became ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that drawing forth his ſword he let it fall with ſuch force upon the head of the laſt Giant that he clove him to the teeth overthrowing him dead to the earth. This brave blow having reinforced his courage, he made ſo ſmart a thruſt at the breaſt of his companion, as meeting juſt with the wound which the firſt Giant had given him there, the point of his ſword came out at his back, together with his life and that little bloud he had leſt: howbeit not contented to ſee himſelf delivered from thoſe two, he turned him to the firſt comer for to ſerve him with the ſame ſawce; but he retiring a little back ſaid unto him: I cannot worthy Knight, with reaſon imploy my arms againſt you; for having given me my life which was undoubtedly far engaged by the force of theſe two Knights whom you have ſlain, it were baſe in me to defend it againſt you, and in you a cruelty to deprive me of it, after you have ſo generouſly preſerved it: if you have any intereſt in this fair Lady I will no longer pretend to any part in her, but will reſt conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Heerupon with open arms they embraced one another, to the infinit ſatisfaction of the Queen, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this buſineſſe ended according to her wiſh, and contrary to the fear ſhe was in about the iſſue therof, knew not well how to look. See, ſaid ſhe to her Knight, who came to kiſſe her hands after his victory, and to preſent the Giant to her; See, my Lord, how I am doubly engaged to you for my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Count being thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered, for he had no wound upon him, they began to ſet on towards Celibana, where they quickly arrived with much contentment. The news of the Queens misfortune being carried to <hi>Dardanor,</hi> the Courtiers were all up in arms, and every one was ready to get to horſe for to ſuccor her, when word was brought to the King, that ſhe was freed by the valour of the Knight ardant, who entertaining himſelf in his melancholy fancies not far from the way which the Queen went, had heard the noiſe of arms, and came in juſt as the combat of the three Giants was in the higheſt fury: two of the which paſſed by the edge of his ſword, the third becomming his friend for the aſſiſtance he had given him. This ſecond advertiſement much more welcome then the former, having quieted <hi>Dardanors</hi> mind, he ſent his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and Chyrurgians to Celibana to look to thoſe which were wounded. In the mean time our Lovers began to careſſe one another; for <hi>Clairangia</hi> no longer able to hinder the felicity of the Knight ardant, whom ſhe thoght worthy of her love, aſſoon as he was unarmed thus amorouſly ſaid unto him: I ſhould be ungratefull indeed, if I ſhould not anſwer your affection or now refuſe you a recompenſe for thoſe good ſervices you have rendred me, your valour doth inforce me aſwell as it doth Knights that incounter you; and I am conſtrained to confeſſe that you deſerve my favours, I will therefore confer them on you, ſo as you do manage them with diſcretion, and will delay your delight no longer then the evening. You ſhall follow <hi>Sileſia</hi> when time ſerves, but take heed you loſe not your ſelf in the exceſſe of your joy, nor let your actions teſtifie the content of your heart. O ye Gods! ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> rapt into a heaven of bliſſe, how pleaſing is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to me, and what cauſe have I to eſteem my ſelf the happieſt man on the earth? Not all the gods, Madam, ſhalbe able to attain to this glory of mine, and I may well ſay that all my travels are fully rewarded with theſe words alone: you aſſure me unexpreſſable felicities, and ſuch as queſtionles might eaſily tranſport me from my ſelf (for no mortall man can receive them without paſſion.) But Madam, I will carry my ſelf (ſinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

me to do ſo) with ſuch prudence as you ſhall never repent your ſo infinitely obliging of me. But alas! I fear that the time may change, and pardon me. If I ſay that I doubt that I am not fortunate enough to merit ſo much grace. This is, anſwered ſhe, to afflict your ſelf without cauſe: Doubt not, my Knight, that I will fail of my word, ſince I am to have a ſhare in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you hope for; but that we may begin our love with diſcretion, I would not have you tarry heer any longer, for fear of giving ſuſpition to any. There is the Earl of Clina, hold good correſpondence with him if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for he is a man of whom I ſtand in doubt, and that queſtionleſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our actions. Theſe words making <hi>Fulgoran</hi> to withdraw, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, not now any more to paſſe his time among the trees with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating upon the cauſe of his diſcontent, but to meditate with the leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion upon the good fortune that was promiſed him. Having ſpent ſome hours in this entertainment the night approached, which he with ſo much impatience had expected, to render him contented: For <hi>Sileſia</hi> whom the Queen had fully informed of her intentions, came to him, and having lead him to certain trees that made a delicate arbour, willed him not to ſtir from thence till ſhe returned to him. His impatience making him think the time long, he accuſed his Miſtris of ſloth, and would willingly have gone to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten her, but fearing to offend with much ado he refrained, and ſtaid till at laſt he ſaw the Queen appear, having nothing but a looſe white ſattin gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on, and ſo gentle a night dreſſing on her head, as would have forced the dulleſt ſoul in the world to have loved her. Raviſhed then with delight he went and fell on his knees before hir, kiſſing her hands a thouſand times: But ſhe that could not endure to ſee him in that poſture, joined her lips to his with ſuch ardency, as did well teſtifie that ſhe was no leſſe preſſed with her deſires then he. Theſe firſt careſſes ſerving only to waken their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, they ſate down upon the graſſe, where <hi>Fulgoran</hi> immediatly took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his deſired bliſſe, with ſo much ſweet dalliance, as the Reader muſt not wonder if I do not take upon me to deſcribe the pleaſure thereof, ſince all the words in the world are not ſufficient to expreſſe it. Having thus paſt the greater part of the night with all the content that may be wiſhed for in this world, they withdrew themſelves with a promiſe to meet there eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, which accordingly they performed with much ſecrecie; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their delights had been of longer continuance, if <hi>Fulgoran</hi> had well obſerved the advice his Miſtris gave him. But with this good fortune his humour changed, he was no longer melancholy, he was not to be found in the woods, he frequented not the fields, he was more curious in his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell then he was wont to be; If he ſpake it was alwaies in the defenſe of the beauty of Ladies; briefly in his eies was to be read the tranquility of his mind, and all his actions being full of jollity, made men judge that joy was more predominant in his heart then fadnes, ſo that every man wondered at this ſtrange alteration in him. The Count of Clina obſerving him more narrowly then the reſt, becauſe he had a particular deſign upon him, ſoon diſcovered the ſecret, and was confident (ſeeing the Queen ſo often to eye him) that the metamorphoſis proceeded from ſome ſpeciall familiarity that was between them, which made him infinitely diſcontented. For being ſomewhat in love with the Queen, wherof nevertheles he never durſt make any ſhew, it madded him to ſee another more happy then himſelf.

I am, ſaid he, all tranſported with choler, ſlighted for a ſtranger, and my boldnes in diſcovering my ſelf is threatned with puniſhment; but I will make it appear that I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of affronts. The Queen abuſing the eaſines of the King, doth give her ſelf over to the Knight ardant, and refuſing to let me ſhare in her careſſes gives me juſt cauſe to reſent it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this ſecret.

I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe theſe adulterers, and putting them in the Kings hand will not give this Knight leiſure who truſts in his valor, to make uſe of his courage, his arms; for the Law doth not allow any man the combat in his own quarrell. And if the remembrance which the King owes to his precedent ſervices, or the reſpect of the Queen, do draw him to diſpenſe with the Law and permit him to combat himſelf, I will confront him with the redoubtable brothers of the two Giants that he laſt ſlew, who will be right glad to meet ſuch an occaſion to be revenged of their enemy. They are three, and able alone to defeat a whole army; I do therefore perſwade my ſelf that he will not ſtand long before them, what companion ſoever he gets to aſſiſt him.

Thus was all in diſorder, except our lovers, who lived ſo contented amidſt their ordinary delights, and not imagining they were ſubject to fortunes power, did ſtudy nothing but how to careſſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the infinit vexation of the Count of Clina, who tore his hair for deſpite, but his pain was of no long continuance: For ſeeing in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the King had ſent him what means he had to be revenged, his grief was turned into joy: nevertheleſſe not intending to diſcover his thoughts he kept the ſame countenance as before, till his ſuccour were arrived. This while <hi>Clairangia</hi> who dreamt not of the miſchief that was to fall upon her head, having not forgotten the place where ſhe met with ſuch delight, was lying upon the graſſe with <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> ſtriving to make her careſſes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him with a world of dalliance, when as all on a ſudden ſhe heard a great noiſe of arms in the Caſtle. Sin ordinarily makes the guilty fearfull, and we often ſee that fear doth diſcover a bad deſign. The Queen gueſſing at the cauſe of all this hurly-burly inſtantly aroſe, and ſhewing the Knight Ardant a place of the wall commodious for him to get out, ſhe beſought him to ſave himſelf rather then to loſe his life out of too much courage. Dear friend, ſaid ſhe to him, you may much better relieve me, having the liberty of the fields then fettred in irons void of all power to make uſe of your valour againſt our enemies. Time preſſeth us, and forbids us any long diſcourſe: wherefore I will take my leave of you with this kiſſe, then joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her lips to his, ſhe ſpeedily retired by a ſecret pair of ſtairs up to her chamber; where ſhe found <hi>Sileſia</hi> neerer dead then alive, with the affright of hearing the Count bouncing at the door and threatning to break it open. The eſcape of the Knight Ardant having rendred the Queen ſomwhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, ſhe freely opened the door: and ſeeing the Count come in attended by a number of ſoldiers, ſhe ſaid to him with a countenance that teſtified her diſpleaſure: What is it (diſloiall as thou art) that thou intendſt to do, and what means ſo many men at arms at this unſeaſonable howr when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould be at reſt? If you had, Madam, replied he with a like confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, continued ſtill in your virtue, I ſhould be bound to render you an account of my actions, but that now being wanting in you, I will not tell you the reaſon why in the Kings name I areſt you as his priſoner, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that your offence tels you what is the cauſe therof.

I will go to priſon then, ſince it muſt be ſo, but remember that chaſtiſement alwaies followes the offence, and that thy crime will not remain unpuniſhed. Saying ſo, ſhe was going out to take her Coach, when as ſhe eſpied the Knight Ardants Squire in the cuſtody of thirty or forty ſouldiers, who intreated him with ſuch indignity, as ſhe could not forbear ſaying to the Count: Baſe man, Is this poor gentleman alſo guilty with me? Oh heavens! what injuſtice is this? and how is it that you do not puniſh ſuch enorm iniquities? I would, replide the Count without being any whit abaſhed, that his maſter were in his room, we would make him know that ſtrangers cannot defile a Princes bed without danger; but perhaps he may fall into our fingers heereafter. Yes, ſaid <hi>Clairangia,</hi> or els thou into his: but I will not wiſh thee that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for thou deſerveſt no better an executioner then a hangman. With that theſe ſpeeches ſerving but to put the Count into further choler, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thruſt her into the Coach, with <hi>Sileſia,</hi> the Squire, and the Knight Ardants arms, and ſo took his way to the Court, not a little vexed that he carried not with him the principall piece of his buſines. The Giant <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimore</hi> who was become <hi>Fulgorans</hi> true friend, did not approve of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and had it not been that he was not as yet thorowly recovered of his wounds, ſo as he was not able to wear his arms, he would never have ſuffered the Queen to be entreated with ſo much cruelty: but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with patience to expect the iſſue of this affair, reſolved neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, either to loſe his life, or to defend the Knight Ardants right, who on the other ſide was no leſſe troubled.

What, ſaid he all inraged, and looking toward the town whither they were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his miſtris, is it poſſible that I ſhould leave my Lady unrelieved? and can I be ſatisfied with ſhedding of tears in ſtead of ſpending my bloud for her ſervice? It is not poſſible that I ſhould be ſo baſe? My love is the cauſe of her misfortune: my reſenting it muſt alſo be the cauſe of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: I have a ſword yet left me, that is enough, for courage cannot be wanting to me in this occaſion: I will break through theſe armed troops that convoy her, and make it appear that I am more ſenſible of her miſery, then of her affection. Therewith he laid hand on his ſword and began to follow the Count and his company, when as he heard the voice of one that called to him, that made him preſently at a ſtand, imagining that perhaps it might be his Lady, who being unwilling to fall into the Kings hands, had made an eſcape as he had done, and was come to ſeek him determining to run one and the ſame fortune with him: but he continued not long in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for though it were night and dark he might yet diſcern a maid, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaluted him, ſaid: Good Knight, I come to divert you from your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to tell you that it is no leſſe glory for a man to do all things with prudence, then to encounter his enemies with courage: you are in the way to an inevitable ruine, and of making your Lady culpable in your death: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould alwaies predominate in us, and to her ſhould our paſſions ever ſubmit: Take this way into the wood, where you ſhall find a Cave, out of

With that ſhe took him gently by the hand and led him through the Garden, where a thouſand ſorts of delicate flowrs divided a great number of quarters, into ſo ſtately an hall, that he was even loſt with the admiration of it. For beſides the limming of gold and azure, the walls were adorned about with threeſcore marble ſtatues of Knights, which holding up one of their hands ſupported a throne of chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, wherupon <hi>Cupid</hi> was ſeated in ſtate, as it were thereby demonſtrating that he had triumphed over al thoſe the moſt valiant Knights of the World. Being areſted a while with the conſideration heerof, he went out of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another room, which ſeemed no leſſe glorious to him then the former, where immediatly ſix other damſels ſerved a great deal of excellent meat to the Table: but me thinks it is fit to leave him a while amongſt theſe delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, from whence we ſhall bring him in convenient time, to relate unto you the lamentations which in the mean ſpace the beautifull Queen of Romerie made. This Princeſſe being conducted to the City in all rigorous maner, was yet ſtill in hope to mollifie the King by her tears, and to make him loſe the bad conceit he had of her; but her hope was in vain, for <hi>Dardanor</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſenſible of his diſgrace, refuſed to ſee her, and having committed her to priſon determined without further delay to put her to death, ſeeking no better proofs againſt her then the Count of Clina's information, and the flight of <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> had not the Lords of his Kingdome oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this injuſtice of his. The Law, Sir, ſaid one of his ancienſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailor, doth indeed adjudge the Adulterer to death, but yet commands us to proceed upon better evidence then bare opinion; who doth aſſure us of the Queens offence, beſides the words of the Count of Clina? and who can truly ſwear that this is not a treachery in him? <hi>Sileſia</hi> maintains that ſhe is innocent, and no body preſents himſelf as her accuſer but only one man, who is not to be relied upon in this caſe; why then ſhould we be more led by his motion then by Law and Cuſtome? Sir, there is no likely hood of it, (pardon me if the conſideration of right makes me ſpeak in this maner) and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17218:24"/>
the conjecture which you frame upon the flight of the Knight Ardant, is not forcible enough to prove her guilty; He was not found in the Caſtle, that is rather a ſign of my miſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I, but he preſents not himſelf: it is true, and in my judgement he hath reaſon; For being a ſtranger, and not expecting to be ſupported in his right, ſince you have failed him after he had ſo infinitely obliged you, he hath withdrawn himſelf, knowing how dangerous it is to fall into the hands of an incenſed Prince. Sir, you have my opinion freely delivered to you: the place that I hold by your Majeſties command, gives me that liberty. And ſince there is queſtion of your quiet, and my conſcience, I ſay, that your Majeſty ought not to refuſe the Queen the benefit of the Law, which is, that a woman accuſed may juſtifie her ſelf by the arms of a Champion. This liberty then ſhe hath if her accuſers appear. I am heer ſaid then the Count of Clina, ready to accept of this condition, and to enter the combat with three ſeconds againſt an equall number: for being certain of the thing I ſhall never fear that the victory ſhould not be of my ſide. Heerupon the King ſeeing that the moſt apparant of the kingdome were of his opinion, and that the Count of Clina accepted of the combat, he Decreed, That he ſhould accompanied with three gentlemen, within fifteen daies maintain his accuſation; And that the Queen ſhould within the ſame tearm, preſent the like number, upon pain of being held culpable and liable to puniſhment. Matters thus ordered every one withdrew: The Count of Clina to ſend for his Giants, and <hi>Sileſia</hi> who was enlarged, to enquire and ſearch for the Knight Atdant.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Count of Clina highly pleaſed for that the combat was granted him as he deſired, diſpatched preſently a ſervant of his to <hi>Bracandors</hi> kinſemen, advertiſing them of the conditions of the combat, and what day they were to be in the City for the finiſhing of their enterpriſe; being ſo confident of the victory, as he made no doubt of being revenged to the full, ſince <hi>Fulgoran</hi> appeared not, to take upon him the defence of his own honour and his Ladies; who amidſt the grief to ſee herſelf in captivity had no other recourſe but to her tears; howbeit judging it fit to give them over for to think of ſome means for her delivery, ſhe diſpatched away <hi>Sileſia</hi> with a command to ſeek the Knight Ardant where ever he were, and to acquaint him with the reſolution that was taken concerning this combat, but all her labour was in vain: for having emploied two daies in that ſearch without any news of him, ſhe was ready to make her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, determining rather to die ſo then to return to her miſtris with ſo little

ſatisfaction. Great Gods, ſaid ſhe lifting up her hands, can you ſuffer ſo beautifull a Queen to be loſt for want of ſuccour? and what may be heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after expected from any man, when the Knight Ardant not only fails of his promiſe, but is alſo wanting both to the life of his Lady, and his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Is this the recompenſe of all her love? and how can he excuſe ſo great a baſenes? If he have not feared the hazard of his life for the relief of privat perſons, why doth he now refuſe to employ his valour for a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſo neerly concerns him? Truly I know not what to ſay, and am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly amazed to ſee him thus abandon us without any ſenſe of that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which lately was ſo violent in him. But alas! it may be he is not ſtill in this country, and ſo is ignorant of the reſolution is taken concerning this affair: wherfore I may blame him wrongfully: and yet not ſo, but I have juſt cauſe; for the fear of all the tortures in the world ſhould not have made him quit this kingdome before he knew whether his preſence heer were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or no. He is guilty, and my complaint of him not unjuſt: but what ſhall I ſay to this afflicted Princeſſe? Shall I carry her the certain news of her ruine, by the default of her Knight? Or ſhall I perſwade her to ſave her life by yeelding to the deſires of this Traitor that accuſeth her? Neither of them, for ſo ſhould I be either guilty of her crimes, or of her puniſhment, and be the deſtruction both of her honour and her life: die I muſt then, (for without her I deſire no happineſſe in this world) and declare by a generous reſolution that I loved her more in my death then whileſt I lived. Die then <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and let the ſacrifice of thy bloud appeaſe the Gods, and make them look upon thy miſtris with an eie of pity. With that ſhe took a little knife that hung at her girdle, with a purpoſe to ſheath it in her boſome, when as on the ſudden ſhe eſpied hard by her a maid, that thus ſpake unto her: Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, do not perſiſt in this furious deſign which you are about to execute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelf: The Gods would rather be highly diſpleaſed with the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your bloud, then any way reconciled to your deſires by ſuch a heady violence. They are to be humbly intreated and not provoked by our deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. Leave then this courſe which would be to no purpoſe, and ere long you ſhall meet with a Knight that will be of much uſe to you in your buſineſſe. He is full of curteſie, and will not refuſe to be a ſecond therein; touching the reſt never trouble your ſelf, for the firſt being found, a third will appear in ſo due time as theſe tears will be converted into joy. This ſaid, ſhe ſo ſuddenly left her, as <hi>Sileſia</hi> had not leiſure to reply, being very much grieved that ſhe underſtood not the meaning of her ſpeech; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe taking a little better heart upon her promiſe, ſhe forgot the nymphs advice, but went into the thickeſt of the wood, where ſhe had not gone far before ſhe found a yong Knight ſleeping under the ſhadow of certain trees: He was ſo lovely, and ſeemed ſo handſome aſleep, as ſhe could not chuſe but behold him with paſſion. Oh heavens! ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, how liberall hath nature ſhewed her ſelf to this Knight, if he be as brave and valiant as the nymph would make me believe, I do not think that any one in the world can match him, except it be <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who is nothing behind him in thoſe perfections which I obſerve in him? and me thinks he looks very like him; or if there be any difference, it is that our Knight is ſomewhat fairer, and hath a more majeſticall aſpect.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17218:25"/>
my deſire, the buſineſſe about which I am ſent doth preſſe me unto it, and doth not permit me to trifle out the time in this maner. I muſt then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him to procure mine own quiet, but it muſt be done in ſuch ſort as I may not be taxed of incivility. Wherupon retiring a little aſide, ſhe began to lament ſo lowd, that the ſleeping Knight awaked, and not well come to himſelf, laced on his helmet, took his ſword in his hand, and drew directly to the place whither the voice called him. She that ſaw him coming in that faſhion preſently aroſe, and throwing herſelf at his feet embraced his knees without any other ſpeaking then by ſighs, which made the Knight take her up by the arm, and ſay unto her: Gentlewoman be pleaſed to riſe, and tell me if you have any occaſion to uſe me, that I may diſpoſe my ſelf to do you ſervice. For having taken arms for no other end, I ſhall hold it a glory to be emploied in drawing you out of that affliction wherin you ſeem to be at this preſent. Noble Knight, replied ſhe, the Gods reward you for this ſo generous an offer: I am indeed afflicted, and perhaps you ſhall never meet with an occaſion more worthy of your arms and valour then this, to which you have preſented your ſelf: I belong to the beautuous Queen of Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, one of the compleateſt Ladies on the earth; who, for ſlighting the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the moſt treacherous man that lives, is falſly accuſed to have forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her honour: and the King himſelf more heady then diſcreet, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged her to the fire, if ſome Knight do not undertake her defence. See heer the firſt and principall cauſe of my grief, and the next is, for that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find a Knight whom I have ſought theſe two daies; for I am aſſured that he would not fail us at our need, and that with your aſſiſtance our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would come much ſhort of their reckoning. But if we do not meet with him we ſhall not find any in the Court that will undertake the combat for the Queen: not for that they do not hold her innocent, but becauſe the report is that three horrible Giants will ſecond the traitor, who is the cauſe of all theſe miſchiefs; now if your courage be ſuteable to the beauty which I ſee in your face, you can never have a braver occaſion to gain honor in the world, nor will you let me return without hope of ſeeing my miſtris ſoon rid of the trouble. Do not believe, Gentlewoman ſaid he, that the fear of any danger can make me be wanting to the duty of a good Knight; we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave our homes, nor put on arms, but with a ſolemn oath not to forſake the innocent in their miſery. Wherefore I will not only aſſiſt you in this, where the life and honor of ſo excellent a Princeſſe is in queſtion, but in whatſoever els you will employ me: Let us then when you pleaſe make for the town, provided that we may reach it in time, I ſhall never complain of my labour. I could not, replied ſhe wiping her eies, expect an anſwer leſſe vertuous from ſo gallant a Knight. Let us go then, ſince you are pleaſed, without any further ſtay, for in truth I fear that we ſhall not get there but with the lateſt. Away then went they towards the Town, entertaining one another with pleaſing diſcourſes, to make their journey ſeem the leſſe tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In this mean time <hi>Fulgoran</hi> was in the Palace of the rock, amidſt the greateſt delights that might be; one while being entertained by the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, who recounted to him the admirable deeds of arms of the Grek Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the end he might thereby be drawn to love them: another while di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the pleaſing object of a thouſand varieties which he met with in every part. Love did not then diſquiet him, he was free in his thoughts, and the remembrance of no one thing whatſoever, was of force to bar him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17218:26"/>
from enjoying a moſt happy content. Fourteen daies being ſpent amidſt ſo much ſweetnes, that fair Lady which did firſt welcome him at his arrivall there, took him by the hand and ſaid, I could paſſionately wiſh, gentle Prince, that the Fates would permit you a perpetuall abode in this houſe, that I might not be deprived of your converſation, which is moſt agreeable to me: but you were not brought hither for my ſatisfaction, nor for to paſſe the reſt of your daies in ſolitarines; your valour is neceſſary in the world, and I ſhould be guilty of much miſchief if I ſhould retain you heer any longer: Wherfore you ſhall preſently depart, for the preſervation of that which your merit hath gotten you, I mean that beautuous Queen who feared not to hazard her life to oblige you: She is in an extream danger of death, which ſhe cannot avoid but by your aſſiſtance: Do not fail her then in this neceſſity, leſt you incur the name of ingratefull. The eſtate wherin you now are doth trouble you, I well perceive, for to enter a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat in the caſe you are now in were not agreeable to your merit. But be not diſmaid, for thoſe which brought you hither from amongſt the middeſt of your enemies, have taken a care of your affairs; behold, heer are arms, that were made for you and worthy of your valour: with that ſhe opened a little Cabinet and took out of it an azur'd armour, covered all over with golden ſtarrs, and an helmet of the ſame ſo rich and of ſo excellent a temper, as was hard to be matched. You muſt, ſaid ſhe continuing her diſcourſe, inſtantly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m your ſelf, whileſt I give order to make ready a horſe for you; with that ſhe departed, leaving the Knight Ardant as much amazed as contented: but remembring that it was no time to loiter, ſince the buſines was preſſing, he put on thoſe arms, which he found ſo light as he could hardly beleeve that they were proof enough againſt the blow of a ſword; yet unwilling to ſhew any miſtruſt of them which had entertained him with ſo much curteſie, he made an end of arming himſelf, and inſtantly came down the ſtairs: but when he thought to come into the Court, he no longer ſaw thoſe ſtately buildings, or the rock, but a very ſpacious plain. Good God! ſaid he then all aſtoniſhed, where am I now? and how in a moment comes ſo goodly a houſe to be loſt? Either I ſleep, or all that was done heer proceeded from the art of ſome perſon that loves me. Howſoever I am armed now, and therfore fear not the encounter of my enemies: then looking round about him he ſaw on of the braveſt horſes that ever he had beheld, tied at a tree not far off. This Lady, ſaid he is no liar, for the horſe is not inferior to the arms: with that he drew to him, and finding him ſadled and brideled, got up on him, took a lance that was reared againſt the tree, and rode away towards the Town. In this mean time the Giant <hi>Grandimores</hi> wounds were healed, and <hi>Clairdngia's</hi> ſorrows increaſed. For having no news either of her Knight or of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> ſhe was in utter deſpair of her life, the rather in regard that the next day was the very ſame which was deſigned her for the maintenance of her innocency; that her enemies were come, and that no Knight preſented himſelf to defend her right. Poor diſtreſſed Queen, ſaid ſhe tearing of her hair, into what extremity art thou now reduced? Thou haſt but one gaſp of life remaining, which alſo thou muſt loſe ignominiouſly; and that which with reaſon may moſt torment thee is, that thy miſery proceeds from thy ſence of anothers pains, who now hath no feeling of thine. O ingratefull Knight! I could never have beleeved that thy love would have been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by my misfortune, ſince that was the only cauſe of it: but thy perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17218:26"/>
doth teach me, that nothing is more unſure then the promiſes of men. Thou oughteſt to loſe a thouſand lives (for ſo thou haſt often ſworn to me) and run any danger whatſoever for my ſervice; and thy affection ought to be as laſting as thy life, yet now thou wanteſt either love or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: the preſence of three men doth affright thee, or forgetfull of my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, thou art now lying at the foot of ſome other Lady, whom thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to bring into the like miſerable condition. But what do I ſay? <hi>Fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> Thou art no coward, I have ſeen too great proofs of thy valour for to doubt of it: nor can I by any means perſwade my ſelf that thou doſt not love me ſtill. Thou comeſt not then to relieve me, becauſe thou art detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome unlucky fate, and ſo it is not in thy power: I am therefore too blame in accuſing thee; for I know thou wouldſt not ſhun the encounter of a thouſand armed Knights when my preſervation were in queſtion. No I can accuſe none for my ill fortune but my ſelf; I will die then in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and will beſeech the Gods that they will deliver thee if thou beeſt in captivity, and alwaies bleſſe thy enterpriſes. The Princeſſe being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for death expected but the next day, which came on with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the Count of Clina, who believing that he ſhould not find any oppoſit, cauſed himſelf to be armed with rich arms, and mounted upon a mighty horſe came into the field with ſuch arrogance, as there was not one of the aſſiſtants that did not curſe him in his heart, ſeeing with what boldnes he marched in the midſt of his three Giants: as ſoon as he was entred the field the Queen was ſent for; but ſhe not expecting any help would have gone ſtraight to the place of execution and not to the liſts: but in that inſtant the Giant <hi>Grandimore</hi> preſented himſelf to her, armd at all pieces to deſire her leave that he might undertake the combat for her. Madam, ſaid he, it is with much grief that I ſee your fair eies drenched in tears, and that the Knights of your Court are ſo baſe as not to aſſiſt you in this neceſſity: I am the Knight Ardants friend, and will with his quarrell which now is in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, maintain againſt your enemies, that you are innocent of the crime is imputed unto you: be pleaſed then to give me power ſo to do, and diſtruſt not the mercy of the Gods who never leave the afflicted in their miſeries. Theſe couragious words giving <hi>Clairangia</hi> ſome hope, ſhe replied in this maner: Vertuous Knight, this good will of yours to me doth ſo oblige me, as I am moſt willing to put all my right into your hands; you go alone to fight with fowr redoubted enemies, nevertheles I hope you will be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For they are traitors, and the God<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> will fight on my ſide, giving you as much courage as they have malice. But let us know with what conditions this combat is to begin: Then calling for the Iudges, ſhe ſent to the King to beſeech him that <hi>Grandimore</hi> might be permitted to encounter his enemies one by one, and not altogether, ſince the lawes of Chivalry did not permit a combat upon advantage: wherunto the King anſwered, that the buſines was not in his power to diſpoſe of, but depended wholly upon the pleaſure of his adverſaries; howbeit he would no way hinder him from being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by any Knight that ſhould happen to arrive whileſt the combat la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Since it is in the choice of our enemies, ſaid <hi>Grandimore,</hi> incenſed with this anſwer, let us Madam, go and ſee if there be more curteſie in them then in the King: wherupon entring within the liſts he ſet himſelf juſt againſt the Count of Clina and his Giants; one of whom deſired the firſt courſe, remonſtrating to his companions that it were a baſenes for fowr of them to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17218:27"/>
join in the defeature of one ſingle Knight. But the Count of Clina would none of that, knowing the abilities of <hi>Grandimore,</hi> and the importance of the victory. Thoſe which are wicked, ſaid he, deſiring to cloke his malice with ſome ſhew of reaſon, do not deſerve to be intreated like perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; we therfore may lawfully make uſe of our fortune that is preſented unto us: Saying ſo, he furiouſly elapt ſpurs to his horſe, and the others by his example did the like. But <hi>Grandimore</hi> diſdaining the Count directed his lance againſt one of the Giants, and that ſo luckily, as he ran him clean tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, laying him upon the ground: yet being unable to ſit the ſhock of fowr lances, which had at one and the ſame inſtant incountred him, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed ſpite of his heart, and fell with a ſlight wound in his arm; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les being more active then the greatnes of his body did ſeem to permit, he very lightly got up, and was remounted on his horſe by that time the others had ended their courſe: Having then no feeling of his hurt, he couragiouſly drew out his ſword, wherwith he gave the Count ſuch a blow, as cutting his arm ſheer off he ſent him without ſence to the ground. That done, he made head to the Giants, who battered him more rudely then he deſired, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan one of the cruelleſt fights in the world; ſometimes ſtriking, ſometimes foining, and then again with an admirable dexterity avoiding their blows: In brief, he ſo carried himſelf that it was not perceived to whom the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did incline; when as the firſt Giant whom he had overthrown, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered his ſpirits came to charge him with ſtrange fury; his coming in making him diſpair of his life, he graſpt his ſword faſt in his hand, and determining to ſell his skin as dear as he could, he let it fall with ſuch rage upon him that firſt came within his diſtance, as he gave him a dangerous wound in his head. And not therwith ſatisfied he was raiſing his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to diſpatch him, but at that very inſtant he received two ſuch blows, one on the head and the other on the arm, that letting his ſword fall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his ſaddle deprived of all ſence, his horſe carrying him about the field ſo as the Giants could not come to faſten the leaſt blow upon him. Things being at this paſſe, every one accounted the victory ſure; for the Count of Clina who now began to move, when as a damſell was ſeen to enter the field accompanied with a Knight, who underſtanding the ſtate of the combat, and the conditions whereunto it was begun, approached to the Giants that purſued <hi>Grandimore,</hi> and charged them in ſuch ſort, as they were glad to turn head to defend themſelves. <hi>Grandimore</hi> coming to himſelf then at the noiſe of their blows, was as much aſtoniſhed to ſee himſelf brought to that eſtate, as pleaſed with that aſſiſtance, wherof meaning to make uſe, he took hold of his ſword that hung at his arm, and renewed the combat with ſo much fury, as every body wondred at the courage he ſhewed in this fight: which having indured about an howr without advantage, was ready to end with the death of <hi>Grandimore</hi> and his fellow, if in the inſtant there had not appeared in the field a Knight in azur'd armor, powdred with little ſtarrs of gold, ſo brave, and carrying himſelf ſo handſomly in his ſeat, that every body was delighted with the view of him: his coming in was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to all the ſpectators; for as ſoon as he was entred the liſts, and that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work, they ſaw him light upon one of the Giants with a blow, that divided his helmet and head in two pieces, they all preſently aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the victory would fall on the Queens ſide, who then began to hope well: and attentively beholding him, ſhe believed that it was her <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goran,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:17218:27"/>
whom ſhe had ſo long wiſhed for. The more ſhe eied him, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the force of his blows, the more ſhe ſetled her ſelf in that opinion. But he that obſerued her alteration, immediately imagined that ſhe knew him: which did ſo fire his courage, as not enduring that two men alone ſhould ſo long diſpute with him the honour of a combat, upon the ſucceſſe wherof depended all his contentment, together with the life of his Miſtris, threw ſo violent a thruſt at him that was oppoſed to <hi>Grandimore,</hi> as he ran him quite through the body, and laid him dead upon the ground. From him then turning preſently to the third, which was hand to hand with the ſtrange Knight, he let flie at him ſo furious a blow, as he clove his cask and head down to the teeth. Then looking upon the Count of Clina, who was not able to riſe, he leapt from his horſe, went and diſarmed his head, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the point of his ſword to his throat, wretch as thou art, ſaid he, confeſſe thy villany if thou wilt hope for any favour. For Gods ſake, good Knight, anſwered he, be not ſo cruell as to take away my life: Content your ſelf with my being thus wofully diſmembred; I will freely diſcover the truth of this affair, ſo you will but cauſe the Iudge to come down to me. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Duke of Rozolia deſcending from his ſcaffold, the Count decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the excellent beauty of the Queen, having powerfully maſtered his reaſon, he had ſought for relief at her hands: but his ſuit being rejected by her with indignation, he was ſo ſenſible of that diſgrace, as he had plotted this treaſon in revenge of his deſpiſed affection. That he had never ſeen the actions of the Knight Ardant without reſpect, nor the cariage of the Queen without modeſty; and that he moſt humbly beſought the King to pardon this his offence for his repentance ſake. Let the Gods, ſaid <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> when they reported this confeſſion to him, never be favourable to me, if once more I give ear to a man ſo wicked: he ſhall ſuffer the puniſhment that he had ordained for my Wife, to the end that traitors may by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample learn to be wiſe. Having then cauſed him to be thrown into the fire, he turned to receive the Queen, unto whom he ſhewed all the kindnes that might be, deſiring her utterly to forget the curelty he had exerciſed towards her. Afterwards addreſſing himſelf to the three Knights; I confeſſe, ſaid he, that I am engaged to you as much as I could have been for the reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine own life: But Gentlemen, ſince you already have done ſo much for me, pleaſe you oblige me further, by letting me know who you are. If my innocence were not apparant, anſwered he in the azure arms, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unbuckling his helmet, I ſhould not thus preſent my ſelf before you, Sir, to entreat you to reſtore me the honour of your favour: but the Count of Clina's confeſſion giving me that boldneſſe, I come to continue my ſervices if they may be acceptable unto you. I am Sir, the Knight Ardant, who is not a little grieved that he hath been at any time the ſubject of your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This great Knight is <hi>Grandimore,</hi> whom the laſt day I purchaſed my friend in my way to Celibana. This other is a ſtranger, whom good fortune hath brought hither, and whoſe name, as yet I know not. Pardon me then, Sir, if you pleaſe, and make it appear, that the malice of my enemies hath not been of power to take away your favour from me. Nor ſhall it, by the faith of a Prince, ſaid the King embracing him again, and I am more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for having ſo lightly given credit to this cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

a time of rejoicing, let us talk no more of our paſſed misfortunes. See where my Wife comes to entertain you: you ſhall from her receive the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement that is due to your valour. Wherupon he withdrew, leaving the three Knights with the Queen, who made infinitly much of them, wondring at the beauty of the ſtrange Knight, that was ſo like to <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> as there was no great difference between them. Some time being ſweetly ſpent in theſe complements, the Knights were conducted to their Chambers, there to be unarmed, to the extream vexation of theſe Lovers; who, for fear of reviving the ſuſpition that had touched upon them, paſſed this interview ſlightly over, holding no other diſcourſe together, but with their eyes and thoughts. As ſoon as they were retired to their Lodgings, the Phyſitians and Chyrurgians by order from the King, came to viſit their wounds. But the ſtrange Knight and <hi>Fulgoran</hi> had not that need of their aid which the Giant <hi>Grandimore</hi> had, whom they found hurt in fowr places: whereat the Knight Ardant was much grieved, in regard he loved him dearly for his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: how beit his diſpleaſure conſiſted not only in that, but rather for that he was barred from his Miſtris, who ſuffered no leſſe then he; and that durſt not look familiarly on him, for fear of falling again into the danger which ſo lately ſhe had eſcaped. Living then in this vexing reſtraint, all maner of delights were unpleaſing to them, and perhaps this ſadnes of theirs, might have turned to their ruine, if the Gods, who take care of all things, had not given them a remedy thereunto, as I will preſently ſhew you.</p>

But knowing that Art is needles to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of a generous mind, I only come humbly beſeeching you to grant me one boon wherby I hope to get out of thoſe my ſighs, wherinto the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of certain wicked perſons have plunged me. The gentle maner of your requeſt, ſaid the Queen, doth not permit me to refuſe you. Say then, ſweet heart, what is it that you deſire of me, for I am moſt ready to grant it? I did not expect an anſwer leſſe noble from your Majeſty, replied the Damſell, &amp; therfore will preſently begin the acknowledgements that I ow for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, with a proteſtation of continuing them all my life. That which I deſire at your gracious hands is, that you will command theſe two Knights (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17218:28"/>
to <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and the ſtranger) to follow me for the freeing of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom the moſt diſtoiall man in the world holds priſoner, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deprive him of the Dutchy of Matran, which after his death is to diſcend upon me. It may be you will think me uncivill, for craving a thing of you that depends on the will of another: but, Madam, you will not ſo much wonder at me, when you ſhall well underſtand the reaſon I have to make this ſuit unto you. Worthy Knights are alwaies obliged to lend ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour indifferently to all afflicted perſons what ſoever; but yet I am aſſured that they go more willingly to the undertaking of the moſt difficile enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, when as they are commanded ſo to do by ſome Lady of your merit: I therfore thought it ſitter to addreſſe my ſelf to you, then to importune them to quit this Court, where their vertues are held in ſo high an eſteem. You know, anſwered <hi>Clairangia,</hi> extreamly ſorry for the promiſe ſhe had made, that they being no ſubjects to the King, we have no farther force over them, then what their curteſie is pleaſed to afford us; ſo that I ſhould think it an abuſing of their good will they bear us, if I ſhould lay any command upon them heerin: but that I may not be wanting to my word, I deſire them to employ their valour in your ſervice, and to follow you for my ſake. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran</hi> then, I receive no little content in the leave you give me to ſerve this Damſell, to whom in truth both your Majeſty and my ſelf are much obliged: for it was ſhe that furniſhed me with the arms and horſe, which you ſaw me uſe the day of your deliverance. I did not think, ſaid the Damſell ſmiling, that ſo ſmall a ſervice as that which I rendred you then would have been ſo long remembred: but now I ſee by experience that a good turn is never caſt away, ſince one way or other we alwaies meet with a recompence for it: your kind acknowledgement pleaſeth me ſo well, that I am reſolved to do more for you then ever I did, and you ſhall one day find it: In the mean time, I pray you prepare your ſelf to go with me to morow in company of this ſtrange Knight; for if we tary heer any longer, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would be loſt, and we ſhall not find him alive whom we go to deliver. The departure of theſe Knights being thus reſolved on, the Queen remained in a ſtrange perplexity: for the abſence of <hi>Fulgoran</hi> afflicted her extreamly before it came; and that which moſt vext her was, that ſhe durſt not bring him into her chamber to take her laſt farewell of him: which this ſtrange Damſell knowing, ſaid unto her: If I had not Madam, a particular ſcience for to penetrate into the ſecreteſt thoughts of men, I would not offer to ſpeak with ſuch privacy to you, but underſtanding both what they do, and what they reſolve to do before they communicate it to any one: you may not wonder if I tell you that I know the pain you are in at this inſtant, for the departure of this Knight whom I am to carry away with me. I am the cauſe of your ſorrow, but I will now let you ſee that I have alwaies deſired your contentment: you long, and bluſh not at it, to enjoy the Knight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants company with the ſame liberty you have heertofore had; I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it for you, knowing full well that he diſires it with no leſſe paſſion then you: but do not ſend for him before night, for otherwiſe I ſhould not have time enough for my conjurations, and ſo you might be ſurpriſed: you ſhall have the whole night at your diſpoſe, and him to continue ſafely with you till break of day. Theſe words mightily troubled the Queen; for women would not have their counſels known, and are well pleaſed that people ſhould be blind in their affairs: but being unable to help it, and on the other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17218:29"/>
ſide moſt contented with the promiſe was made her, ſhe very much bluſhing anſwered: If you were ignorant of the weaknes of women, of the power of that haughty deitie which triumphs over all men, or of the merits of <hi>Fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> I would never confeſſe my error, or would ſeek excuſes to make it ſeem leſſe diſtaſtfull to you; but being aſſured that none of theſe things have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped your conſideration, I will not trouble my ſelf with ſtudying for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to perſwade you that I have not done much amiſſe: and rendring you thanks for the aſſiſtance you proffer me, which indeed I cannot refuſe, ſince you are ſo well read in my privateſt intention; I will wholly reſt upon your promiſes, for the execution wherof, I will inſtantly go and ſend <hi>Sileſia</hi> to my Knight to give him advertiſement of our reſolution. This enamoured Queen retiring therupon to her Chamber, with much impatience attended the evening, which was no ſooner come, but ſhe ſent for her Knight, whom ſhe careſſed more then ever ſhe had done; conjuring him by the infinity of her love to ſhorten his voiage as much as poſſibly he could, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her longer then of neceſſity he muſt, of the pleaſure ſhe took in his company; and the more to oblige him thereunto, ſhe informed him that their embraces at Celibana had left her with child. The night then being inſenſibly ſlipt away amidſt the ſweeteſt delights that two lovers can enjoy, they parted with tears, and proteſtations to love one another eternally. Having taken their leaves and bidden <hi>Grandimore</hi> farewell, that lay of his wounds, our Knights preſently left the Town, with the ſtrange Damſell, who ſeeing her ſelf a great way diſtant from the Town, made a ſtand, and ſaid thus to <hi>Fulgoran;</hi> Valiant Knight, marvell not if I ſpeak ſomwhat free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you; they which love you and deſire to have a ſhare in the glory of your fame, out of the intereſt that their affection doth chalenge therin, have commanded me to tell you, that a worthy and well bred Knight ought not to be caried away by any diſordered love, which never produceth but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects. Your paſſion for the Queen of Romeria, would infallibly have been your ruine, and her impriſonment was no other then a preſage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This which I give you is the advice of a friend; for you may well imagine, that it is more for your glory, then for any profit I may reap therby: And if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with what affection I received you lately in the palace of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted rock, you will judge that I rather did it to conceal you from them that ſought for you, and who would without doubt have taken away your life without any regard of your former ſervices, then for any hope of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſtance from you. Weigh my reaſons well, I pray you, and do not yield ſo much to your paſſion as to forget what you are. Go ſeek abroad in the world the renown that your predeceſſors have acquired. Imitate your Father and Brother, which qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And above all take heed you return not to Romeria, till your fate bring you thither when as you leaſt think of it; otherwiſe you will periſh there by the jealouſie of <hi>Dardanor,</hi> and will be the cauſe of ſuch miſchiefs, as will make your memory moſt odious amongſt men. I am not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17218:29"/>
afraid to ſpeak thus unto you before this Knight, who is your neer kinſman, though you know him not to be ſo, to the end that if you follow not my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he may with reaſon blame you for it. Saying ſo, ſhe vaniſhed away, leaving them both much amazed, but principally <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly grieved that he had not firſt learned the names of his ſo brave and eminent kinſmen; but hoping that fortune would one day let him know them, he turned him to the Knight that accompanied him, and embracing him thus ſpake: Dear Couſin, you may pleaſe to pardon me, if till now you have been no better entertained by me; if I have erred it was out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but time ſhall let you ſee that I do highly value your being of kin to me, and the ſervices that I will render you ſhall give you cauſe to think my actions void of malice; with that they embraced a freſh: which done, <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goran</hi> did in this maner proſecute his diſcourſe: Were it reaſon to ſtick in ſo fair a way? I verily believe we are of kin, but know not which way; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me in letting me know who you are: for by the knowledge therof, I ſhall it may be, learn ſomwhat of my own diſcent. Verily, anſwered he, the more I conſider the words of this woman, the more find I my ſelf in confuſion, not being able any way to imagin how you and I ſhould be of the ſame bloud as ſhe delivers, in regard that my Father and Mother (who for the preſent hold the Scepter of Canabea) never had either brother or ſiſter, but the Queen <hi>Florella,</hi> who died without children; and yet, as I remember, I have often heard it ſpoken, that the ſame Queen dying with child by one of the moſt eſteemed Princes of Chriſtendome, who it may be ſhould have married her, was ript up by a Magician Giant, that took out the child, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe had not been conceived full eight months, and wrapping it in a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin parchment, carried it away no man being able to hinder him: howbeit he promiſed the Prince <hi>Brazanges</hi> my father, that he would one day return him, and let him ſee him with all the perfections to be required in a brave Knight. It now reſts that you inſtruct me where you have beſtowed your yonger yeers, that out of this incertainty we may (if poſſible) draw a truth for our content. Doubtles, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> this womans words are true: The great <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

At theſe words they embraced again with much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xpreſſion of love, and travailing on entertained themſelves with variety of pleaſing diſcourſes: but night comming on ſooner then they de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:17218:30"/>
As ſoon as the ſong was ended, ſhe that had ſung threw the Lute upon the graſſe, took the Knight by the hand and ſat down ſo cloſe to <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> and his couſin <hi>Florimond,</hi> that they could not ſtir without being perceived. This approach according with their deſire, they ſtood ſtill in expectation of what would enſue heerupon, and had not long continued ſo before they heard the Lady ſpeak in this maner: I am with much reaſon afraid that you may ſlight my favours becauſe they are freely offered you, and think me ſhameleſſe forthus diſcovering my thoughts unto you. But Sir, when you ſhall conſider the weaknes of women, and your own merit, you will never condemn my boldnes, but will love me ſo much the more willingly, in that I do not ſtick to tell you that I will give my ſelf abſolutely unto you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſervation at all. My beauty is not ſo ſmall that you can deſpiſe it, without being cruell; and did I want that perfection, yet can I glory of a greater, which is, that I love you with paſſion. The time is ſeaſonable, the darknes favours us, and this place ſeems to be made for ſuch an occaſion: let it not then ſlip, I beſeech you, and I will render my careſſes ſo pleaſing to you, as you ſhall account your ſelf happy in the fruition of them. Let us begin with this kiſſe, which heer I tender you, and not ſuffering me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in this flame, ſo requite me that I never have occaſion to ſay that you are ingratefull, and moſt unworthy of the beauty which doth ſo adorn you. With that word ſhe drew neer with her lips to his, and already had put her arm about his neck, when as the Knight modeſtly withdrawing himſelf thus replied: Madam, pleaſe you to pardon me if I do not receive your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with the ſame height of affection wherwith they are now preſented to me; you are deceived by my outward appearance, and believing me to be what I am not, you give me more cauſe to be ſorry in your behalf, then to ſmile at your diſcourſe. I am of the ſame ſex that you are, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incapable of yielding you the contentment you expect: I freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this ſecret for to teſtifie unto you that I have no will to be ingratefull to your affection, which I do not entertain becauſe I am unable ſo to do: you wonder now at this, I believe, for there are but few women ſeen in theſe parts to follow arms: but yet it is not a thing impoſſible, and I aſſure my ſelf that you are not ſo ignorant of the world as not to know that the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons do paſſe up and down every where as Knights errant uſe to do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if you give not credit to my words, I will not make dainty to let you ſee ſuch evidence upon my breaſt as ſhall aſſure you of this truth, and by this means curing you will be very glad to let you underſtand, how it is no little diſcontentment to me that nature hath framed me ſuch as I am. You may ſay (replide the Lady) what you pleaſe, but upon my faith I ſhall ſtill take you for a Knight, untill I ſee ſome better aſſurance of the contrary: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall oblige me (though this may ſeem ſomewhat uncivill) if you will put off your cuiraſſe, that ſo I may be diſabuſed; and in the mean time tell me your name, for it may be I ſhall know you by the fame that goes of you. That is the only way, anſwered ſhe, not to know me at all; for my name is not ſo renowned in the world, as that you might know me by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it you: yet to obey you, pleaſe you to know that I am called the great Savageſſe, wife to the mighty King of Lidia, who died at the battell of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo, and am fitter to do you ſervice with my arms in my hand, then as you have deſired. Saying this ſhe unlaced her cuiraſſe, and took the Ladies hand to put it into her boſome, when as three Giants and twelve Knights,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17218:30"/>
who had long dogd them, and now found them by the light of the torches, ſeazed upon them both, and put them into a Chariot, notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance that the fair Savageſſe, who had not leiſure to draw her ſword, could make. The Knights much troubled for the want of their helmets at this ſo unexpected an incounter, ſpeedily recovered for to make them ready to follow the Giants, who went away infinitly pleaſed with their booty. But it was ſo dark that they knew not where they were, and therfore it was a good while before they could find their Squires, who likewiſe were ſo drowſie, as it was long before they could bridle their horſes, by means wherof their enemies were gotten a great way before them, ere they were able to ſet forth in purſuit of them: nevertheleſſe deſirous to ſee the end of this adventure, they rode all night with incredible ſpeed, inſomuch that two howrs after Sun riſing they came to a valley, in the bottom wherof they ſaw the Coach ſtanding ſtill, and the three Giants with their followers bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a Knight, who defended himſelf bravely, and had already laid fowr of their Knights dead at his feet. Oh heavens! ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> madded to ſee this unequall match, what do I behold? and why do not I aſſiſt ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a man? Come Couſin, let us make theſe baſe creatures know, that the juſtice of the Gods is alwaies armed for the ſuccour of the oppreſſed. This ſaid, they fell upon the Giants with ſuch fury, as at the firſt ſhock they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled two of them to the earth, ſo wounded, as one was troden to death with the horſes feet; the other getting up again a little after with much ado: the Knight that was firſt ingaged in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The valor of theſe three warriours being at the higheſt, the combat laſted not long; for the firſt Knight having made his enemies turn their backs, he diſcharged ſo furious a blow upon the arm of the Giant that fought with <hi>Florimond,</hi> as he ſent it together with his ſword to the ground, juſt as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> had made an end of his. The victory being thus gloriouſly atchieved, the Ladies which were bound with cords were preſently delivered, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Knight that began the fight. For knowing the fair Savageſſe, he preſently unlaced his helmet, and imbracing her ſaid: Ah Madam! how I deteſt theſe inhumane villanes that have bound you, who are able to bind all the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A thouſand times I give thanks to heaven that brought me thus ſeaſonably to encounter you, for to begin your deliverance: nor am I leſſe engaged to theſe brave warriors, who have in ſeconding me ſhewed ſo much valor: for the which I will go and vow a perpetuall ſervice to them. Be you alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to yield them the like regard, that it may appear you are as curteous as you are beautifull; wherwith he was turning to them when as the fair Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageſſe being free of her bonds, took him in her arms and kiſſed him with ſuch affection, as made her ſomthing jealous that was with her: My Lord, ſaid ſhe, it is I that is made happy in this meeting, and your gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I acknowledge that theſe Cavaliers have done much for us, and am therfore willing to render them thanks for their aſſiſtance; wherupon ſhe leaped down from the Chariot to go to <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and <hi>Florimond,</hi> who were amazed at her beauty: but they prevented her with ſo much reſpectivenes as rendred her almoſt aſhamed of it. Madam, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran</hi> to her, you honour us too much in eſteeming us
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17218:31"/>
worthy to ſerve you; and this poor pains we have taken, is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that which we deſire to undergo for you. This day is moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, ſince it hath furniſhed us with means to ſee you: but that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment may be compleat, tell us, I beſeech you, who this yong Knight is, the braveſt and moſt valiant that ever I beheld. It is not without reaſon, anſwered the fair Savageſſe, that you commend and deſire to know him; for beſides the merit of his valour, wherof your ſelves are judges, he is diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the nobleſt race in the world, being grandchild to the excellent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, who fils all the earth with aſtoniſhment at the recitall of his glorious deeds of arms, and ſon to the valorous <hi>Pentheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi> the moſt invincible Princeſſe of the world, and the never conquered <hi>Don Silves de la Silva.</hi> His name is <hi>Silvan,</hi> accompliſhed with all thoſe rare endowments, that can honour a gentleman; and ſo obliged to the aſſiſtance you have given him, as he will not fear to engage his life for your ſervice, nor my ſelf to employ theſe arms for you which you ſee me cary. <hi>Fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> exceedingly pleaſed with this incounter, for he had an extream deſire to prove himſelf againſt ſome of the Greek Princes, anſwered: Madam, the praiſes that you give this Knight, are great, becauſe they come from you, but too little for the excellency of his valor, wherof there needs no better teſtimony then this field covered with dead bodies; wherfore I ſhall gladly receive the honor of his affection, together with yours, although I could have wiſhed that our acquaintance had been begun in another faſhion, I mean by a combat between him and me: For being of a contrary faith to mine, we could hardly have continued friends but by ſuch an adventure. <hi>Silvan</hi> who was no leſſe diſcreet then valiant, and that would not appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, being ſo touched, anſwered him modeſtly: Vertuous Knight, I ſhould be very ſorry to lift my ſword againſt a perſon to whom I am ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly obliged: but if for the quiet of your conſcience you deſire the combat I will not refuſe you. Theſe words would without queſtion have embarked them further, if they had not at that inſtant ſpied a maid come ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards them as faſt as ſhe could drive, who without other ceremony ſaid to <hi>Fulgoran:</hi> Knight Ardant, take this way preſently, with the Prince of Canabea your Couſin, and by the command of the Lady of the inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rock follow three damſels that are in the hands of an horrible Giant: and you gentle <hi>Silvan,</hi> prepare your ſelf for an affair no leſſe dangerous then that, and let the fair Savageſſe accompany you, for ſhe will be of much uſe to you therin. Theſe Ladies ſhall in the mean time withdraw to this houſe, which you ſee heer by, and my ſelf will watch for the ſafety of all. The earneſtnes of this woman having quickly put them in readines, each one took the way that was ſhewed him, and ſo they ſeperated themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone a little way, <hi>Silvan</hi> heard a noiſe behind him, which made him turn ſuddenly about, thinking he had been among his enemies: but ſeeing no body ſave that one woman whom he had lately left, he ſtaid and ſaid unto her: Gentlewoman, you follow us, I perceive, wheras I thought you had been otherwhere imploied; is it your pleaſure that I take any other way? No, replied ſhe, I only come to ſalute you from the wiſe <hi>Vrganda,</hi> who ſends you word that you ſhould not be troubled, that you are not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting with the Knight Ardant, for that could not have been done without an irreparable loſſe. Keep on your way till you arrive in the Parthian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, with this beautuous Queen: your preſence will ſhortly be neceſſary

there. In the mean time I will adviſe the other Knight to travell no further in vain: for the adventure which I told him of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceeded wholly from my own invention. Saying ſo, ſhe turned about her horſe without tarrying for any anſwer, and went to the Knight Ardant, to whom ſhe made the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, informing him that her Miſtris would not for ſome reaſons, which ſhe would one day let him know, ſuffer him to fight with <hi>Silvan;</hi> and giving him no time to ſpeak a word, ſhe left him with ſuch ſpeed, as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loſt ſight of her, infinitly grieved for that he had not asked her his fathers name. But hoping to meet her again ſome other time, he paſſed on with <hi>Florimond,</hi> whileſt the fair Savageſſe and <hi>Silvan</hi> followed their way, intertaining themſelves with an infinity of pleaſing diſcourſes.</p>

What are theſe ſighs good for, and to what end is this ſilence? Do you ſtill think of the loſſe you have endured? Hath not time as yet wrought its due effect in you?

Madam, I muſt unlock my boſom to you, ſince your ſelf hath given me the occaſion to do it: I have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to refuſe that to your beauty which all the men in the world do render it; and my grief proceeds from my not daring to hope that you will receive me in to your ſervice: for knowing that ſuch an ambition becomes none but the prime Knights of the earth, I have alwaies feared to beg that grace of you. My ill humour doth not pleaſe you, it is in your power to change it: my ſighs and tears are troubleſome to you; you may quickly ſtop the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them: and if you have no leſſe pity then you have attracting charms you will preſently command me to live at more quiet heerafter, by telling me that I ſhall not love ungratefully. This fair Amazon that was not infen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Loves power, conſidering the merits, the perfections, and the birth of this Knight, who had made no difficulty to expoſe himſelf to danger for her ſuccour, that ſhe could hardly paſſe the reſt of her daies in widowhood, and that ſhe knew not where to find a man more agreeable to her humour, or better ſuited to her condition, anſwered him with much modeſty. See, my Lord <hi>Silvan,</hi> how our opinions do many times abuſe us; I had thought your diſcourſe had been of another quality then it is, nor did I believe that the little beauty which I have, could have prevailed ſo much over you. You love me, and ſay that you breath not but for the honour of my favor, I will grant it to your merit; and not to be ingratefull, do even now receive you not only for my Knight, but for the lord of my affections, aſſuring my ſelf that you will not ſeek the poſſeſſion of them but according to the laws of honour. No certainly, ſaid <hi>Silvan</hi> all overjoid, for it were a ſacriledge to ſerve you with any hopes of a baſe alloy: Madam, I accept of the grace which you now do me, with a true and pefect ſence of the worth therof, and do heer plight you that faith, which another day I will tender to you with more ſolemnity in the preſence of thoſe upon whom I depend. Saying ſo, he diſarmed his hand, and giving it to her he purſued his diſcourſe in this ſort: Now Madam, it is in you to render me in effect the happieſt Knight on the earth, as already I am in hope. Dear friend, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, time will give us leiſure to think of that point: in the mean ſpace live in this belief, that being perfectly beloved of me, I will not paſſe by any occaſion that may tend to your content and mine own. Whileſt theſe Lovers rode on with all the delights that two ſuch perſons might injoy, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and his Couſin on the other ſide were giving end to a number of brave adventures, which made their name ſo glorious, as the whole world was full of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown.

Travelling up and down thus with a world of praiſes one morning at the entry into a forreſt they met with two damſels, each of which demanded a boon of them.

Yes, ſaid ſhe looking up, you may divert a great miſchief by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the beſt Knights in the world, whom a horrible Giant accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with thirty or forty of his men, doth hold inveſted in that Caſtle which you ſee yonder before you, and if your courage be anſwerable to your gallant aſpect, you will not ſuffer him to periſh in that maner. At theſe words <hi>Floriſel</hi> without any further ſtay in regard the danger was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſet ſpurs to his horſe, and finding the gate open, entred into a large Court, where he ſaw a Knight armed with a Cuiraſſe of the colour of fire, who beſtirring himſelf bravely, did one while lay upon a Giant, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while ſend an arm or a head of a Knight to the earth. His valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in him no leſſe wonder then it did deſire to ſuccour him, (although he knew him to be the Knight Ardant whom he ſought) he inſtantly couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lance, and aiming it at the bever of the Giants helmet, he hit him with ſuch force as he made him take three or fowr turns on the ground, ſo that if the ſhame to ſee himſelf overthrown had not animated him with rage he had lien there longer: but ſpite rendring him inſenſible of all pain, he

aroſe though with ſome difficulty, and incountring <hi>Don Floriſel</hi> who in the mean ſpace had diſpatched three of his followers, he charging them with ſuch violence, as much amazed him; howbeit not failing in courage, and knowing full well how to carry a buſineſſe as that was, he avoided half of his blows, and made him feel his ſo waighty that he had no cauſe to brag of his advantage. Hammering upon one another in this ſort, they kept ſo cloſe together, that the Giant had no opportunity to aſſiſt his people, of whom the Knight Ardant did in the interim make a ſtrange ſlaughter; whereat he was ſo enraged, that he beſtowed the moſt part of his blows in vain, with horrible menaces to overthrow the altars which he had erected for the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Gods, which gave him not powr to vanquiſh one ſingle Knight.

That done he inſtantly returned forth of the Caſtle, for that he would not be known of the Knight Ardant, leſt the reſentment of the ſuccour he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, ſhould oblige him to refuſe the combat which he intended to have with him: and withdrawing himſelf to the edge of the forreſt he lighted upon the cottage of a yong ſhepheard, who receiving him very courteouſly gave him the beſt entertainment he could. But whileſt he took a little reſt, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> was in no great eaſe: for meeting with an old Gianteſſe who had a mace in her hand wherwith ſhe was beating in pieces the door of a chamber where the Princeſſe Alixenna had locked up her ſelf, he was by that Mege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra charged with ſuch violence, that he was ſomewhat amazed at it. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he carried to women made him endure ſome blows, and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have freed himſelf without ſtriking her; but fearing ſome miſchief from this fury he ſuſtained a mighty blow that ſhe ſtruck with her mace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhield, and cloſing with her gave her ſuch a knock with the pommell of his ſword under the ear, as he laid her dead upon the floor. That done, he cauſed the Princeſſe Alixenna to open the dore, who with tears of joy would have caſt her ſelf at his feet to have kiſſed his hand. But having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her he ſaid: Madam, Knights errant do not receive ſuch homage, which is not due but to perſons of your merit; If I have done any thing for you, I am ſufficiently recompenſed in that my endevours are acceptable to you.

I am ſomewhat of kin to the fair Queen <hi>Sidenia</hi> his wife, and came now from Guindaia, to viſit and comfort her after ſo many loſſes as ſhe hath lately ſuſtained: but tell me, I beſeech you, whether I be not too importunat in this requeſt of mine, or whether I ſhall hazard my ſelf in this journey, only with the damſell that brought you hither in ſo lucky an howr? Madam, anſwered <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> I will go with you moſt willingly to Conſtantinople, not to receive as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, any recompence: for good Knights are to content themſelves with the glory of their actions; but to preſerve you from falling again under the mercy of ſome wicked men, who without ſufficient regard to your beauty might ſtrive to get that of you by violence, which ought to be given for love. Wherfore we will depart preſently, if you pleaſe, unleſſe you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtay till to morrow.

Howbeit ſeeing it could not be helped, they went to free certain Knights, whom the Giant held in priſon, to whoſe care the charge of the Caſtle was committed. That done every one retired to his reſt, whileſt <hi>Floriſel</hi> to whom the length of the day ſeemed tedious, in the company of his hoſt that had not wherwithall to divert his thoughts by his diſcourſe, entred into the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt part of the wood, where he walked a great while inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This contemplation having held him till it was almoſt night, he was upon returning to his lodging, when as he ſaw a damſell making towards him, followed at the heels by a Giant, armed at all pieces: He that had no other arms but his ſword, would without queſtion have been amazed at this encounter, had he been capable of fear; but his gallant heart deſpiſing all dangers, he was advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with his ſword in his hand, when as the maid thus ſpake to him: Hold, my Lord <hi>Floriſel,</hi> arms and valour are of no uſe, where there are no enemies; we are heer rather to do you ſervice, then to offend you. I confeſſe ſaid he, ſtretching out his arms to embrace her, I confeſſe, Gentlewoman, that I was in the wrong, for I did not at the firſt ſight know you to be our dear friend <hi>Alquifa:</hi> Tell me, I pray you, are your parents yet living, and what occaſion brings you hither at this time? I have already told you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, that it is in ſome ſort to oblige you this I am heer: My Father and Mother were never more affectionated to your ſervice: all their ſtudy and care is for the good of you, and thoſe of your houſe.

                     <p>To give you a clearer underſtanding of theſe words is that I may not do. Wherfore not to trouble you any longer about it, I will only ſay, that you muſt alwaies cary in mind what you ow to your name and glory; with that ſhe went away ſo ſuddenly, as ſhe gave him not the leaſure to return her any anſwer, leaving him ſomwhat diſpleaſed with ſo abrupt a parting: howbeit conſidering that all the actions of thoſe ſages were done for ſome reaſon, he was the better ſatisfied by viewing thoſe fair arms, which he immediatly put on, and ſo returned to his cottage. The night being then quietly paſſed over, he aroſe very early, and taking up his ſtation at the edge of the wood, he remained there till ſuch time as he ſaw the Knight Ardant come out of the Caſtle, and then advancing fair and ſoftly he met him in the midſt of the way, and thus ſpake to him: Knight, it is with ſome grief that I deſire to combat with you, for ſuch as reſemble you are to be honoured. But I am ſo ſenſible of the death of a Gentleman, whom ſome few daies ſince you ſlew, becauſe he carried a red Croſſe on his ſhield, that I cannot ſuffer you to be at quiet, nor let ſlip ſo fair an occaſion of revenging his death: you are provided for the combat, our incounter is without advantage; Let us ſee then to whom fortune will be moſt favourable. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> that heard himſelf defied in ſuch modeſt tearms, much commending in his mind the gallant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of his adverſary, would willingly have declined the fight, but fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to leave an ill impreſſion of his courage, he anſwered him very diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I aſſure you, Knight, our diſcontent is equall, for a diſcourſe ſo free from paſſion as yours is, doth inform me that you are no leſſe valiant then curtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and makes me with ſome doubt apprehend the iſſue of this our combat: which no longer defer ſince you will have it ſo. Saying thus, they retired a little to take the field, and turning head they met ſo bravely, that their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſhivered to their very gantlets, neither of them being unhorſed: This ſo rude and furious an incounter having but animated their courages, out of an eſteem that each of them had of his enemies courage, they charged one another with ſuch rage, as their helmets ſeemed to be all fire. The Knight Ardant that had never met with ſo ſtrong a party, diſplaied all his force and cunning, and laid ſo mightily at him, that <hi>Floriſel</hi> was much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at it, holding him worthy of the fame that ran of him: but knowing not how to be vanquiſhed, he returned him ſuch an exchange, and preſt him ſo lively, as he began to doubt of the iſſue of the combat. O immortall Gods! ſaid he full of deſpite, have you then vowed my ruine? and intend you that this combat ſhall bereave me of all the glory of my former adventures? I have ſeen the ſtouteſt Giants in the world at my feet, and now am reduced to the fear of ſeeing my enemy triumphing over me: this is faintnes in me, I confeſſe, but I am reſolved either to overcome or die. Which thought inflaming choler, he redoubled his blows with ſuch violence, as <hi>Floriſel</hi> had never eſcaped with life, had it not been for thoſe good arms given him by

Hammering thus upon one another with more paſſion then judgement, they continued their combat fowr howrs together without breathing, or being able to diſcern who had the advantage, which ſo enraged them, as letting go their ſwords, they cloſed together and fell to wraſtle in that violent maner one with another, that at length they fell both of them to the ground, where they tumbled a long time up and down, ſome while a top, and ſome while underneath, not knowing who ſhould prevail: at laſt, neither of them being able that way to maſter each other, they roſe both together, and returned to their ſwords, wherwith they laid on a freſh with ſo much fury, that after they had continued two howrs in this ſecond charge, they were inforced to fall off a little to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Whileſt thus they took breath, each of them had leiſure to wonder at the bravery of his adverſary: and willingly would they have left the combat in the eſtate wherin it then was, had not honour defended it: but either of them unwilling to give any advantage to the other, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their fight more furiouſly then before. And ſo obſtinately were they bent upon it, that nothing could be expected from the end of this fight but the death of them both, if heaven which reſerved them for its glory, had not ſecured them by the goodnes of their arms. Eight howrs being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpent ſince the beginning of their combat, each of them feared to ſee himſelf vanquiſhed; ſo that making no further account of their lives, they at one inſtant delivered two ſuch mighty and dangerous blows at each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they both fell to the earth quite deprived of ſence.

To this end they were making preparations, when as the Emperour <hi>Spheramond</hi> was advertiſed that the Empreſſe of Perſia was alſo brought to bed of two ſons, the one called <hi>Perſides</hi> and the other <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> the Queen <hi>Sidonia</hi> of one called <hi>Clariſel</hi> of Guindaia; The Infanta <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna</hi> of one called <hi>Florisbel</hi> of the ſtar; The Princeſſe <hi>Timbria</hi> of one called <hi>Ageſipolis;</hi> The Queen of Clotona, of one called <hi>Flamides;</hi> The Queen of Caſtara of one called <hi>Formozel</hi> of Sitanquia; The Queen of the fortunate Iſland of one called <hi>Cilindor;</hi> The Queen of Samothracia of one called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramant;</hi> The Queen of Licaonia of one called <hi>Fidamant;</hi> The Dutcheſſe of Laiazza of one called <hi>Lucian;</hi> The Empreſſe of Rome of one called <hi>Sclerimond;</hi> The Queen of Dacia of one called <hi>Laſcaris;</hi> The Queen of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia of one called <hi>Doriſtan;</hi> and the Queen of Cathaia of a daughter called <hi>Anticlia:</hi> which news ſo increaſed the content of <hi>Spheramond,</hi> as he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to keep open Court eight daies together, and to hold a jouſt and tournay for all commers, at the end of theſe magnificences.

Theſe Knights having been ſo eafily overthrown, every one began to give the honour to the black Knights, when as the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Eſquilan</hi> of Polonia, and the brave <hi>Ruſsian</hi> of Media, who had reſerved themſelves till the laſt, advanced with a kind of I know not what hope in the ſpectators, that the glory of the jouſts might yet remain to the Court by the valour of theſe two gallant Princes, who taking ſtrong and ſtiff lances, went and encountred the black Knights with ſuch fury, as the earth ſeemed to tremble under them. Their encounter was remarkable, all fowr of them brake upon their ſhields with ſuch equall fortune, as there appeared not more addreſſe or leſſe courage and force in any of them then in the other. Thoſe ſtaves being in ſhivers, the ſecond were brought them, which they brake as the firſt, the Knights not ſeeming to be any whit moved with theſe ſo furious ſhocks, howbeit this reſiſtance inflaming their courages they ran yet three other courſes, with as much fury as grace; but being extreamly enraged for doing ſo little before ſo great an Emperour, they charged new ſtaves, wherwith they encountred ſo violently that all fowr of them quit their ſaddles, infinitly grieved at ſo great a misfortune; nevertheleſſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly getting up they were going to repair that default with their ſwords, when as they that were appointed for the Tournay came in, and ſeparated them. The yong Knights divided themſelves, and being placed in the head of two ſquadrons of two hundred men a piece, they encountred together ſo bravely, that many were unhorſed at the firſt brant, and every one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the honour of the day, they laid luſtily about them: the yong Knights performed wonders, one while they were ſeen in the middeſt of the preſſe, another while in the front, ſtriking furiouſly and warding gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In brief the party was ſo well diſputed, that a full howr was paſt, ere any man could judge who had the better of it. If the brave <hi>Ruſsian</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, and the generous <hi>Eſquilan,</hi> cleared all before them, the two black Knights on the other ſide performed their parts no leſſe bravely, in ſuch ſort

that all was in equall ballance, when at the beginning of a combat between the two black Knights and <hi>Ruſsian</hi> of Media with <hi>Eſquilan,</hi> who had met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they ſaw a Knight armed all in white armour appear in the Liſts, who joining with <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The black Knights foreſeeing their loſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled their blows with extream violence, but they were oppoſed by ſuch ſtrong enemies, as they could not promiſe themſelves the victory: on the other ſide <hi>Ruſsian</hi> and his companion fearing that the honour of the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney might reſt upon the white Knight whom they knew not, aſſailed their adverſaries moſt valiantly, whence it enſued that being reſolved either to die, or vanquiſh, all fowr diſcharged at one and the ſame inſtant ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blows upon each other, as the ſwords of <hi>Eſquilan</hi> and <hi>Ruſsian</hi> brake in eight or nine pieces, and the black Knights helmets flew from their heads; whereupon they were preſently known by <hi>Spheramond,</hi> for the gentle <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> and the fair Savageſſe, who were about fowr daies before arrived in the Empire of the Parthians, after they had run many fortunes, of which we have not ſpoken, becauſe we would not omit thoſe other paſſages, that more neerly concerned our deſign.</p>

The Emperour doth highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, and eſteems of me no leſſe; wherfore I beſeech you be pleaſed to let me make him my interceſſor to you, for your love and favour: what ſhall be reſolved upon by his advice will, as I ſuppoſe, cary the more weight with it; not in regard of us, for being reciprocally aſſured of our affections, the opinion of others ſhould be indifferent to us, but only to have it ſaid, that we know how to render due honor to ſuch as deſerve it. Deareſt friend, anſwered ſhe, you are aſſured that my will is yours, and that I wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on you, having reſerved nothing to my ſelf, ſince I firſt engaged my faith unto you; therfore you may diſpoſe of all things at your pleaſure: and if the Emperour ſhall ſpeak to me in your behalf, my anſwer ſhall be ſo modeſt, as it ſhall neither ſwarve from the reſpect I ow unto him, nor from the duty wherunto your love obligeth me. This reſolution being taken, not without ſome kiſſes, <hi>Silvan</hi> went to the Emperour, to whom in the firſt place he gave an account of all his adventures which he had paſſed ſince he left the great Caſtle of the twelve Towrs; that done, he began a ſpeech to him of this tenor: Sir, you are a competent judge of the powers of Love, nor do I believe that any man can ſpeak more experimentally therof, then your Majeſty. My parents that were not long ſince incloſed in their tombs, nor the late loſſe of ſo many Princes, whom Chriſtendome doth to this day lament, have not been able to divert this paſſion growing in me by the object of a pleaſing beauty, ſo that I am enforced to confeſſe unto you, that the merits of that fair Queen whom you ſaw not long ſince fighting with me, are accompanied with ſuch unreſiſtable charms, as I have been conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld up my liberty unto them: I know you have a mighty power over her, and that you may freely diſpoſe of her determination. In which regard, Sir, I moſt humbly beſeech you that you will be the author of my happines, that you will contribute to my content, entreat her graciouſly to accept of my affection, and in a word engage her to give me with her ſelf, the ſcepter of Lidia, which ſhe now enjoieth by the death of her husband. It is true that I have not deſerved this grace, but the favour you ſhall do me heerin ſhall ſo firmly oblige me, as I ſhall never have any deſire but for your ſervice. Couſin, anſwered <hi>Spheramond,</hi> the lawes of Love are ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that I do not wonder if men do prefer them before thoſe of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: our parents are dead, for they could not live ever, and what ſhould

leſſen our grief for that loſſe, is, that they have left the world with ſo much glory and honour, as their fame ſhall continue in the mouths of men to all eternity; ſo that we are not to afflict our ſelves exceſſively for loſing them, nor refuſe our good fortune when it is preſented, the rather for that they are not ſenſible of our actions; wherfore you ſhall not wrong their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if now you take a wife, ſince heaven hath too ſoon deprived you of her whom your merits had purchaſed for you: and to teſtifie unto you that I ſpeak according to my heart, I will ſhare in the fault which you think to commit. You ſhall enjoy what you earneſtly deſire, or this fair one ſhall reject my praiers, for ſhe is well worthy of you, and you of the delights which you hope for from her. Saying ſo he left him, and without protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting time, went into the fair Savageſſes chamber, who had that day at the requeſt of her Lover, attired her ſelf like a woman. See now ſaid he, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in that habit, ſee now fair Queen, your ſelf in caſe more likely to force a thouſand Knights to your obedience, then you were of late with your ſword in your hand, although you can well make it redoubtable to your enemies; and in truth I do not now marvell that <hi>Silvan</hi> is charmed by ſo many excellencies, ſince I my ſelf do begin to have the like deſires, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am heer rather to do him ſervice, then to ſuffer my ſelf to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. I know not how you value his kindred, or the merits of his perſon, but I am not ignorant how much he loves you with paſſion, and if I did not think I ſhould trench too much upon the ſweetnes of your diſpoſition, I would willingly beſeech you to do him ſo much honour as to receive him for your Husband. Sovereign Prince, replied ſhe with a deep bluſh, I did in the beginning of your diſcourſe beleeve, that you were pleaſed to divert your cares with ſome gentle paſſage of wit, but theſe words are paſt jeſting, ſo that I am obliged to anſwer as ſeriouſly: you render me a husband ſo worthily vertuous, as the greateſt Princeſſe on the earth could not refuſe him without imputation of vanity, nor do I mean to leave the election of him to any other; I do therfore moſt willingly accept of him, aſwell in conſideration of the pain your Majeſty hath taken in ſpeaking to me for him, as for his own merit and love; and do account all thoſe poor ſervices that I have done to your Crown, abundantly rewarded in this only favour: which is as much as you may expect from me, who do humbly beſeech you abſolutely to diſpoſe of all that concerns me, being moſt aſſured that you ſhall never ſee me diſobey your commandements. <hi>Spheramond</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an anſwer to his wiſhes, and unwilling to give fortune leiſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe any malice for the diſturbance of theſe Lovers content, he cauſed them to be contracted the ſame night, and the next day to be maried with great ſolemnity.

Theſe diſpleaſing news cauſed great trouble in the Court, all paſtimes ceaſed, complaints were renewed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one grieved according to the meaſure of his love: the new Knights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſhew their affection to the ſervices of the houſe of Greece, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly armed themſelves, and comming altogether before the Emperour, they beſought his permiſſion to go in ſearch both of this yong Prince, and of the adventures of the World; which requeſt being granted them, they departed the ſame day with a reſolution to run over all Countries, rather then to fail of their enterpriſe; but their deſign was to no purpoſe, for the Enchantreſſe <hi>Creonda,</hi> in whoſe hands he was, and that had not taken him away, but only for that ſhe foreſaw by her Art, that of her daughter <hi>Griſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> he ſhould beget a Prince excelling all of his time, had ſo enchanted him, as by the ſequel of this Diſcourſe will appear, that none but <hi>Alcander</hi> could know the place of his retreat, or be able to contribute to his deliverance. The Court being in mourning for this bad news, and for the abſence of ſo many Princes, <hi>Spheramond</hi> had no contentment left him but in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of <hi>Silvan,</hi> who not willing to abandon him ſo ſoon, endeavoured to make the time more pleaſing, and his loſſe leſſe ſenſible unto him. Howbeit forced by the neceſſity of his affairs, he was conſtrained to depart, together with his wife, for to reduce the people of Lidia to their duties; who ſeeing neither King nor Queen, rendred but little obedience to their governours, and began to riſe in tumultuous maner. Their departure made the Court very ſolitary, but the Emperour knowing how to live every where with contentment, never troubled himſelf with the conſideration of ſo many loſſes as he had endured, and began to attend the care of his ſubjects, when a ſecond advertiſement gave him a freſh cauſe of diſcontent.</p>

Heerwith they ſet ſpurs to their horſes, but make what haſte they could they were not able to overtake them before they came to the ſea ſide, where they ſaw the wench leap in a Bark and the old man after her, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken her by the hair made as though he would have cut off her head. The Knights much grieved for that they could not aid her, in regard the Bark was put off a little from land, they approached to them as neer as they could; and thinking to alay his fury with intreaties, began to conjure him to conſider what he himſelf was, and how little honour he ſhould gain by dipping his hands in the bloud of a woman. I know very well, anſwered he, what every man ows to his reputation, but withall I am not ignorant of the content that revenge affoords: This woman cannot eſcape death for ſatisfaction of the wrong I have received from her, except you grant me one boon: You ſhall have it ſaid <hi>Eſquilan,</hi> whatever it be that you deſire of us: Come aboard this Bark then, replied he, and go with me, I ſhall have time enough to let you know what I will require of you. Wherupon not ſtaying for further entreaty, they preſently lighted from their horſes, and by the advice of the old man leaving them upon the ſtrand, they entred that little Bark, which without attending any more lading, began to cut the waves with incredible ſpeed. The Knights much amazed to ſee themſelves caried away in that ſort, looked round about them, and ſeeing no Sailers for the ſteering and conducting this veſſell, they deſired to be informed by what means it was done, but they found no body to ſatisfie them therin; the old man and the damſell no longer appearing, nor any thing to be found in the Bark but two little Beds, and a Table furniſhed with exquiſit meat.

they ſaw a Dwarf come in to them, who ſhewing a ſpirit much greater then his body, thus ſpake unto them: My Lords, it is time for you to rowſe up your ſelves, and worthily to employ theſe arms you wear. Heerwith they aroſe, and looking about them they perceived two ſhips grapled together; in one of the which were two Knights, invironed with about twenty ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and two horrible Giants, that charged them with ſuch fury, as they were amazed to ſee what reſiſtance they made. Their Bark laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord juſt as they had laced on their helmets, they leapt into that ſhip wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the two Knights were, and aſſailing the two Giants, they laid upon them ſo luſtily, as they quickly made them diſpair of the victory. The combat was very hot between theſe fowr, but no whit leſſe dangerous on the other ſide: for the two Knights deſirous to make uſe of time, charged their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with ſo much fury, as they cut them all in pieces, except one, that was very richly armed, who unwilling to die with the reſt, though he had beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf very bravely before, intreated for life and liberty.

I am a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the mighty King of Canabea, the Chriſtian Princes capitall enemy, and am now come from treating with the great Cariff of Affrica, and the King of Coriza, to whom I was emploied, for to invite them to a war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Princes of Greece; the cauſe wherof is, rather for religion then conqueſt, and my voiage was ſucceſſefull enough, had I not lighted upon you: for having obtained all that I deſired, namely fifty thouſand men to fall upon the Empire of Trebiſond, beſides an hundred and thirty thouſand more, which are already levied in the Kingdomes of Canabea, Romeria, and Calican, I returned extreamly well ſatisfied, in the company of thoſe two Giants, which the King of Coriza had given me, by whoſe aid I did not doubt but to ſee the Crown of Trebiſond placed on my maſters head: the rather for that I knew the principall defenders of that Empire are dead, ſo as the Chriſtians have been conſtrained to commit the government ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to an Amazonian woman; and that thoſe which ſurvive will not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit their own provinces, for fear of being invaded by other Pagan Kings. Behold what you can expect from me in diſcharge of my promiſe; it remaineth now that you make yours good, and reſtore me to my former liberty, as you have preſerved my life. The Princes of Greece, anſwered one of the firſt Knights, aretrue of their words, and ſtand in no doubt of their enemies: Experience ſhould have made them wiſer, and ſo many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels as they have loſt, ſhould me thinks, be able to break that obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they have to die in this quarrell; but ſince they will not guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reaſon, they ſhall not be more gently entertained then they have been heertofore.

And to teſtifie unto you that we do not much regard their menaces, we will give you leave to proceed on your voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and you may tell your kinſman that for a beginning of the war you have met with Greek Princes as full of curteſie as courage. This ſaid, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to weigh anchor, and letting them go he turned to the two Knights, with no little admiration to ſee them ſo yong and ſo excellent. <hi>Eſquilan</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved them very attentively, deſired them not to be diſpleaſed if his curioſity caried him to demand of them who they were, to the end they might the better know to what perſons they were engaged for ſo many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes and praiſes, wherwith they had rewarded the poor ſervice they had done them.

In the mean time the ſhip wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Ruſsian</hi> was, having ran two daies without meeting any adventure, arrived at the foot of a little mountain which ſeemed to the Knights ſo pleaſant, that they preſently landed, much admiring to ſee their horſes upon the ſhore in the ſame equipage that they had left them in; but ceaſing their wonder by the remembrance of what they had ſeen the old man and the damſell do not long before, they preſently mounted upon them, and taking a beaten way that lead up to the top of the mountain, they ſpent about an howr or more, at the end wherof they found a Cave, whoſe mouth was ſtopt with certain pieces of wood, which made them conjecture that there was ſome ſecret within it, their curioſity then not permitting them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, without knowing whether there were any adventure within it worthy their courages, they alighted; and tying their horſes to a Tree they thruſt away the bars, ſo as with little difficulty they made that entry free for them, but that not being large enough for two to paſſe in front, <hi>Ruſsian</hi> drew out his ſword, and intreating <hi>Eſquilan</hi> to ſtay there till his return, he went on a pretty way in that darknes not without ſome apprehenſion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into ſome precipice, out of which he ſhould never be able to diſingage himſelf, but then preſently eſpying a lamp he marched with more aſſurance by the light therof, till he came into a vault of about five and twenty or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17218:40"/>
thirty paces broad, in one corner wherof upon ſome ſtones raiſed in form of an altar was a fire burning, &amp; making a ſtand to look about him he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered two damſels comming, one of the which kneeling down before him, thus ſpake: If it be by the order of that barbarous man, who now deſires to glut himſelf with my bloud, as he hath heertofore done with my embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if it be, I ſay, from <hi>Ormand</hi> that you come, do not, Sir, make me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh any longer; my boſome is ready to receive the blow of mercy, and it will leſſe grieve me to die by your hands, then once more to come in the ſight of ſo wicked and baſe a man. Fortune hath brought me hither, ſaid <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> taking her by the hand to raiſe her from the ground, not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhorten your daies, and much leſſe to put you into the power of a man that you have no cauſe to love. Be not therfore afraid, but rather be confident in my company, and be aſſured, Gentlewoman, that I will have an account of the wrong that hath been done you, if you will make uſe of my arms; and let me know the occaſion of your retirement to this deſolate place, ſo far remooved from all converſation of men. Good Knight repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, my miſery is paſt remedy, and the aid you proffer me can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſerve but only to oblige me unto you for your good will; yet will I not be ſo little ſenſible of the favour you do me, as to deny your curioſity the relation of my misfortunes. Let us ſit down then upon this bed of leaves that ſo you may with the more eaſe attend to my diſcourſe. Me thinks, ſaid <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> we ſhould be much better abroad where the clear day will more content us then this darknes, the rather for that a Gentleman my friend, who ſtaies without for guard of the entry of this darkſome lodging may perhaps be diſcontented with our longer ſtay. All places are to me indifferent, ſaid ſhe, and if I deſired to ſtay you in this cave it was becauſe I thought it a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place for the rehearſall of my woes, then any other whatſoever. But I am well contented to go out with you that the Sun which for theſe fowr and twenty daies hath not troubled my ſight, may let you behold in my face the ſigns of a moſt extream ſorrow; wherupon going forth they went and ſet them down in the ſhadow of certain trees, where ſhe began to ſpeak in this maner: Do not, I beſeech you, expect a long diſcourſe, although the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my misfortunes be infinit; for I will not Sir, abuſe your patience, but ſuccinctly let you know the cauſe of my diſpair; I was not five weeks ſince Counteſſe of Haute fleur, rich and beautifull enough, at leaſt as I thought, to cauſe my ſelf to be beloved of any, now ugly and more likely to fright people with my looks, then to beget the leaſt affection in their hearts, and deprived of all conveniences in the world, but what theſe trees do yield me for my ſuſtenance, and that of this maid which keeps me company, who not being ingratefull for ſome favours received of me in the time of my proſperity would needs bear a ſhare in my miſeries to comfort me. This is a ſtrange change, and ſuch as men might well wonder at, if they did not know that fortune diſpoſeth of all things, and that ſhe daily maketh greater metamorphoſis, but I will not lay the blame on her, becauſe I muſt confeſſe that all the fault was wholly in my ſelf; for if I had not given credit to the words of <hi>Ormand</hi> a yong Prince, and one of my neighbours, I might ſtill have flouriſhed amidſt the delights which thoſe of my condition daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. This Knight, valiant of his perſon, and fully compleat in all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that can render a Gentleman commendable, if he had been ſenſible of a lawfull affection, happening to be in a forreſt where I intended to ſpend
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17218:40"/>
ſome daies in hunting, was aſſailed by fowr Knights, who preſſed him very hard, and without queſtion would have laid him in his grave, if I had not chanced to come in during their combat, but unable to endure the ſight of ſo unequall a party, I went to his enemies, and curteouſly deſired them for my ſake to forbear, and to conſider that they much wronged the order of Knighthood, but they were ſo obſtinatly bent, as they would not give ear to me, wherwithall being diſpleaſed I commanded three Knights of my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to take the buſines in hand, which they did ſo fortunately as in leſſe then half an howr theſe arrogants were cut in pieces. That execution done, I was going towards <hi>Ormand,</hi> whom I had never ſeen before, meaning to invite him home with me, to have his wounds looked unto, but he prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and lifting up his cask ſaid unto me: You have Madam, nobly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved my life, which doubtleſſe was otherwiſe in my enemies power, but I deſire you will be pleaſed to imploy it in your ſervice, and not to ſpare it whenſoever you ſhall think me fit for any deſign of yours; I am heer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all acquaintance, and find my ſelf conſtrained to preſſe yet once more upon your goodneſſe, beſeeching you to ſpare me one of your ſervants for to guide me where I may have my bloud ſtanched, which runs out at three or fowr wounds. I ſhould but half oblige you if I ſhould leave you in the eſtate you are in; but Sir, I will make you ſee that I eſteem more of your life then you think for, wherfore go along with me and you ſhall find all that is needfull for you: wherupon departing with all ſpeed we got in leſſe then an howr to Heautefleur, where I put him into the hands of a Phyſician, that within a month ſo recovered him, as he was able to bear arms; during which time I viſited him daily, and finding him to be of a moſt gentle cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I conceived a certain kind of good will towards him, which converted into a violent love aſſoon as he had told me who he was, and that he had ſworn to affect me more then all the world beſide: I will not heer tell you the pleaſure I received in hearing him ſigh, nor the contentment I had in the praiſes he gave me; for taking all his actions for teſtimonies of his love and my merit, I felt ſuch infinit ſweetnes in his converſation, as all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights whatſoever were nothing to me in compariſon therof. To what end ſhould I ſpin out this diſcourſe any longer? Opportunities being fit, and our paſſions violent, I yielded him up that which I ought to have held moſt dear, under the aſſurance of a thouſand oaths that he made me to marry me publikely, when he had craved the conſent and permiſſion of his Father, whoſe authority he held not fit to be contemned; which ſeeming to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable, I gave him leave to return into his Country after he had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried five months with me, hoping that ere long he would have returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but the traitor never thinking more of his promiſes, but with ſorrow for that he had made them, and deſpiſing my careſſes becauſe he had too eaſily injoied them, not only refuſed to write to me, but having done a world of indignity to a Gentleman whom I ſent to preſſe his return and to advertiſe me of his health, he ſignified to me by word of mouth that the beauty of my Country, much more then that of my perſon, did make him deſire to reviſit it, but that it ſhould be with a powerfull army to annex it to thoſe eſtates that fortune had conferred upon him; and as for me that I ſhould do better to place my ſelf amongſt thoſe that attend the ſacrifices of the Gods, then to think of living any more to the world: Imagine, I pray you, what an aſtoniſhment I was in when the Gentleman delivered this unto

me: Verily, I had much ado to beleeve him, for remembring the loving ſpeeches that he had ſo often entertained me with, and the innumerable oaths that he had ſworn to me, I could not be perſwaded that his affection was entinguiſhed, and that he could be ſo fearles of the juſtice of heaven, but alas! I found to my grief, that the good opinion which I had of him did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe me; for adding effects to his words not long after, he invaded my Country with two and twenty thouſand men, ſeazed upon all the places that depended upon my command, except the Caſtle of Heautefleur, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into a Couſin of mine hath put himſelf with three thouſand foot reſolving to die or to keep it for me: but fearing to fall into the hands of this wicked wretch, who threatned to abandon me to the luſt of his ſouldiers, I rather choſe to make my retreat to this place then to ſerve once again for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſcorn. You are now, brave Knight, fully informed of my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat eſtate, which can have no end but with the loſſe of my life. In extream dangers Madam, ſaid <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> we muſt put on ſtrange reſolutions; your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries I confeſſe are great, yet do I not hold them paſt remedy, for you will be at quiet when this vile man ſhall be no longer living, and that may be within a few daies; the Heavens are juſt and alwaies armed for the defence of oppreſſed innocence, to whom I render humble thanks for bringing us hither to aſſiſt you in ſo juſt a quarrell, for the maintenance wherof, this Knight and my ſelf will either die or reinveſt you in your former greatnes. Is your Caſtle far from hence? But one daies journey replied ſhe. Be then aſſured, ſaid he, that your enemies ſhall ſhortly ſee us; in the mean time, keep you cloſe heer, that we may know where to give you an account of our proceedings when time ſhall ſerve: with that they tooke their leaves of her, and getting to horſe made ſuch ſpeed as they were at the Camp by break of day, and juſt as the enemies were raiſing of their ladders to aſſault the place; that occaſion ſeeming to favour their approach to the walls without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, they followed <hi>Ormand,</hi> and ſeeing thoſe of the Caſtle make a ſally at the very ſame inſtant even as they deſired, they preſently turned head and began the skirmiſh ſo luſtily as the ſouldiers on both ſides were amazed at it, <hi>Ruſsian</hi> adviſedly judging that the quiet of the Countrey depended upon the life or death of <hi>Ormand,</hi> perceiving him advance with certain troops, he diſcharged ſo dangerous a blow upon his helmet, that he overthrew him to the ground amongſt the feet of a thouſand horſes, but not willing to let him die in that maner, he cauſed him preſently to be taken up, and commanding two Knights to carry him to the Caſtle, they purſued their good fortune with ſuch fury as the enemies being in diſorder for want of their Generall, betook them to their heels, leaving above three thouſand dead upon the place. Thoſe of the Caſtle being by the direction of theſe two Knights, retired, there were bonefires made for joy of ſo remarkable a victory, but eſpecially for the taking of <hi>Ormand</hi> priſoner; who ſeeing himſelf in the hands of a people that had no cauſe to love him, could not well brok his misfortune, and did extreamly fear the diſpleaſure of the fair <hi>Iſolinda,</hi> for he could not beleeve that after ſo much ſcorn as he had put upon her, it was poſſible for her to continue her affection ſtill to him, nevertheles reſolving patiently to endure the worſt of fate, he expected what his enemies would determine of him. In the mean ſpace the two Knights not willing to loſe time, made all the garriſon to arm, leaving the inhabitants to favour their retreat if they were purſued, and determined to waken their enemies by the

The number of the dead being calculated on both ſides, it was found, that the Pagans had loſt ninety two thouſand men, with ſeven Giants, and the Princes <hi>Bruzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Florimond,</hi> and the Cariffe ſore wounded; the Chriſtians for their part having fifty ſeven thouſand men ſlain, <hi>Florizell</hi> and <hi>Alaſtraxerea</hi> both hurt, the one in the ſhoulder, the other in the arm.

To what end ſhould I ſpin out my diſcourſe any further, ſhe did ſo highly extoll the beauties and perfections of this Princeſſe, as I loved her before I ſaw her; ſo that I rode away moſt deſirouſly to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, whereinto I entred with much facility by the cunning and direction of this wench. I had a little affection to her before, as I told you, but as ſoone as I ſaw ſo many charms in the eyes of <hi>Arthemiſa,</hi> I reſerved no more power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſelfe, but well contented to preſent her with my liberty, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand it again. The King of Morcaſſia her father, was much afflicted to ſee the enemy ſo neer his walls, yet did he a little cheer up himſelfe when he ſaw in a skirmiſh that fell out two dayes after my arrivall, that my blows were weightier then thoſe of all his Knights, and that the King of Nicomena's people did no leſſe redoubt the incountring with me, then his did that of the Giant; whereupon he made extreamly much of me, all things were directed by my advice, but that which gave me moſt ſatisfaction, was that I ſaw <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themiſa</hi> did love me, and was delighted to ſee me ſigh at her feet. Leaving them with this tranquillity of minde, I accounted my ſelfe the moſt fortunate Knight of the earth, eſpecially when as a little after, I was the cauſe of all their happineſſe by the death of <hi>Baliſtan,</hi> ſo was their capitall enemy called, whom I ſlew in ſingle combat, routing afterward his whole army with a horrible ſlaughter. This victory gained me the hearts of the Morcaſſians, and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed me of the good graces of <hi>Arthemiſa,</hi> who, to tell you in few words, being no leſſe in love with me then I was with her, yeelded up herſelfe wholly unto me, and ſo made me taſte the ſweetneſſe which is found in the careſſes of an amorous woman.

The aſſurance that I had of the Kings favour, made me approve of her opinion, ſo that I went preſently to him, and putting him in minde of the ſervice I had done him, I beſought him to reward me for them by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Arthemiſa.</hi> Your vertue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, doth oblige me to give you all contentment; but firſt for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction both of my ſelf and my ſubjects, I deſire to know who you are.

were not the memory of your ſervices a bar to my diſpleaſure, I would make you feel what is due to the hate of your father. Think now, I beſeech you, how I was vexed at the hearing of theſe words, ſo contrary to my hope: In truth, I was ready to die, but my rage kept me alive to make him this reply.</p>
                     <p>Ingratefull King, thou haſt forgot that without my aſſiſtance thou hadſt now been a ſlave, and not knowing what curteſie means, thou refuſeſt me that which I have juſtly purchaſed; but thou ſhalt one day ſee what thy heady fury will avail thee, and that it had been more expedient for thee, to have paſt by the enmity which thou carrieſt to my father, and a thouſand times repent the little eſteem thou makeſt of me; for be aſſured, I know the way to abaſe what I have ſo generouſly exalted: Thou threateneſt me here in thine own Palace, but beware of comming neer me, for I carry the ſame ſword that ſpilt the bloud of thine enemies, and think not my courage any whit abated by two moneths reſt. Saying thus, I paſt into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, armed my ſelf, and mounting on horsback, I retired into a forreſt which was not far from thence, with a deſigne to return the ſame night, for to know of <hi>Arthemiſa,</hi> how I ſhould bear my ſelf in this affair: But alas! I found her not alive, for having been acquainted with the quarrell between her father and me, ſhe fell upon the floor with ſo violent a grief, as ſhe was therewith ſuffocated before ſhe could be ſuccoured: From hence proceeds the exceſſive ſorrow that I have now theſe three moneths endured, and from this ſo untimely death of hers, are thoſe hourly complaints deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which you have heard, and which I would have continued to the end of my dayes, had not your perſwaſions diverted me from them.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe ending with many ſighes, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> began afreſh to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, remonſtrating unto him, that a noble courage ought equally to receive the aſſaults and careſſes of fortune; and thus diſcourſing, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Army, which the unknown Knight liked very well of, when he knew the occaſion wherefore it was there. Not long after, <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the terme of the truce ready to expire, called the chiefeſt of his Commanders into his tent, and with a Majeſtick countenance, thus ſpake unto them: Excellent Princes, did not the bloud of the innocent rather move us to pity, then carry us to cruelty, I ſhould adviſe you once again to hazard that remainder of our men, which the fury of our enemies hath left us, and ſeek in their deſtruction the honour of an happy victory; but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee them ſuffer ſo for the ſatisfying of our pleaſure, I am of opinion, that it is beſt our quarrell be determined by a company of ſelected perſons, and that we ſhould ſecure our people with the venture of our lives; I am the authour of this propoſition, and therefore it is reaſon, that I alſo ſhould be the firſt in the danger. Our adverſaries are valiant, it is true, and all the world aſcribes to them the glory of knowing how to fight well; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we have heer ſo many brave ſpirits, that we need not fear to meet them with equall number, for otherwiſe, the good conduct of their armies will make them alwayes triumphant; let us then arm three or four of us againſt ſo many of the Greek Princes, and let not the reſt that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the fight be troubled, for it ſhall be no leſſe glory to be placed in the government of an Army, then to diſpute the honour of acombat; I deſire to be the firſt, the unknown Knight ſhall ſecond me, the other two may be elected: If my advice be good, you may follow it; if not, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

The third day being come, with the incredible content of the Combatants, they preſented themſelves in the field, armed at all parts, and expected nothing but the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to charge their lances, when as they ſaw two Damſels enter, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly addreſſing themſelves to the Princes of Greece, demanded a boon of them.

As I live, ſaid he, you ſhall not be denied, for I am too ſenſible of the favours which I received from her at that time, ſpeak onely, and let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That which I deſire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſhe, is, that you will follow me preſently, together with theſe three Knights that accompany you, to the end you may give her what then you promiſed her.

No, no, replied ſhe ſtraight, they are as much obliged to me by promiſe, as you are, and will not make any difficulty to defer the combat to another time. No indeed, ſaid <hi>Spheramond,</hi> who was come to them, ſince we are ingaged thereunto by our oath; howbeit, you ſhall do us a ſingular favour, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have told you, anſwered <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> that I will never decline your Miſtreſſes commands; let us then proceed in the way, ſince you will have it ſo, and let theſe Lords take the other; herewith, imbracing with ſome ſhew of ſorrow, they parted, and followed their guides.

Thereat <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who lent an attentive ear to her diſcourſe, lift up his eies and ſaw two Dwarfs, the one upon the faireſt courſer in the world, the other much leſſe, and more deformed, with a great pack on his back: This, ſaid ſhe, taking the horſe by the bridle, and preſenting it unto him, is that which now ſhe gives you; ſhe will not change your arms, becauſe they are excellent, but knowing that you deſire others, for that you would not be known, ſhe hath committed a ſecret unto me to quench theſe burning co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; whereupon, pouring a violl of water upon them, ſhe rendered them quite black; but ſo poliſhed, as one might ſee himſelf in them. This now, continued ſhe, doth repreſent the grief you are in, for that you do not know who you are, and remember I tell you that theſe arms ſhall not loſe this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour till you be known; at which time they ſhall re-aſſume their ardent flames to make you burn with a new fire, and be aſſured that this change will not let you doubt of your diſſent, when you ſhall call to minde theſe my words: Now this is all that you may learn from me at this preſent. As for you, brave Knight, ſpeaking to the unknown, you may beleeve that ſhe loves you alſo, and for ſome inſtance thereof, ſhe hath commanded me to preſent you with theſe arms, which are in this pack, that are far fitter for the adventures you are to undergo, then thoſe you have on you; you ſhall do well to accept of them from her accordingly, and to be confident that they will be very uſefull to you; you may not leave this way, becauſe it is not without a myſterie that you are brought into it, and doing that which belongs to the duty of good Knights, yield more to the glory of your name, then to your paſſions. Saying ſo, ſhe vaniſhed away, together with the Dwarfs, leaving the horſe under <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> and the arms upon the back of the unknown Knight.</p>

I am perſwaded, ſaid he to himſelfe, that I am the ſon of ſome Chriſtian Prince, and I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think ſo: for this Lady, that favours my enterpriſes, would not now twice have diverted me from fighting with thoſe famous Knights of Greece, if I might have done it without offence: Moreover, if I call to minde the ſpeech of that old man whom I met withall the ſame day I received the order of Knighthood; and at my coming to the Crown of Canabea, I cannot doubt of it: for the moſt part of my Barons do affirm, that the Queen <hi>Florella,</hi> my mother, contracted a marriage in private with the brother of the greateſt Prince of Chriſtendome, and for that onely conſideration, did they put the Scepter into my hands, as being the lawfull heire of the countries under her obedience. If it be ſo, I ought to ſerve them, and not ſeek to ruine them by my Arms. But what do I ſay? Serve them? that were to be baſe, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of indignities; They have beguiled the ſimplicity of an amorous woman, and made her ardours ſerve to end her life: wherefore me thinks it were more reaſonable for me to loſe my ſelfe with her, then leave this crime unpuniſhed. Howbeit, there is no remedy for that which is paſt, and my revenge would but increaſe my griefe and ſhame: things therefore muſt be left as they are, and I muſt labour to finde out the truth of the matter, rather then run indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly into actions of perpetuall repentance. Having been long entertained with theſe thoughts, he came to himſelf, and cheering the unknown Knight, who was no leſſe tranſported with his imaginations, they continued on their way till night, which they paſſed in a ſound ſleep under the trees after they had fed on ſuch cates as their Squires had provided.

Behold, ſaid <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goran,</hi> a new miracle for us, and the Gods ſeem to authorize our enterprizes, yet I fear our teeth will grow longer, if our fortune do not the ſooner bring us to ſome land: for I am exceeding hungry already.

Having travelled ſo an howr, with all the content that might be, they arrived neer to a mountain, on the top whereof they ſaw one of the moſt ſtately Caſtles in the world; five towers equally diſtant an hundred &amp; fifty paces one from the other, framed on the fore-front of the building, whoſe walls were of white and black Marble, and the covering of a mettall ſo gliſtering, as one could not behold it with leſſe pain then the Sun. Between theſe towres an hall appeared, ſo high, as it ſeemed to ſurpaſſe the clouds; and the gardens made all in diſcent, poſſeſſed them with an extream deſire to be in ſo ſweet a place.

                     <p>This adventure, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> is queſtionleſſe reſerved for us: for you are unknown by name, and I by birth: wherefore I am perſwaded, the Deſtinies have eſtabliſhed it for our glory, let us proceed then if you pleaſe, and ſee what is promiſed us: So going to the bridge, they perceived a little ſtream running under it, that ſeemed to be ſwoln with the bloud of a great many murdered perſons. O me! ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> how much doth this object ſo full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour abaſe the glory of theſe proud buildings, which doubtleſſe were not ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but to draw Knights hither, and then to deſtroy them; nevertheleſſe I will increaſe the number of thoſe that are here ſacrificed, or overthrow the power of it. Scarcely had he ſpoken thus, when as he ſaw coming in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes, a furious Giant with a mighty club in his hand, and the moſt dreadfull Serpent that can be imagined; he was covered all over with green ſcales, that were proofe againſt the cuttingſt ſteele in the world; his throat, whereinto a man might eaſily enter ſeemed to be a fornace, and the ground was ſo violently beaten by his tail, eight foot in length, that it trembled round about him. <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> whoſe courage was incapable of feare, thinking the defeat of this creature more difficult then that of the Giant, marched againſt him, leaving the other combat to his companion, and inſtantly diſcharged ſo mighty a blow on his head, that he was conſtrained with it to ſhut his mouth, which before he held wide open to devour him. The Knight much vexed for having imployed ſo much force in vain, ſtruck him again on the body with ſuch violence, that he made him recoil three or four paces back. Now this

blow ſerving but to incenſe him the more, he flew upon him ſo furiouſly, as he overthrew him to the earth, tearing his ſhield from his arm. Fear doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with wings, and many times is cauſe of our preſervation: <hi>Fulgoran</hi> finding himſelfe in that plight, and without a ſhield, was in ſome doubt of his life; but ſuddenly getting up, and feeling his ſtrength increaſe with his chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, he gave the Serpent ſuch a ſmart thruſt in his eye, as he paſſed his ſword a foot deep into his head. The beaſt growing mad with the pain of his wound, made three or four ſteps back, and with his huge long tail ſmote the Knight ſo terribly on the helmet, that he was once more compelled to kiſſe the ground with an opinion that a tower had fallen upon him; the violence of the blow having ſomewhat aſtoniſhed him, he was not able preſently to riſe, ſo that the Serpent ſeeing him lying along, leapt to him, and ſeizing on him with his teeth laboured to bite his armour in pieces; but <hi>Fulgoran</hi> that had not loſt his judgement gave him another thruſt where there were no ſcales, running his ſword up to the hilts in his belly. The pangs of death making this fierce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fall off three or four paces from him, the Knight much troubled to behold himſelfe without a ſword, ſtood in a maze, when as Fortune preſented him with the means, not onely to ſave himſelfe, but to conquer alſo: for the Giant, that combated the unknown Knight, being exceedingly vexed to ſee his bloud trickle out from divers parts of his body, came up ſo cloſe to him, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcharge a blow on his enemies head, he bit his arm on his helmet with ſuch force, that it quite ſtund it, ſo that his club fell out of his hand cloſe by <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who ſpeedily catching of it up, gave the Serpent ſuch a deadly ſtroke with it juſt between both the eyes, as his brains flew out. This victory, as glorious as little expected, ſerving but to increaſe his courage, he turned him about, having firſt plucked his ſword out of the Serpents belly, to go unto the ſuccour of the unknown Knight, but perceiving his adverſaries head at his feet, he went and ſate him down on a great ſtone to take breath, thinking that ſo painful a beginning would have a more difficult ending. The deſire he had to ſee the iſſue of this adventure, and the glory which he hoped for from it, not ſuffering him long to reſt, he aroſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> little after, and paſſing under another Arch which he ſaw on his left hand, he was ready to enter into a little wood, when as he perceived ten hideous Salvages come out of it, whereof five began to aſſault him terribly with their maſſie clubs, the other five giving the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Knight the ſame welcome; who finding himſelfe amongſt ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, was in ſome doubt of his life: nevertheleſſe, reſolving to ſell it dearly, he beſtirred himſelfe with much valour and dexterity. But it much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him for that his ſword could not make way thorow the ſhaggy hair of theſe monſters, which cruſhed his bones with their heavie clubs. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide <hi>Fulgoran</hi> laid fearfully about him: for deſiring either to dye or to vanquiſh, he had already overthrown two of them dead at his feet, defending himſelf couragiouſly from the reſt that preſſed him with incredible fury. The combat being in this dangerous eſtate, the unknown Knight enraged for that he could not as yet ſee any bloud drawn from his enemies, gave one of them ſuch a thruſt in the belly, as he ran him quite thorow and thorow, laying him dead on the graſſe; but he had not time to rejoyce at this his lucky diſpatch of that monſter, for the reſt charged him at the very ſame inſtant with two ſuch cruell blows, as they extended him on the earth quite void of ſenſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving then that he was dead, they yelled forth ſuch a dreadfull cry, as the whole Iſland reſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17218:51"/>
for to ſee whence it might proceed, perceived the misfortune of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, whereat he was ſo exceedingly incenſed, that taking his ſword in both hands, he diſcharged it ſo forcibly upon one of them, as the hair not able to withſtand the edge thereof, it divided his head in two pieces; whereupon, not regarding the reſt, he ran ſuddenly to the unknown Knight, whom his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were a diſarming; and carried with the ſame fury as before, he ſtruck one of them ſo terribly on the ſhoulder, as he cut him down to the very girdle. The other three beholding this terrible blow, preſently forſook their former man, and joyning with them that remained, they aſſailed him ſo furiouſly, that they gave him no leave to breathe, their ſtrokes deſcending ſo thick upon him, as his ſhield ſeemed to be an anvill whereon 5 or 6 Smiths were a hammering. Seeing himſelf preſſed in this ſort, &amp; fearing that at length he ſhould fall under the weight of theſe ſtrokes, he began to retire by little and little towards the Arch, that ſo he might avoid fighting with them all at once, when as a big Knight in gray Armour preſented himſelfe, who ſeeing the inequality of this fray, drew out his ſword, and therewith charged one of the Salvages with ſuch ſtrength, as he ſent his club arm and all unto the ground; not contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he gave another ſuch a thruſt juſt in the throat, as the point of his ſword came out at the nape of his neck, laying him dead on the graſſe. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> no leſſe amazed then pleaſed with the valour of this new commer, took his ſword again in both hands, and fearing leſt the glory of this adventure might be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from him, he ſtruck one of them that purſued him very hard, with ſuch violence on the thigh, as cut it ſheere off, placing him in the number of thoſe that live not. The two that ſtill remained, beholding the horrible butchery of thir companions, would have ſaved themſelves by flight; howbeit they were followed ſo cloſe by the two Knights, as their deaths were not deferred but to the third blow they received. This victory being thus gloriouſly obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> going to the grey Knight, ſpake in this manner: Noble ſir, I muſt render that unto your valour which all the world cannot refuſe you, and give you thanks for my deliverance: if I live, it is through you, but I will gladly ſpend ſo much bloud for your ſervice as you have now preſerved in my body; purſue the good fortune which brought you hither, the glory of this adventure is reſerved for you, and the beginning that I have given to it, ſhall not make me deſire to oppoſe your enterprize. I have not done any thing, ſir, anſwered he embracing him, for your ſuccour, but what the Law of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood commanded me. So many enemies as you have extended heer on the earth, and that dreadfull ſerpent which lies dead yonder, are aſſured teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that you can vanquiſh without me, and defeat your enemies without my aſſiſtance; wherefore I will never attribute unto my ſelfe the honour due to your courage, which verily is more then humane, but ſhall be glad to go on with you, and in all things be governed by your command: Herewith they embraced again, and were diſpoſing of themſelves to proceed in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, when as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> bethinking him of his companion, went preſently unto him, to ſee whether he were yet in caſe to receive any ſervice from him. Having then unlaced his helmet, he found his face all covered with bloud, but yet was much cheered to ſee him ſtill breathe. Courage, ſaid he unto him, our enemies are ſlain, and you revenged for the outrage they did you. This victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, anſwered he ſomewhat faintly, would be a great contentment unto me, were I ſure that it had not coſt you too much of your bloud. I feel much pain, replied <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> from ſo many blowes that I have received; but the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17218:51"/>
Clubs being unable to to pierce my Armes, I have not loſt one drop of bloud, the only thing that now troubles me, is to ſee you ſo ill. It is true, anſwered he, that I am very light headed, but time wil reſtore me my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with my ſtrength, and if our Squires were heer to tend me, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded I ſhould be well again in a little time. <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him, ran incontinently to the firſt Arch of the bridge to call them, and leaving him in their hands, he paſſed on with the gray Knight, till they came to the Marble walls, where they parted upon the encounter of two wayes, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> taking that on the right hand, and the gray Knight the left; going then on, with wonder to ſee ſo ſtrong walls, and dangerous guards, they came much about the ſame time unto two gates, the gray Knight to that on the weſt ſide, and <hi>Fulgoran</hi> to the other that looked towards the Sun riſing, ſo that the ſound of their knocking was heard both at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, whereupon the gates flew open with a moſt dreadfull noyſe; which notwithſtanding, ſtayed not from entring in with their ſhields on their arms, and their ſwords in their hands: But they had not made three ſteps, when as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> ſaw one of the hugeſt and moſt deformed Giants that might be, advance towards him with an Axe of ten foot long, which he diſcharged at his head, with a confident beliefe to cleave him to the middle, notwithſtanding the goodneſſe of his Arms; howbeit he nimbly avoided the blow by leaping aſide, ſo that it lighted upon the ground, whereinto it entred a great dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This ſtroke bringing death with it, the Giant tumbled preſently down, but with ſuch ill fortune for <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> as he fell under him, being almoſt ſtifled with the weight of his body: nevertheleſſe, collecting all his forces together, he ſo heaved at his dead enemy, that he turned him aſide, thereby clearing himſelfe of ſuch an heavie burthen; howbeit he was conſtrained to ſit down and reſt himſelfe till he was raiſed again by a new occaſion.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the gray Knight was not idle, for paſſing in juſt when <hi>Fulgoran</hi> did, he was incountered with a furious Bull, and a moſt fearfull Dragon, which ſhewing him his teeth, that were a cubit long, and as ſharp as a razor, menaced him with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17218:52"/>
had not the Bull, leaping and bounding, gone a good way from him to fetch his courſe with the more fury at him, gave him leiſure to riſe, but in ſo due a ſeaſon, as with a light leap he avoided the ſecond incounter of his horns, upon the point whereof he thought the hazard of his life did hang: not willing to ſticke in ſo fair a way, he made as though he would ſtand his return, but ſtepping aſide, he ſtruck him ſo right upon the neck, that he cut it half in ſunder, letting him run about the court with the pangs of death, which was not long deferred, for paſſing by <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who then was up, he received another blow in the very ſame place, which laid his head upon the earth. The two Knights, that ſaw not one another, the houſe being between them, having no more imployment below, went up by two pair of ſtairs, and found themſelves, the gray Knight in one of the faireſt chambers that ever he had ſeen, and <hi>Fulgoran</hi> in a hall, where the firſt object that his eyes lighted on, was the beautifull wife of <hi>Dardanor,</hi> chained in a corner, half naked, and almoſt covered over with bloud. Good Gods, ſaid he, ſtepping a little back! Where am I? Do I not ſee <hi>Clairangia,</hi> the Queen of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as well as of Romeria, in chains, that are onely fit for ſlaves? Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! Thoſe that have thus intreated you, underſtand not your merit: But do not, I beſeech you, afflict your ſelf any further, See heer your <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who vows by all the Deities, that he adores, either to revenge your wrongs, or to die with you. Alas! ſaid ſhe with a ſigh, and no leſſe rapt with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, then delight, to ſee this Knight there, whom ſhe loved as much as her life, it is moſt true, that the Gods never forſake them that in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions crave their aid: Dear friend, I alwayes hoped that my freedom would be procured by your hand, and though the ſtrength of this place was very great, yet I beleeved that your vertue could meet with nothing able to reſiſt it: you are come juſt as it ſhould be, for I had not long to live, the torments I ſave ſuffered have been ſo grievous, as I wonder how I could have patience to endure them: You are doubly bound to a revenge; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know not yet this ſecret, I muſt tell you that our private careſſes at Celibana, made my belly ſo to ſwell, that you may ſee good teſtimony of it ere it be long; howbeit, <hi>Dardanor</hi> was free from all ſuſpition of it, till an old Sorcereſſe, ſiſter to the King of the frozen Iſles, who died at the great battell of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> came into the Court the ſame day that he returned from the warre of Greece, and ſaid to him: Knoweſt thou (King of Romeria) that thy wife is with child of a ſon, which is none of thine, and that ſhall one day, when he comes to know his father, ruine the Altars of the Gods whom we adore? No, thy knowledge doth not extend ſo far; but for that I am obliged to preſerve the Pagan name, I came to thee to advertiſe thee of the affront done unto thee. And the better to clear this point, remember the Count of China, he ſpake but out of ſuſpition, yet was his accuſation moſt true, and therefore would adviſe thee to choak this brat before it be able to do miſchiefe; but becauſe it would be a diſhonour for thee to defile thy hands in the bloud of thy wife, leave thy revenge to me, and give me permiſſion to puniſh her my way: you know the violent humour of <hi>Dardanor.</hi> This diſcourſe having rekindled the diſpleaſure that he had conceived againſt me, at the time when you delivered me, he preſently put me into this womans hand, who making me go with her into a Chariot drawn by four Griffions, brought me to this houſe, chained me by the neck, as now you ſee me, and ever ſince hath daily whipped me with rods, threatning to put me and my child to one of the cruelleſt deaths
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17218:52"/>
that ever was ſeen, which ſhe would queſtionleſſe have done long ſince, but that ſhe ſtill told me, how the ſtars did not as yet give way to her deſires, ſo as I beleeve our lives are limitted by the onely pleaſure of the gods. This is a caſe, anſwered <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> whereof we are not now to ſpeak; let us rather ſeek out this old witch, to puniſh her as ſhe deſerves: But pardon me, Madam, if this deſire be more preſſing with me, then the care of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you now from theſe chains, for ſo long as ſhe lives, we ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but troubles here, I will therefore purſue that buſineſſe with all the ſpeed I may: So making obeiſance to his Lady, he went up a little paire of ſtairs, which carried him to the top of the houſe, where at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming he eſpied this Enchantreſſe, drawing figures and characters upon the floor. As I live, ſaid he, old Megara, taking her faſt by the hair, which hung about her ears, your devils ſhall not now ſerve your turn, but you ſhall give an account of your cruelty to a Lady which you have held ſo long heer in fetters: Dragging her then down the ſtairs, he came into the hall, at the end whereof he ſaw a Knight, who comming upon the cry of that Sorcereſſe, ſaid: Ah, Sir Knight, do not imploy your ſelf in fighting with a woman. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> mad angry, to ſee his revenge deferred, gave her ſuch a blow upon the ſtomack, as he laid her half dead upon the floor; and not conſidering, that the Knight which ſpake to him, was the ſame, who ſo lately had afflicted him, and that forced by the charms of this woman was come thither, laid hand on his ſword, and began ſo cruell a combat with him, that all the hall rang with the noiſe of their blows, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> fought very bravely, for that the preſervation of his Miſtris was in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but his oppoſite was ſo ſtout, as he durſt not hope for the victory, which put him in ſuch a rage, as he redoubled his blows with infinite vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but he was no leſſe preſſed by his adverſary, who charged him ſo fiercely, that he did not remember he had ever been ſo harldly laid to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were when he fought with <hi>Floriſel</hi> about the death of <hi>Balard;</hi> the combat growing furious, through their choler, they continued in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner almoſt three hours, without diſcerning to whom fortune would be moſt favourable: But as they were in this diſpute, the old woman gat up, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and thinking to eſcape into her Cabinet, where the prime of all her charms remained, caſt her ſelf between the Knights, who having their ſwords advanced to charge one another, did let them deſcend in one inſtant upon her head, which they divided into three or four pieces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the earth trembled, and the foundations of that building, which were laid by Art Magick, were ſcattered with a thunder clap; the Knights finding themſelves in the field, wondered much at their combat, which they well remembered, and much more that they ſaw neither marble nor towers, but onely the bodies of the Savages, of the Giants, and the monſters, which were naturall, and not forged, an infinite number of bones of men, devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thoſe creatures, <hi>Clairangia</hi> bound to a tree, with thirty or forty Knights in the ſame plight hard by her, and the body of the Sorcereſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as I have told you; <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who had nothing more preſſing, then the misfortune of his Miſtris, ran preſently to her, cut the cords that tied her, beſought her to accept the deſire he had to do her ſervice, and not be troubled though her habits were not ſutable to her royall greatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>I am, ſaid ſhe, ſo contented to ſee my ſelf free, and ſo neer to you, as I no more complain of my paſſed torments; Let us onely think of getting

out of this place, and afterwards we will conſider of the means to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the ingratitude of a man, that did not merit the honour of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as well as we are delivered from her whoſe malice ſought our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whilſt theſe diſcourſes were re-inkindling the fires of their former loves, the gray Knight unbound all thoſe priſoners, whom that hag had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a torture far worſe then death; and finding amongſt them four very young, and exceeding handſome, he courteouſly demanded of them, whence they were: We are, ſaid one of them, Chriſtian Princes, knighted but a few moneths ſince, but ſo infortunate in the beginning of our arms, (being unhappily fallen upon this place, where without your aid we had certainly found our graves) as we cannot hardly ſay, that we have given the leaſt proof of the valour which our fathers demonſtrated in an age far younger then ours; This firſt is called <hi>Leonidas,</hi> ſon to <hi>Aſtibel</hi> of Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia, the next is <hi>Abies</hi> of Ireland, ſon to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> the third is <hi>Frizell</hi> of Arcadia, ſon to <hi>Giorntes,</hi> nephew to the good King <hi>Liſard,</hi> and my ſelf am an Amaſon, daughter to <hi>Celafia,</hi> of whom perhaps, you have ſometimes heard: We came, drawn by the beauty of the place, into theſe parts, were made priſoners by the Giants or the Savages, and are now all diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſerve you, ſince your valour hath given us the means ſo to do. The gray Knight, finding himſelf obliged by this offer, very curteouſly thanked them, and knowing them to be Chriſtians, left them to the liberty of their actions, departing from them to <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who having not ſeen him yet without his helmet, ſpake thus unto him: Brave warrior, It is time, me thinks, that I ſhould know him, to whom I ow ſo much ſervice; be pleaſed then to tell me your name, and to let me ſee your face. I cannot, anſwered he, refuſe you ſo ſmall a requeſt; and now you ſee me, ſaid he, taking off his helmet, and diſcovering a face, brown indeed, but grave and amiable, as might be wiſhed; but if I muſt proceed farther, and tell you alſo who I am, you ſhall know that I am called <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> ſon to the great Emperour of Aethiopia, and more pleaſed with your acquaintance, then with the poſſeſſion of the beſt part of the world; with that they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and letting the young Knights depart in <hi>Prigmaleons</hi> Frigot, they went to the unknown Knight, who was now well recovered, and ſo all three, with <hi>Clairangia,</hi> imbarked themſelves in <hi>Fulgorans</hi> veſſell, which with its wonted celerity, made to the main ſea, whilſt they were furniſhed with good meat for their repaſt, and good beds for their repoſe.</p>

Commanding then his Fleet to go on, toward the evening the Army drew into order within a bow ſhot of them, giving <hi>Fulgoran</hi> time for the effecting of his deſigne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he departed in the ſame Bark that brought him thither, onely with his two friends, and the faire Queen of Romeria in his company. And holding up a gantlet in ſigne of parly, he went aboord the Admirall, where all the principall commanders were aſſembled; and adreſſing himſelfe in particular to ſome that he knew, holding <hi>Clairangia</hi> by the hand, he ſo well remonſtrated their duty unto them, that they all ſubmitted to her as their Soveraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, proteſting they were never ſo much diſcontented with any thing as her abſence. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> infinitely pleaſed to ſee a new oath of allegeance unto her, and the affection that her ſubjects did beare her, beſought her to give him leave to returne to the Chriſtian Army, that hee might give <hi>Dorigel</hi> thanks for his aſſiſtance, which ſhe could not well refuſe him; yet granted it upon his promiſe of returning the next morning to conduct her into Romeria with a troop there to poſſeſſe him of the crown thereof, together with her ſelfe.

Herewith they drew out their ſwords, and began to march toward the enemy: But they met one of the Giants, with five and twenty halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, comming to ſtop their paſſage, which <hi>Fulgoran</hi> conſidering, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the big Knight would not be able longer to endure the violence of ſo many oppoſites, fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The great Knight ſeeing himſelf ſo opportunely ſeconded, quickly got out of the water, and thruſting himſelf into the midſt of thoſe raſcalls, in a ſhort time laid ſeven or eight of them at his feet, imitating <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who to their horrour, making them feel both the edge and point of his ſword, cut halberts, ſhields, cuiraſſes, murrions, in pieces, ſo that in a little while he had ſtrewed the ground with armour that he had hewen in ſunder, and with arms, legs, and heads, that he divided from bodies. Thoſe which remained, ſeeing with what rage theſe Knights did maſſacre them, fled with all ſpeed into the Caſtle, and quickly locked themſelves up therein, expecting what fortune would befall their companions: In the mean time, <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> combatted <hi>Scarafand</hi> (one of the moſt furious Giants of the earth) with ſo much valour, as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> was amazed at it; for he had made ſo many breaches in his arms, as he had ſcarce any bloud left in him; ſo that he fell by the violence of a blow that lighted on his helmet, at the ſame time that <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> and the great Knight, beholding the unknown

And how am I ingaged to theſe Sages, by whoſe direction our ſhip hath been guided to this Iſland, ſince by my arrivall here I receive ſuch a benefit? My dear friend, <hi>Grandimore,</hi> I never thought to finde you in ſuch danger, and I was amazed at the valour which you ſhewed in your combat with ſo many mighty enemies; yet, having otherwhere ſeen grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof thereof, I cannot doubt, but in the end, the victory would have been yours though the number of them were exceſſive: Nevertheleſſe, I heartily thank the Gods for bringing me hither, where I might in ſome ſort requite you for that which you did for me, when you undertook the combat againſt the Count of Clina in my behalf. At theſe words, <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimore,</hi> who till then knew him not, opened his arms, and embracing him with much affection, remained a good while unable to ſpeak, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of joy, but when his tongue was at liberty, he ſaid: My content in thus meeting you, is no leſſe then that you teſtifie in beholding of me: My Lord, I wandered about the world onely to ſeek you, that I might do you ſervice; and beleeve me, I am not more glad of the ſaving of my life (which is preſerved onely by your valour, and that of theſe brave war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All of them agreeing with him in opinion, they advanced toward the Caſtle, which they found cloſe ſhut againſt them; and not knowing how to get in, they promiſed life to as many as were there; when as a horrible Gianteſſe, who was come out of a ſecret poſtern, came behinde <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> and ſtruck him ſo mighty a blow with a mace, that ſhe laid him quite aſtoniſhed in the duſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling <hi>Fulgorans</hi> helmet, before he could ward it with his ſhield, ſhe left him in the ſame eſtate, which put <hi>Grandimore</hi> in ſuch a rage, as laying hand on his ſword, without remembring her ſex, he diſcharged a blow at her head with ſuch violence, as he clove her in ſunder to the girdle; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ran preſently to <hi>Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And having gone a while under ground, he met with a pair of ſtairs, which brought him into a great court, where he ſaw a young Giant, of eight or ten yeers old, with three Knights, and the four villains, that had ſaved themſelves by flight, buſily imployed in bringing pieces of wood to rampire up the gate

againſt <hi>Grandimores</hi> blows; The ratling that his arms made comming into the Court, cauſed the Knights to turn unto him, when as thinking that ſome other followed him, they preſently fell on their knees, craved their lives; which was freely granted them, upon condition the priſoners ſhould be opened, and all that were there detained ſet at liberty. This promiſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured them, they opened to <hi>Grandimore,</hi> whoſe chiefeſt care being to ſatisfie the Gentlewoman, he commanded all the priſoners to be brought forth, which were about threeſcore, as well men as women, the moſt part of whom had been deflowred by the two Giants, and then caſt into the dungeon. The Knight, which was the occaſion of this enterpriſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out with the reſt, and knowing how much he was obliged to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, whom he alſo loved, beſought theſe Knights that he might marry her before they left the Caſtle, which was granted them, to their infinite content. The priſoners being freed, and the Knights having need of ſome reſt, they went up into the lodgings, after they had committed the charge of the Caſtle to <hi>Celiſdan,</hi> (ſo was the Gentlewomans ſweet heart called) and renewing their careſſes, they related their adventures, with as much ſatisfaction as wonder to all the company: In ſuch diſcourſe they paſſed away the time till ſupper, after which every man retired to his reſt, till two howrs after midnight, that the Sentinell came, and awaking them, declared, how he had ſeen a chariot, drawn with ſix great horſes, go by, wherein were five or ſix women, that made the ſtrangeſt moan in the world, the fear of two dreadfull Giants, and twenty Knights, that rode by, and threatened them, not being able to make them hold their peace. Theſe Princes, alwayes forward to ſuccour ſuch as were in diſtreſſe, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this intelligence, inſtantly aroſe, and commanding the grooms to make ready the beſt horſes that the Giants had in the ſtable, armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all ſpeed poſſible, and guided by a fair and clear moon-light, followed the way that the Sentinell had ſhewed them; when as they had ridden hard two howrs and better, about day break they came to a port, where they found the horſes and the chariot, but that empty, and without any to guide it: This ſomewhat troubled them, but when they eſpied not far off a ſhip, newly under ſail, they preſently conjectured, that they whom they ſought for were aboord her, wherewith they were extreamly vexed, becauſe they could not ſuccour thoſe afflicted women: Whilſt they looked one at another, without ſpeaking, as it were lamenting their want of ſome veſſell to carry them; <hi>Fulgoran</hi> turning about, deſcried a Bark afar off, which comforted him a little, eſpecially when he obſerved, that it ſtood right with them: but when it was come neerer, and that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be the ſame in which he had navigated ſo long before, he quickly alighted, and addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Prigmaleon;</hi> See, Sir, ſaid he, our friends do not leave us without their aſſiſtance; behold heer our little Bark which comes ſo pat for us to purſue theſe theeves according to our deſire; Let us loſe no time then, but make uſe of the occaſion that ſo favourably preſents it ſelf; whereupon, having all left their horſes, they preſently with their Squires got aboord the veſſell, which not tarrying for any other lading, put off ſtraight to ſea, following the ſhip where the Giants were, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite contentment of the Knights, who entertained the time with diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the admirable knowledge of thoſe Sages, which in this ſort were able to command the winds, and order the inconſtancy of that mercileſſe

element, highly commending the care which they ſhewed in directing all their deſignes onely to the honouring of vertue. The one half of the day being pleaſingly ſpent in theſe diſcourſes, they ſaw the ſhip which they had in chaſe, grapled with another, and hearing a terrible noiſe, preſently conjectured that it proceeded from the fight of ſome Knights, who meeting with the Giants, and not enduring the lamentation of thoſe captive women, had ſet upon them, with a reſolvtion to revenge their wrongs. That conceit having put them in a readineſſe, they immediatly came up cloſe to thoſe veſſels, in one of the which they ſaw onely four Knights, two very big, who had taken the Giants to taske, and other two of a leſſer proportion, that oppoſed the fury of twenty ſtrong Knights. The courage wherewith theſe four Knights maintained the combat giving them exceeding ſatisfaction, they ſtood a good while looking on them, admiring the horrible blows of the firſt four, and the gracefull activity which the other two ſhewed in holding ſo many play: But doubting their too long ſtay might perhaps be prejudiciall to theſe four brave warriors, they leapt into the Giants ſhip in deſpight of their Knights reſiſtance. And at the firſt boording of it laid four of them upon the deck, which might have affrighted the reſt, if one of the Giants, ſeeing that ſlaughter, had not left his enemy almoſt deprived of ſenſe, with a mighty blow that he gave him, come in to their ſuccor; his preſence animating them they began to fly upon our Knight with more fury then before, whilſt their Maſter combated <hi>Grandimore:</hi> But being fallen into the hands of the moſt valiant Knights in the world, their utmoſt indeavour nothing availed them; for within a while, the hatches were covered with their armour cut in a thouſand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the water, with heads and quarters which every minute they made flie over boord, ſo as none remained alive ſave the two Giants, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their troops defeated, redoubled their blows with ſuch fury, as the Knights were amazed at it; but ſtraining themſelves to diſcharge their blows with their utmoſt force, cauſed the bloud to iſſue ſo abundantly out of the many wounds they had received, that they both fell down dead, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at one inſtant, the one at the feet of <hi>Grandimore,</hi> and the other into the ſea, by the valour of him with whom he fought.
<hi>Fulgoran</hi> then with <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> advanced towards the Knights to ſalute them, but hearing a great noiſe in their own ſhip, they ſuddenly turned about, and ſeeing the unknown Knights Squire fallen into the ſea, they all made what haſte they could to ſave him: which when they had done, and taken him up, their ſhip flew off from the other, with ſuch celerity, as the Knights had no time either to give them thanks for their aſſiſtance, or to enquire of their names and fortunes. Now whilſt their Bark carried them away in this ſort to a Port of Greece, where within two dayes after they arrived, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding contentment of <hi>Grandimore,</hi> that was ſore wounded, and had none in their veſſell who knew how to cure him: The other Conquerours, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving romaged the Giants ſhip, met with a moſt beautifull Lady, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſix maids, ſo ſad and disfigured with the fear they were in, that there appeared no bloud in their faces: Going then to comfort her, and bringing her forth into the light, one of the Knights kneeling down, and kiſſing her hand, ſaid unto her: Madam, put away all fear, for your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are dead, and heer are none but ſuch as onely breathe for your ſafety.

                     <p>Ah, dear Nephew, ſaid ſhe, imbracing and kiſſing him with much affection, this miſhap did not befall me in France, but in an Iſland of this ſea, whether a ſtorm had driven me, with thirty Gentlemen that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on me, who gave but too good proof of their fidelity; for after they had ſlain one of three Giants, and twelve Knights, they maintained the fight with the reſt to the laſt gaſp: I was going by the conſent of the Prince <hi>Lucendus</hi> my husband, who intends to follow me preſently, towards Conſtantinople; but my voiage was at an end, and my life at the laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, had I not met with you.

Meſſengers were therefore ſent into every quarter, that theſe firſt magnificences, after the death of ſo many Princes, might be the more glorious, and that thoſe which ſurvived, might in this ſort demonſtrate, that their courages were nothing abated by afflictions.

The firſt day of the Iuſts being come, and <hi>Florizell</hi> of Niquea ſet at Table with all thoſe Kings, a Squire came into the Hall and kneeling down, thus ſpake unto him: Excellent Prince, the two Knights of the Crowns, as valiant peradventure as any on the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t is, none ſhall require of them the combat of the ſword, ſo long as they ſhall have the better at the lance; That if their fortune be equall in the courſe, and both they and their adverſaries unhorſed, then they may diſpute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day with the ſword; but with this reſervation, that if at the time of their being diſmounted, new Knights ſhall happen to enter, equall in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to them, the two aſſailants ſhall remount themſelves, and ſiding with the maintainers, ſhall altogether oppoſe the laſt commers, to the end they may not be deprived of the honour of the Iuſts: The ſaid Knights deſiring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit of their victory, then onely the names of thoſe that ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed, that it may be known how far the valour of every one will extend. Verily, ſaid <hi>Florizell,</hi> this gentile proceeding doth infinitely pleaſe me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not enquiring after the names of your maſters (who cannot be other then gallant Knights) I grant them all that they deſire: Let them come then when

they pleaſe, they ſhall finde the liſts ready for them; and if the incommodity of their journey have not permitted them to bring a tent with them, I will ſee them furniſhed with what ſhall be neceſſary for their ſervice. The Squire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with an anſwer ſo gracious, the young Knights prepared themſelves for the Iuſts, and every one lookt for their comming, to ſee if their deeds would make good the bravery of their words. The people having already fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the place, and the Princes being ſet at the windows, they ſaw how the Knights, armed in azure coloured Arms, powdered all over with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble golden Crowns, came in, with ſuch a grace, and ſo gallantly ſitting their horſes, as better cannot be imagined. As ſoon as they were entred the liſts, a Gentlewoman much richer in clothes, then either in good faſhion or beauty, preſented her ſelfe unto them, and ſaid: Gentlemen, if you be as ſull of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie as you ſeem to be able and brave, you will not refuſe me one requeſt I am to make you. No upon my faith, anſwered one of them ſmiling, provided that it be in our power: for your merit doth oblige us to giue you all ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That which I require of you, replied ſhe, is, that all the courſes which which you ſhall run this after noone, may be onely for my honour, that I may one day glory, that I have ſeen a number of good Knights unhorſed upon the quarrell of my beauty. Theſe words having made all that were within hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ready to burſt with laughter, the Knight returned her this anſwer: Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, we are ſory that it is not in our power to ſatisfie your demand: for the conditions which we have propounded for this Iuſt, have already ſo bound us, as we cannot be permitted to run a courſe for your ſake, wherefore you may be pleaſed to excuſe us for this preſent, and expect ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherein we may do you ſervice. See, ſaid ſhe in choller, juſt the anſwer which ill bred Knights, and without judgement, uſe to make; you refuſe to ſerve me though you have very much reaſon for it: but I doubt not to meet with ſome others more courteous then you, that puniſhing this baſeneſſe, will revenge the wrong you do to my beauty. Then going out of the liſts, with a million of reproches that ſhe gave the Knights, ſhe made all the aſſembly to renew their laughter: and ſo getting to horſe departed with ſpeed. In the mean time, ten Knights, that were newly ſeen to come out of the forreſt, entred the field, two of which taking their place over againſt the defendants, attended the ſound of the trumpet, which was no ſooner heard, but they diſlodged with a very good grace, breaking their ſtaves on their adverſaries ſhields; who, therewith not moved, although the incounter was ſtrong, layd them in the duſt, giving by this their firſt courſe, a very fair demonſtration of their valour. The two adventurers being thus unhorſed, two others took their room, who were entertained more favourably then their fellows: for at the firſt courſe they fell not, yet the ſecond ſtaffe made them quit their ſaddles, to the extream diſcontent of their companions, who attempting to revenge them, had a ſhare in their diſgrace, and found themſelves alſo extended on the earth. The ſpectators admiring the bravery of the Knights of the Crown, expected what the two next would do that preſented themſelves; but they were not long in ſuſpence: for they gained no more then thoſe which preceded them, but were rudely overthrown after they had made their oppoſers loſe their ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops. The two laſt advancing, with no leſſe gallantry then full of deſpight, ran their firſt courſe with extream fury, and meeting all four in the middeſt thereof, brake their ſtaves bravely, and ſo paſſed on without any advantage on either ſide. This courſe being fairer then any of the former, did highly

                     <q>That if fortune made the encounter equall, and they were all at one time unhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they might try it out with the ſword; but if at the time of their being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted new commers arrived, in number equall to them, the aſſailants ſhould take new lances and ſiding with the maintainers, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Knights in the gilt arms, not deſiring to ſhew themſelves refractory, ſince the Iudges would have it ſo, ranked themſelves with thoſe of the Crowns, who took freſh horſes, conceiving by the countenance of their adverſaries, that they had a hard party to deal withall; and placing themſelves over againſt them, attended the ſound of the trumpet for their diſlodging.

Nothing appeared but ſparks of fire in the air, and cantles of armour and ſhields on the ground. If <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> charged with violence, they felt themſelves ſo cloſely followed, as they wondered at the valour of their enemies; nothing was to be heard but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blows, one part laid on load, another was forced to ſet their knees to the ground: In brief, this ſight might truly be tearmed the moſt furious that ever had been ſeen between eight perſons. <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> who had one of thoſe of the gilt arms to deal with, being mad at the reſiſtance he found from him, let his ſword deſcend with ſuch rage on his helmet, as he made him recoil two or three paces with the ſight of a million of ſtars at midday; but he had not time to glory much of that advantage, for his adverſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his ſpirits, came and charged him with ſuch force, as his ſhield being divided in two pieces, the ſword fell ſo heavy on his ſhoulder, that he was fain to ſet one knee to the ground, to ſave himſelf from falling; but quickly getting up again, he rendered the combat far more cruell then ever it was.

And indeed they were ſo eager as they continued ſeven hours without taking of breath, or that any one could diſcerne any the leaſt ſigne of wearineſſe or of advantage in them, which ſo madded them, as carried by an unuſuall rage, they all quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſwords, and grapled together, hoping by meer ſtrength to get the victory; but little prevailing that way, they were at length conſtrained, after they had tumbled on the ground, ſometimes above, and another while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to riſe as by agreement, and recommence their combat, which laſted till night, no man being able to attribute the honour of it more to the one then the other. <hi>Don Rogell,</hi> who infinitely admired the valour of theſe Knights, perceiving them obſtinately bent not to give over for all that it grew dark, cauſed the retreat be ſounded. But their rage not permitting them to heare it, they went on with their buſineſſe, and continued battering one another more cruelly then they had done all the day before: ſo that <hi>Don Rogell</hi> was inforced to diſcend with <hi>Spheramond,</hi> and intreat them to part for his ſake, ſhewing them, hat the cauſe of their contention being ſo ſlight, their enmity had no reaſon to be ſo bitter; but they lent a deafe care to all that he could ſay, ſo as at laſt he was conſtrained to put himſelfe between them, which ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> as turning himſelfe ſomewhat haſtily to <hi>Don Rogell,</hi> he ſaid in ſome choller: I would fain have intreated you to have let Fortune work her will; but ſeeing your authority oppoſes the deſigne of thoſe that combat before you, remember that it ſhall not be able to hinder me when I ſhall viſit you with an hundred thouſand men, to require an account of the diſtaſte you now give me. Neither will I, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who was as much diſpleaſed, promiſe them better dealing: for I will once more cover your fields with brave and warlike Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, Princes of Greece, receive theſe words for a defiance, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a war. But that you may underſtand who are your enemies, this Knight is <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> the great Emperour of Ethiopia, whom you ſee in theſe gray Arms, and I am the King of Canabea, by which name you cannot chuſe but know me. Yes, ſaid <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> without being any way diſtempered, we have cauſe not to be ignorant of what you are; but it may be time will qualifie this heat, and that little you gained before our walls, perhaps will keep you from purſuing the ſecond deſigne. But if you be ſo reſolved, we have friends enough not to care much for your Armes: yet ſhall not that keep me from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating you, ſince it is now dark night, to take a lodging in our Palace, untill you have a little refreſhed your ſelves after the great toyle you have this day endured. That is ordinary with us, anſwered <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> ſo that your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie may well be ſpared; wherewith ſomewhat coldly retiring, they went to their friends, who with more deſpight then paine, quickly got to horſe: and, notwithſtanding they were ſhrewdly wounded, travelled till about midnight, that they came to a Gentlemans houſe; where, when they had ſtayed two dayes, they left <hi>Grandimore</hi> and the unknown Knight to be cured of their hurts, and the morrow after they parted with a promiſe of meeting at the end of two moneths, in Natolia, with each of them an hundred and fifty thouſand men, to be in one body tranſported to Conſtantinople.

Thus have I, excellent Prince, delivered the cauſe of my comming into your dominions, where my hope is to ſee this Princeſſe freed by the hand of ſome one of thoſe which render your Court the moſt glorious, and the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted in the world. But if it be your pleaſure that the triall of this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be made in your preſence, then I humbly deſire that you will permit that I may obtain a Boon of your Knights, which notwithſtanding ſhall not oblige any but him that ſhall undo this inchantment. That ſhall not hinder you, ſaid <hi>Floriſell,</hi> from finding that contentment heer you deſire: and with all my heart I wiſh that this fair Princeſſe may in this place meet with an eaſe of all her pains; to the furtherance wherof I promiſe you, in the name of all mine, that you ſhall not be denied your requeſt, ſo as it be in our power to perform. Hereupon all thoſe Knights, who deſired nothing but occaſions of winning honor, were to arm themſelves for to begin the triall. The firſt that preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe, was the gentile <hi>Perion</hi> of Turkie, who knocking at the Marble gate with his ſword, they ſaw a Knight come forth all armed, not ſo great as moſt Giants, but much exceeding the ſtature of moſt men, that ſetting hand to a rich ſword, advanced his ſhield againſt the fury of a blow which <hi>Perion</hi> delivered at his head, and at the ſame inſtant charging him, made him perceive, that his valour was extream, ſo that the combat began to be both dangerous and delightfull: for if the one ſhewed a rare agility in avoiding his adverſaries blows, the other demonſtrated an exceſſive force. Having battered one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then above an hour in that faſhion, <hi>Perion</hi> determined to ſee the game upon a caſt, and with his ſword in both hands, to lay upon his enemies helmet; but he was prevented: for the Giant having diſcharged an horrible blow on his head, laid him all along upon the floor, and was going to return into his priſon, when as <hi>Florian</hi> of Sopradiſa advanced; who, to be ſhort, had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune, no more had <hi>Triſtor, Floreſtan, Quedragant,</hi> and all theſe new Knights, which were all ſerved in the ſame manner, after they had ſtood a fight more or leſſe, according to the proportion of their ſtrengths. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Eſquilon</hi> of Polonia would needs ſucced his companions in their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, but not till after two hours fight, and with ſome hope of the aſſiſtants, that he would carry away the honour of the adventure. His fall having poſſeſſed the gallant <hi>Ruſsian</hi> with more choller then fear, he drew to <hi>Fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with his ſword drawn; whereupon they began to charge one another with ſuch mighty blows, that the room ſhook under them, pieces of armour flew about, their ſhields were hewen in pieces, and the pavement ſprinkled with bloud, teſtified the valour of the combatants; who bravely diſputing for their lives, and the victory, made all the ſpectators amazed at it, eſpecially the Greek Princes, who judging <hi>Ruſsians</hi> manner of fight both more furious, and more
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17218:63"/>
pleaſing then any of the former, exceedingly deſired to know him: Three howrs being paſt away, ſince the beginning of the combat <hi>Ruſsian</hi> grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and chuſing rather to die then not to overcome in the preſence of ſo many excellent Princes, he delivered a full blow upon the Giant with ſuch violence, that it divided his body in twain, to the infinite contentment of the Gentlewoman, and of the fair Infanta <hi>Agriclea,</hi> who inſtantly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſpirits, and a great clap of thunder breaking forth, juſt as <hi>Fulgoſon</hi> fell, the Pyramid was found in a thouſand pieces, and <hi>Agriclea</hi> in the arms of her woman, who comming to <hi>Ruſsian;</hi> Brave warrior, ſaid ſhe to him, you have this day gained ſo much honour, as we will ſpeak eternally of your valour; but you know withall to what your word doth oblige you. I do, ſaid he, raviſhed with the ſingular beauty of <hi>Agriclea,</hi> I know that I am ingaged to you for a boon, and am ready to grant it preſently. The time for it, ſaid ſhe, is not yet come; but you ſhall, if you pleaſe, one day make good your promiſe, either at my intreaty, or at the command of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; with that, a new clap of thunder being heard, they ſaw <hi>Agriclea</hi> and her woman, together with the body of the Giant, and the fragments of the Pyramid taken away in a cloud, nothing remaining of them in the room, but the bloud that <hi>Fulgoſon</hi> ſhed, upon the laſt blow he received; In which, as it had been in a table of braſſe or marble, were written theſe words:</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Ruſſian</hi> of Media, the ſon of <hi>Rogell</hi> of Greece, and of the fair Queen Grianda.</q>
                     <p>O me! (ſaid <hi>Spheramond,</hi> who had noted the Gentlewomans diſcourſe, and therefore was come to look upon that bloud, imagining that it was not left there without ſome myſterie) What a wonder is this? And by what a ſtrange adventure are we acquainted with a ſecret of ſuch importance? Come hither brother, ſaid he, offering to embrace <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> and give me the firſt careſſes that are due to our neerneſſe in bloud; you can no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your ſelf, for your deſcent is written here; and my Lord, my Father, hath juſt cauſe to rejoyce to ſee one of his race with ſo much good fortune. <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> thus ſuddenly ſurpriſed, kneeled down before his father, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hands, confeſſed that he had determined not to reveal that he was his ſon, ſuppoſing that his valour had not as yet rendered him worthy of that glory: but ſince the heavens had thus diſcovered him, he thought himſelf moſt happy in this adventure, and would endeavour to honour the name that he carried. I ſhould never have done, if I ſhould go about to particularize the careſſes which <hi>Ruſsian</hi> received from <hi>Floriſel,</hi> from thoſe Princes his kinſmen, from the Queens of Guindaya, France, and Lydia, and from all the Court; wherefore I will not ſtand upon it, but following my diſcourſe will tell you, that <hi>Ruſsian</hi> was not more contented with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he had gained in this adventure, and with the notice that his kindred had taken of him, then he was grieved for the departure of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> whoſe incomparable beauty had made a deep impreſſion in his heart: but hoping that time would furniſh him with occaſions to ſee her again, he comforted himſelf as well as he might, and laboured to finde out reaſons to quiet his minde.</p>

Our Princes more intentive to what concerned them in honour, then to continue their pleaſures, aſſembled one day together, and calling to minde <hi>Fulgorans</hi> and <hi>Prigmaleons</hi> threats, they conſulted of the means they had to oppoſe the violence of their forces. Our Empires, ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> as the principall perſon in that counſell, are not unfurniſhed of good ſouldiers; we have a number of brave Princes ſtill alive, and our Courts are full of gallant Knights; wherefore we have no great cauſe to be troubled with our enemies coming, ſo as we take care to haſten our levies in due time; as for our ſelves, I am not of opinion that we ſhould ſtir from hence, ſince the Governours of our Provinces, and our ſubjects, will not be wanting in point of obedience to all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: So that the thing which doth moſt preſſe us for the preſent, is, that to diſpatch away ſpeedily ſome Gentlemen, to the Lievtenants of thoſe countreys, which are ſubject unto us, commanding them to raiſe as many men as they may without disfurniſhing the places of importance of their neceſſary garriſons.

Whilſt they were thus imployed in Greece, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and <hi>Prig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> were not idle, for having parted with a reſolution not to enter any combat except extream neceſſity inforced them to it, they arrived almoſt at one inſtant, the one in the Empire of Aethiopia, and the other in the Kingdom of Canabea, where the firſt things they did, was, to ſend to all their neighbour Kings, to intreat that they would together with them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the revenge of thoſe outrages, which from time to time all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme had received from the Emperours of Greece: Their requeſt was without any difficulty granted, for a multitude of Kings and Princes that had not been parties in the former leagues, determined to joyn with them, utterly to exterminate the Chriſtian name for ever.

It is a fault, I confeſſe: for you have enough to divert a troubled mind, but I ſhall deſire you, not to be offended with it, ſince I fail not out of malice, and that I am ready to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amends for my errour. It was not to conſtrain your actions, that I ſet this diſcourſe on foot, replied he, but knowing that the withdrawing one from melancholy thoughts, doth many times oblige a man. I took the boldneſſe to call you, that you might do better to be merry, then thus to loſe your ſelfe in ſuch cogitations. Riding on then in this ſort, they paſt away the day with many pleaſing diſcourſes, and the night in a ſound ſleep, though they had no other covering then the trees. But the Sun having waked them, they purſued their former way, and travelled till noon, when as they came to the tree where the Damſell hoped to finde her gallant, and to make him give an account of the Armes that he had taken from her: howbeit, ſhe was extreamly amazed when ſhe ſaw neither the ſword nor the helmet hanging on the boughes. I am moſt certain, ſaid ſhe, looking <hi>Ruſsian</hi> in the face, that my griefe, as great as it was, did not take my underſtanding from me, and that this tree is the witneſſe of the wrong which the robber did me of whom I now complain, as well as of the oathes which he ſwore to tarry eight dayes for me here. No, I am not miſtaken: for ſee where the graſſe is preſſed down with the weight of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This is the bough whereon that pretious ſword hung, and theſe the ſame ſtones upon which he ſate down to try if the helmet would fit his head, yet I wonder he ſhould be gone, conſidering how he boaſted of his valour; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I am reſolved either to loſe my ſelfe, or to be revenged: wherefore, if you pleaſe, let us go on, and ſeke him ſo long till we heare ſome newes of him.

I deſire, anſwered <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> that you would be pleaſed to tell us where we are, and if you have ſeen any Knight under this tree. You are, ſaid the Dwarſ, in the Kingdome of Macedon, this Oke is called, the tree of adventure; becauſe that ordinarily here falls out one novelty or other: and the Knight after whom you enquire, is this morning gone away at the requeſt of a damſell, who hath carried him to the guard of the caſtle of Love from hence. I am, ſaid <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> ſatisfied in few words: but my friend, you may adde one greater obligation yet to that wherein I ſtand already indebted unto you by giving me information of the Caſtle you ſpeake of. I would, replied he, if it were in my power to ſatisfie you, but truly, ſir, my curioſity did never ſtretch ſo far, onely my opinion is,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17218:65"/>
that it is called the Caſtle of Love, becauſe there is to be ſeen in an inchanted room there, that proud Deity which triumphs over the hearts of lovers, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a throne of Marble; at the end whereof are two Arches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into no living man could ever yet enter. Now if you be not contented here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and that you aske me why the entring into that houſe is forbidden, I will tell you, that as far as I could gather by the Damſels diſcourſe which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Knight away, that it is to hinder a great happineſſe to Chriſtendome, predeſtined to it by the ruine of this inchantment, which is ſhortly to come to an end. I could not, ſaid <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> be more clearly informed in what I deſired to know, ſo that I will trouble you no further.

Being delighted with this furious fight, he ſtaid a while to obſerve the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and adreſſe, wherewith theſe Knights ſtruck and avoided the blows of one another. But hearing a noyſe on the left hand, he turned ſuddenly about, &amp; ſeeing the Savages and the Giants whom he ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this Prince, that knew the way to vanquiſh, lifting up his ſhield o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whilſt this combat grew hot, by reaſon of the Giants rage, and the government of the Prince, who fought with more judgement then force, that of the two Knights having endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But me thinks it is time to tell who theſe two excellent Princes were, that the reader may no longer be held in ſuſpence; <hi>Ruſsian</hi> of Media was one, and the other was <hi>Mandajar</hi> the proud Pagan, that took the ſword and helmet from the Dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſword in both his hands, and let drive with ſuch fury at the Prince of Media his ſhield, as he forced him to ſet one knee to the ground, with an opinion that he would never riſe again. But he had little time to rejoyce: for his ſword brake in three peeces, and <hi>Ruſsian</hi> getting up in an extraordinary rage, made him beleeve that his death was no further from him, then till he received the next blow, ſo that valuing his life more then his honour, he ſhamefully turned his back, and not daring to ſtand the fury of our Chriſtian, he ran away through the Court of the Caſtle, at the very ſame time when as <hi>Don Rogel</hi> gave one of the Giants his deaths wound, and got him into the inchanted Hall, as into a place of refuge, or ſanctuary. <hi>Ruſsian</hi> following him, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one of the Giants in his way, gave him ſo terrible a blow upon his head, that he clave him to the very teeth, and ſuddenly withall entred the Hall where <hi>Mandajar</hi> was; who ſeeing himſelf followed ſo cloſe, went up the ſtairs, which led to the throne of love: and taking that copper Idoll in his hand, he was going to throw it at <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> but was prevented by his ſword, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his body in two.

this fountain, which was ſet heer in the time of the miſt, perhaps you will have cauſe to ſay with me, that it is one of the rareſt wonders that may be ſeen: <hi>Don Rogel</hi> then, more curious then before, went preſently up the ſteps, and looking into the water, he beheld the fair Empereſſe of Perſia his wife, who with a ſad countenance declared, that his abſence was not little grievous to her, that loved him ſo truly; Fair-Miſtris, ſaid he then, it is not without extream ſorrow that I am thus eſloigned from you; But alas!

Stay, I beſeech you, and by my actions judge of my ſufferings, too long indeed for ſo ſlight a fault; My ſighs do crave that grace which ſometimes you granted me, and which now I have loſt, rather by misfortune, then malice; Do not deny it to this violent affection I bear you, your quiet, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment depend on your facility in receiving me at this preſent, for love having heertofore tied us together with ſuch faſt bonds, I cannot ſee how ever we ſhould live contentedly in this ſeparation. That is it, ſaid the Shepherdeſſe, with a diſdainfull countenance, which without doubt abuſes you; for I am now more capable of hate, then ever I was of love, neither do you imagine, that my happineſſe conſiſts in your glory, or my pain in your misfortune; you are to me me ſo indifferent, that I will never have a ſhare in any thing that may be fall you; your excuſes therefore, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities wherewith you thus vex me, are altogether unprofitable: Leave me then to live with the liberty of my thoughts, and ſtudy ſome artifice with which you may appeaſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> who hath no leſſe cauſe to baniſh you her preſence, and not to love you, then my ſelf.

If you have heertofore loved him, you would doubtleſſe have loved him ſtill, had not ſome crime of his rendered him unworthy of your affection; his repentance doth blot out his offence, wherefore you ought to love him as much now, as heertofore you have done, nor think more of his fault, ſince his ſorrow for it hath cancelled it. I ſhould willingly, anſwered ſhe, allow of your reaſons, if I were leſſe ſenſible of the grief I am in, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo fouly deceived, or could build any aſſurance on the oaths of men: but can it be likely I ſhould ever put any truſt in the oaths of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, whoſe humour I too well know to be ſo inconſtant and full of levity; theſe tears, which you ſee in his eyes, are onely to reduce me once more into the captivity wherein his love hath for three yeers detained me; and his ſighs, ſerve but for charms, to keep my reaſon from diſcerning the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which he would bring upon me; I muſt not therefore regard them, but having paid for my learning, take my ſelf out a good leſſon from his fault, and my misfortune, to injoy the happineſſe of my liberty.

My tears, and the continuance of my mourning, ſufficiently demonſtrated my ſorrow, but my undeſtanding, and time, the common Phyſician of our ſorrows, having ſomewhat eaſed my grief, I confidered that it was but weakneſſe of ſpirit ſo to loſe my ſelf in the anguiſh of my minde; and finding ſome eaſe in my p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was worthy of my love, I do confeſſe, for his fault ſhall not keep me from giving him his deſerved commendations; but his light and ſickle humour hath made him incapable of ſo good a fortune. He ſaw me, and finding (as he pretended) charms in my eyes, came to preſent his ſervice to me with ſo good a grace, that from that time forth it was impoſſible for me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the reſolution I had taken, never to love again, for fear of being once more in the danger of the misfortune, which had made me complain ſo long; howbeit, good manners obliging me, not to accept him at the firſt tender of himſelf, nor my affection permitting me to reject him with too much rigour, I made him an ordinary anſwer, which yet might let him perceive that I had no inclination to neglect his good will: To what end ſhould I ſpin out my diſcourſe, with delivering the particulars of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our paſſions?

                     <p>The Pagans drawing toward the Town, and hearing no noiſe in it, thought the Chriſtians had been ſleeping, ſo that in a moment their ladders were reared, whereupon, the Giants firſt mounted, to encourage the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to follow them: But ſtraightway they ſaw the enemy ſhew himſelf, and with a tempeſt of ſtones, boiling oyl, ſulphur and pitch, overthrew thoſe which thought to lay hold of the parapet, ſo that the ditch began to be filled with dead men; then it was that the aſſault grew to be furious and cruell, for the Giants enraged to ſee their fellows repulſed and ſlain, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for their lives preſſed forward, and divers times to the ſword with the Chriſtian Princes, who, under favour of the wall, diſcharged moſt horrible and mortall blows; eſpecialy <hi>Spheramond,</hi> that never lighted on a Giant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depriving him of life. Nevertheleſſe, lacking room to lay about him, according to his minde, he took a new reſolution, and leaving the charge of his quarter to <hi>Don Sinaldo,</hi> as alſo <hi>Lucendus</hi> that of his to <hi>Garmant,</hi> they both ſallied forth with ſix thouſand horſe apiece, and gave upon the enemy with ſuch fury, that finding them in diſorder, the field was infinitely cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with dead carcaſſes. Then was the valiant Prince of France ſeen breaking into that mighty battalion of the enemies, and charging them with ſuch courage, as made his friends admire, and his enemies fear him: On the other ſide, the invincible Emperour of the Parthians ſeemed a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt of war, one while ſending arms and heads to the ground, another while dividing a Giants body in two pieces. In brief, nothing was to be ſeen round about them, but dead bodies, nor any thing to be heard, but a confuſion of voices, and the cryes of ſuch as lay dying under the horſes feet. The valourous Aethiopian, and the mighty King of Canabea, whom theſe two little ſquadrons attacqued, followed by the Kings and Giants that accompanied them, did wonders, piercing into the Chriſtians ſquadrons with a great and terrible ſlaughter, and were very glad to ſee them abroad, in hope to beat them in, and enter the Town with them: But <hi>Floriſel,</hi> that conſidered the conſequence of this enterpriſe, cauſed eight thouſand horſe to ſlip along by the Town, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Tamberlan of Moraria, put <hi>Eſquilan</hi> in the head of the one moity, and ſending him to ſecond <hi>Spheramond,</hi> himſelf with the reſt, charged the enemy, and aſſiſted the Prince of France, who then was

fighting with <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> with as much courage as force and dexterity: theſe troops, having renewed the fight with much cruelty, and ſo continued it a pretty while, were about to make their retreat upon advertiſement that a great piece of the wall was fallen down, and that there was great danger in it, by reaſon of the enemies obſtinate preſſing on there; when as on the ſudden, a terrible noiſe and tumult was heard at the ſea ſide, which put a fear into both ſides; the Chriſtians doubting that it was ſome new ſuccour againſt them, and the Pagans miſtruſted as much; but it was ſoon known what it was; for preſently the Pagans army was ſeen to be in diſorder, and a little while after, a Knight came up to the trenches, that certified <hi>Floriſel</hi> of the arrivall of the brave <hi>Amanio d' Aſtre,</hi> of <hi>Ginoldan,</hi> the Kings of Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dania and Comagena, the Kings <hi>Melinda,</hi> and <hi>Olidor</hi> his brother, with ſixty thouſand horſe, and forty thouſand foot, who knowing in what eſtate the fight ſtood, had landed with a determination to charge the enemy back. As I live, ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> this is good news; Come, let us cloſe up our enemies, and keep them from putting themſelves in array. Saying ſo, he advanced with forty thouſand horſe, drawn out of the Towns and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and put himſelf into the field with a reſolution to fight, but <hi>Prigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> and <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> as diſcreet as valiant, perceiving the diſorder their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in by reaſon of this new-come army, which made an incredible flaughter amongſt them, kept their ſouldiers within their trenches, under the command of the King of Thenes, and of the Iſland of Till, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where the Chriſtian Princes were arrived, arreſted their fury, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of their men within their works. <hi>Floriſel,</hi> commending the diſcretion of Princes ſo young, went to receive his kinſmen with a world of contentment, and cauſing a quarter to be ſet out under the walls for their forces, carried the Kings to the City with him, where the entertainments were renewed at their meeting with thoſe beautifull Princeſſes. That done, they fell to burying the dead, which on the Chriſtian part, was found to be nine thouſand three hundred Knights, and ſeven hundred foot; and on the enemies, twenty ſeven thouſand ſouldiers, fourteen Giants, and five Kings, which ſo much the more vexed the Pagans, as our Princes had cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice.

All things thus ſetled on either part, they expected the day of battell; which being come, to the generall content of both the Armies, the Pagans began to draw into the field, not a little wondring to ſee their enemies there before them, who already had had their troops there embattaild with admirable judgement: The firſt that ſhewed himſelfe of the Pagans party was the great Cariffe of Africa, who marching gloriouſly under a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of colours, wherein appeared two Lyons ſlain by one man, intimating his valour, that had made him twice to triumph over thoſe beaſts, cauſed a charge to be ſounded as ſoon as he ſaw the Emperour <hi>Spheramond</hi> with a brave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallerys ſet forth againſt him. The incounter of theſe two leaders was very gallant: for the African was brave &amp; daring but having the prime Knight of the world in hand, was wounded in the ſhoulder, and ready to loſe his ſaddle, had he not been ſuſtained by one of his Giants that followed him; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe his wound being ſuch as would not permit him to keep the field, he was conſtrained to retire, leaving his men very ill handled at the firſt ſhock: for the Cenophales, the King <hi>Melinda, Caſsiana,</hi> and <hi>Olidor,</hi> laid five of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants dead upon the earth, <hi>Armond</hi> of Bohemia, and <hi>Florizart,</hi> having been as fortunate againſt the Kings of Tincefort and Caliſan, who were overthrown at the firſt incounter with a multitude of Pagans beſide, who were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Greekes that had been inured to the war ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wherein their enemies had forced them to bear Arms.

But the numbers of the enemie giving way to the valour of our Princes, they were already wavering, and ready to turn their backes, had not <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> cauſed the ſecond battalion to advance, commanded by the great King of Mauritania: to encounter whom the excellent Prince of France drew forward his; and with that greatneſſe of courage wherewith his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years was endued, at the very firſt courſe he ran his lance clean thorow his enemies body, depriving this ſecond Squadron both of an head and hope; yet being maintained by ſo many Kings and Giants, the battell began to be very bloudy: the valiant <hi>Alaſtraxerea, Ginoldan, Perion, Florian, Triſtor</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> laid about them ſo terribly, that for all their multitude of Kings, and the bravery of their Giants, of whom five were at this ſecond charge kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the place, the Pagans were about to retire with ſhame, had not the Tamberlan of Moraria preſently ſet forth with incredible fury.

ſlaughter, both that and the two former had all paſſed by the edge of the ſword, if the invincible King of Canabea had not come into play, with ſo much valour, and acting ſuch marvellous deeds, as notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance the King of Hungary and Poland could make, who advanced at the very ſame time, he maintained the battell in an equall balance: his preſence cleared the ranks, and the ſouldiers ſhunned his ſword, as they would have done a thunderbolt from heaven; cloſe by him marched <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimond, Grandimore,</hi> and the brave unknown Knight, making ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock, as was moſt lamentable to behold.

The valiant <hi>Eſquilan</hi> of Poland did miracles, and not parting from his father, who gave ſtrange proof of his courage, ran to oppoſe the Giants that ruined all before them, but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Prince of Canabea, and of the Giants that accompanied him, held the battell longer in ſuſpence then could have been hoped for from the weakneſſe of the former troops; howbeit, in the end he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to give way to force, by the comming in of <hi>Silvan,</hi> who that cay ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered good proof of a wonderous vertue: and carrying ruine along with him whitherſoever he went, he made the victory incline to the Chriſtians, when as the mighty Emperour of Aethiopia entered the field, and like a torrent ruſhing on our troops, quickly changed the face of all things; but he was ſoon incountered by <hi>Floriſel</hi> of Niquea, with his laſt battalia: Theſe two Princes, as valiant as poſſibly might be, encountering in the midſt of their courſe, bare one another to the earth; but fearing to be troden under the horſes feet, they inſtantly got up again; the fall of theſe two great cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, having drawn all the braveſt Knights of their ſquadrons to that place, there began a moſt dangerous fight; for the Kings of Cathay, Dardania, and Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This object arreſted the eyes of thoſe forrain Kings with wonder, to behold ſo rare a thing, and gladly they would have ſeen the Lions take their way into their teeth, that they might have had the content to have conſidered it neerer: But ſeeing them go towards the City they forbare, and would not follow them: Some of the Greek Princes, being without the walls, to clear the ditches, and gave order for the repairing of the breaches which the enemy had made, preſently conceived that it was ſome brave adventure: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded the gates to be opened: which done, the Lions entered, and paſſing the ſtreets with marvellous ſpeed, they came into the court of the Palace, where they ſtood ſtill.

Meeting then with <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> who was labouring of the ſame diſeaſe, he diſcovered his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on freely to him, and ſo well they agreed together that an howre before day they went out of their trenches, not acquainting any man with their purpoſe. <hi>Fulgoran</hi> in his blacke, which he had not put on ſince the warre began, and <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> in azure armes. Then taking a way ſome three leagues about, they came to the North gate, where all the Chriſtian forces were intrenched, and ſent to let the Greeke Princes know, that two ſtranger Knights having heard talke of the fountaine of Lovers, did entreat they might bee permitted to trie their fortune. Their deſire, ſaid <hi>Florizel,</hi> ſeems ſo juſt, that I cannot refuſe them, were I ſure they were our enemies: Let them enter then when they pleaſe. The Pagan Princes having received this anſwer, went on to the Palace Court, where ſeeing two Knights ready to begin the triall, they ſtaid to behold the iſſue of it, and tying their horſes to the railes they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to ſecond thoſe Knights, that were going to fight, if they ſped not well. And turning toward the fountain, they perceived the two inchanted Knights arm from underneath the arches, who began one of the moſt furious combats that ever had been ſeen; for they charged one another with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as all the aſſiſtants were amazed at it, and extreamly wondered to ſee with what activity all four of them avoided their adverſaries blows; the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they ſought the luſtier, and more able they ſeemed to be, and all the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Princes ſaid they had never ſeen a braver combat: having then continued in that ſort, above two hours and a half, the two aſſailants reſolving either to conquer, or die, took their ſwords in both their hands; but their enemies no leſſe enraged at the refiſtance they found in them, and tranſported with the ſame fury, delivered two ſuch terrible blows on their heads, as they laid them on the pavement, to the extream grief of all the ſpectatours, that thought they were dead, eſpecially the Kings of Lidia, and the Fortunate Iſland, who when their heads were diſarmed, ſaw that they were their dear wives, the fair Savageſſe, and the King of Nyeger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knights, behaved themſelves ſo bravely, and delivered their blowes with ſuch fury, that every one expected no other end of that fight, but by the death of them all. Fowr howrs being ſpent in this ſort without any ſhew made by theſe Knights of taking any breath, the place was ſtrewed with their armes, the bloud ran down their ſides, millions of ſparkles flew about their eares, and their ſwords deſcended alwayes with ſuch violence, as their lives ſeemd to depend on every ſtroake.

Out of which a little after, came a reverend old man, with a beard reaching downe to his girdle, marching between two women, with ſuch a majeſty, as amazed all the ſtanders by. <hi>Floriſel</hi> who obſerved him, and knew the two women to be <hi>Vrganda</hi> the unknowne, and the faire <hi>Caſſandra</hi> her daughter, aroſe from his chaire, ſeeing they drew toward him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his Armes to embrace them; but the old man bending himſelfe to the ground: ſaid, Moſt excellent Prince, you ſhould have ſome reaſon to ſhew that you are pleaſed with my comming, if you knew how far my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire extends to do you ſervice, but not having hitherto given you much notice of it, I will acknowledge the favours you now do me, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed meerly from your courteſie, not having any way deſerved them. And if I preſent my ſelfe before you thus, without command, it is onely to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that without me you would loſe very much to day. You ſee this miſt, it doth enfold ſome great matter, and is that which a faire Sun muſt diſſipate; wherefore be pleaſed that <hi>Polixena</hi> may come hither, and then we will make an end of our worke. Reverend ſir, ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are the more recommendable, in that they are without obligation; and this inclination you have to do ſomething for my content, ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me, that not to be ingratefull, I muſt tender you all that lies in my power. If my daughter may be uſefull for any great deſigne of yours, ſhe ſhall preſently be here: But in the mean time, ſuffer me, I pray you, to complain a little of theſe Ladies that accompany you, for leaving me ſo long without hearing any newes of them. It is true, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> after ſome uſuall complements, that we have not been heere, but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the welfare of Chriſtendome would not permit us to deſert our ſtudies, whereof you ſhall hereafter reap the benefit, and for the preſent you ſhall ſee that we have done more for you then you thinke. <hi>Polixena</hi> then being come downe with all thoſe Princeſſes, the old man tooke her by the hand, and led her into the miſt, whilſt <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſaluted the Princeſſe, and ſpake theſe words to <hi>Floriſel:</hi>

                     <p>Believe it, my Lord, that you are not a little obliged to this wiſe man, who is called <hi>Alcander,</hi> and is the moſt knowing perſonage that ever beſtowed time on good bookes, and that will do more for you in two dayes, then we have been able to do in ſo many years. I thinke no leſſe, ſaid <hi>Floriſel:</hi> But you muſt alſo be aſſured, that he ſhall want no recompence, if he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from our hand: For I finde my ſelfe ſo engaged to his knowledge, whereby the bodies of our fathers are interred with ſo much honour, as I will be maſter of nothing in the world, that ſhall not be at his diſpoſing. But, Madam, what means this youth, which I ſee in your face, and in the reſt of your perſon? whereat I cannot but wonder, if it be not done by Art. That is a ſecret, ſaid ſhe laughing, which you ſhall know in due time. In the mean while, let us, if you pleaſe, go to <hi>Alcander,</hi> ſince we ſee the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is gone; with that they drew toward the foure Knights, and ſaw, that

                        <hi>Polixena</hi> having powred a viall of water, which ſhe had in her hand, upon <hi>Fulgoran</hi> his armes, they immediatly were turned to their former colour of fire, even at the very ſame inſtant. When as the other three Knights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aroſe, much abaſhed to ſee themſelves without helmets, and not knowing how their combat was determined, <hi>Don Rogel</hi> and the brave baſtard of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, who were the two enchanted Knights, looked about on <hi>Floriſel,</hi> and all their kinſmen, without a word ſpeaking, as if they ſtill had been reſtrained by ſome charme. And on the other ſide, <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> and <hi>Fulgoran</hi> were no leſſe aſtoniſhed, beleeving that they were in priſon. But <hi>Alcander,</hi> not to keep them longer in ſuſpence, addreſſed himſelfe to <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> ſaid, Sir, have you ever ſeen me in any other place? Yea, replied he, you are the ſame that I met with the very day that I firſt put on theſe Armes, and that then gave me an advice, of which I have at times made good uſe. And I, <hi>Vrganda,</hi> taking him by the hand, what place do I hold in your memory? Such, Madam, anſwered he, as I owe to the aſſiſtance which I have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times received from you in my occaſions: for I am not ignorant, that you are the Lady of the enchanted Rock, and by the means of whoſe Art, all my enterpriſes have ſucceeded happily. But, Madam, I beleeve, that it is not without ſome myſtery, that you now are heer. No certainly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe: for I am come to make you underſtand certaine words, which a damſell whom I ſent to you, ſpake when ſhe changed the colour of your armes. She told you, if you well remember, that when your armes ſhould reaſſume the former colour of fire, you ſhould know what you were; and that the firſt day of our enterview, ſhould be the happieſt, and yet the moſt dangerous of your whole life: you ſee now the experience of it; your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is now no longer blacke, and I beleeve you will freely confeſſe, that you were never in more danger of death, then when you fought with this Knight, pointing to <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> who is your Father; and all theſe Princes which you ſee heere, are your kinſmen: but that you may have no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt, give me that ſword which you have in your hand, that I may ſhew you more certaine evidence of the truth heereof. Taking it then from him, ſhe ſhewed him graven upon the blade:</p>
                     <q>Fulgoran, Sonne of Don Rogel of Greece, and of Florella of Canabea.</q>
                     <p>And if you deſire yet more certain proof, added ſhe, go up theſe ſtairs, and look into the water of this fountain, it will ſhew you the truth. That would ſhew, anſwered he, but too much obſtinacy, to diſtruſt ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes: I will never make a doubt, Madam, of that you ſhall tell me; nor doe I deſire more aſſurance of this verity, then the ſorrow that I feel for having lifted up my arms againſt him, for whoſe preſervation the Gods and Nature, command me to die a thouſand times, if I were capable of ſo many lives. But my Lord, ſaid he kneeling down to <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> you will impute the fault to my ignorance, and be pleaſed to pardon me, if hitherto I have ſought the ruine of your Empire, for the glory of the Gods, whom my education made me adore; which henceforward I ſhall be ready to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and repair the damages which my arms have brought them. My ſon, ſaid <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> moſt lovingly embracing him, I am ſo pleaſed with this accident, that ſetting a part all care of the wars, I will not think of any thing, but of rejoicing with you, and for you.

His new deſires then not permitting him to think of his return, he expected the iſſue of the buſineſſe; when as <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt his exceſſe of joy, could not forget him, turning moſt, kindly to him thus ſpake: My worthy Lord, and Companion, I am extreamly afraid, that the knowledge of my parents, obliging me to be baptiſed, wil make me loſe the honour of your love, and cauſe you to hate me as much as ever you affected me. That is a thing, anſwered <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> which you are not to doubt; for your vertue onely having given birth to our friendſhip, I cannot beleeve it can be ſo eaſily broken by any difference of religion; on the contrary, I think it good reaſon that you imitate your parents, and that it is juſt in you to teſtifie the content you take in knowing them; for theſe being the prime Princes in the world, no man can deſcend from them without glory; we have troubled them very much, and our arms have cauſed great diſorder in their States, but we may amend that fault; you ſhall ſerve them out of duty, as I will out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for from henceforth I vow to hold a firm peace with them if they be pleaſed with it; and am very willing to be their friend, provided they judge me worthy of that favour.</p>
                     <p>Now on my ſoul, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> embracing him again, this is that which moſt I could wiſh for in the world, and your freeneſſe ſo obligeth me, that, not to be ingratefull, I moſt heartily offer you all that lies in my power: but come and let us go to theſe my Lords, who for that they know you not, have not rendered you that which your birth and valour deſerve. Repairing to <hi>Don Floriſel,</hi> he briefly acquainted him with the quality of <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Floriſel,</hi> excuſing himſelf on his ignorance, careſſed him in ſuch manner, as he held himſelf much indebted to his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

with <hi>Florimond,</hi> and the unknown Knight, who would needs accompany them to them to the City, they took leave of <hi>Bruzanges</hi> and <hi>Grandimore,</hi> and returned to the Greek Princes, who made it appear, that they cared not much whether the enemy continued ſtil before their wals, or was on the ſea returning homeward, ſince they had drawn from them the beſt part of their ſtrength. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing then their feaſting and ſports, they paſſed away the day with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, till toward evening, when as word was brought, that there was a Knight at the gate, who deſired to ſpeak with <hi>Prigmaleon.</hi> Let him come in, ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> it may be he comes to be merry with us, as being weary of lying ſo long in his tent, and ſeeing nothing but arms. Vpon this command, the Knight was brought into the room, where kiſſing a paper which he had in his hand, he preſented it to <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> from the King of Zizinia; who having opened and read it, ſaid to him, Knight, your maſter tells me, that, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being of importance, he hath committed it onely to your fidelity; let us know then, I pray you, what the matter is: More, I aſſure you, anſwered he, then you imagine; and by the care my Maſter takes of you, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much he loves you. He was this day preſent at the Counſell, wherein it was concluded, to cut your troops and thoſe of Canabea in pieces; but he not intending to be a traitour to you, nor able to endure ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath advertiſed you of their deſigne, to the end that with the aſſiſtance of your new friends, you may turn that hurt upon them, which they intend to you: He will favour your enterpriſe, nor ſhall his men draw a ſword againſt you; and when the alarm is given, he will draw to the ſea ſide and embark his ſouldiers: It reſts now, that you make good uſe of the advertiſement that he givees you, and carry the matter with ſuch diſcretion, as it may not be known that your enemies counſell is revealed by his means. Aſſure him, ſaid <hi>Prig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> much amazed at the ſoul deſign of thoſe Pagan Kings, that I will die rather then prejudice him for the favour he doth me; he doth indeed oblige me as you ſee, but I will never be ingratefull, and hope one day to require him: in the mean time, I will prevent this miſchief if I can, and beleeve it, the traitours ſhall have no great cauſe to brag of their villany. Having then acquainted the Greek Princes with the buſineſſe, he ſent the unknown Knight to his quarter, to give private directions to his Commanders, and intelligence of the enemies deſigne; <hi>Florimond</hi> having received the like Commiſſion for the Canabeans, with order to put on white ſhirts upon their arms, that they might know their own men in the dark. This Knight being returned to the Pagans Camp, <hi>Don Floriſel</hi> of Niquea, deſiring to let <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> know how much he eſteemed his friendſhip, ſeeing the night reaſonable dark, put thirty thouſand horſe out of the North-gate, and divided them into two ſquadrons, in one of which he commanded himſelf, with <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> the two Cena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phales, <hi>Lucendus, Filadard, Eſquilan, Gadard, Dorigel, Melfort, Abies, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Leonidas, Florizart,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dardanio:</hi> The other he left to the leading of <hi>Don Rogel, Spheramond, Melinda, Olidor, Ginoldan, Amanio, Silvan, Anaxander, Floradin, Perion, Florian, Triſtor, Quedragant, Agrian,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all of them white linnen upon their arms, now with his ſquadron he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards <hi>Prigmaleons</hi> quarter, and <hi>Rogel</hi> with the other, toward <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorans:</hi> But thinking it fit to ſtay till the fight began, they made a ſtand about a mile off, tarrying for nothing but the noiſe to make them give in upon them. On the other ſide, the Pagan Kings did not ſlumber, for having made two battalia's of their men, each of them of ſeventy two thouſand horſe, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

O me! ſaid he, How luckily doth this fall out?

This ardour carrying him on, he came to his Miſtris, thinking that he ſhould have his tongue as free as his thought; but after a Good-even, he ſtuck faſt, and leaving his eyes to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his paſſion, he was not able to utter a word. <hi>Polixena,</hi> who took this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſſe for a ſigne of his love, ſeeing him in that caſe, took him by the hand, and ſaid: My Lord, I beleeve we have ſurpriſed you, for the amaze you are in makes me imagine ſo much.</p>

It is true, replied he all trembling, that a ſecret griefe

doth conſume me. But, Madam, I ſhould have juſt reaſon to blame my want of courage, and to impute all my vexation to my cowardice, if I ſhould not ſeek for a remedy when it is in my power to do it. I have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red infinitely ſince I ſaw you, and the powerfull charms of your eyes have left me nothing that is mine, but my deſire to doe you ſervice. You may ſay, I am too bold, that a greater reſpect belongs to your greatneſſe, and that I ought to have endured my ſuffering without declaring it. But alas! I do not ſpeake but by the impulſion of a paſſion that forces me to it. Love hath untied my tongue, which you ſaw was dumbe when you came hither: and that is it which now conſtraines me to beſeech you, that you will be as ſenſible of pitty as I am of affection. If I had not given you occaſion to ſpeake, coldly replied <hi>Polixena,</hi> I ſhould be diſpleaſed with this your diſcourſe. Maidens in theſe daies, and eſpecially thoſe of my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, doe not take a liberty of engaging themſelves without the conſent of their fathers; neither willingly permit any to talk to them of love, for fear of being deceived, and infortunate by truſting the oaths of a lover of three daies ſtanding.

Nevertheleſſe, being ſomwhat pleaſed that he had revealed his thoughts, he retired quietly to his chamber, and remembring that townes doe ordinarily endure the firſt aſſault, that yet will afterwards yeeld to a perſiſting beleager, he tooke paper, and in it wrote theſe lines.</p>

                     <p>This Letter, written and ſealed, he committed to the fidelity of a Dwarf, who certainly had a greater ſpirit then a body, and that could ſo well chuſe his time, as the next morning he found <hi>Polixena</hi> in her chamber, unto whom kneeling down, he ſaid: If it were fit for me, Madam, to relate to you what one of the moſt completeſt Princes of the earth doth ſuffer for you, I would recount to you his ſighes, his griefs, his tranſports, and his diſquiets, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you know the miſerable eſtate whereinto deſpair hath reduced him, ſince you forbad him to complain to you, I ſhould perhaps poſſeſſe you with as much pity, as he hath love; but perſwading my ſelf that his paſſion hath found reaſons enough to let you ſee it, I will content my ſelf with preſenting this paper to you from him: Be pleaſed, Madam, to view it with a gentle eye,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17218:84"/>
and return him ſo favourable an anſwer as may cauſe him to live conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; you ſhall tye the world to you in no mean obligation, by preſerving in it ſo brave a Knight; who, I aſſure you, deſires nothing ſo much as the honour of doing you ſervice. I will not, anſwered ſhe, be ſo farre an enemy to his content, as not to be willing to read what occaſion he takes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me: wherefore give me the paper; with that ſhe took and opened it, and having well conſidered it, ſaid to the Dwarfe: My friend, the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer that I muſt returne to thy maſter, conſiſts of ſo few words, as I need not take a pen in hand to let him know my minde, onely bid him hope, that time bring him content, and that fidelity alone can procure him that which with ſo much impatience he wiſhes? for. It is enough, anſwered the Dwarfe, I will go tell him that he is happy, and that he is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain any more. So going out with a curtſie that made the Princeſſe laugh, he went to <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> who expected his returne with a panting heart, and returning him that anſwer, he rendred him ſo contented, that not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelfe to be Emperour of Aethiopia, he imbr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What, ſaid the Dwarfe, coldneſſe? Beleeve it, you may be happy if you will, if you be not happy already, me thinkes I ſee you in the midſt of thoſe delights which will bring you to a very paradiſe. For having ſeen that faire hand which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched mine when ſhe tooke the letter from me, and imagining that her cloathes concealed wonders, I was almoſt tranſported with her. And if the reſpect of your paſſions had not ſtaid me, I had aſſuredly beſought her with ſome favour to quench that flame which already began to ſcorch my heart. But not intending to be a traytor, nor to ſeek my contentment with the loſſe of your quiet, I ſurmounted thoſe unruly paſſions, and quickly withdrew my ſelfe for feare that the violence of my deſires ſhould make us commit ſome errour. See, ſaid <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> laughing heartily at the grace wherewith this little thing vented his fooleries. See my Muſſardin, aſſured proofs of thy fidelity, which I have alſo obſerved in other things. But be confident, that thou obligeſt not an ingratefull man, and that I will one day recompenſe the labour thou tookeſt in maſtering thine own appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for my ſake. I know well, ſaid the Dwarfe, that my affection doth highly oblige you; howbeit withall, I extreamly feare that you will not give me the reward for it that I deſire. But I will upon the faith of a Knight, ſaid <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> ſo that I may do it without prejudice to my love, and that it be in my power. Nay, I will quickly eaſe you of that fear, ſaid the Darfe, nor ſhall you find any friend more faithfull to endeavour the bringing of your wiſhes to their deſired part, then my ſelf, if you will aſſiſt me: for as for <hi>Polixena,</hi> I will wholly quit her to you; but I would fain have a place in the good grace of <hi>Caſtibella,</hi> daughter to that peerleſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> who once filled the world with ſuch wonders of her beauty. It is a riſing Sunne, that promiſes great things in her courſe; and that to be briefe, hath ſtruck me dead in the eye. Perſwade her to love me, and ſetling a good impreſſion on her of my courage (for you know I would rather dye then be wanting to my occaſion of honour) tell her, that my alliance with her will be for her glory, and that ſhe ſhall finde herſelfe moſt happy in my ſervices. So will I never complaine of my pains in furthering your ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and you ſhall ſee how faithfully I will ſerve you. This is, ſaid

Make not that your excuſe, ſaid the Dwarf, true love never ſtands upon time, I will ſtay till yeers have better ripened her judgement, and in the mean ſpace will finde a thouſand wayes to make my intentions not unpleaſing to her.

When as there came into the Hall a Damſell reaſonably handſome, carrying in her hand the head of a Giant, who beholding the company a good while, with wonder to ſee Knights of ſo brave a preſence, and Ladies of ſuch beauty, enquired ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry modeſtly which was the Emperour of the Parthians.

I am ſaid ſhe, much bound to your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, but God be thanked, I have heer in my hand an occaſion of rejoycing, rather then of complaining; nor am I come hither to crave the help of any whatſoever, but to preſent to that Excellent Emperour the head of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemy he had, brought to this paſſe by the incomparable valour of a Knight, that bears a wilde man in his ſhield, whom I may juſtly vaunt to be one of the valianteſt men upon the earth, and the Phoenix of thoſe that this day bear arms. This Knight, meeting with me in the confines of Macedon, could not paſſe by me, without enquiring after the cauſe of ſome tears which he ſaw me ſhed: I freely told him, that the villany of a Giant, who had ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed me, did wring them from me, and that I was going to Conſtantinople to crave reparation of that wrong; knowing well that the Princes of Greece did never refuſe their aſſiſtance to Ladies in diſtreſſe, and that particularly I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to addreſſe my ſelf to the Emperor <hi>Spheramond,</hi> both for that he holds
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17218:85"/>
the reputation of ſurpaſſing all Knights of this age, and that the Giant had told me, how all the villanies which he then committed, were done by him, in ſome ſort to revenge the death of another Giant, whom the Emperour had ſlain, when as a Knight errant he followed adventures abroad in the world. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, then anſwered this court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if you be pleaſed to make uſe of me, I ſhall moſt willingly imploy my ſelf in your ſervice; It is a long journey from hence to Conſtantinople, your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may finde occaſion to get him further off, you will take a great deal of pains in vain, and not be ſatisfied in your deſire: On the other ſide, I do paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately long to demonſtrate unto that valorous Prince, how I do love his vertue as much as other men do honour his birth, and that I will labour ſo long as I live to ruine his enemies.

I would not have you, ſaid he, give me ſo many thanks for a thing whereunto I was bound by the laws of Chivalrie; but ſince you will needs oblige me, take the head of your enemy, and for a further ſatisfaction of your minde, carry it to Conſtantinople, preſent it to that warlike Prince, and render your grief the leſſe, by publiſhing the revenge you have had for it. I ſhall with a good will, replied I, undertake that journey, but then Sir, will you be pleaſed to tell me who you are, to the end I may know to whom I am ſo infinitely indebted. See heer, my name in my ſhield, ſaid he, ſhewing a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage pourtrayed thereupon, for a more perfect knowledge of me, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I may not give: Follow on your way, whilſt I go ſome other where to ſeek occaſion of imploying my arms; with that, not thinking it convenient to be troubleſome, I took the head of <hi>Marandor,</hi> (for ſo was the Giant named) and began my journey to this place, where I am arrived with grief, for that I finde not the Emperour of the Parthians to give him an account of this brave Knight; but, if you pleaſe, I will leave it in your charge to do it, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I ſhall at any time be ready to deſerve it of you in all poſſibly I may. Whereupon, ſhe laid the head of <hi>Marandor</hi> on the floor, and making a very humble reverence, immediatly departed, leaving all the Princes extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know this ſo valiant and brave new Knight: Whilſt they were all commending the valour of the Knight of the Savage, <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> who ſtill had <hi>Agriclea</hi> in his memory, could not be at reſt, and would certainly have been gone, had it not been for the deſire he had to ſee his father and his kinsfolks at liberty: but that reſpect prevailing with him, he paſſed the moſt part of his dayes unquietly enough; contrarily <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> who interpreting <hi>Polixena's</hi>

Let this reaſon ſerve for my excuſe, and do not, I pray you, call me ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The ſervice that I will do you with my arms, ſhall make amends for this default; in the mean time if you have a minde to tarry heere, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move further, that I may not trouble your repoſe. Thus it is, ſaid ſhee in choler, that poore ſpirits uſe to excuſe themſelves. Sleep, ſince you care more for a nap, then you do for my life. The Gods who are alwaies juſt, will one time or other revenge your deſpiſing of me, and make you thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel the pain that I ſuffer by your ingratitude. Saying ſo, ſhe withdrew under another tree with extream diſcontent, leaving <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> in no leſſe diſquiet of mind: for remembring his <hi>Polixena,</hi> from whom he durſt not aſſure himſelfe a better entertainment then now he had given that amorous damſell, he never could ſhut his eies; and in that trouble he continued, till the ſun being riſen made him get to horſe, where entring into a forreſt, that befell him, which ſhall be deliverd to you in the next Chapter.</p>

Thoſe laments comming to his ear, put him out of his muſing, and made him preſently goe to a buſh, from whence the noiſe did come; where at the foot of it he ſaw a Lady, that holding a ponyard in her hand, ſpake theſe words: <hi>Melina</hi> it is time for thee to die, ſince thy Knight is loſt; for thy dayes would be but anguiſh, and every thought of him an inſupportable torture, when thou ſhalt remember that thou wert the cauſe of his death, by putting him upon a buſines, which could no way conduce to thy content. It had beene much better done to have kept him ſtill in thy houſe, amidſt a thouſand pleaſures, then to carry him abroad to the hazard of his life. But ſince this miſchief is not to be remedied, thy deſire to accompany him, muſt be without fear; neither muſt thou ſhrinke from death to follow him. Lifting up then her hands, ſhe was ready to ſtrike the dagger into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> who perceived her intent, and therefore was lighted from his horſe, had not ſuddenly laid hold of her; and remonſtrated that deſpair was a greater offence, then that for which ſhe ſo much ſorrowed. Stay Madam, ſaid he, ſtay your hand, I beſeech you, and do not in this ſort run headlong to perdition. The ſhorteſt follies are the beſt; and when you have well conſidered that the ſhedding of your bloud, will not reſtore him to life, whoſe death you lament, you will, without doubt preſerve it; and beleeve that it were better to appeaſe his ghoſt with ſome other kind of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to incenſe the Gods with a new murther. Alas! anſwered ſhe, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him, if you knew the occaſion I have to deſire to die, you would not now divert me from this deſigne. I do not doubt, ſaid he, but the cauſe of your grief is very important, but yet I ſay that it ought not to tranſport you from your reaſon; and if you could give your ſelf ſome relaxation in imparting it to me, you ſhould doe much for my ſatisfaction, and perhaps not a little for the eaſe of your mind. I am content to do it, anſwered ſhe, letting the poniard go, but it ſhall be upon condition, that you ſhall leave me at liberty to do what I pleaſe, if you find the occaſions that I have to be juſt. <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> having promiſed her not to croſſe her will, provided hee

might do it with reaſon, ſhe ſat down upon the graſſe, and thus began her diſcourſe. Walking one evening in a wood neere the houſe, in which I am ordinarily reſident, I met a Knight, who being ſtrayed out of his way, did ſo curteouſly entreat me to grant him lodging for that night, as beſide the law of charity, which doth bind us not to refuſe our helpe to thoſe that doe need it: I felt my ſelf alſo forced by the fair language, and by the grace that he uſed in his requeſt, to give him my hand, and to lead him to my houſe, aſſuring him that there he ſhould receive the beſt entertainmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſo pleaſed me, that not to diſſemble, I could not keep my ſelf from falling in love with him. I then made him to be ſerved at the Table, and ſometimes ſerving him my ſelf with the ſtrength of my affection, I ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to my curteſie, that aſſuredly hee did beare mee ſome good will, which infinitely rejoiced me; but fearing to loſe him, as ſoon as I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, my contentment was thereby much weakened: To remedy that doubt, I reſolved to arreſt him with my careſſes, I mean, to give my ſelfe wholly to him without any reſervation at all. Taking him then by the hand, after he had ſupped, I went and fate down with him upon the beds feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to tell me his name, his quality, and paſſing from thoſe ordinary tearms to thoſe of love, I made an oſtentation, not of my bounty, for of that his eyes could be judge, but of my birth and quality, eminent enough for the ambition of any Knight, that were not a Prince; the conveniencies that I was Miſtriſſe of, my eſtate, my humour not unpleaſing: and briefly, all that came in my head, and which I beleeved might ſerve to make him to affect me; but fearing all theſe charmes would not be able to ſtay him, I entreated him to grant me one favour, which I intended to deſire of him.</p>
                     <p>The entertainment, ſaid he, which I have heer received from you, doth not permit me to be ingratefull in refuſing you; Madam, you ſhall have of me all that you pleaſe to command. As for the firſt point of your deſire, I will tell you freely, that I am called <hi>Griolanis,</hi> born in Macedon, of parents unto whom fortune truly hath done wrong in not conferring ſcepters on them for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their vertue; I travell thorow the world to purchaſe glory, and raiſe my ambition beyond the limits of my birth, and ſhould reckon my ſelf moſt happy, if I might deſerve the greatneſſe of your fortune in poſſeſſing of you; but not thinking it fit to aim ſo high, before my valour hath made me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great a favour, I will put off the further treating thereof till ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and in the mean while beſeech you to let me freely know what you deſire of me. To have you maintain a juſts in favour of me, anſwered I, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſatisfied with his diſcourſe, which confirmed my hope, not in this Caſtle, but neer Conſtantinople, that the glory of my beauty may flee about, together with the praiſe which you will acquire by your noble deeds. Your requeſt, ſaid he, is ſo much to my advantage, as I will not fear to intreat you that we may be gone about it in the morning. This anſwer having quieted my minde, I brought him to his chamber, where I left him to take his reſt, and having given order for ſome affairs of mine, after Sun-riſing I departed with him, and came to a croſſe way not far from hence, where this fair Knight, for three weeks ſpace, acted wonders, and won ſuch glory, that round about there was no talk ſave of him; but the Deſtinies, envying my content, brought a

Knight to us yeſterday, that bare a Savage in his ſhield, who defied my lover upon the injuſtice of his enterpriſe. <hi>Griolanis</hi> alwaies accuſtomed to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, judging by the aſpect of his adverſary, that he was like to be very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Choler then having quickly raiſed theſe two brave warriors, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſently drew their ſwords, and ſo ſtoutly charged one another, that all the wood reſounded with it; I ſaw their heads continually covered with fire, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their armour fell to the ground; if one ſtruck with force, the other with dexterity rebated it; blows followed thruſts, their ſhields were ſo hewed, that but a little of them was left upon their arms, their helmets were all battered, their cuiraſſes pierced, and the graſſe was ſtained with their bloud; as often as the Knight of the Savage advanced his ſword, I grew pale, and lifting mine eyes to heaven implored the aid of the Gods for my Knight; I was many times riſing to part them, and inſtantly fell down again with fear and weakneſſe; briefly, I beheld this combat more dead then alive. Six howrs now being ſpent between them in this faſhion, and yet no advantage to be diſcerned on either ſide, both quitted their ſwords, and taking one another about the middle, they fell to wreſtling together with extream fury; ſometimes one was above, ſometimes another; ſo that having toiled thus a while with incredible deſpight to ſee their victory no more advanced, they by a mutuall conſent aroſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their ſwords againe, renewed the combat in a crueller and more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner then before: <hi>Griolanis</hi> did his part to the height, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he was one of the prime Knights in the world: but the Savage was nothing behinde him. So that having continued the fight in this ſort, three or foure houres longer, they advanced both their ſwords, and at one and the ſame inſtant diſcharged them with ſuch violence on each other, as <hi>Griolanis</hi> not able to ſupport the weight of the blow, fell to the ground quite deprived of ſenſe, juſt as his enemy ſtaggering did the like. The fall of theſe two Knights ſo amazed me, as I was not able to go preſently to <hi>Griolanis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but love prevailing over feare, I at laſt aroſe, and being about to unlace his helmet, I ſaw two women come riding in a Caroch, who taking them both up, put them into it, and then immediatly going in themſelves, without ſpeaking a word to me, went their wayes with ſuch ſpeed, as that, and the aſtoniſhment wherein I was, made me that I could not obſerve what way they took. But having within a while recovered my ſpirits, I made a horſe be brought me, and getting up, I put my ſelfe into the wood, and ſought them all the night, without hearing any newes of them. From hence proceeds my reſolution to dye: for ſince <hi>Griolanis</hi> lives not, what ſhould I do in the world? So holding her peace, ſhee went to ſeeking of her ponyard; but <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> fell again to comfort her, and ſo powerfully prevailed with her, as in the end ſhe promiſed him to do no violence upon herſelfe: whereupon bidding the Damſell that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him farewell, ſince the occaſion of his journey was removed, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Conſtantinople, where we will give him leaſure to relate what he had learned from the Gentlewoman, to ſpeake of theſe two incomparable warriours.</p>

What do I ſee? Where am I, or who could bring me into a place of ſuch delicacie?

But I may quickly free my ſelf of all doubt: This ſtately Palace, is not without inhabitants, and I ſhall ſurely finde ſome body in it, that will inform me how things have paſt: Leaping then out of his bed, he took certain clothes that lay upon a table, and having put them on, he went down into a dainty garden, where all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flowers of the earth were ſet in a moſt ſtrange and artificiall order; he beheld with admiration a multitude of trees, loaden with all manner of fruit, heard with pleaſure the muſick of a million of birds, who ſeemed to ſtrive for to render that place moſt delectable; and viewed with wonder, a many of fountains, which made a fair lake, wherein a world of ſwans did ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but that which he thought the greateſt wonder, was that, among all theſe rarities, he found not any one perſon of whom he might be ſatisfied in what he deſire<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: In the end, having viſited all the allies, he ſaw come forth from the other ſide of the houſe a Gentleman, ſo handſome; of ſo ſweet a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and of ſo brave a preſence, as he beleeved that nature was not able to frame ſuch another piece; his carriage exceedingly pleaſing him, he went to ſalute him, and not knowing him for that incomparable warrior, that had made him ſo ſweat in his armour the day before, he ſaid to him: Sir, you ſhall much oblige me if you will be pleaſed to tell me where I am, and who is the Maſter of this place. Verily, anſwered the fair Knight, I am in the ſame trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you are, and being heer without knowing how I came hither, was ſeeking ſome body that might ſatisfie me in what you enquire after. As far as I perceive, ſaid <hi>Grien,</hi> our caſe is much one, and ſince a like fortune hath made us (not expecting it) to incounter thus, a like means, it may be, will make us finde the cauſe of it: Yet me thinks I ſee a man under thoſe trees; let us, I pray

you, go to him, he may perhaps ſatisfie our deſire: The Knight then, who was no other then <hi>Griolanis,</hi> looking behinde him, ſpied an old man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them, of a tall ſtature, in whoſe face appeared a Majeſty not common with other men, who when heapproached to them, ſaid: Sir Knights, your meeting doth yeeld me matchleſſe contentment, for ſeeing you ſo kinde friends after ſo great an animoſity, I may with reaſon eſteem my ſelf happy, that I have entertained you in my houſe. For my part, ſaid <hi>Griolanis,</hi> who by thoſe words knew that this Knight whom he beheld, was the redoubted Knight of the Savage, that had ſo late made him deſpair of his life, I can bear no ill will to this brave warrior, out of the conſideration of our late combat; but if he pleaſe to love me, I ſhall gladly do him all ſervice. Love you, ſaid <hi>Grian,</hi> yes without queſtion I will love you, for it were a crime to hate your vertue; beleeve it then that I am wholly yours: Whereupon, they imbraced one another with as much affection as could be deſired, which ſo contented <hi>Alcander,</hi> that carrying them into a Cabinet, after he had royally feaſted them, with abundance of delicate meats, he thus ſpake to them: Brave warriors, be not amazed at what you have lately ſeen; the heavens, that would have you preſerved for their glory, made me yeſterday ſeek to ſave you in a time when you had little reaſon to hope for it; your choler brought you even to deaths door, my care hath returned you back from it, ſeek not any occaſion of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence heerafter; but rather imploy thoſe mighty abilities which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed you with, to the ruine of thoſe that would overthrow his religion, he will reward your zeal, and you ſhall ſee a happy end of all your enterpriſes. At theſe words he vaniſhed out of their fight, thoſe ſtately buildings were now no more to be ſeen, thoſe delicious gardens changed their form, the Knights found themſelves mounted upon their horſes, and armed at all peeces, exceedingly aſtoniſhed at that which had befallen them: But not forgetting the counſell that had been given them, they again proteſted to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eternally; and taking the firſt way that came to hand, they went directly to Conſtantinople, as you ſhall ſee in the Chapter enſuing.</p>

Soſudden a departure would certainly have very much diſcontented all the Court, if that yong Prince had been in the power of anyother. But every one being aſſured that thoſe Sages had not carried him away in that ſort, but for his honor, they ſhewed but little grief for his abſence, eſpecially <hi>Floriſel</hi> &amp; the reſt of thoſe Princes, who ſeeing themſelves without wrinkles, and with the ſame beauty and abilities which they had when they were five and twenty years old, did view themſelves with wonder, &amp; could not tell how to comprehend ſuch prodigious things. All men caſt their eyes upon the fair Queen of France, who having the ſame charmes about her, that ſhe had when ſhe was called the Baſiliske of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, ſtrucke every eye with infinite amazement: they alſo admired the renewed beauty of the excellent Queen of Guindaya, of the matchleſſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtraxarea,</hi> which had for ſo long a time kept the Prince of Colchos her idolatrizer, of the faire Empreſſe of Perſia, the peerleſſe Empreſſe of the Parthians, and the <hi>Infanta Rozaliana</hi> her ſiſter: and in brief, of them all, who had as well as they experienced how farre the power of <hi>Alcander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

All being thus ſet upon pleaſure, the young Princes who as yet were not knighted, deſiring to demonſtrate that they were no leſſe joyfull then the reſt, preſented themſelves upon their knees together, all armed in white armour, before <hi>Floriſel</hi> of Niquea, and by <hi>Perſides,</hi> whom they had made their ſpokeſman, thus delivered their requeſt.

That done, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe afreſh, to make much of his friends, who ſeemed to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond all joy. Theſe new Knights riſing from their knees, with incredible ſatisfaction, for that they had met with ſo little difficulty in their deſigne, went to take a ſlight repaſt with the Emperours; and having fitted themſelves with all that was neceſſary, entred the liſt, where <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> being choſen for the Captain of two hundred Greek Knights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the head of whom were <hi>Ruſsian, Fulgoran, Eſquilan, Florizart, Abies, Frizel, Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Armond</hi> and <hi>Melfort;</hi> and <hi>Perſides</hi> with the like number of French and Perſians, aſſiſted by his brother <hi>Floridan, Rozanel d'Aſtre, Lucibel, Seſtilian, Perion, Florian, Triſtor, Quedragant, Dardanio</hi> and the gentle <hi>Floreſtan</hi> of Sardinia. Vpon the third ſound of the trumpet they began the braveſt courſe in the world, <hi>Perſides, Floridan, Rozanel</hi> and the young Prince of France, brake very gallantly upon the Emperour of Aethiopia, <hi>Fulgoran, Ruſsian</hi> of Media, &amp; the ſtout Polonian. And paſſing forwards without once bending in the faddle, for all the encounter of four ſuch famous warriours, they bravely ſet hand to their ſwords, wherewith they began to cleare the rankes, in ſuch ſort, as already men fore-judged that with time they would prove equall with the prime Knights of the world: Every blow that they gave, laid a man upon the ground, and nothing could have ſtood before them, if the ſame foure with whom they ran their courſes, had not oppoſed themſelves, and arreſted their fury. The brave baſtard of Media having <hi>Perſides</hi> in hand, charged him with very much force and grace; but his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my behaved himſelfe ſo well, as he was eſteemed no leſſe valiant then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> being oppoſed to <hi>Rozanel,</hi> confeſſed, that he had never ſeen a man more active, or more able. And the valiant Princes of Canabea, &amp; Poland, had enough to do to ward the blows which <hi>Lucibel</hi> and <hi>Floridan</hi> laid inceſſantly upon them.</p>
                     <p>The honour of the victory being generally diſputed by theſe young Lords, everyone was highly delighted with their behaviour, and more then all the reſt, the Princes of Greece, who obſerving them with wonder, and infinitely admiring ſuch ability in tender yeers, did heartily wiſh that the honour of the tourney might be theirs, which undoubtedly had befallen them, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that <hi>Melfort</hi> and the reſt could do, who by little and little yeelded to the blows of <hi>Seſtilian,</hi> which that day gave great proof of an admirable valour, when as they ſaw two Knights enter the field in watchet arms, ſo gentile, and ſo gallantly ſeated in their ſaddles, that all men had a good opinion of them; their gracefull carriage drawing the moſt part of the aſſiſtants to obſerve them, it was quickly known, by a Savage appearing in a ſhield of one of them, that they were the famous <hi>Grian,</hi> and the fair Knight, of whom ſuch miracles had

been reported. Theſe two warriors ſeeing that every body obſerved them with expectation of what they would do, couched their lances, and taking part with the weaker ſide, at the firſt courſe laid <hi>Perion</hi> of Turky, and <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> in the duſt; and drawing forth their ſwords, in a moment overthrew <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Triſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On the other ſide, <hi>Rozanel</hi> and <hi>Griolanis</hi> entreated one another with a like fury; their ſwords were perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in motion, their ſhields fell in pieces, and a thouſand flames flew continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about their heads: If fear of being overcome rendered the Greek Princes ſtrong and hardy, the deſire which the others had of acquiring glory in the preſence of the moſt gallant warriors of the world, did ſo enflame their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, as their blows ſeemed lightening which falls from heaven upon the higheſt tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Two daies being ſweetly ſpent in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Alcander</hi> (who diſpoſed of his leiſure according to the event of things which he fore ſaw by an admirable knowledge) cauſed his Griffons to ſtay in the unknown Iſland of the ſage <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and alighting with her and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Rozalmond</hi> in the Chariot, accompanied with the fair <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> he ſaid unto him: Excellent Prince, it is time to give a beginning to the wonders which your valour is to bring into the world, your labours ſhall be great, but as great ſhall be your reward, and the glory you ſhall reap by them will make them ſo acceptable unto you that in ſtead of being danted with the pains you will every day ſeek new occaſions to employ your ſelf and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your name more famous. I will not ſpeak heer of the care you are to have of the ſervice of God, knowing full well that your good education hath not been without that inſtruction, and leſſe will I recommend thoſe parts unto your memory which a good Knight ought to be indued withall, the greatnes of your birth having naturally given you a powerfull impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue; but I earneſtly beſeech you not to abandon the counſell which this damſell your follower ſhall give you, untill ſuch time as your deſtiny ſhall call you to the place where her preſence can no longer ſerve you: Her parents have alwaies watched for the ſafety of your predeceſſors, ſhe ſhall continue the ſame care, and her ſuccour ſhall be no leſſe importing your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, then that of her mothers was to the deſigns of <hi>Amadis</hi> the Great. At theſe words the Griffons extending forth their wings, roſe up ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Rozalmond</hi> had not time to render the thanks which he thought was due to the affection of this man: wherwithall undoubtedly he had been much diſcontented if <hi>Caſſandra</hi> had not advertiſed him that ſo ſudden a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17218:93"/>
was not without ſome ſecret myſterie. Comforting himſelf then with his entertainment, three dayes paſt away with the ſame delight as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the end whereof he ſaw the Griffons, which drew him gently to ſtay their flight, and alight down neer to a city, the ſtatelieſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable that ever he had beheld; it being compoſed of beautifull build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, framed after another faſhion then at Conſtantinople, or in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Parthians, where he had been brought up.

                        </gap>ovelty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, his eyes were diverſly carried according to the variety of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which raviſhed him in ſuch ſort, that he never thought of alighting out of his chariot; but <hi>Caſſandra</hi> taking him by the hand to divert him from ſo profound a thought, ſaid unto him; It is no time, brave Prince, it is no time to wonder at ſuch petty matters, by and by you will ſee far greater marvells: onely let us enter into the city, and be mindfull to reſerve ſo much power over your ſelf, that you fail in nothing when you come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Emperour that is to make you Knight, and are to appear before the faireſt Princeſſe of the world, who will this day triumph as much over you, as you in time to come ſhall triumph over the greateſt Knights of the earth. I ſhould fear the encounter of theſe perſons (anſwered he) if I did not march under your conduct; but Madam, what apparance is there that I can fail in your preſence, or that my paſſion ſhould tranſport me ſo far as to forget my duty? I know how to carry my ſelf towards perſons of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Emperour, and how a Princeſſe of her merit, whom you ſo highly commend, is to be admired; ſo that if I muſt learn to love, time and my fidelity ſhall one day make me expert: in the mean ſeaſon, I will never be troubled to ſee her ſigh for another, and reject my ſervices; for if her heart be other wayes ingaged, you have charms of power to alter her minde, and to ſubject her unto me in deſpight of her ableſt reſiſtance. Your merits can do more (ſaid <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> then my Art: But not to looſe time, give me your ſword and helmet, and let us go on. Then advancing towards the city, they went unto the Palace, before which they found four hundred Knights all armed, and mounted in ſuch ſort, as if they had been ready to charge ſome enemy. This encounter amazed them, and they could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have ſtayed to demand what occaſion had aſſembled them in that manner; but fearing to offend by this curioſity, they paſt on, and mounting up the ſtaires, came into the hall, where the firſt object they met withall, was an old man, high ſeated in a throne of gold, wearing an Imperiall dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem on his head, having by his ſide a wife of his own age, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a daughter ſo fair, that nature ſeemed to have imploied all the power ſhe had left for to make her accompliſhed. <hi>Rozalmond</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a world of aſſurance in his actions unto himſelf, beholding a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo rare and excellent, made a ſtand in the midſt of the hall, as if he would have taken time to admire her; but inſtantly remembring <hi>Caſſandra's</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he continued his pace with a ſweet modeſtie; and ſeeing himſelf at the foot of the throne, he kneeled down, where with an admirable grace craving the Emperours hand to kiſſe, he beſought him not to refuſe him one boon he would demand of him. You ſhall have it (ſaid the Emperour, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of his ſeat for to imbrace him, with aſtoniſhment at his ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary feature) and I will never refuſe a gentleman of ſo goodly a preſence as yours, albeit my ſcepter and my crown were at ſtake for it. I am not heer to ask riches of you (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> Fortune doth give them to us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17218:93"/>
when we have deſerved them, and a man ought to be contented when he is vertuous, but I am now at your Majeſties feet to obtain the power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe armes upon my back; firſt, for the ſervice of God, and then for the ſuccour of thoſe which ſhall be any wayes afflicted: In a word, Sir, I deſire you, if you pleaſe to make me Knight, to the end I may in ſome ſort imitate my Anceſtours, who by their worthy acts have acquired immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall glory in the world. Your demand ſeems ſo juſt (anſwered the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) that I ſhould hold it a very great errour to deny you; but it grives me not a little, noble Sir, that I cannot give you ſo ſacred an order with thoſe ceremonies I deſire, for having ſo juſt an occaſion to be afflicted, by reaſon of the importunity of an accident, that now lies heavie upon me, I cannot any way ſhew that joy which otherwiſe I would. The ſilence I every where obſerve (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> &amp; that array wherin I beheld ſome of your people, made me think that you had ſome great affair in hand, but I could not imagine, Sir, that your Majeſtie being ſo puiſſant in friends, in means, in men, could fear any diſaſter whatſoever: howbeit, now I learn that the higheſt are moſt ſubject to miſhap, and your affliction makes me ſay, that the condition of men is miſerable, ſeeing it depends onely upon fortune: the moſt violent diſeaſes finde their remedies, ſo ſhall your griefe ere it be long, and time ſhall reſtore you to your former peace. The Gods (ſaid the Emperour, ſhedding ſome tears) ſhall if it be their pleaſures authorize your words and my wiſhes, and take pity of my ſuffering, whilſt I comfort my ſelf in that hope. And that you may not complain of me, I will make you Knight yet before dinner, ſince you deſire it ſo much. Then taking him by the hand, he led him to the Temple, where his Gods were worſhipped, and giving him the Oath, he made him Knight after his faſhion. All the while the Ceremonies were in doing, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> had his eies firmly fixed on this beautious Princeſſe, whom his ſoul already adored; and perceiving her looks in like manner to be faſtened on him, as amazed at the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his perſon, he kneeled down before her, and ſaid; Madam, there is but one thing now wanting to make me compleatly happy, namely, that I may receive the ſword from you, who are, in my judgement, the faireſt Lady in the world, as I have received the Order from the greateſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the earth; this favour will ſo incourage me in the midſt of dangers, that I ſhall draw glory out of the moſt difficile enterpriſes. Would to the Gods (ſaid ſhe, amorouſly ſighing) that this were able to adde any thing to your valour; be aſſured then, Sir Knight, that your good fortune ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with mine own preſervation, and that I would give you forces ſufficient to draw us out of the perplexity wherein we are now ſo miſerably plunged; but knowing mine own weakneſſe, and the little power I have in the world, I can hope for nothing that way: nevertheles, not to be ſo far ingratefull, as to refuſe you any thing which may become me to grant you, I wil willingly gird you with the ſword, &amp; withall humbly beſeech the Gods, that you may worthily imploy it, for the glory of their Altars, and the ſuccour of the afflicted; ſaying ſo, ſhe took it from the ſage <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> hung it at his girdle, and preſently would have retired; but the love of this new Knight was more, then to leave her with any diſtaſte for want of an anſwer: ſo that bowing himſelf, and kiſſing her hand, he ſaid unto her; Excellent Lady, I may truly ſay, that the braveſt Knights of the earth never received fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours equall to thoſe you have been graciouſly pleaſed to confer on me
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17218:94"/>
this day, but render my content perfect, I beſeech you, and permit me to importune you ſo far, as to demand why you told me that my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhould begin with your preſervation, if you could adde any thing to my forces; for it is juſt, that I ſerve you at this time with the ſword where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall you have armed me, and I ſhould finde ſupreme glory in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which you ſhould be pleaſed to lay upon me, for to undertake ſome combat, with the title of your Knight. If I did not value your life (replied ſhe with a delicate bluſh, and a little withdrawing her ſelf aſide) I ſhould make no difficulty to expoſe you to the fury of a man, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted of the earth; who lately encountring the Emperour my father in a forreſt, whither for his pleaſure he was gone to hunt, cut an hundred Knights, which accompanied him, in pieces; and having ſtruck him down with a blow of his ſword, made him promiſe that I ſhould be the price of his life and liberty, and that he ſhould marry me within fifteen dayes; but deſiring to reſerve you for an affair leſſe dangerous, if I cannot avoid this, I will never permit you to ingage your ſelf ſo raſhly, and I ſhall be very well contented that you will leave this controverſie to be decided by all thoſe Cavaliers, whom you ſaw before the Court gate when you entred in. I do not think (anſwered <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> that the promiſe of all the Empires in the world would be half ſo dear to me, as the aſſurance which you have now given of your fair reſpect to me. But, Madam, could I merit this grace, or could you ever regard me, if I ſhould be ſo baſe as to leave the glory of your ſervice to another? That ſhall never be, and well might you repute me moſt unworthy of your eſteem, if this occaſion ſhould paſſe over ſo. My vertue muſt give me this treaſure, and my valour muſt make me the lawfull maſter of it; your enemy is a man, and conſequently ſubject to the ſame accidents which thwart others; I will ſee him, not with thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med troops, but alone; to the end that the reputation of his defeat may not be divided with others; I moſt humbly beſeech you therefore not to reſpect my life, which cannot be more generouſly imploied, and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that marching for your intereſt, you will receive ſatisfaction from my enterpriſe. Theſe words pronounced with more then an ordinary grace of ſpirit, gave much content to the Princeſſe, who took them for powerfull teſtimonies of love; but her affection making her apprehenſive of his loſſe, ſhe was about to have commanded him not to undertake this combat, when as the Emperour ſent for him to ſit down at the table, who not enduring to hear the ſighes of the afflicted people amidſt his own joy, ſeeing the meat come in, he went and kneeling down before the Emperour, ſaid unto him: Mighty Prince, the honour that you have done me this day, obligeth me to take part of your diſtreſſe, nor will it permit me to quit theſe armes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I have imploied them againſt this barbarous ſtranger, who thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets you. He is before the walls of the Town, and it is ſaid, that he hath made a vow never to depart thence till you have performed your promiſe; let us make good his words, and permit me to ſend him to a grave, rather then into the armes of a creature ſo divine, from whom he doth not merit ſo much as a look: I am in caſe to fight, there is yet day enough, if he have much ſtrength, I do not want courage; make uſe, Sir, of a ſtranger, who hath not the honour to be known of you, nor ſo much as can tell where he is: If fortune prove mine enemy, you will be the leſſe ſenſible of my loſſe, in regard you know me not; and if the dice chance to turn, from how much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17218:94"/>
care will you be delivered. The knowledge which I have (ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) of the incomparable forces of this warrior, will not ſuffer me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you the combat with him, and the reaſons you bring to perſwade me thereunto, are proper to diſſwademe from it; for if you undertake a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of the onely pity which you have of my affliction, have not I much cauſe to lament you, if for my ſake you ſhould die? Yea, I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the loſſe of you more then of a thouſand other men, who it may be could attempt the danger out of the hope of recompence, whereas you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound nothing to your ſelf, but the glory you expect from your travell: put your ſelf in head of thoſe armed troops, that they may take aſſurance from this courage; this way you will much more endear me unto you then any other. Sir (anſwered <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> the Knights of our countrey never fight with advantage, at leaſtwiſe thoſe who hope for honour from their actions: your enemy is accompanied but with one Squire, and with your favour I will carry none along with me but this damſell, who hath alwayes followed me; onely in regard I am on foot, permit me to chuſe an horſe in your ſtable. Seeing you will have it ſo (ſaid the Emperour) I will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oppoſe you, and the Gods I humbly beſeech to favour your valour, and return you with as much glory, as you have juſtice in this quarrell. This reſolution of <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> having aſtoniſhed all the Knights of the Court, who beheld him as a wonder, ſeeing with what confidence he went to affront a man, that ſcorned to draw his ſword againſt whole troops, greatly troubled the Princeſſe, who diſcontented with her fathers conſent, would fain have drawn the Knight aſide, abſolutely to forbid him the fight, but ſeeing ſhe could not poſſibly do it without diſcovering her affection, ſhe was conſtrained to retire, and have recourſe unto teares for the eaſing of her grief.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hileſt the Princeſſe bewailed the loſſe of her Knight, which ſhe held to be inevitable, he went to finde out his rivall, with an incredible content for that he had ſo ſuddenly met with an occaſion to employ his ſword for the ſervice of a beauty which his ſoul ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but he was vexed with himſelf, for that he had not been ſo curious as to demand her, and her fathers name. Intertaining himſelf in this manner, the thought of his Miſtris, from whoſe fight he was not abſented, made him fetch ſome ſighes; whereupon, <hi>Caſſandra</hi> took occaſion to ſay unto him; Ah Sir, did not I aſſure you that you ſhould ſee ſtrange things to day, and you ſhould not come out of the city again with the ſame power you had of your ſelf in the morning? You have been but too true (anſwered he) for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging my captivity, I may ſay to you, that now I have ſeen the faireſt thing in the world: But Madam, Why do you not tell me in what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17218:95"/>
countrey we are, the name of this courteous Prince who hath made me Knight, and that of this incomparable beauty, which hath left me nothing free, but the will to ſerve her? Why what important affair had you (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> ſmiling) that hindered you from informing your ſelf thereof? My paſſion, replied he, may ſerve to excuſe me for that: and I, ſaid ſhe, was reſtrained by the reſpect I had, not to withdraw you out of the rapture, wherein the object of this Princeſſe had caſt you: but to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your deſire, Know that you are now in the mighty Empire of Gardacia, which is ſo far diſtant from the Kingdoms of Chriſtendom, that they have never heard ſo much as ſpeak of it: the Sovereign thereof is this Prince, by whom you were Knighted, valiant in his younger yeers, and ſo redoubted by all his neighbours, that never any one durſt offer to trouble the quiet of his ſtate, but <hi>Fulmigadan,</hi> the ſame againſt whom you now go to fight: who not being able to look upon <hi>Armazia,</hi> ſo is your Miſtris named, without rendring unto her that which is due to her from all men in the world, found means to ſurpriſe her father, and oblige him, by the reſtitution of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make him maſter of the felicities, which he imagines to himſelf in the poſſeſſion of a thing ſo rare: But it is time to leave off this diſcourſe for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which touches you ſomewhat neerer; you are approaching an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then will you oblige me much more then you think for, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> but I fear ſhe will not willingly take ſo much pains. Leave me the care of that, ſaid <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and I am perſwaded ſhe will make no difficulty at all of it. Whereupon returning preſently to the Court, ſhe went to <hi>Armazia</hi> in her chamber, and perceiving ſome tears upon her cheeks, ſhe ſaid unto her; Beautious Princeſſe, I imagine that the pity which you have of our Knight, makes you lament his loſſe as inevitable, being to encounter <hi>Fulmigadan;</hi> but it lies in you to hinder that miſhap, and to make him this day triumph over ſo brave an enemy. Would you know how? By not diſdaining to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the city walls; your preſence will animate his forces, redouble his courage, and I am perſwaded render him invincible; upon this favour, your own good and his life depend: wherefore, Madam, ſeek aſſurance in his victorie, as he will finde glory in your ſervice; you ſhall not repent any pains you can take to go and ſee him fight for you, for I am confident that you will return with more content then you have grief at this preſent. I were not worthy to live, if I would not contribute to mine own ſafety, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe; Will my preſence avail this Knight, ſay you? It is moſt juſt that I give him this ſmall ſatisfaction, ſeeing he contemns his own life to ſave mine; let us go then when you pleaſe, but with this aſſurance, that for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rv drop of bloud his enemies ſword ſhall draw from him, ſo many tears ſhall I ſhed: ſo being attended by certain Ladies, ſhe appeared upon the walls juſt at the time, when <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> being come to <hi>Fulmigadan,</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him. Knight, it is time for you to ſay, that <hi>Armazia</hi> is too fair to fall into the power of a man ſo ill made as your ſelf; ſhe hath ſent me hither to free you of the error you are in, that ſhe may one day affect you, howſoever her father hath been conſtrained by fear to promiſe the contrary; but thinking that theſe words would not be very pleaſing unto you, I am come provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to anſwer you other wayes. What do I hear, ſaid <hi>Fulmigadan</hi> in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fury, doth <hi>Armazia</hi> diſdain the honour of my favour, and do I ſee my ſelf defied by one man alone? O ye Gods! How will I be revenged on her and you for this affront; but thou, inſolent Knight, ſhalt begin the dance for bringing me ſo harſh a meſſage. Saying ſo, he unſheathed a long and heavie Scimiter, wherewithall he ſtruck at <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> head, but he obſerving his action, threw away his lance, and laying his hand ſuddenly on his ſword, oppoſed his left arm to the fury of the blow, which was ſo great, that it made him bow to the crupper of his horſe with extreme pain; but he preſently ſetled himſelf again, and deſiring to be revenged, he ſtruck him with ſuch fury, that the Pagan receiving the blow upon his ſhield, thought he had been under the ruines of a tower overthrown by lightning, and indeed he ſo aſtoniſhed him, that had it not been for his horſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away, <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> who had his ſword aloft, might eaſily have vanquiſhed and ſlain him. This firſt blow amazing <hi>Armazia,</hi> inflamed her with the love of this Knight, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd in truth the rage of the Pagan was ſuch, that <hi>Rozalmonda</hi> arms, though the beſt of the world, could not have reſiſted the fury of the blow; but lightly avoiding it, and making uſe of the opportunity, he charged full upon the body of <hi>Fulmigadan,</hi> which he opened, and gave paſſage to his bloud to iſſue forth in great abundance: Thus the battell waxing every minute hotter and hotter, the ground was ſtrewed with pieces of their armor, the graſſe was died with their bloud, &amp; the skie enlightened with the fire which ſparkled from their helmets, and the encounter of their ſwords. If the force of <hi>Fulmlgadan</hi> ſeemed monſtrous, no leſſe admirable appeared the addreſſe of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both in abating, and ſhifting his blows; briefly, this combat brought a generall aſtoniſhment, and every one expected the end of it by ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blow. In the mean time, the two combatants charged one another with extream fury, and taking no time to breathe, ſo quick were their ſtrokes, that their ſwords were neverſeen but in the air, or on their armour. <hi>Fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadan,</hi> far more enraged then can be expreſt, and ſtriking with paſſion, and not with judgement, railed againſt heaven and earth for producing a man ſo puiſſant and couragious, as to be able to withſtand his force, that made the whole world to ſhake; and ſeeing that four hours were already ſpent ſince the combat firſt began, and yet had gotten no advantage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he gave ſuch deſperate blows that made <hi>Rozalmond</hi> amazed at his fury; but being no leſſe incenſed to ſee that in the beginning of his arms, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was ſo long diſputed in the preſence, and for the preſervation of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazia,</hi> to whom his ſoul was ſo far ingaged, he reſolved either to die, or ſuddenly to vanquiſh; claſping his ſword then faſt in his hand, he began to preſſe the Pagan with ſuch terrible blows, that his forces ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17218:96"/>
with his travell, whereat <hi>Fulmigadan</hi> was ſo tranſported with rage, that he took his Scimiter in both his hands, and diſcharged it ſo furiouſly upon <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> helmet, as it made him fall backward upon the crupper of his horſe, caſting out great quantity of bloud at his mouth, and noſe; whereupon every one thought him to be dead, and the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Knights to aſſail his enemy, who ſeemed to be all covered over with bloud and duſt; but even as the troops were about to march, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Rozalmond</hi> raiſe himſelf up, and make towards <hi>Fulmigadan</hi> with ſuch horrible fury, that he, who contemned the dreadfull thunder of the Gods, began to fear, ſeeing him arrive with ſo much rage, and indeed the blow which he diſcharged on his head was ſuch, that it cleaved him down to the very ſhoulders, overthrowing him ſtark dead to the ground. This victory thus generouſly obtained, brought a world of contentment to the Emperor, but much more to the beautifull <hi>Armazia,</hi> who not able to contain her joy, ſo publiſhed the praiſes of this Knight, as if ſhe had neither voice nor ſpeech but for his glory; howbeit, every one thinking that ſhe did it in regard of the intereſt which ſhe had in the death of <hi>Fulmigadan,</hi> it was not ſuppoſed that her love made her ſpeak in that maner, but ſhe could not poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſelf in the exceſſe of her paſſion; for ſeeing <hi>Rozalmond</hi> come with ſome wounds upon him, ſhe made it appear that ſhe would be partaker of his pain, and not enduring to ſtay till the Emperour had entertained and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed him, ſhe went, and with an amorous countenance asked of him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wounds were dangerous. Madam, anſwered he, I am not ſo ill, but that if I were to begin another combat for your ſervice, I would moſt gladly undertake it. The Gods, ſaid ſhe, forbid ſuch another accident; you have done ſo much this day that your name ſhall never die in this Empire, ſo long as the world doth laſt; but I fear I ſhall abuſe your patience, if I do not permit your wounds to be viſited; wherefore I will leave you, having firſt entreated you to make uſe of all things heer, as if you were in your own houſe: the obligation wherein we ſtand ingaged unto you gives you this power, and commands me to ſeek out the means to ſhew my ſelf acknowleding in particular, which aſſure your ſelf I will do; in the mean time have regard to your health; ſo with moſt amourous looks ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, leaving him more contented with the care ſhe had of him, then with a Monarchie. The Emperours Chyrurgeons being arrived, would have dreſſed his wounds, but <hi>Caſſandra</hi> deſiring them to leave that unto her, ſhe cauſed him preſently to be laid into a bed, and making uſe of a precious balm, which ſhe ordinarily carried about her, ſhe willed him to reſt untill ſuch time as the medicine had wrought its operation.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Aſſandra</hi> leaving <hi>Rozalmond</hi> to his reſt, walked into the orchard, where the trees diverſly ranged, yeelded an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible delight, and deviſing with her ſelf what means ſhe might uſe to get from this Court without giving too much diſcontent to theſe new lovers; ſhe eſpied <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi> who being carried with clean contrary thoughts, was entertaining her ſelf with the pleaſure ſhe conceived to be in the poſſeſſing of a man, on whom the heavens ſeemed to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all the beauty, comelineſſe, and valour of the world. Should I not be happy indeed (ſaid ſhe to her ſelf) if this Knight were born for me, and ſhould I not have cauſe to praiſe my good fortune, if his condition ſhould prove equall to mine, that ſo my parents might one day grant me unto him in recompence of his ſervices? Yes no doubt, and I ſhould think that my content would ſurpaſſe all the pleaſures of the earth, nor would I envy the very glory of the Gods: But alas, I am afraid, conſidering the miſery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto us from the fault of the firſt man, that Fortune hath not given Scepters to his being, and that in regard thereof he will be leſſe acceptable to my father, who erring with others, will more eſteem greatneſſe then vertue, and will make me wretched in his avarice: Howbeit, I cannot think, that a valour ſo great, a countenance ſo promiſing, a preſence ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, and actions ſo majeſticall, may poſſibly be encountred in a vile and baſe perſon: Vertue delights in the higheſt places, and doth not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate her ſelf to ſuch as know not how to acknowledge her; it cannot be but that his birth doth equall his merits, and ſure I commit no fault in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him: nevertheleſſe, it were not amiſſe to clear this point inſtantly, and ſo free my ſelf of this unquietneſſe that thus afflicts me; which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be done, for this damſell that follows him will not refuſe, I hope, to give me this ſatisfaction: I will ſend for her then, and under colour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my ſelf of the faſhions of his countrey, draw her to acquaint me with that which I ſo much deſire to know; whereupon, turning about to command ſome of her women to fetch her unto her, ſhe perceived her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining that walk, as it were for fear to interrupt her in her meditations; wherewithall being very glad, ſhe called her unto her, and taking her by the hand, ſaid thus; Sweet heart, you ſhall do me a ſingular favour, if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our walk amongſt theſe trees, you will firſt recount unto me who this young Knight is, being the valianteſt that ever bare arms, and unto whoſe courage we are bound in ſo powerfull an obligation; and afterwards falling upon the faſhions of your Countrey you will faithfully deliver how the Knights live there with their miſtriſſes. Madam (anſwered <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> I will content you in a few words; Our lands are happy, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce excellent Knights, and moſt beautifull women (though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17218:97"/>
I never ſaw any that might compare with your Highneſſe) but that which addes unto our happineſſe, is the freedom wherein we live, we know not what ſuſpicion means; the Gallants frequent the Ladies, and the Ladies converſe with them, and are ordinarily ſeen in company together, either in the woods, or fields, free from any conjecture that may any way redound to the prejudice of their honour. It is certain that vertue is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes found in all kinde of perſons: if any undiſcreet Knight ſhall offend any Gentlewoman whom he ſhall meet alone, ſhe ſhall be preſently righted by the next that paſſeth by, and ſo is the inſolence of a diſhonourable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low revenged: concerning the ſituation of the countrey, I will ſpeak brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, onely ſaying, that it is very goodly, fertile in fruits, repleniſhed with beautifull and ſtrong towns, pleaſant rivers and woods: Now the merit of this Knight, the knowledge of whom you deſire; Madam, he is come of the nobleſt race in the world, and his parents are at this day ſo great, that the earth trembles at the onely report of their arms; for his valour, you have had the firſt proofs of it; you are judge of his perſon, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard you are as yet ignorant of his diſpoſition, I will aſſure you that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not able to conceive a ſweeter, or more pleaſing; more I may not ſay, a precedent Oath forbids me, and without breach of my faith, I may not name him, untill ſuch time as he hath finiſhed ſome warlike adventures, for the execution whereof I conduct him; and therefore, Madam, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire you that you will be pleaſed that he may depart to morrow. How, to morrow? (ſaid <hi>Armazia)</hi> he is not in caſe to go ſo ſoon, but ſay he were, you could not in any reaſon carry him away before the Emperour my father have bethought him of the recompences which are due to his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Madam (anſwered <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> men of this Knights condition under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing for gain, honour directs their enterpriſes, and all the riches of the world could not make him ſtep one foot; you are the treaſure he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the glory of your ſervice will be far more dear to him, then all the kingdoms of the earth: This makes you bluſh, but Madam (pleaſe you to pardon me if I go farther) it is no time now to diſguiſe your thoughts; I know them as well as your ſelf, and can tell that the perfections of this Knight have gotten him good place in your favour, as your beauty hath not left him without paſſion. You love him, but it is not fit that your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould deprive the world of the fruit of his vertue, him of the honour that he is to reap thereby, you of the content you are to hope from it, and his friends of the ſatisfaction which they ſhall finde in the praiſes every where publiſhed of him: the Ordinances of the Deſtinies, Madam, muſt be purſued, wherefore let your patience make your pleaſures, which you are to enjoy by his alliance, more ſweet: I will return him unto you, within a certain time, ſo full of glory, that you ſhall think you had been very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if you had hindered his deſignes; Weigh theſe reaſons, Madam, and never ſtand upon the conſideration of his wounds, they are healed by this time; and let me obtain that favour from you, as to truſt your ſecrets in my hands, I may do you more ſervice therein then you are aware of, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me you will hardly ſee your deſires fulfilled. It is true indeed (ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazia)</hi> that I did not think you had had ſuch knowledge, and that being ſurprized in this manner, my colour roſe in my face; but ſince nothing can be concealed from you, I will deal freely with you, and confeſſe that the merits of this Knight have wounded me with love, and deſire you to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17218:97"/>
very mindfull of the promiſe you have made me, to take care of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of his return, in the hope whereof, not oppoſing my ſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of heaven which govern all things with an admirable prudence, I will permit him to depart when you will, provided that I have to morrow for to ſee him heer after dinner, and draw from him the vows which I deſire for my aſſurance, at which time you ſhal bring him hither if you pleaſe, and you ſhall oblige me not to let him know that it is with my privity, to the end he may not take advantage of my weakneſſe. Madam, anſwered <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> he hath too much love and judgement to make ſo vain a uſe of that favour, and my ſelf too much devotion unto your ſervice to diſobey the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have laid upon me; we will be heer preſently after dinner, and in the mean time I wiſh that may be alwayes propitious to your deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saying ſo, night being come, ſhe withdrew, and getting to bed, betook her to her reſt. This while <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> having ſlept ſix hours, awaked; and feeling no pain from his wounds, was much abaſhed at the firſt; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this powerfull operation proceeded from <hi>Caſſandra's</hi> ſalves, he fell to think of his Lady, and his imagination repreſenting unto him the charms of her eyes, the lovely feature of her face, and the delicacie of her complexion, he ſaid; Mighty Love, that diſpoſeſt the hearts of men as thou pleaſeſt, leave me not now without ſuccour, and make this fair one as ſenſible of my paſſion, as my ſoul is of her beauty, then will I proclaim thy praiſes amidſt my content, and acknowledge no power to be greater then thine; I will publiſh to every one that thou art juſtly ſtiled the Maſter of the Gods. Entertaining himſelf thus with ſuch pleaſing fancies, he never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it was far day, and had continued longer in his bed, if <hi>Caſſandra</hi> had not come in, but her arrivall took him from his thoughts, for to tell her that all his wounds were cured, ſave onely that of his heart. I do beleeve it (ſaid ſhe unto him) but think you that I cannot cure that of your heart as well as thoſe of your body? I conceive that you are perſwaded ſo, and that my power doth not extend ſo far; but I will make it good to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the preſence of <hi>Armazia,</hi> who aſſuring you anon that ſhe loves you, will make it appear that I have power over all things: then ſetting her ſelf down at his beds feet, ſhe declared unto him the encounter which ſhe had had with his Miſtris, the diſcourſe that paſt between them, and briefly the commandment ſhe had received to bring him into the orchard, which gave him ſuch content, that all his ſpeech ſeemed too little to give her thanks for her aſſiſtance; he imbraced her, proteſted that he would never forget this favour, and not being able to contain himſelf in the exceſſe of his joy, he called for his clothes, in all haſte to run unto the place which ſhould be the witneſſe of his glory: but <hi>Caſſandra</hi> wiſely delivering, that he ought not to be ſo tranſported by his paſſion, which might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all his future happineſſe, ſtaied him and ſaid: Conſider better of your own good, go not on ſo precipitiouſly, and remember that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loves are preſerved and made perfect by direction. <hi>Armazia</hi> affects you, it is true, but ſhe would not have it known, and ſhe might juſtly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if your paſſion ſhould diſcover her ſecret, wherefore you ſee how you are to carry your ſelf with more judgement. I hold your counſell to be very good, anſwered he, but alas! I cannot command my ſelf; and my joy is ſuch, that thereby my reaſon is loſt: howbeit, I will be more adviſed ſince it concerns me ſo much, and by my government hereafter you ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17218:98"/>
known the greatneſſe of my affection. Entertaining themſelves thus with a world of pleaſing diſcourſes, they paſt away the time with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, till <hi>Rozalmond</hi> went into the great Hall, where the Emperour received him with ſo much demonſtration of kindneſſe, that he was even aſhamed of his favours. Behold (ſaid he, kiſſing him on the forehead) one of my chiefeſt wiſhes are accompliſhed, for ſeeing you in good health after I had doubted of your life, me thinks I have nothing elſe to deſire, but the means how to recompence you worthily: But whilſt the Gods ſhall be pleaſed to grant it me, make uſe, Sir, freely of the authority which I enjoy in my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; I give you the ſame power over it which I my ſelf have, and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I hold you every way as dear as I do my <hi>Armazia:</hi> I will not ask you who you are, time and my fair reſpect will perſwade you to acquaint me with it. Yes Sir (anſwered <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> and at this inſtant I would give you that ſatisfaction, if I could do it without the breach of the vow, which I have made not to diſcover my ſelf, untill I return from a voiage I had undertaken for the damſell whom you ſee accompanying me: at which time, Sir, I promiſe you, not onely to tell you who I am, but to ſerve you as long as I live, if you will be pleaſed to do me ſo much honour, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me into the number of your Knights. How (ſaid the Emperour) will you leave me ſo ſoon? My word obligeth me (anſwered <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> and I beſeech you be pleaſed that I depart to morrow, about an affair of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and if Fortune favour my arms, it ſhall not be long before I return again to wait on your Majeſtie. I ſhould have been very glad, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to have kept you longer heer; howbeit, I will not interrupt your deſignes, but will reſt contented with your promiſe: howſoever, will you not take leave of the Ladies? My duty bindes me to that, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and the rather becauſe you are pleaſed to permit me: So making a very low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto him, he went unto the Empereſſes chamber, who received him no leſſe graciouſly, and would likewiſe have perſwaded his longer ſtay; but making the ſame excuſes which he had uſed to the Emperour, he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, attending the time that he was to ſee <hi>Armazia;</hi> who having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn her ſelf preſently after dinner, entred into the orchard, with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance onely of one woman, and came to <hi>Rozalnond,</hi> who with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence expected her; and ſeeing her approach kneeled down for to kiſſe her hand.

That is all which I deſire, ſaid ſhe; in the mean time, I beſeech the Gods to bleſſe the ſucceſſe of your enterpriſes, and quickly to let me ſee my content in your return; ſo amourouſly kiſſing him, ſhe went away with tears in her eyes; and <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> being no leſſe diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, got him to his chamber, from whence he ſtirred not till the next morning about the break of day, when with <hi>Caſſandra</hi> he ſet forward on his way.</p>

Both pleaſure and pain (anſwered he) for if I be well ſatisfied with the remembrance of the beauties of <hi>Armazia,</hi> I am as much vexed at my eſloignment from her, not having beſtowed that time in her ſervice which my affection deſired. This ſhould not trouble you (ſaid ſhe) for Fortune prepares you ſo much pain for that occaſion, that you will one day wiſh you had leſſe; I do not ſpeak this to terrifie you, knowing well that you will never fear, come what danger can, but to allay the griefe you are in for your departure from the Court of <hi>Gardacia,</hi> having acquired no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. Howbeit, if I ſhall proceed, and ſay ſomething for your comfort, be ſure that you afflict your ſelf to no purpoſe, whenſoever you doubt the power of a rivall, <hi>Armazia</hi> being born to love you with as much fidelity as you profeſſe conſtancie unto her. But it is time to leave off this diſcourſe, the ſea appears, and now we muſt rowl according to Fortunes pleaſure, that ſo you may give a beginning to the wonders which your actions ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Approaching then to the ſea ſhore, they beheld the waters begin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inſtant, out of a ſetled calm, to ſwell with mighty billows, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently encountering one with another, made a dreadfull noiſe. So ſudden a tempeſt amazed <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> who turning to <hi>Caſſandra</hi> for to ask of her from whence it ſhould proceed, he ſaw a ſhip of the ſtrangeſt faſhion that ever eie beheld; it was round, and carved all over, at each window ſtood a ſtrong and furious ſavage with an oar in his hand, the outſide was azure fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with characters of gold, and roſes of the ſame metall, and in the midſt of it was a maſt, on whoſe top appeared a little Sun, ſhining ſo bright, that it was not poſſible for one to look upon it. He was ſtrangely raviſhed with this marvell, and his eies were ſo faſtned to the beauty of the veſſell, that he ſeemed immoveable; which <hi>Caſſandra</hi> conſidering, and deſiring not to looſe time, ſhe alighted, and ſaid unto him: Sir, do not you think now that the wiſe <hi>Alcander</hi> loves you well, having ſent you ſo goodly a ſhip for the execution of your enterpriſes? I never doubted of his good affection to me (ſaid he) nor of the devotion you have to the advancement of our houſe (for I am perſwaded that you have a hand in the faſhion of this work) but in truth, I muſt acknowledge that this care is none of the leaſt favours, which I may hope both from you and him, ſeeing it is a mean to open me the way of glory: let us go into it then, if it be made for us, and let us begin to ſeek our Fortune. Saying thus, he ſaw ſix ſavages open a port, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him a plank; whereupon, going in he became more aſtoniſhed then before, finding himſelf immediatly in a room, the richeſt that ever he had ſeen; he looked all about, wondering at a thouſand rarities which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held there; but that which moſt delighted him, was ſix pictures hanging together on a row; whereupon fixing his eie, in the firſt he obſerved the very ſame feature, love had powerfully graven in his heart, which ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, that kneeling down, he ſaid aloud; Beautious <hi>Armazia,</hi> now am I happy indeed, and there is nothing wanting to my felicity, but that you will be pleaſed once more to tell me that you live for my content: But alas! You do not ſpeak? From whence doth this ſilence proceed?

It is true (ſaid he, riſing up) that the exceſſe of my joy made me beleeve that this was <hi>Armazia</hi> indeed, but you are not to marvell at it; for if lovers be blinde,

how would you have me to ſee the fault which I committed, in adoring the ſhadow for the ſubſtance? Madam, I am not blameable for this action, which teſtifies the violence of my affection, and if I have any way failed, it is in that I have done it before you, unto whom, me thinks, I ſhould ow more reſpect. Your greatneſſe (anſwered ſhe) gives you far more power then you ſpeak of; for being heer but to ſerve you, there were no reaſon that my preſence ſhould bring any conſtraint to your actions, neither was it the occaſion that drew me to put you out of thoſe fancies, but what I did was onely to ſhew you theſe other pictures, and to ask your opinion of them; tell me then, I pray you, what you think of the Princeſſe which is next to <hi>Armazia?</hi> That Nature (anſwered he) never framed a more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull piece, and if my Miſtris were not in the world, no doubt, this fame which equalls her, would bear away the prize from all the beauties of the earth; and that which makes me more to wonder, is, how all the reſt may juſtly boaſt of the like advantage: What could be deſired more in the face of this third, who ſeems to carry charms in her eyes, powerfull enough for the captivity of all men? Queſtionleſſe nothing, and I hold that Knight moſt happy, which is one day to enjoy her: but come let us view this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe a little, and tell me whether ever you ſaw ever ſo much grace and majeſty under ſuch a rude and unhandſome habit? I am perſwaded that the heavens have taken exceeding pleaſure in making her ſo fair, thereby to inform us, that their treaſures are not alwayes imparted to the greateſt. How contented will the fields be whither ſhe ſhall drive her flocks, how how happy the trees under whoſe ſhadow ſhe ſhall reſt; but far more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſhall the Shepherd be, whoſe lips ſhall be preſt with ſo delicate a mouth! Without diſſembling, I envie him, and were Nature wiſe, ſhe would furniſh her with matches worthy ſuch an excellence. For the fifth, truth ſhall ſave me the labour of commending her, modeſty not permitting me to ſay that <hi>Penamond</hi> of Greece, my ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And as for the laſt, he hath not eies that will ſay, her beauty deſerves not praiſes equall to the reſt. But Madam, will not you tell me who thoſe four be which I know not? Moſt willingly, anſwered ſhe; The firſt is <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> the excellent Princeſſe of Tramazond, who hath none to be compared with her but your <hi>Armazia,</hi> and which may be ſaid to be the moſt valiant Lady that this day beareth arms, being promiſed by the Deſtinies to him, who alone may alſo be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelled to you in feats of chivalrie. The next is <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> the heir of <hi>Martaria.</hi> This Shepherdeſſe ſo beautifull, is called <hi>Miralinda,</hi> whom France brought forth, and which ſhall hereafter fill the world with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And ſhe that appears with ſo ſweet an aſpect, is the ſtately Queen <hi>Corolandaya,</hi> worthy of the place where you ſee her ranked. But, Sir, me thinks, it is time to take a little repaſt. In good faith, ſaid he, I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly content my ſelf with beholding my <hi>Armazia,</hi> but ſeeing it is your pleaſure I ſhall eat, let us do ſo; whereupon, going to a table ſet full with exquiſite meat, they ſat them down, whilſt their veſſell ſwiftly cut the waves, being carried, as it ſeemed, moreby the dexterity of the ſavages, who rowed with a wonderfull ſtrength, then by the wind that filled the ſails: after their repaſt, they fell to diſcourſe upon a world of pleaſing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which paſt away the day in ſuch ſort, that might came upon them far ſooner then they were aware of; ſo that <hi>Caſſandra</hi> withdrawing to a

Upon my ſoul (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> ſpeaking ſoftly to <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> here is one of the handſomeſt Gentlemen on the earth, his ſhape very much contents me, and me thinks I cannot chuſe but love him. No doubt you have reaſon for it (ſaid <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> for he touches you ſo neer, that you ſhould deny nature, if you had not ſome affection to him; in a word he is your kinſman, and is named <hi>Clariſel</hi> of Guindaya, ſon to the famous <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of Niquea, carried away (as you have heard) when he was in his ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling clothes, and now kept heer by the charms of an Inchantreſſe, who loves him no leſſe then <hi>Ginolda</hi> did in times paſt the valiant Prince of France; but it is high time to free him from ſo long a captivity, to the end his vertue may be manifeſt to the world; and for that regard, I cauſed the ſhip to ſtay heer, knowing that your valour was neceſſary for his deliverance. Me thinks (ſaid he) there needs no great labour to bear away a man that ſleeps, and that is without arms to defend himſelf, if he had power to do it; ſhall I carry him aboard the veſſell? No (ſaid ſhe) let us ſtay and hear what this damſell will ſay to him that is coming; it is <hi>Criſolita,</hi> ſhe that captivateth him as much by the charms of her beauty, as he is otherwiſe held by thoſe of her mother <hi>Creonda;</hi> then ſoftly retiring, and hiding themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the trees they let this Nymph paſſe, who ſeeing <hi>Clariſel</hi> aſleep, put her mouth preſently to his, and finding that this touch did not awake him, ſhe ſaid ſomewhat aloud with a ſigh.

I do not think (ſaid <hi>Clariſel)</hi> that any man can take me from hence againſt my will; wherefore do not you afflict your ſelf in this ſort, for be aſſured my love is too much for me to forſake you ſo: but I wonder that your mother, who can ſtay the Sun in his courſe, force even the devils themſelves, and do what elſe ſhe pleaſe againſt the law of nature, doth not ſhew her ſelf more carefull of our good, by impeaching the arrivall of this Knight. The Ordinances of heaven are inviolable (anſwered <hi>Criſolita)</hi> for you may be confident that ſhe hath imploied the utmoſt of her skill, and yet cannot come to know how, or by whom you are to be carried from hence; which makes me conjecture that a Magician, more cunning then her ſelf, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the care of this affair: wherefore I muſt reſolve to loſe you, and ſo I will; but firſt I deſire to obtain this promiſe from you, which wil be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite comfort to me in your abſence, that you wil alwaies love me, and return hither ſometimes unto me.

The combat continued in this manner very cruell and dangerous, each imploying his uttermoſt force, eſpecially the Knight of the Bridge; who being mad for that he ſaw no bloud on his enemies armour, and reſolved either to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh or to die; he ſet both his hands to his ſword, and ſtruck his enemy ſo rudely on the helmet, that he made him ſtoop with one knee to the earth, whereat he was ſo mightily incenſed, that riſing in fury, he diſcharged ſuch a terrible blow on the Knight of the Bridges ſhield, that having divided it in two, he made him to ſtagger, and put both his hands to the ground, whereon queſtionleſſe he had fallen, had not the ſhame of being overcome, and the apprehenſion of death cauſed him quickly to get up again.

Provided Madam (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> that you ariſe from the place where you are, I will with all my heart grant whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you can demand of me, but this humility of yours diſpleaſes me (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for ſpeaking ſo) I being of no ſuch recommendation in the world as to be complemented with ſo much ſubmiſſion. I cannot (anſwered <hi>Criſolita)</hi> yeeld you ſo much honour, but that you yet deſerve far more; howbeit, ſince you command me to carry my ſelf otherwiſe towards you, I hope I ſhall not erre in obeying you. That which I deſire of you, my Lord, (ſaid ſhe, being riſen up) is, that you will pleaſed to give <hi>Clariſel</hi> the Order, to the end that the memory of being made Knight by ſo excellent a hand, may render him worthy the renown which his father hath acquired in the world; for if he muſt go along with you, I ſhall think my ſelf happy that he may take courage from your preſence to combat bravely whenſoever fortune ſhall offer him the occaſion in your voiage. Madam (anſwered <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond)</hi> the merit of your beauty obliged me to reſpect you before, but I never eſteemed you as I do now, nor was perſwaded that it was poſſible any woman could love ſo generouſly as you have done, which makes me once more to ſay that mine unkle is happy in your affection, ſeeing you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer glory before your own ſatisfaction, and his honour before the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you might have in him; you deſire to have him Knighted, if he be ready, your pleaſure ſhall be preſently fulfilled.

All the Ceremonies being finiſhed, <hi>Criſolita</hi> obtained of <hi>Rozalmond</hi> that he would ſtay there eight daies longer, which paſt away very pleaſingly, ſometimes in the company of the valiant <hi>Silverin</hi> of the Deſert, whom <hi>Rozalmond</hi> much affected, and that was now thorowly cured of his wounds, and ſometimes with the entertainment which <hi>Caſſandra</hi> and <hi>Creonda</hi> gave him by ſome ingenious trick of their Art: But the day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture being come, <hi>Criſolita's</hi> reſolution began to faint under the grief ſhe had to ſee that her lover was to be divided from her.

Good God (ſaid he to himſelf) how defective is Nature in the dividing of her treaſures, and how little providence ſeem the heavens to have in the diſtribution of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Why ſhould a beauty ſo excellent be born with ſo much miſery, and what reaſon is there that ſhe ſhould one day ſerve for the contentment of a Shepherd, who ſhall not have the judgement to know the value of ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a jewell? Queſtionleſſe it is unjuſt, and it were unworthy in me to ſuffer it; if Nature have made a fault, I will repair it; I am born a Prince, it is in my power to raiſe a baſe condition, and to place her in the rank where ſhe ought to be: I muſt then, without any regard at all to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men, who more reſpect greatneſſe then vertue, riches then merit, and gold then contentment; make no difficulty to love her, provided her ingratitude do not render her incapable of that fortune; now if any man will condemn me for this action, my fathers example ſhall ſerve to excuſe me, who was no leſſe inamoured of <hi>Silvia,</hi> then I am now of this ſame; and without doubt he had married her, never ſticking at her poverty, if the

By heaven (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond)</hi> you are unlike to have us at ſo eaſie a rate, nor ſhall your audaciouſneſſe carry away the victory without ſome pain: ſo quickly lacing on their helmets, they oppoſed the Giants with their ſwords drawn, and charged them ſo fiercely, that it amazed them at firſt; but thinking that all the forces of the world united together could not withſtand them, they began to ſhowr ſo many blows upon them, that without the goodneſſe of their arms, which reſiſted the ſharpneſſe of their blades, they had been in very great danger, howbeit, fighting without fear, they ſent many an arm into the ſea, cut Knights in ſunder, and many times drew bloud from the Giants, who railing on the Deſtinies, and their Gods, ſtruck moſt of their blows on the ſhip ſide (being hindered by a thick ſmoak, which iſſued out of their viſers, from ſmiting where they would:) <hi>Silverin</hi> fought with a great deal of valour, <hi>Clariſel</hi> did wonders in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of his arms, and <hi>Rozalmond</hi> amazed every one; his blows were ſo many thunderbolts, and his ſword never lighted without the bloud of his enemies. Whilſt the fight was at the hotteſt, one of the Giants percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Caſſandra</hi> where ſhe ſat in the veſſell of the Sun, leaped ſuddenly in, and laying faſt hold on her, carried her into his ſhip, when one of the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges diſcharged his oar ſo ſtrongly on his head, that he ſtruck him into the ſea, whereinto <hi>Caſſandra</hi> had tumbled with him, if ſhe had not been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by <hi>Clariſel,</hi> who marking the Giants enterance into their veſſell, at the very inſtant ran his enemy clean thorow the body, who therewith fell down dead in the place: this young Knight having caught her by the gown, and placed her again in the ſhip, returned ſuddenly to the fight; exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed to behold with what grace <hi>Rozalmond</hi> imploied his ſword, and in what manner, having eleft the Giants head with whom he had to do, he beſtirred himſelf amongſt the fouldiers; following him then with the like courage, he performed ſuch wonders, that <hi>Rozalmond</hi> ſtood a while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him amongſt thoſe Knights, who fell before him as the graſſe before the mower; ſo as not being able to hold out any longer, they were quickly cut into a thouſand pieces: In the mean time <hi>Silverin,</hi> who was in fight with a Giant, ſeeing his friends glorious by the defeature of all the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo furious, that making no account of his life, he put both his hands to his ſword, and therewith ſmote his enemy ſo dangerouſly on the body, that he opened him even to the very back, tumbling him into the ſea with his companions.

former courſe, ſhe thus proceeded: I imagin that the only compaſſion of my pain, and the glory which is to be expected from a generous enterpriſe have given you the deſire to ſuccour me; but beleeve me, Sir Knight, you wilbe caried therunto with more affection when you underſtand the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The time was that I lived very contentedly, and free from the cares of the world, beleeving that fortune was not able to croſſe this my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but that powerfull divinity which alwaies triumphs over men, made me feel that our good or harm depend on his favour and frown. I walked forth one day into a wood adjoining to one of the faireſt houſes of France (whither I am now conducting you) and little thinking of love, I went ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the providence of nature, that produceth all things either for the profit or pleaſure of man, when through the trees I perceived a Knightly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the graſſe: I was about to have turned back (and would to God I had, for then you had not ſeen me at this preſent ſo ſigh and complain) but being a little too curious, and having my woman with me, I ventured to go cloſe unto him; as ſoon as I had ſeen his face which ſeemed marvellous beautifull, it was impoſſible for me (O Gods! can I ſay it without ſhame? yes, ſince my fortune will have it ſo) it was impoſſible for me, Knight, any longer to maintain my liberty, but even then I received the hurt which time hath made incurable. I had taken exceeding delight in beholding of him, if ſome tears that trickled down his cheeks had not troubled me, but there by apprehending the miſery which now I am in, I found pain in this pleaſure; howbeit having more love then feare, and fooliſhly imagining that I had beauty ſufficient to alter him, in caſe he were in paſſion for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I went to awake him with a kiſſe, when I perceived him to open his lips, and complain in this maner: O Gods! muſt our love yeeld to the fury of a barbarous mother, and ſhall our deſires depend upon her avarice? Fair <hi>Clitia,</hi> I cannot beleeve but that the memory of our delights are dearer to you then her commandements, and that you prefer your vowes before her menaces. But your ſilence doth much amaze me, and I am not able to ſay whether I am to fear a change in you, or ſome miſchance in your perſon. Mighty Love, divert both the one and the other of theſe accidents, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not humanity to be of more power then thy ſelfe. Theſe complaints infinitely diſpleaſed me, and I would fain have retired, if my new paſſion would have permitted me; but being no longer Miſtris of my will, I came inconſiderately to mine owne ruine, nevertheleſſe knowing that modeſty is a powerfull charm to win mens affections, I would not ſeem impudent, but withdrew my ſelf under ſome trees faſt by, and began to ſing, hoping that he would repair to the voice as he did; for not giving me ſo much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to ſing out fowr verſes, he aroſe, and creeping from oak to oak he came very neer unto me. I marked him well, but making as though I did not, I continued my ſong, at the end whereof he ſhewed himſelf, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me with an excellent grace, demanded of me whether I would accept of his company. Another would have been affraid at the ſudden approach of a man unknown, but not deſiring to make uſe of any ſuch cunning, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with a ſmile (which might very well have teſtified my thoghts) that it were ſimplicity to refuſe a Knight of ſo fair a preſence as his. To what end ſhould I relate the diſcourſe we had then, and how I applied all my allurements and charms for to render our diſeaſe common? Without doubt it would but adde unto my miſery; wherefore I will only let you

know, that taking occaſion to diſcover unto him what I thought of certain ſighs he had fetched, I told him that his good parts had poſſeſt me with a great deſire to love him, and that I intreated him to conſider what good he had gotten without any labour at all. My ſpeech ending with a mighty bluſh, he looked upon me, and anſwering me with a ſigh. Alas! Madam, ſaid he unto me, what a world of cauſe have I now to complain of my ill fortune, which having ingaged my affection in another place, will not ſuffer me to receive the favours you would confer upon me. Theſe eies wherein you yet ſee tears do witnes but too well, that my heart is not at quiet, and that a woman poſſeſſeth it: be pleaſed then not to accuſe me, if I doe not diſpoſe of it according to your deſire, ſeeing I have not the power ſo to do; but if in any other thing you can think me fit for your ſervice, Madam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I will recompence the honour of your love, with my bloud, and will gladly die to aſſure you that I am much obliged by your favour. Imagine, I pray you, whether I took any pleaſure in this anſwer, whereby the death of all my hopes was concluded. No queſtionles, for I was almoſt ready to ſwound with grief at it, but my anger preſerved my judgement, for to complain of him, and I began to tearm him cruell, when I ſaw a woman appear, who knowing him alighted at that very inſtant, and preſenting him a letter ſaid, that <hi>Clitia,</hi> (ſo was my rivall called) remembred her ſervice unto him. At theſe words I perceived him grow pale, and his legs became ſo feeble, that he had fallen down had not that woman upheld him. I was almoſt as ſenſible of his indiſpoſition as himſelf, but deſiring to make uſe of the opportunity it gave me, I took the letter out of his hand, and knew by the contents thereof, that <hi>Clitia</hi> being ready to be delivered of a child, derived from their ſtollen pleaſures, deſired him to return in all haſte both for to legitimate the birth of it, as alſo by that way to deſerve the favour which her mother had alwaies denied them, proteſting in caſe he were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiall, not to ſurvive her delivery, but to poiſon her ſelf. I was violently in love with him, I muſt confeſſe, but when I conſidered the reaſon that he had to affect this woman, who upon his faith had made no difficulty to give him that, which ought of all things to be moſt dear unto us, I ſet by mine own intereſt, and ſhewing more pity then love, I counſelled him to depart inſtantly away, ſince it ſo much concerned his Miſtris life and honor. This is to love nobly, ſaid he being come to himſelf again, but Madam, my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune will not ſuffer me to expedite my journey, my horſe being ſlain in a combat which I had yeſterday juſt without this wood. That ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, replied I, for I that would give you my ſelf, cannot refuſe you an horſe. Then bringing him to my ſtable, I beſtowed one of the beſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Kingdome on him, and ſo letting him go, I returned to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for to complain of my deſtiny, that had made me to love a man, who had not the power to recompence my affection, and for to ſeek out reaſons to divert me from theſe fancies, in the continuance whereof I ſaw my aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ruine, but to ſpeak truth I could not reſolve ſo much as to ſay that I would never love him: proceeding then in my former paſſion, I preſently diſpatched away a Squire, and charged him expreſly to enquire what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Alcidas</hi> (ſo is that worthy Knight named) which he performed with ſo much care, that about ſix daies after he reported unto me the death of <hi>Clitia,</hi> who had poiſoned her ſelf, thinking that the retardment of her lover was a ſign of his diſloialty; and further, which much perplexed me,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17218:105"/>
he delivered that the mother of this Lady had cauſed <hi>Alcidas</hi> to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended (as he was ſhedding an ocean of tears on his Miſtriſſes tombe) and impriſoning him, had condemned him ſhamefully to loſe his head, if within three moneths he did not finde a Knight that would combat <hi>Farna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazan,</hi> a terrible and mighty Giant, who came not long ſince to inhabit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this womans lands, no man knowing wherefore. If the death of <hi>Clitia</hi> was pleaſing to me, becauſe it opened a door to my hopes, you may as well beleeve that the captivity of <hi>Alcidas</hi> afflicted me; howbeit, loving him too much onely to beſtow tears on him, I put my ſelf to ſea two daies after, with a purpoſe to go unto Conſtantinople, to demand the aſſiſtance of ſome one of thoſe brave Princes, which ſeek the like occaſions of glory; but I am ſufficiently ſatisfied for all my travell, having incountred you in the ſtrangeſt manner that ever was, and applauding my good fortune, I will hope that ere long you will reſtore me to the ſupremeſt degree of my felicity, ſeeing juſtice accompanies your arms. Madam, aſſure your ſelf (anſwered <hi>Clariſel)</hi> that I will gladly fight for his preſervation, and your contentment; but if you would oblige me, make truce with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and reſtrain theſe tears a little, that ſo our voiage may ſeem the leſſe tedious. It is fit (ſaid ſhe) that having found a remedy for my grief, I ſhould ſhew a merrier countenance; I will no longer complain then, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to make the time, if I can more pleaſing unto you. Whileſt they diſcourſed in this manner, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> and the Knight of the Deſert, being riſen with the Sun, marvelled very much that they could not ſee <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and purpoſed to go and wake him, thinking that he was yet in his bed; but <hi>Caſſandra</hi> arriving thereupon, told them, that he had imbarked himſelf with a ſtrange Gentlewoman, for to aſſiſt her in an important affair; whereat doubtleſſe <hi>Rozalmond</hi> had been diſcontented, but that he conſidered, it was not without great cauſe he was carried away by ſo extraordinary an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo tha ſhewing himſelf not much ſenſible of it, he fell into talk with <hi>Caſſandra</hi> and <hi>Silverin</hi> till it was dinner time, which was no ſooner done, but they landed hard by Conſtantinople with no ſmall content.</p>

therefore intreat you, as an addition to your other favours, to go and buy me ſome others where you think they may be had, otherwiſe I am reſolved to ſeek my fortune elſewhere, becauſe I will not be conſtrained by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and intreaties of my friends, to make any longer abode here. I knew very well (anſwered ſhe) that you would requeſt this of me, which made me to take order for it aforehand; and I marvell how all the while that you were aboard, you never obſerved an armour which the wiſe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander</hi> hath provided for you: whereupon, returning with him into the ſhip, ſhe ſhewed him certain arms hanging on a pin, the faireſt and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt that ever he had ſeen; they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>zure, all covered over with white roſes, raiſed up with ſmall ſtrings of gold, whoſe ends made an A. and an R. ſo neatly interlaced, that he ſtood a good while admiring the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of them; imagining, and that rightly, that thoſe were the firſt letters of his fair <hi>Armazia's</hi> and his own names; but having an extream deſire to ſee them on, he doft thoſe which firſt belonged to <hi>Meridian,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Knight of the Sun, and immediatly put on them, greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to finde them ſo exceeding light, and fit for him, as if he had but a dublet on. I ſhould never hazard my ſelf in any combat with theſe arms (ſaid he to <hi>Caſſandra)</hi> if any other ſaving your ſelf had given them to me; but wholly relying upon your judgement, I will make no ſcruple to uſe them, and will beleeve that the temper will ſupply the defect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Your ſafety (ſaid ſhe) is dearer to me then that I ſhould be any way careleſſe of it, and if theſe arms be light, it is to accommodate you the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in fight, you ſhall know the goodneſſe of them ere it be long; in the mean while, you muſt remember that a valiant man is to apply himſelf to the time, not to yeeld to any labour, and to take all things in good part: I ſpeak this to you, becauſe we are to part one from another immediatly, for I am to beſtow my ſelf in an affair that tends very much to the good of your houſe; but before I go, I will adviſe you by no means to be afflicted for your abſence from the beautiful <hi>Armazia,</hi> time and your loialty wil give you thoſe felicities which is expected by a vertuous love. At theſe words <hi>Rozalmond</hi> found himſelf cloſe by <hi>Silverin,</hi> who attended him on the ſhore, very much marvelling that he could neither ſee the ſhip of the Sun, nor any body living, but two dwarfs, that held a couple of brave ſtrong hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, upon which <hi>Silverin</hi> and he preſently mounted, taking the firſt way they met withall, which brought them in leſſe then an hour into a goodly forreſt, where on the fudden they met with a Damſell and two Knights; one of them carried a Savage on his ſhield, and the other a Moore in chains; whereby you may eaſily gueſſe them to be the renowned Knight of the Savage, and <hi>Don Griolanis,</hi> called the fair Knight, who came from the juſts at Conſtantinople, as you heard in the laſt Chapter of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Book, and had by chance incountered a Damſell, unto whom <hi>Griola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> ſpake thus: It grieves me not a little that I cannot ſatisfie your deſire, but Gentlewoman you muſt blame your ſelf for it, who require a thing which is not in my power. Your excuſes are to no purpoſe (anſwered ſhe) and all the reaſons of the world ſhall not releaſe you from your promiſes: follow me then to perform my pleaſure, otherwiſe I will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of your life, and will requeſt your head of theſe Knights that are coming heer.

them, I ſhould ſoon be delivered from a great importunity. You are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle raſh (ſaid the good Knight of the Roſes, ſo we will call <hi>Rozalmond</hi> heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) for it ſeems that after you have failed in your promiſe to this Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, you will alſo defie us upon that quarrell, I do not willingly undertake a combat without knowing whether it be juſt or no, but if this Gentlewoman intreats me, you ſhall ſee it had been better for you to have uſed gentler language, for you ſhall either die for it, or ſatisfie her in what ſhe deſires of you. Who are you (ſaid <hi>Grian</hi> the Savage then in ſcornfull manner?) Who are you that kills men ſo faſt? I am (anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> netled with this diſdainfull ſpeech of his:) I am a Knight can do more then I ſay. That will I know by experience, ſaid <hi>Grian:</hi> when as turning their horſes about, they encountered one another ſo bravely, that each of them thought he had run againſt a rock, finding themſelves both with great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement on the ground: for <hi>Rozalmond</hi> and <hi>Grian,</hi> not being uſed to ſuch falls, could hardly be perſwaded they were unhorſed; howbeit, ſeeing themſelves lie all along, they inſtantly aroſe, and carried with an unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed fury, they diſcharged two ſuch blows with their ſwords each on the other, that both of them b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nded their knees, even ready to tumble down, had they not been ſupported by ſhame; but preſently recovering themſelves, they began to aſſail one another ſo fiercely, that either of them wondered at his enemies force; their blades being alwayes in continuall motion, and guided ſtill by a like rage: This while <hi>Silverin</hi> and <hi>Griolanis</hi> combatted with no leſſe courage and addreſſe, ſometimes one made two or three ſteps back, ſometime the other was aſtonied, their armour was all over hacked, and if the bloud ran down on one of their arms, the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently beheld his on the ground. Having thus continued fighting three hours together, and no advantage perceived on either ſide, when the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, who had ſo ingaged them, ſeeing four very gallant Knights arrive, ran ſuddenly unto them, and bedewing her cheeks with tears, beſought them to grant her one thing ſhe would requeſt of them. We will not deny you (ſaid one of them, who ſpake for the reſt) provided your requeſt be juſt, and that it be in our power. I ſhould be unworthy of your favour (anſwered ſhe) if I ſhould require an impoſſibility of you; my deſire then is, that you will tell me your names, and that you will ſpeedily part theſe Knights, who outrage one another, as you ſee, for my occaſion. You would have made us beholding unto you (ſaid the Knight) if you had not deſired our names, but not to fail in our promiſe, know that this great Knight is <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> Soveraigne of the Empire of Aethiopia; the ſecond is <hi>Perſides,</hi> ſon to the excellent Emperour of Perſia, <hi>Don Rogel;</hi> the third is the valiant <hi>Lucibel,</hi> Prince of France; and for my ſelf, I am called <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> of Media: touching the quarrell of theſe Knights, we will labour to pacifie it, or die in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Whereupon, advancing towards them, who were ſtill in fight, they wondered to ſee with what fury and addreſſe they managed their combat, and eſpecially with what grace he of the Roſes beſtowed his blows, which ſeemed far more terrible then thoſe of <hi>Grian,</hi> who had gotten him ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Conſtantinople, and gently declaring unto them, that ſhe that was the cauſe of their difference deſired their attonement, they intreated them to become friends, and to part with equall reputation. I am content (ſaid <hi>Griolanis)</hi> ſo as this woman will quit me of the boon which ſhe hath cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly obtained from me. How, anſwered the damſell, would not my

love ſuffer me to ſee you in danger, have I ſought the means to draw you out of it, and are you ſo ingratefull not to acknowledge ſuch favor?

Being parted then the one from the other, howbeit reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the next morning for to ſee unto whom fortune would give the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the fowr firſt combatants went to lie down together under certain trees, when they ſaw a Giant paſſe along by them, who carrying a torch in the one hand, held a very fair damſell by the other, that wept bitterly, crying out for help unto the Gods, and it ſeemed to <hi>Rozalmond</hi> that it was his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Armazia,</hi> which put him into ſuch a rage, that inſtantly he got him to horſe again, galloping after the Giant, whom he had threatned with a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of deaths, if he had been able to ſuffer ſo many, but the buſines being carried by enchantment, and by the ſole wiſdome of <hi>Alcander,</hi> who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this maner to divert the miſchief which might have enſued if theſe

This equipage having made him turn aſide the better to obſerve it, begot ſuch an earneſt deſire in him to know what was in the litter, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching it and addreſſing himſelf unto him, who appeared to be of ſo good a preſence, he ſaid unto him: Knight, be pleaſed to tell me what it is you conduct in this Litter. It is that which you may not know (anſwered he in an arrogant maner) unles firſt you vanquiſh me, and afterward theſe ſeven Knights together, &amp; that alſo you grant a boon to this damſell. Now think whether your forces are capable of ſo great a charge, or whether you have ſufficient courage to undertake it; if not, depart, for all the praiers in the world ſhall get you no other ſatisfaction. You are ſo diſcurteous (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Don Griolanis)</hi> that if I had not a deſire to undertake this adventure, your arrogance would make me fight with you, therefore I will know by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xperience what is in you, and look into this Litter ſpite of your teeth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon placing themſelves in the middle of the way juſt one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they charged their lances and incountered ſo ſtrongly that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger flew to the ground; <hi>Griolanis</hi> having loſt both his ſtirrups, was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the violence of the ſhock, that his courſe was finiſhed before he could come to himſelf; howbeit conſidering that it was no time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, he quickly recovered his ſpirits, alighted from his horſe, drew his ſword, and ſeeing his enemy that was riſen, come towards him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream deſire to revenge his diſgrace, he met him, and withall gave him two
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17218:107"/>
ſuch terrible blows, that he was compelled to knock his chin againſt his breaſt, which ſo incenſed him that claſping his ſword faſt in his hand he ſmote him ſo furiouſly that he ſmote his ſhield in two. <hi>Griolanis</hi> ſtroaks were dreadfull, no leſſe impetuous were thoſe of the Knight of the Litter; if the one ſtruck, the other gave a thruſt, they cunningly avoided blows, their dexterity was admirable, their force extream, their rage ſo great that to ſee them hew one another in that maner, nothing els could be expected thence but death: two howrs being ſpent ſince the beginning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, <hi>Griolanis</hi> enraged with this protraction, redoubled his blows moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and perceiving his enemy grow weary, he gave him ſuch a cruell cut three fingers deep on the ſhoulder, that he ſtaggered with it, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to come to himſelf again, he ſtruck him with ſuch a mighty force upon the head, that he laid him ſtark dead in the place. Behold, ſaid he, the reward of pride, and the puniſhment which attends the unadviſed: it may be lawfull for me now, I hope, to ſee what I have ſo much deſired. Our deaths, anſwered one of the Knights, muſt firſt accompany our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor. Truly, ſaid <hi>Griolanis,</hi> it is much againſt my will if I ſight at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſince you conſtrain me, you ſhall ſuffer for it. Saying ſo, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leapt into his ſaddle, and taking a lance from his Squire, he ran againſt the ſeven Knights, who incountred him furiouſly all at once, and brake all their ſpears upon him without moving him any more then if they had reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted againſt ſome rock; but it fell out otherwiſe with him, at whom he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lance, for he was run quite through and through, and overthrown dead to the earth. Having ended his courſe he returned with his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and ſeeing himſelf invironed by ſix men, who ſeemed to be fearles of death, he began to lay about him; now he foind at one, then he cut another on the head, heer fell a leg, there flew off an arm, and briefly he quartered them with ſuch fury, that in leſſe then half an howr three of them were laid dead on the ground; the reſt notwithſtanding grew more obſtinate, and drawing ſtrength from their grief for the loſſe of their friends, they ſeemed to fight with the more rage and fury, but being in the hands of one of the prime Knights of the world, all that they could do was to no purpoſe; for they were ſoon cut in pieces, and there remained none but the damſell, who being much amazed at the incomparable valour of this Knight, beheld him with wonder. Gentlewoman, ſaid he approaching to her, may I now be permitted to ſee that which I have ſo deerly bought with the death of theſe diſcurteous Knights? Yes Sir, anſwered ſhe, ſo as you promiſe me one boon. Moſt willingly, ſaid <hi>Griolanis,</hi> for I was born for the ſervice of Ladies. You may approach then when you pleaſe, ſaid ſhe. <hi>Griolanis</hi> having lift up the covering beheld in the bottom of the Litter the pourtrait of a Queen ſo marvellous fair, that he was almoſt beſide himſelf conſidering her with ſo much perfection. Good God, cried he, what a world of beauties are heer aſſembled together? and how happy is the Knight that can hope for the poſſeſſion of ſo invaluable a treaſure? Gentlewoman, be pleaſed I pray you, to let me underſtand the name of this excellent Princeſſe, and why you cary her picture about in this faſhion. It is fit, ſaid ſhe, that I give you this ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſeeing you have nobly promiſed to grant me what I ſhall deſire of you: You ſee the face and features, but not all the beauties and graces of the mighty Queen of Corolandaya; for her actions are ſo winning, that they render her accompliſhments far greater and more commendable: As
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17218:108"/>
for that which concerns our voiage, I will deliver you the cauſe of it. The Kingdome of this Princeſſe conſiſting of one of the moſt ſpacious and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Iſlands in the world, accommodated with ſafe harbors, ſtrong places, valiant warriors, and exceeding lovely dames, gave her a number of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Knights for ſervants, ſome carried by the conſideration of this crown, and others to injoy a thing ſo rare, whereupon depended the former. The fame of the beauties and graces of this Queen every day bringing one Knight or other to preſent his ſervice unto her, it hapned that at one time there were two and thirty which caried with a like deſire to ſhew their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor before her, made a turnament, where, in few words, jealouſie incenſing their fury, they hewed one another ſo cruelly, that notwithſtanding all the praiers of <hi>Adelazia</hi> (ſo is my Miſtris named) who wept and took on piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, there was but one remained alive, all the reſt having paſt by the edge of the ſword: the Queen was ſo ſenſible of this maſſacre, that ſhe ſwore never to admit of any man more, and to that end ſhe cauſed thirty ſoldiers to be placed at each port of her Kingdome, with expreſſe commandement not to ſuffer any Knight whatſoever to land; and conceiving that one vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant perſon might vanquiſh them, ſhe made a law whereby ſhe ordayned, that not any one of thoſe which ſhould be ſo fortunate as to paſſe in deſpite of her guards, ſhould ſee her before they had ſubmitted unto one comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of three, the choice whereof ſhe left unto them (aſſuring her ſelfe that the leaſt of the three was impoſſible for any man whatſoever to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form) or that they had overcome an hundred armed men, which ſhould be alwaies ready waiting at the gates of the town where ſhe pleaſed to make her reſidence. Since that time many have preſented themſelves at the port, ſome of purpoſe, others driven in by fowl weather, but being vanquiſhed by the guards, they retired with diſgrace; only this miſerable man whom you have ſlain, the Prince of Argilles named <hi>Silvion,</hi> ſubdued the thirty Knights, and entred into the Iſland, where the Queen cauſing three moſt difficile things to be propounded unto him, namely, either to give her the ſcepter of Greece by the death of all the Princes which poſſeſſe it, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her with the goodlieſt Knight, &amp; the moſt exquiſit beauty of the earth, or conduct her portrait through all the Provinces of the Orient, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that you have ſeen, maintain in all the Courts of Kings, that ſhe was the faireſt Lady in the World, and at the end of ſix yeers return unconquered, which done ſhe promiſed he ſhould ſee her, and that with her ſelf ſhe would give him the Crown of Corolandaya. This infortunate Prince finding an extream favor in this laſt commandement, moſt willingly undertook that charge (albeit that the term of ſix yeers was grievous unto him) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired that ſhe would be pleaſed to appoint ſome one to accompany him who might be judge of his actions, and give her account therof; which ſhe granted, ſending me along with him, and expreſly commanding me to write all the names of ſuch as ſhould be vanquiſhed upon this quarrell, and preſent her with a liſt of all the Princeſſes for whoſe ſervice they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the combat: the which accordingly I have performed, having already the names of threeſcore and twelve daughters to Sovereign Potentates, and of two hundred Knights bravely fought withall and overcome, but the end of my commiſſion arriving by the death of this Knight, I am conſtrained inſtantly to return, and carry back this Litter to Corolandaya, whither you ſhall accompany me if you pleaſe, ſuffering no man to ſee the portrait of my

I beheld even now in the combat of this Knight all the valor that may be wiſhed for in a man; now I ſee all the charms and all the graces that can be deſired in the ſweeteſt face of the World. Ah Sir! if the Prince of Argilles had beheld you without an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and that he could have prevailed more by his praiers, then he hath done by his ſword, doubtleſſe he had ſhewed my Miſtris that which ſhe moſt deſires, &amp; placing you by her, he had aſſembled the goodlieſt Knight, and the beautifulleſt Lady in the earth; but it much rejoices me that ſhe ſhall not be deprived of this contentment, ſeeing I am conducting you unto her. <hi>Griolanis</hi> laughing at this ſpeech, began to entertain her with other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and ſo ſweetly paſſing away the time, they arrived at the Sea ſide, where they imbarqued themſelves, ſailing towards the Iſland of Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landaya, whither we will leave them going, for to overtake <hi>Grian</hi> the Savage.</p>

                     <p>I will not deliver the ſorrow which this cruell anſwer brought me, you will imagine it well enough, but it wrought ſo powerfully upon me, that I was delivered of a ſon, which born before his time, died the ſame day, redoubling my grief and lamentation, (for I hoped he might one day ſerve to make this wretch acknowledge his fault) who underſtanding this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp; thinking that I would never let him be quiet, departed one morning from his fathers, and went to ſeek adventures, as Knights errant uſe to do; which coming to my knowledge, I reſolved to leave the world, not able to endure the menaces and hatred of my parents, who never looking upon me, but with an eie of contempt and ſcorn, made me wiſh for death a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times a day: wherefore taking all the money I could make, I got out one night, and in two daies travelled ſo far, that I arrived at this houſe, where, finding it empty, I ſtaied; and becauſe I would not be known, I

And thus, good Sir, have you had the ſad, but true ſtory of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which me thinks, deſerves as much pity, as I have miſery. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, anſwered <hi>Grian, Zelandions</hi> treacherie is greater then your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for ordinarily we have not conſiderations ſtrong enough to keep us from erring when we love, wherefore I proteſt unto you, that if I can meet and know him, either to be the death of him, or he ſhall make good his promiſe to you of marriage; live then with his hope, and ſuffer me to take a little reſt, for this is the third night that I have not ſo much as cloſed an eie. Then <hi>Arliana</hi> bidding him good night, withdrew into another cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with her companion, and left <hi>Grian</hi> to ſleep till the next day, when he took the firſt way that preſented it ſelf after he had courteouſly taken leave of his diſguiſed hoſteſſes. His horſe carrying him according to chance, rather then by his own direction, he travelled till noon, when he diſcovered a ſtately Caſtle, unto the which addreſſing himſelf, he incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a damſell making moſt pitifull moan. Gentlewoman, ſaid he unto her, this great ſorrow of yours argues ſome extraordinary affliction, but if your relief may lie in the power of a Knight, let me quickly know what troubles you, and be aſſured of preſent ſuccour. Alas, ſaid ſhe, I will not relate the occaſion of my laments, becauſe I will not ſtay you to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; enter into this unluckie houſe, and preſerve one from death, who it may be will render you the like another time.

beauty of his face, which being at that inſtant overſpread with golden hair, made him think that he held not a Knight, but a woman fair, beyond all excellencie; he called the damſell at whoſe requeſt he entered, and was about to ask her for ſome water to fetch her again, but ſeeing her open her eies, he took her under the arm, and holding her up a little, he ſaid unto her; Madam, take courage, your enemies are not in caſe now to offend you. Where are they, ſaid ſhe, riſing with fury, where are theſe wicked wretches, that would upon ſuch extream odds have taken away my life? Madam, anſwered <hi>Grian,</hi> I have uſed them as you ſee, with more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then can be imagined, in that I have diverted the deſtruction which they meant you. What powerfull obligations are theſe, ſaid ſhe, with a gentler countenance? and queſtionleſſe you are a moſt valiant Knight, that could prevail over three ſuch monſters as theſe. I have done nothing, anſwered he, but what I would moſt deſirouſly recommence for your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to deſerve the honour of your commandments; wherefore if you be any whit ſenſible of ſo little, Madam, furniſh me with means to do more, and favour me ſo much, as now to name me your Knight, you ſhall I hope no more recent that choice, then I ſhall complain of my captivity; in the mean time let us look, whether there be any thing elſe for us to do heer. It is very well adviſed, ſaid ſhe, lacing on her helmet, let us go then, as for your requeſt, time ſhall reſolve me; ſo mounting up a pair oſ ſtairs, they viſited all the chambers, and finding no body, but onely one woman with a bunch of keyes, they made her immediatly deſcend into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, from whence ſhe brought up one and thirty Knights, whereof one ſeeming to <hi>Grian</hi> of a better preſence then the reſt, made him deſirous to know him. Gentleman, ſaid he unto him, I pray you tell me your name, and how you fell into the hands of theſe Giants. I ſhould be very ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, anſwered he, if I ſhould refuſe you ſo ſmall a matter, receiving ſo much good from you; I am called <hi>Zelandion.</hi> How (ſaid <hi>Grian,</hi> laying hold of him at that word) are you then that diſloial man, which betraied the affections of <hi>Arliana,</hi> after you had had your pleaſure of her? By my beſt hopes, if you were armed, as you are not, you ſhould either die, or confeſſe that you have dealt lewdly. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Zelandion,</hi> very much troubled with this menace, it is not likely I ſhould offer to fight with him that ſaves my life, if I were in caſe ſo to do; it is true, that the bad counſell of ſome pernicious perſons, drew me to abuſe the love of <hi>Arliana,</hi> but chaſtiſed by a long captivity, I fully purpoſe quickly to repair that fault if I may finde her alive. Your repentance, ſaid <hi>Grian,</hi> perſwades me to pardon your weakneſſe; but do not think to deceive heaven once more, for if you do not keep your word which you have given me now, be aſſured that I will not ſtick to ride a thouſand miles to inflict a juſt puniſhment upon you: And to let you know that I have a ſpeciall care of this buſineſſe, go inſtantly and take the beſt horſe you can finde heer, following my Squire into a deſert place, whether deſpair hath reduced <hi>Arliana,</hi> and marry her, whereby you ſhall give me occaſion to ſerve you. Now heer is, ſaid he, the happieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that ever I could have received: My Lord, you ſhall be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying ſo, he cauſed a horſe to be ſadled, got up, and following <hi>Grians</hi> Squire, arrived in four hours at his Miſtreſſes hermitage, whom he married after a world of proteſtations to love her eternally.</p>

This brave Prince ſeeing himſelf a ſhore, after a tedious voiage at ſea, and knowing that the term prefixed for the ſafety of this Knight approached, he uſed very great expedition, declining all occaſions that might divert him from the execution of his enterpriſe. Having travelled then eight daies with his guide, who was named <hi>Orixenna,</hi> at length he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the town where <hi>Alcidas</hi> was priſoner: but <hi>Orixenna</hi> exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to behold all the people aſſembled in the market place, waxed pale, and ſo weak, that if <hi>Clariſel</hi> had not held her, without doubt ſhe had fallen from her horſe. What ails you, ſaid he, and what can trouble you now when you have ſuch cauſe to rejoice? Alas! ſaid ſhe with a ſigh, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this people gives me occaſion to fear that <hi>Alcidas</hi> is not alive.

Madam, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> do you know this priſoner? Yes, ſaid ſhe exceedingly troubled, it is <hi>Alcidas;</hi> wherefore good Knight, be pleaſed to remember your promiſe. At theſe

I am ſatisfied, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and therefore all that I require now is, that I may encounter your enemy; with that he paſſed on to the place where proud <hi>Farnabazan</hi> was walking, with the opinion that no man durſt affront him; but ſeeing this Knight appear ſo bravely diſpoſed, and of ſo gallant a preſence, he ſaid unto him: Comeſt thou, unadviſed Knight, to defend <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas?</hi> I do, anſwered <hi>Clariſel;</hi> and I am heer to make thee die like a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, replied the Giant, wherefore let us not ſpend the time any longer idly.

Madam, ſaid he unto her, my happineſſe would be compleat, if you will be pleaſed now to paſſe by the little ſatisfaction I gave you, when you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me ſo much, as to ſay that you loved me; then I was a captive, now I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If I had more regarded your vertue then mine own paſſion, anſwered <hi>Orizenna,</hi> without doubt my ſpight had been added to the malice of your enemies, and I had not laboured ſo much to finde you an aſſured ſuccour; but not able to blame your fidelity, I deſired you ſhould know that I was not offended with your refuſall, ſince you had not the power to give your ſelf twice: As for your reſentment of the good offices I have done you, I approve of it, and ſhall be very well ſatisfied, to ſee you ſigh for me with the ſame ſincerity as you have heretofore done for <hi>Clitia;</hi> but now is no time to ſpeak of this matter, let us go to my houſe, and ſeek to reſtore you a little, after the enduring of ſo much incommoditie as impriſonment brings along with it, and then we will conſider of the reſt. This amorous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being very pleaſing to <hi>Clariſel</hi> (whoſe valour <hi>Alcidas</hi> commended to the skies) they all left the town, and for that <hi>Orizenna's</hi> houſe was but four leagues from thence, they got thither by that time it was night, which was no ſooner paſt, but <hi>Alcidas,</hi> who could not endure the violence of his new deſires, fell upon the point of his marriage with <hi>Orizenna,</hi> which was celebrated the third day after, with a world of magnificence, and brave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; howbeit, that which moſt contented <hi>Clariſel,</hi> was to behold ſix ſtrong luſty ſhepherds enter into the hall, whereof one advancing before the reſt, deſired he might be admitted to maintain at wreſtling, that <hi>Miralin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was the faireſt maid in the world. I know very well; replied <hi>Alcidas,</hi> that this Shepherdeſſe is incomparably fair, but my friend you are too weak to undergo ſuch a buſineſſe; nevertheleſſe, I will not hinder you from ſhewing your ſtrength heer, and to witneſſe that I am pleaſed with your deſigne, I promiſe a ſcarf to the victor. At thoſe words of Shepherdeſſe, and <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, Clariſel,</hi> who was then in talk with <hi>Orizenna,</hi> changed colour three or four times, which very much troubled her at firſt, and going to prevent what ſhe feared, <hi>Clariſel,</hi> that ſuſpected her meaning, took her by the hand, and leading her to a window, ſaid thus: Madam, I make no queſtion but you have diſcerned ſome alteration in me, and that the goodneſſe of your diſpoſition hath made you partaker of my ſuffering; but the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, is other then you imagine, and if I fail now of your aſſiſtance, there is no hope of remedy for me, but in death; I aſſure my ſelf you marvell at this language, and that you will demand an explication of it from me; but if you had not known what it is to love, you may think I would never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with my thoughts, for fear you ſhould laugh at me. In a word, I am in love, and the perfections of this Shepherdeſſe, for whoſe ſake theſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17218:112"/>
men diſpoſe themſelves to wraſtle, have ever ſince I ſaw her picture, which was about ſome three weeks ago given me ſo much paſſion, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to hear her ſpoken of but that I am troubled becauſe I cannot come to the ſight of her: it may be you will condemn this affection of mine, and ſay with the moſt part of perſons, that I am but poorly ſpirited not to conſider her birth and my condition, howbeit I will reply that it is the fault of fortune, which doth not impart her favours as ſhe ought, and that finding in her all that may be deſired in the rareſt Princeſſe of the earth, ſhe is alike to be regarded. Howſoever it is no queſtion with me whether I do well or ill, but I freely communicate my heart to you, to the end you may aſſiſt me with your counſell, acquaint me with her abode, give me a ſafe retreat in your houſe, and ſo recompence that which you think is due to my deſert. In good faith, ſaid ſhe laughing, I will confeſſe my weaknes to you; when I ſaw you change colour, I beleeved you had not been well, but altering this opinion upon the beginning of your diſcourſe, I lightly imagined that you had been in love with me, and was bethinking my ſelf whether I ſhould yeeld more to your merit, then to the faith I ow to my <hi>Alcidas,</hi> but now being freed from this care, it is eaſie for me to tell you that you love with reaſon; for the beauty of this ſhepherdeſſe may excuſe the affection of any Knight whatſoever; ſhe dwels not above three leagues hence, and lives with ſuch contempt of the ſhepherds that adore her, as ſhe ſeems to be born to triumph over all and love none. Now if you will follow my counſell heerein, you ſhall not preſent your ſelf before her in the eſtate you are; your habit would beget ſuſpition, and your preſence miſtruſt, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating your ſelf to her life, take upon you as ſhe doth the care of ſome flocks, that ſo you may have the more occaſion to ſee her, and leſſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your content. Truly, ſaid he, I hold this to be the beſt courſe I can take; but Madam, it were fit me thinks that ſhe ſhould once ſee me firſt as a Knight, to the end that beholding me change my condition for her ſake, ſhe might be the more obliged to love me. That will not be amiſſe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, and if you can find the opportunity to meet with her alone when you go in that faſhion, your deſign no doubt will ſpeed the better; but we will think of that at more leaſure, in the mean time let us take our part, if you pleaſe, of this wraſtling ſport. Then turning about to the ſhepherds, whereof two were a wraſtling together, they tooke marvellous delight to ſee what falls they gave one another, tumbling together on the graſſe, and afterwards diſpute with their fiſts who ſhould be the victor. This paſtime having laſted two howrs, the night according to theſe Lovers wiſhes arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which gave every one occaſion to betake them to their reſt.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE night too ſhort unto theſe Lovers was very tedious to <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> who troubled with an amorous impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſlept not, and would have departed before day to have given ſome quiet to his mind by the ſight of his fair ſhepherdeſſe, but fearing to go without a guide left he ſhould miſſe his way, he ſtaied till <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> (whom <hi>Orizenna</hi> had acquainted with his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) came to bid him good morrow. The content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ſhewed in his countenance made <hi>Clariſel</hi> ſigh, and ſay unto him: O God! how happy were I if I could boaſt the careſſes of <hi>Miralinda</hi> as you do in your thoughts the kiſſes of your <hi>Orizenna.</hi> Your love doth make you hope for the like ſucceſſe, anſwered <hi>Alcidas,</hi> and time will give it you, let us make uſe of it then, and beginning to trie our fortune let us ſee whether you ſhalbe as happy a lover, as you are a valiant Knight. Heerwith they got to horſe, and rode ſtraight to Bellombre where <hi>Miralinda</hi> lived; <hi>Alcidas</hi> endevored to make the way ſeem ſhort unto him with a deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſcourſe, but it gave him no guſt at all, his mind was ſo taken up with expectation of the content which he was to have ere long in beholding the beauties of his Miſtris: two howrsbeing ſpent in this maner, they paſt out of the wood, &amp; began to diſcover one of the delicateſt places of the world: On the one ſide a champion full of corn, on the other a dainty riſing hill planted with fruit trees, below a river, which gently winding watered two meadows wherwithall his banks were bounded, upon the decline of the hill a number of houſes appeared, which made a pretty village, and at one ſide a little wood of firre trees reaching almoſt to the clouds. Well Sir, ſaid <hi>Alcidas,</hi> what ſay to this place? That it is worthy of <hi>Miralinda,</hi> anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and that nature ſeems to have made it for to render my abode heer leſſe irkſome, albeit the only preſence of my ſhepherdeſſe is able to make it moſt delightfull unto me were it not compoſed as it is, but I very much fear we ſhall not eaſily meet with that we ſeek for. Let us follow our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſaid <hi>Alcidas,</hi> Love is never wanting to them that adore him. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſt the river they came to certain ſallows, which gave a very pleaſant ſhade, at the end of one of thoſe meadows where <hi>Alcidas</hi> alighting, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Don Clariſel:</hi> Sir, I hold it fit that we ſhould ſtay heer a while for to ſee if <hi>Miralinda</hi> will paſſe by; for commonly ſhe goes this way, and grazes her flock upon this freſh paſture. Do as you think good, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> for I am ſo little my ſelf, that I am not able to ſay any thing to purpoſe; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he alighted, took his horſe by the bridle, as <hi>Alcidas</hi> had done, and letting him feed amongſt the trees, he returned cloſe to the high way, where he eſpied a yong ſhepherd who folding his arms acroſſe, and lifting up his eies to heaven, ſaid: O heavens! how long will you ſuffer me to be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bject of the ſcorn of this ſhepherdeſſe, and when will you render her more ſenſible of my affection? I have willingly forſaken that which ambition
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17218:113"/>
might make men deſire, I have put on an habit unworthy of my eſtate that ſo I might enjoy the ſight of her with leſſe ſuſpition, and I ſerve her with the ſame reſpects which ſhould be uſed to a perſon more eminent, yet ſhe forbids me her preſence, ſhuns me, and will not permit me ſo much as to ſay that I die for her. This is extream ingratitude, and if I complain thus it is not without a great deal of reaſon. As I live, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> I ſhall never be jealous of this ſhepherd, and if all that ſuffer for her find no better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, I have cauſe already to complain. You are to hope better, ſaid <hi>Alcidas,</hi> for all thoſe that ſhe hath ſeen have not that worth in them which you have; but let us ſpeak ſofter, I pray you, for queſtionles I ſee her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. At theſe words <hi>Clariſel</hi> grew pale, and perceiving her not far off, he trembled like a leaf ſhaken by the wind, nevertheles thinking how much it conduced to his future happines to be bold in this firſt encounter, he coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly reſolved to boord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er without fear, and was going to meet her had he not been retained by <hi>Alcidas,</hi> who ſeeing him offer to ſet forward, drew him back whileſt <hi>Miralinda</hi> approached, and ſitting down upon the graſſe untied her golden hair for to make it up again with the more grace. <hi>Clariſel</hi> that beheld her through the trees, was raviſhed in the contemplation of ſuch wonderfull beauty, but apprehending a greater content in her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he went towards her, leaving <hi>Alcidas</hi> behind. The noiſe which he made treading upon ſome leaves, drew <hi>Miralinda</hi> ſuddenly to divide her hair, that ſo ſhe might with the leſſe impediment look about her, ſhe was ſomewhat amazed ſeeing a Knight ſo goodly, and of ſo gallant a grace to appear, but accompanying her actions with an extraordinary diſcretion, ſhe preſently roſe up, and making him a low reverence demanded what chance had conducted him to that place. My paſſion brought me hither, anſwered he, for to tell you fair ſhepherdeſſe, that you are not to marvell hearing me truly to ſigh for you, though our conditions ſeem to be ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; Love doth greater miracles, and the wonders which I ſee in your eies ſhall alwaies excuſe me before the ſevereſt Iudge that can be. Look, ſaid ſhe no whit abaſhed, how a ſilly ſhepherdeſſe may be jeered: no doubt, Sir, I have cauſe to complain of fortune for giving me no better a being; but withall I muſt praiſe her for ſending me into the world with ſo much judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to know how to put the difference that is requiſit between your greatnes and my poverty, which forbids me to be perſwaded that ever I can merit the honour you would do me. I am without name, without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and have nothing els to relie upon this day in the world then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodnes of an old ſhepherdeſſe, who doth bring me up, upon condition that I ſhall feed her flocks, in regard whereof I will never beleeve that you love me but to undo me, which I will avoid if I can, and will wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that which can make me live happily in my unhappines. Now if you fondly ſuppoſe with them who think that promotion may one day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to accept of the advantages they propound unto me, without doubt you will be deceived, and loſe your labour, for at length you ſhall know that the deſire of greatnes ſhall never prevail with me.</p>
                     <p>If you take feigning for truth, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> without doubt you will intreat me as you have done all thoſe which have hitherto preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before you; but if you pleaſe to make uſe of your reaſon, you will diſcern the difference that is to be made between my affection and their paſſions. I love you without deſiring any thing of you but what honour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17218:113"/>
will permit you to confer on me, and that which I moſt wiſh for at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is, that you will ſuffer me to live by you with the liberty to keep a flock in another habit then this I have on; and that you will not refuſe to ſee both in my reſpect and in my actions, the integrity of this love. Provided, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, that your quality be not known heer, which at laſt might make me unhappy; and that you will live modeſtly according to your promiſe, I will never oppoſe your deſire: for I will give my ſelf the glory of your captivity, and beleeve that your intentions are as ſincere, as I am innocent. Beauteous ſhepherdeſſe, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> kiſſing her hand whether ſhe would or no, I receive this grace from you with more ſatisfaction, then if you had made me Monarch of the whole earth: You command diſcretion in my actions, you will have my affection to be unfeigned, and my vows inviolable; ſuch is my deſire to, and I wiſh that thunderbolts from heaven may ſtrike me, if ever, you ſee me ſigh otherwiſe then you would have me; and from henceforward I will approve of your anger and my baniſhment, if I give you any occaſion to abridge theſe favours which I hold ſo dear. Well, ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> our accord is half made, but can you counterfet the ſhepherd well? The beſt in the world, anſwered he, and if I had the habit now, I verily think you would take me for one, at leaſtwiſe I ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate my ſelf far better to the cariage of a ſwain, then one of your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers doth, who came this way a little before you, and mightily complained of your rigour. It is the ſon of Count <hi>Moligny,</hi> named <hi>Ceſander,</hi> anſwered ſhe, who queſtionles wiſhes me well, but his humor is intolerable; he is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous when he beholds me caſt an eie upon any ſhepherd, he importunes me continually, and is alwaies chanting unto me the greatnes of his race, as if I were obliged to love him, for that only conſideration, rather then for the merit of his perſon, and renders himſelf ſo odious in his waies, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to look upon him, which is the reaſon I flie him as I would do a wolf. But let us leave off this diſcourſe, I pray you, and tell me how you lighted on this place. The deſtinies conducted me hither, ſaid he, and from their providence is this good fortune of mine derived. Then making a brief relation of his adventures, of his condition, of the beginning of his love, and of the violent paſſions he had undergone ſince that time, he much amazed her, &amp; put her almoſt out of hope of ever enjoying him; but ſetting up her reſt upon a contrary opinion, ſhe ſweetly replied thus: Verily I am of the ſame faith with you, that there is a kind of fare in our affections: for if you were ſtricken in love by my picture, I was no leſſe wounded therewith by yours, which I ſaw not many daies paſt in this very place, it being ſhewed to me by a damſell, who told me that within a while I ſhould no longer be mine own; wherefore I do not marvell now, that I have not been more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to receive you, ſeeing the heavens governed my thoughts, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my will: I acquaint you with this ſecret, not to give you more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; leſſe reſpect, but to let you know that we are not to falſifie the effect of ſo many promiſes, if we will live contented, ſince it is the only mean to aſſure you thoſe felicities which you hope for in me, and to render me the ſatisfaction that I expect from your thraldome. Fear not, faireſt ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, anſwered he, wonderfully contented with theſe aſſurances, fear not that I will ever paſſe the bounds of your commandements, I feel ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite joy in being yours, that I am reſolved to die a thouſand deaths before I will give you the leaſt occaſion to complain of me, and to teſtifie how far
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17218:114"/>
I am from abuſing your favour, I will depart, if you pleaſe, with promiſe to be heer again in two daies for to continue my ſervices unto you. Go my ſhepherd, ſaid ſhe, (for ſo will I call you heerafter) and let Love, whom we begin to adore, favour our deſigns. Heerewith <hi>Clariſel</hi> kiſſing her hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, went to find out <hi>Alcidas,</hi> who ſeeing him return with ſo merry a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, asked him if he ſhould be happy. Yes, ſaid he, if heaven do not oppoſe mine enterpriſe: <hi>Miralinda</hi> wiſhes me well, and truſting in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes makes me hope for that which I moſt deſire in the world; let us get to horſe, we ſhall have leiſure enough to talk of this matter. Then returning to their way they began to diſcourſe of the means <hi>Clariſel</hi> was to uſe for to fall in with ſome ſhepherd, and left the beautifull <hi>Miralinda</hi> to a million of new thoughts, which giving her occaſion to conſider of all things, made her ſometimes apprehend the miſery of a deceit, and by and by confirm her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new againſt the aſſaults of that weaknes.</p>

As ſoon as he was in the field, he reflected on himſelf, and conſidering the habit he was in, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to accuſe him of imprudence and weaknes, wherfore he ſaid: O God! How great is the imbecility of man, and how juſtly are Lovers condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who renounce their own wills, for to give themſelves over to their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Doubtles I am now ſubject to the mockeries of the wiſe, and though I may find ſome excuſe in the example of an infinity of great perſonages, who have erred like my ſelf, yet can I not hinder the jeering of thoſe which are more adviſed, and that will ſay with reaſon too, how I ſhould rather draw inſtruction from the miſery of others, then imitate them in their faults: Howbeit if I conſider the recompence which I am to attend from my deſign, I cannot be charged with folly, nor guilty of blame; but I may maintain before all the world, that the beauties of ſo accompliſhed a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, may extenuate this act of mine. I muſt purſue my courſe then, not ſtand upon ſuch weak conſiderations, and yeeld more to mine own ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then to the opinion of thoſe that are fools, and think themſelves wiſe. Thus intertaining himſelf with a world of thoughts, he arrived at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant meadows of Bellombre, where extreamly deſirous to find his ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, he looked round about, and not ſeeing her appear, he was ſtrangely

                        </gap>ms which he perceived on the left hand, whence he conjectured that <hi>Miralinda</hi> might be there, and that ſome amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhepherd courted her in that maner. Driving on his flock then within a little while he came to thoſe trees, at the foot wherof he ſaw his ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe with another, nothing neer ſo fair, and two ſhepheards upon their knees, who ſeemed to implore her pity. His goodly preſence, and the grace wherewithall he ſaluted this company, faſtened every ones eies upon him; but <hi>Miralinda</hi> knowing him, aroſe contrary to her cuſtome, and giving him an amorous look, asked him what occaſion brought him thither. That is not to be queſtioned, anſwered he, ſince it is moſt ſure that I come as others do to ſigh out my paſſions, and to tell you that you never ſaw ſhepherd before that adores you with more reſpect then my ſelf. She hath more cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence my ſervices, anſwered one, then to hear you make theſe proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but I beleeve you will reap no more benefit by them then I have done by my complaints. If the defect of your merit and the judgement of this ſhepherdeſſe, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> have given you no part in her favour, you muſt not think, ſhepherd, that others are as unhappy as your ſelf; the condition of our ſervice obligeth a woman, and when our actions are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pleaſe her, we are to expect an acknowledgement of them. If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtrain her to love me, I will be contented with the ſight of her; and if my preſence offend her, you ſhall ſee me continually upon theſe banks ſinging my misfortune, and her beauty: behold, ſhepherd, how I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my deſires to hers, accuſing my ſelf without rendring her cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable: and if I receive any thing from ſo great an obedience, I will beleeve it proceedeth rather from her goodneſſe, then mine own merit, otherwiſe I will ſay that I am juſtly puniſhed for having been too daring. How now, ſhepherd, ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> is any man ſo light as you are, thus freely to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his thoughts? I never ſaw you till now, and will you already have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to know that you love me? Yes without doubt, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and if I ſhould uſe leſſe freedome, I ſhould not have ſo much affection. Is it likely that I ſhould be heer for your ſervice, and it not be known? my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns would then be without honour, and my ambition without glory; I can no more forbear, beauteous ſhepherdeſſe, to publiſh my captivity, then to ſuffer; and if you be diſpleaſed with it, I will hold my peace, and think to profit more by my ſilence, then by my ſpeech. Shepherd, anſwered <hi>Miralinda,</hi> reaching him her hand for to make him ſit down by her, I do not purpoſe to forbid you to ſpeak, and what I ſaid was but to let you know that I love a man that is diſcreet, howbeit let us leave this diſcourſe, and tell me from whence you are come, whither you go, and what accident brought you to this place.

Then ſeazing on <hi>Clariſel</hi> he gave him two or three rough twitches, which made him give back a ſtep, but <hi>Clariſel</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good hold on the wings of his dublet, flung him all along on the ground, and gave him ſuch a cruell fall, that every one thought he had been dead; whereupon the other ſhepherd, of whom we have ſpoken before, ran inſtantly to ſuccour him, howbeit <hi>Celidon</hi> being riſen with pain, told him that he felt no hurt, and that in regard he was not fallen but by accident, he was not reſolved to quit <hi>Miralinda,</hi> whom he would make judge of their difference; but ſhe laughed ſo heartily that ſhe could not utter a word; at length ſeeing her ſelf conſtrained to ſpeak, ſhe agreed them ſo, that each of them ſhould remain in his hopes. After that time <hi>Clariſel</hi> was ordinarily preſent in the places where <hi>Miralinda</hi> fed her flock; ſometimes alone, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a number of ſhepherds, who oftentimes accorded their rebocks and hoboys together, for to make the length of the daies ſeem leſſe tedious to this ſhepherdeſſe, who loving none but the handſome ſhepherd (ſo <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſel</hi> was called) cared only for his converſation, and avoided as much as ſhe could the reſt; to the end ſhe might not be importuned by their uſuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; ſo that if ſhe were obliged by the way of civility to ſee them, it was very coldly, being unwilling to give her <hi>Clariſel</hi> any cauſe of ſuſpition, who in the mean while graved upon the bark of all the trees (under whoſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows they met) the name of his beautifull ſhepherdeſſe, little regarding the ſolicitations of his rivals, as unworthy of his jealouſie. Having paſt ſome time in this maner, alwaies accompanying <hi>Miralinda</hi> at the fountains, at the rivers ſide, in the woods and in the meadows, oftentimes taking the care of grazing her flocks, every one perceived that <hi>Clariſel</hi> was beloved of this cruell one, before inexorable to any ſhepheard whatſoever; ſo that jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie putting them often into choler, ſome new match at wraſtling was every day ſeen, wherein <hi>Clariſel</hi> ſhewed himſelf ſo accompliſhed, that all the Country gave way unto him, each one judging him worthy of the fortune he enjoied, <hi>Ceſander</hi> only excepted, who openly declared himſelf his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſought all maner of occaſions to annoy him, and delivered a thouſand lies to <hi>Miralinda,</hi> thinking to divert her from loving him; but ſhe very well knowing whereunto it tended, and the fidelity of <hi>Clariſel</hi> would give no ear to him, and daily made demonſtration of ſome new paſſion for her ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, which ſo vexed <hi>Ceſander</hi> that he reſolved to run into the uttermoſt of extreams, as you ſhall ſee by and by.</p>

No, my deareſt ſhepherdeſſe, anſwered he, I have no cauſe for to complain of you; alike is your beauty, and the ſence of my paſſions, which are no whit leſſe to day then they were before; but you know that time and accidents do not alwaies leave us in caſe to laugh or complain. You will ſay that our content ſhould not be ſubject therunto, and that our love may exempt us from a million of miſeries, as an aſſured port from the ſurges of a troubled ſea, my ſweeteſt ſhepherdeſſe it is true, but can we triumph without labors?

that no regard is to be had to ſuch frivolous things, which oftentimes ariſe from the weaknes of our brain, yet I will not ſlight it, but take it as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from heaven, that it may be lets me foreſee a miſchief, to decline it. I dreamt then an howr before day that I ſaw ſix Lions come into theſe plains who tearing your cloths in a thouſand peeces, dragd you up and down the wood, without any fear of the noiſe and cries the ſhepherds of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made, that they were gotten into a den for to have fed on your body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that a great Bear defended you, and that I comming in to his aid, drew you out of their paws; judge now whether I have not reaſon to fear ſome miſhap in your perſon, and whether I can live contented after theſe mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. No doubtles, nor ſhall I ever be in quiet, till I have put my ſelf in caſe to ſerve you, if by chance any thing ſhould arrive unto you beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. But what can you do heerin, ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> a little troubled? Keep my ſelf ready upon all occaſions, anſwered he, and have my horſe and my arms in my lodging; for I never told you yet, my faireſt ſhepherdeſſe, that I am a Knight, and ſon to the great Emperour of Greece <hi>Floriſel</hi> of Niquea, a thouſand times more ſatisfied in being yours, then in the poſſeſſion of all the Kingdoms of the World. O God! ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> what tears will theſe words one day coſt me, and what ſorrow will this great inequality make me endure? I would your condition, my <hi>Clariſel,</hi> were lower, or mine more eminent, I might then expect that which my judgement doth now prohibit me to hope for. No, no, ſaid he, do not imagin, my excellent ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, that ever this difference ſhall alter my reſolution, or that it ſhall one day cauſe me to deſpiſe that, which you ſee me ſo adore at this preſent. I do not love you for the conſideration of any means that you may have, but for the ſole merit of your beauty, by which I ſwear in the ſight of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whom I call to witnes, that I will alwaies hold you as dear as mine own life; and that I will never have other wife then your ſelf, if ſo be you wilbe contented with my fortune. Relie upon theſe aſſurances, I beſeech you, and do not kill me with greeving at your doubt of my faith. I will give, ſaid ſhe with a cheerfuller countenance, my Lord, I will give more to your oath, then to my fear; for you would not take pleaſure to beguile the ſimplicity of a maid that loves you with paſſion, howſoever you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, if you pleaſe, to carry my ſelf with much more reſpect to you then formerly I have done, to the end that my humility may render me worthy of your affection. It would be the utter undoing of all our pleaſures, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, if you take away the liberty of our actions, wherefore we will live, if you pleaſe, as hitherto we have done. But my ſhepherdeſſe, ſhall we not ſeal theſe promiſes of marriage with ſome kiſſes? It is reaſon, ſaid ſhe, that I ſhould grant you this little, ſince you have reſerved nothing but to give me all. And my Lord, added ſhe after ſhe had amorouſly joined her lips to his, I would I might give you ſweeter and greater contentments, verily you ſhould then perceive that I am moſt ſenſible of your paſſions, but mine honour doth forbid me the granting of any thing more, and wills me humbly to intreat you to be contented with this, untill ſuch time as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies have reſolved to make us happy. You ſhall never ſee me ſwerve from the reſpect which you require in my actions, ſaid <hi>Clariſel;</hi> but my ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, ſeeing this article is concluded according to our deſire, let us return to our former talk. Have you not obſerved the abſence of <hi>Ceſander?</hi> He hath not appeared theſe three daies, and I am confident he hath ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

plot upon you, induced thereunto by the favourable intertainment you have given me, and by the neglect of the ſervices which he hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tendered unto you. Aſſure you, Sir, ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> that loving none but you, I never thought of others, and not to lie to you <hi>Ceſander</hi> was quite out of my head; but now I call to mind that I have not ſeen him a good while, which makes me approve of your ſuſpition, wherefore we ſhall do well to ſtand upon our guard. For my ſelf, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> I reſolve to go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Alcidas</hi> houſe, where all my furniture is ready; but in regard I may not abſent my ſelf without your leave, I deſire you to grant it me. Go, ſaid ſhe weeping, and all the Protectors of our woods be propitious to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; as for me, I will paſſe away the reſt of this day by entertaining my thoughts with the favors which the heavens have conferred on me in your affection. <hi>Clariſel</hi> then departing, arrived within a few howrs after at <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> Caſtle, who by chance was gone the very ſame day upon a certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and conferring a long time with <hi>Orizenna,</hi> recounted unto her the pleaſantnes of his life, the contentment which he had in the continuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of ſo lovely a ſhepherdeſſe, and commending her diſpoſition that was far from all kind of rudenes, he ſwore that he had never ſeen any thing ſo worthy the affection of the greateſt Prince; inſomuch that he made <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenna</hi> in love with <hi>Miralinda,</hi> and extreamly deſirous to ſee her. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe having continued till the evening, he cauſed his horſe and arms to be brought him, and taking leave of <hi>Orizenna,</hi> unto whom he had declared his dream, he returned to Bellombre, wherein deſiring to enter in by dark, becauſe he would not be diſcovered in that equipage, he got him to bed hoping to ſleep better then he had done the night before, howbeit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deſire he had to ſee his ſhepherdeſſe again, not ſuffering him to take much reſt, made him riſe by break of day to wait for her at the Elms; but ſhe that had no leſſe unquietnes was there firſt, ſo that incountring in this maner, they renewed their ſalutes a thouſand times, and ſitting down on the graſſe gave account of their thoughts in ſuch amorous words, that they were able no doubt to make them live contented in the midſt of infinit croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; having ſat then a long time thus ſweetly entertaining one another, they roſe up for to gather their ſheep together which were ſcattered, but they were eaſed of that labour, and remained ſomewhat amazed to behold two yong unknown ſhepherds do them that office; and that advancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both at one inſtant fell upon their knees before <hi>Miralinda,</hi> and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her: Fair ſhepherdeſſe, the fame of you which filleth our hamlets with wonder and aſtoniſhment, having ſtricken this ſhepherds heart and mine both at a time, we revealed our paſſions one to the other at one inſtant, but with ſo much ill fortune, that a marvellous great friendſhip which tied us together like brothers, was ſuddenly converted into hatred, jealouſie not ſuffering either of us to indure a rivall; ſo that in brief after we had recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and in vain intreated each other to yeeld up his pretenſions, we came three or fowr times to blows, alwaies giving over with a like advantage; and queſtionles, we had ſeen the end of one another, if our parents grieved with this enmity had not laboured to accord us; but the prize of our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell being great, each one ſtood firm in his purpoſe, ſo as the aſſiſtance of our friends had been without effect had they not had recourſe to the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which told them that our remedy lay in your hands; we are come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, fair ſhepherdeſſe, that you may pronounce in favour of the one or the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17218:117"/>
other of us: Our conditions are alike, our ſtates equall, there reſts nothing but the conſideration of our perſons, wherof you may be judge. So finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this diſcourſe they both kneeled down before <hi>Miralinda,</hi> who kindly turning to <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> ſmiled and ſaid unto him: Shepherd, I will not make the Oracle a liar, I will preſently heal theſe ſick Lovers, but know you how my friends? By commanding you both never to appear again before me, nor hope that ever I will love you. O cruell! ſaid he that had not yet ſpoken, you heal us indeed: but alas! it is with extream remedies; for our love not permitting us to diſobey you, we will retire our ſelves for to die inſtantly: Saying thus they roſe up, and taking ſeverall paths went away, and were never ſeen more at Bellombre. Theſe ſhepherds being diſpatched in this maner, <hi>Miralinda</hi> ſate down again in the ſhadow, and began to talk with <hi>Celidon,</hi> that was come to the Elms to ſeek her out for to complain of her rigor, when ſhe perceived two armed men making directly to her: the ſight of them much amazing her, ſhe caſt her eies upon <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> who remembring his dream preſently laid hold of a great bat that lay on the bank of the river, and approaching to his ſhepherdeſſe told her, that it was expedient for her to turn back to Bellombre. <hi>Miralinda</hi> very much troubled was running away, but the two Knights comming in, the one intercepted her paſſage, whileſt the other taking her by the arm, would have ſet her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his horſe; nevertheles ſhe reſiſted and cried out for help, which put <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſel</hi> into ſuch a rage, that advancing his bat he diſcharged it ſo ſtrongly on him which held his ſhepherdeſſe, that he overthrew him dead to the ground. This greatly animating him he inſtantly ſeazed on the dead Knights ſword, ran after the other, cut off one of his arms, and with the ſecond blow clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his head in twain, he thought that he had freed his ſhepherdeſſe, when he diſcerned ſix other Knights come galloping towards him, from whom he could expect nothing but death. I muſt, ſaid he then, make uſe of new counſell upon new occaſions; if I expoſe my ſelf to the fury of theſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors which are comming, <hi>Miralinda</hi> would be loſt, and my death would but add to her ſorrow; I will therefore preſerve my ſelf if I can, for to ſuccor her to ſome purpoſe, and not raſhly. Wherupon taking his courſe towards Bellombre, he entred ſpeedily into his lodging, ſuddenly armed himſelf, mounted upon his horſe which he found ready, and getting out of the back gate he galloped after theſe villains, who this while had forcibly conveied away <hi>Miralinda,</hi> and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By heaven, ſaid he, you rakehels, ye ſhall pay deerly for it now I have met with you; ſo drawing his ſword he ſmot one of them with ſuch fury on the helmet, that he clove him to the very ſhoulders; and inſtantly redoubling a back blow on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17218:117"/>
he cut his armor as if it had been ſingle paper, and divided his body in twain, therewith giving another a thruſt in the belly, he ran him quite through the guts ſending him dead to the other two. Not ſatified with this execution, he raiſed his ſword again to have diſpatched the fourth, when as the Knight intreated him to leave him that ſmall part of the glory, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a ſhepherdeſſe which three other theeves had carried away. At this word of ſhepherdeſſe, he turned about, and keeping the ſame way as faſt as his horſe could carry him, within half an howr he perceived his fair miſtris in the arms of a Knight who ſeemed invincible amidſt two others, which ſo enraged him, that with the firſt blow he ſent the ſword and arm of one of them to the ground; and fearing to ſtrike the other, becauſe he held <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralinda,</hi> he diſcharged upon the crupper of his horſe, which he cut in two peeces, by that means ſtaying him: the third ſeeing ſo ſudden an execution ſlunk preſently into the wood to avoid purſuing; but <hi>Clariſel</hi> who thought of nothing but his ſhepherdeſſe, alighted inſtantly, and approaching to the Knight that having left <hi>Miralinda</hi> had drawn his ſword for to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he diſcharged ſo terrible a blow upon his head, that his brains flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he tumbled dead in the place. This done he looked round about to ſee if there were any more enemies to fight withall, but no body appearing before him ſave <hi>Miralinda,</hi> who ſeemed more dead then alive, he went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently unto her, and lifting up his bever, that ſhe might know him, he ſaid unto her: What ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I think, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> they will never trouble you more; for they have beaten the way to their Captain; and having encountred them firſt, I cut them firſt in peeces; one thing only grieves me that I do not know the author of this villany. The author, ſaid ſhe was <hi>Ceſander,</hi> he that held me, and that was the laſt which paſt by the edge of your ſword: This wretch made me ſuffer ſtrangely, for all his diſcourſe was nothing but reproaches of my ingratitude, and thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As I live, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> I am wonderfull glad that he is in the caſe I behold him; more for to ſee you freed from his importunities, then for any fear I had that he could ever have obtained place in your favour, for you have too much judgement to love a man ſo ill diſpoſed; but let us leave of this diſcourſe, and think of getting out of this wood that we be not nighted in it, at leaſtwiſe we will go and render the thanks which we ow to the aſſiſtance of a good Knight whom we ſhall find hard by, and that peradventure is ſtill in fight with one of theſe raskals. Saying ſo, he led his horſe with one hand, and held <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralinda</hi> by the other, when they perceived the Knight of whom they ſpake, come towards them as faſt as he could drive; but as ſoon as he diſcerned them, he preſently ſtopt; and alighting embraced <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> to whom he ſaid: My Lord, I was making all the haſte I could to your ſuccor, but I ſee you had no need of my ſword.

                        <hi>Alcidas</hi> then, ſaid the Knight? O me! ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> how forgetfull am I? Theſe arms I ſaw at your houſe, but I was before in ſuch a rage, and am now ſo full of joy, that I had then no deſire but to be revenged, nor at this preſent have any will but to render thanks unto God for my good ſucceſſe, which was the reaſon why I knew you no ſooner. I but I did your <hi>Miralin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcidas,</hi> for ſeeing her in the power of theſe Knights, and hearing her crie out, I fell in amongſt them to reſcue her, being aſſured that I ſhould oblige you in her aſſiſtance, but without your arrivall, we had both been loſt. Let us ſpeak no more of this misfortune, ſince we have avoided it, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and tell me whether we may find any lodging heerabout; night is at hand, and I am ſenſible already of the incommodity this ſhepherdeſſe would receive, ſhould ſhe lie abroad. I am not able to aſſure you any, ſaid <hi>Alcidas,</hi> only let us keep this way, perchance it will bring us ere long to ſome village: then <hi>Clariſel</hi> having taken up <hi>Miralinda</hi> behind him, <hi>Alcidas</hi> rode along with them, and was muſing on this treacherous plot, when as a Knight came againſt him as hard as he could run, and incountred him ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly that he caſt him out of his ſaddle to the ground, paſſing on as if he had been carried by lightning.

Alas! ſaid he, beautious Shepherdeſſe, now you inforce me, I was reſolved to have ſuffered ſilently; but ſince you will underſtand the cauſe of my griefe, I will not refuſe you the knowledge of it, to the end I may not accuſe my cowardiſe for my ſuffering. I conſider the miſery whereunto I am reduced, in that I dare not tell you, how it is time that you ſhould recompenſe my ſervices; the place favours my thoughts, but my feare to offend you, will not permit me to reveal them: I love paſſionately, you doubt not of it I aſſure my ſelf, your beauty gives me violent paſſions, I am in continuall torment, I feel a million of flames which conſume me, yet I endure and do not ſo much as open my mouth; and hitherto I never gave you any cauſe to complain of my actions: But it is time, I, my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, it is time to be more hardy, and I ſhould think my ſelf miſerable, if I ſhould overſlip this opportunity, without knowing how far your love extends. We are in a wood, barred from all eies that may diſcloſe our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, this darkneſſe will warrant our delights, my faith will make them lawfull, you will free me from a perpetuall fear, that another more happy then my ſelf may one day poſſeſſe you, you will oblige me to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and this way I ſhall aſſure you the greatneſſe which is due to your merit; do not ſuffer me, my deareſt Shepherdeſſe, to languiſh any longer, &amp; keep me from dying with grief, at your being inſenſible of my endurings; give your ſelf wholly to me, as I proteſt again, before God, to be onely yours, and never to have other wife; let us take hold of occaſion, that is bald, and which ſeldom offers it ſelf twice; give not your ſelf time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your fear, nor me cauſe to complain of you; and now calling to minde the integrity of all my paſſed actions, draw from thence an infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that I love you ſincerely, and that you ſhall not be deceived; this is the way to aſſure our happineſſe, all your future content depends on your diſcretion, which ought to accomodate you to the time: think on it, my Shepherdeſſe, and loſe not yourſelf with light conſiderations, which are never well accepted of amongſt lovers: I am now in a ſtate to receive grace, ſaid he kneeling down, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What could you wiſh for more, if you had once the ſpoil of me, and how could you love me, if there were nothing left for you to hope from me? I will never beleeve that you love me for to be my ruine, or that you have weighed that well which you have ſaid; your deſires, and opportunity, that tempts men, have made you ſpeak in that manner I know, but recollect your ſelf, I pray you, judge whether I may give you that with reaſon, which you demand with paſſion; I love you infinitely, I confeſſe it; howbeit, nature teacheth me, that I ought to

love my ſelf better, and that we are not to ſeck the ſatisfaction of another, with our own overthrow; moreover fortune hath beſtowed nothing on me but mine honour for to releeve the miſeries of my birth, and will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of that? Ah <hi>Clariſel!</hi> you will make me beleeve that your love was alwaies feigned, that ſo many oaths were not ſworn but to deceive me, and that you would now triumph over me, for to make me the object of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as I am of ill fortune. If you have ſpoken to that end, proceed ſhepherd, I put my ſelf into your hands, and my undoing ſhall teſtifie that I was not inſenſible of the honour you have done me, and that I have not refuſed you a ſatisfaction, but for to make it one day a thouſand times more acceptable unto you, by giving it you without ſorrow or ſhame, howbeit that I may not have occaſion to complain of my weaknes, be aſſured that this night you ſhal have all that ever you can hope for from me.

I were void of love, ſaid ſhe, if I ſhould not excuſe your paſſion. No my ſhepherd, I will never think on it, but love you the more, for this obedience doth ſo pleaſe me, that now I think my ſelf far happier in poſſeſſing of you, then I did at the firſt; and that you may ſee I will not be ſparing of the favours, which a pure affection may permit me to give you, I will recompence the victory you have gotten over your deſires, with a kiſſe. Saying ſo, ſhe drew neerer to him, and joined her lips ſo ſweetly to his that the exceſſe of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a content tranſported him beyond all that could be deſired of pleaſure in the world, wherein doubtles he had continued a long time if <hi>Miralinda,</hi> plucking him by the arm had not put him in mind that the night was more then half ſpent, and that it was time to betake them to their reſt, thought the place was not very proper for it.

No, ſaid the Count, for I am happy indeed if it be true. Why, do you doubt of my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You may build upon it, ſaid the Dwarf; and do but take order that I may be furniſhed with arms, upon my life Ile lodge you in your Miſtriſſes bed aſſoon as you have made me Knight. This diſcourſe being paſt, not without a world of laughter, the Dwarf retired himſelf, in expectation of the next morning, which was no ſooner come, but he ſo preſt his Lord, that he ſent him to the next town, cauſed light arms to be made fit for him, who having put them on with ſuch Ceremonies as his Maſter had deviſed, for to make himſelf ſport, ſtood upon ſuch puntillioes, as if he would have made all the world to fall by the edge of his ſword. I will ſee now, ſaid he, taking a lance greater then himſelf, whether this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17218:121"/>
Shepherd dare affront me, or be my rivall; and let me not live, if I do not overthrow him at the firſt encounter; wherefore my good Lord, ſaid he to his Maſter, give me leave to commence my knighthood with the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conqueſt of the earth. I will not hinder thee, ſaid the Count, who took wonderfull delight in his humour, but I foreſee that thou wilt catch a fall. No, no, ſaid he, couragiouſly getting up on his horſe, the prize will animate my forces: therewith ſetting ſpurs to an old jade, upon the which he was mounted, away he went to Bellombre with all the ſpeed he could, and came thither juſt at ſuch time, as <hi>Miralinda</hi> and <hi>Clariſel,</hi> ſitting under the ſhadow of thoſe lofty firretrees, were ſinging an air upon the happy incounter of their loves. By heaven, ſaid he, addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> and ſhaking a lance, which might be of the length of an ell, in ſtead of ſinging, thou hadſt need begin the lamentations of thy death, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to love my Shepherdeſſe more. O me, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> laughing in good earneſt with <hi>Miralinda,</hi> to behold the equipage of this piece of man: what new Knight have we here, and with what a grace does he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a lance? Shepherd, anſwered he, in a mighty rage, it is no time to jeer, I mean to be the death of thee, wherefore betake thee to thy arms, and then thou ſhalt ſee, that though my body be leſſe, my courage is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thine. Why, doeſt thou think that I ſhall need arms to vanquiſh thee, ſaid <hi>Clariſel?</hi>
I arms, ſaid <hi>Maſcarin,</hi> for I would be loth to fight with thee upon advantage; but if thou wilt make thy ſelf unworthy of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which I offer, Ile ſoon rid the world of thee. Wherewithall he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his lance, ſet ſpurs to his horſe, and ran againſt <hi>Clariſel,</hi> who taking wonderfull delight in this ſport, ſtept aſide, and with a little rap of his ſheephook tumbled him ſo prettily out of his ſaddle, that <hi>Miralinda</hi> thought ſhe ſhould have killed her ſelf with laughing. Now art thou my priſoner, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> taking him by the collar, and therefore yeeld me up the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, or reſolve to die. That were againſt reaſon, anſwered the Dwarf, for thou cameſt behinde me, and didſt not vanquiſh me fairly. Well, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> wilt thou run once morethen, and quit thy pretenſions if thou art overthrown? I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by my knighthood, ſaid he, and will never croſſe thee more, if I chance to be ſo unhappy as to tumble once again, So mounting on his horſe, he charged his little lance, and ran very couragiouſly againſt <hi>Clariſel;</hi> but receiving another rap on his head with the ſheephook, he fell to the ground, ſo aſtonied, that if <hi>Miralinda</hi> had not opened his helmet to give him aire, he had beene deprived of his ſenſes. How do you feel your ſelf, my Knight, ſaid ſhe, after your fall? Too well, ſaid he, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Shepherd, whoſetreachery to me begins to be puniſhed, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging me to be your Knight, his hopes are utterly undone, ſo that he may go ſeek him another Miſtris elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>How, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> ready to burſt with laughing, do you threaten me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have given you your life? Come, come, ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> I will make a peace between you: Friend <hi>Maſcarin</hi> I wilbe alwaies glad to ſee you, and receiving your vows with affection, I will call you my favourite, as you are already to the Count <hi>d' Aglas;</hi> but I deſire that this ſhepherd ſhould be my Knight, for he can defend me better than you, and ſo I entreat you to live friends. By my life, fair ſhepherdeſſe ſaid <hi>Maſcarin,</hi> I will never appeal from your ſentence, for it were not fit you ſhould diſcard this ſhepherd for me, at leaſtwiſe before you know how far my ſervices may extend, ſo that

if he will render you as much obedience as I do, our quarrell is at an end. I am very well pleaſed with this accord, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> for I ſhould never have ſlept quietly having ſo dangerous an enemy as thy ſelf; let us drink then together for a confirmation of this agreement. In good faith ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarin,</hi> thou ſhalt do me a ſingular curteſie to beſtow a little wine on me, if thou haſt any in thy bottle, this armor hath put me into ſuch a heat, and the choler I was in, made me ſo drie, that I am ready to die for thirſt. Therwith <hi>Clariſel</hi> reaching him a leather bottle which he had ordinarily in his ſcrip, ſo tempered him, that he talkt of nothing but of combatting all the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of the Province to maintain that he was more amiable then they. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this maner with <hi>Miralinda,</hi> he gave her incredible content, pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted <hi>Don Clariſels</hi> cares, and ſerving for ſport to all the ſhepherds of Bellombre, went up and down along the rivers ſide extolling the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable beauty of his ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yes Sir, ſaid he wiping his eies, it lies in you to oblige me unto you for ever, if you pleaſe to imploy your ſword for the ſervice of one of the faireſt Ladies of this Kingdome, unjuſtly diſinherited, and likely to be moſt miſerable all her life time, if the ſuccour of ſtrangers do not render her that of which her friends have deprived her. She is the ſole heir of the Count of Maran, excellently fair, as I told you, and for a long time adored by moſt of the yong gallants of the Court, now neglected by all through the practice of one of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedeſt men of the world. <hi>Narſander</hi> (ſo is this wretch called) Unkle to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> (which is the poor affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

been heard of: for he hath accuſed her not only for offending againſt the duty of a maid well born, but for being culpable of the death of a child, which he produced, and affirmed to be hers, and to confirm his ſpeeches he hath ſo inchanted <hi>Melania</hi> (for he is very skilfull in Negromancy) that ſhe her ſelf avouches how ſhe hath murdered that child, although it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſhe had never ſeen it, but at that time when the Iudges commanded her to be brought to look upon it. This confeſſion of hers, the accuſation of an Unkle, who ſeems to be carried thereunto by a juſt reſentment of her diſhonour, and the teſtimony of a ſervant that he hath, more wicked then himſelf, hath cauſed this maid to be condemned to death, and the Earldom of Maran to be confiſcated unto this Inchanter, if ſome friends of hers by the mothers ſide had not oppoſed this ſentence; ſhewing that there was no regard to be had to the ſaying of the maid, who queſtionles ſpake by the power of witchcraft which <hi>Narſander</hi> had uſed, neither to the falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this man whom avarice had provoked therunto, as was eaſily to be judged by the demand he had made of the lands of Maran, and leſſe to the teſtimony of that ſervant who was known to be a moſt lewd raſcall, and that had ſaid nothing but upon promiſe of recompence. Theſe reaſons were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably heard, and all means have been uſed to diſcover the truth of this affair; but the Iudges not finding anything to prove the innocence of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania,</hi> as they have witnes of her offence, have confirmed their firſt ſentence of death; howbeit deſiring to give ſomething to the birth of this maid, and to the requeſt of her friends, who ſtill maintain that ſhe is bewitched, they have added theſe conditions, that within three months ſhe ſhall bring a Knight for to combat <hi>Narſander,</hi> in whoſe victory or overthrow her life or death conſiſts, which hath been accepted both by her friends, and <hi>Narſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who queſtionles is very valiant and couragious, and that with reaſon beleeves how ſhe will meet with none in all the Country that either dares affront him or that will not fall under his ſword, which very much troubles <hi>Melania's</hi> friends, who unwilling to hazard her honour and life upon the weaknes of their arms, have ſent me to ſeek ſome adventurous Knight for to undertake this combat; and had commanded me to find out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſhepherd, who is much ſpoken of alate; but I will go no further ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus luckily incountred you, only now it reſteth that you will through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin your forces, and conſider whether you are able to give an end to ſo great a buſines. The honour of combats, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> depends on the grace of heaven, rather then on the vanity of men, which is the reaſon why I will not raſhly promiſe thee the victory; but I wil confidently aſſure thee to undertake this quarrell with courage, and not to be diverted from it by the commendation thou haſt given this inchanter. Let us away then if you pleaſe, ſaid the Squire, for to morow is the laſt day of the term prefixed, but my comfort is, we may get thither to night if we uſe a little ſpeed; whereupon ſetting ſpurs to their horſes, they rode diſcourſing of the many miſchiefs occaſioned in the world by the treachery of men, when they met a yong damſell, who ſaluting <hi>Alcidamant</hi> ſaid unto him: Brave warrior, I am commanded to preſent you with this Ring; it is a mean to diſcover the innocence of <hi>Melania:</hi> you may put it on her finger, and then make her ſpeak to the Iudges before you combat for her; howbeit leave it not with her, but conſerve it carefully, for it will ſtand you in ſtead other where. She that ſends me ſo rare a preſent very much obliges me, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:17218:123"/>
and aſſure her that ſhe ſhall diſpoſe of me whenſoever, or howſoever ſhe pleaſeth, and ſo ſhall you for your pains in bringing it to me. Saying thus, he paſt on, as it were fearing that the leaſt ſtay might interrupt his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but his Squire ſeeing him poſt away ſo ſuddenly, ſaid unto him: Do you not know this damſell that ſpake to you but now? No, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for I never ſaw her to my remembrance before. That is very ſtrange, ſaid <hi>Armidas,</hi> for it is even ſhe which gave you theſe arms, and me thinks you gave her but cold intertainment, for ſuch powerfull obligations. By my hopes ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> I am very ſorry for it, I would ſhe were heer again, thou ſhouldſt ſee then I would ſoon repair this fault; but ſince it is now too late, I muſt expect ſome other opportunity to ſhew my ſelf more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging unto her. Talking thus in this maner, ſometimes of one thing, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of another, they arrived at a houſe where <hi>Melania's</hi> friends were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with a purpoſe to chuſe out ſome one amongſt themſelves for to hazard the combat with <hi>Narſander,</hi> but the Squire alighting and telling them of the incounter he had made of <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> they all came forth to receive him, wondring very much to behold one ſo yong to follow arms, and they could not be perſwaded that he was of force ſufficient to reſiſt the fury of a man, who had made himſelf redoubted every where; howbeit obſerving him very ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ctly, and ſeeing him to be of ſo goodly a ſtature, well made, and of a confident look, they hoped for ſomething extraordinary from him, ſo as they honoured him exceedingly; and having given him marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous noble entertainment, they conducted him to a chamber for to repoſe himſelf; but ſo great was his deſire to combat, that he ſlept not long. Riſing then very early in the morning, he diſpoſed of himſelf, as a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to do that means to hazard his life; and afterwards being armed at all points, he went ſtraight to the field, which the Iudges had cauſed to be prepared, in whoſe preſence he approached to <hi>Melania,</hi> who was ſet upon a ſcaffold, and ſaid unto her: Madam, aſſure me of your innocence, that ſo I may have the aſſiſtance of heaven fighting for your preſervation. Why do you ſpeak of my innocency, anſwered ſhe, have not I ſaid a thouſand times at leaſt that I have murthered my child, what would you of me more? that were too much, replied <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> if what you ſay were true: But my Lords, ſaid he, addreſſing his ſpeech to the Iudges, I will let you ſee what cunning this wicked man, to whom you have granted the honour of the field, hath uſed to undo this maid: whereupon, taking the Ring which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> had ſent him, he put it upon <hi>Melania's</hi> finger, and then ſaid unto her: Madam, Is it true that you have murdered a childe? That I have murdered a childe, anſwered ſhe, with a ſetled judgement; O God, never ſuffer me, I beſeech thee, to be charged with ſuch a crime; but, Sir, what childe is this that you ſpeak to me of? Of one that you brought into the world, and murdered inſtantly, anſwered the Iudges. Alas! ſaid ſhe, lifting up her eies: may heaven, that never ſuffers ſuch a crime to go unpuniſhed, ſtrike me dead with thunder, if this whereof I am accuſed be true: Are all this people then aſſembled for that, and muſt this ax do vengeance on me for a ſin which I have not committed? My Lords, do not precipitate my daies in this manner, at leaſtwiſe let me know the authour of ſo great a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Narſander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> is he that would ruine you, that charges you with this fact, that by the power of his charms hath made you ſay, that you are culpable of it, and that labours to have you put to death; but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17218:123"/>
we will chaſtice him if you will remit your right unto my arms. I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit you to fight upon this occaſion, anſwered ſhe, if I were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his aſſiſtance that never forſakes the innocent, but aſſuring my ſelf both of his juſtice and your valour, you may proceed to the combat when you pleaſe. Whereupon <hi>Alcidamant</hi> taking the Ring from her as he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by <hi>Nerea, Melania</hi> required afreſh to be put to death as ſhe that was guilty; wherby the aſſiſtants plainly perceived how <hi>Narſander</hi> had bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her, in ſuch ſort that all the people were ſo incenſed againſt him as they had torn him in peeces, had it not been for <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who deſiring a little ſilence, advanced towards him; and finding him full of rage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to ſee his ſecrets diſcovered ſaid unto him: I have laid open thy villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not to exempt my ſelf from the combat with thee; for I will oblige the world by thy death, and free all honeſt perſons heerafter from thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, but to clear <hi>Melania</hi> from all imputation whereunto ſhe might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the opinion of thoſe that neither could diſcover nor beleeve thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, wherefore defend thy ſelf from me. Therewithall taking the field, he charged his lance, and ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, he met him ſo ſtrongly in the midſt of the courſe, that he caſt him out of his ſaddle, though not without ſome ſtaggering by the incounter he had received. <hi>Narſander</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf on the ground ſuddenly roſe up, and drawing out his ſword he let fall a blow with ſuch fury on his enemies ſhield, that thorowly made him to feel the force of his arm; but not to fail in the firſt combat that ever he had undertaken, he began to charge <hi>Narſander</hi> ſo fiercely, that every one admired to ſee him fight with ſuch grace and courage againſt a man ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and that was ſcarcely to be matched again in France: if his enemy ſtruck at him, he either warded it with his ſword, or oppoſed with his ſhield to it, and for the moſt part avoided it with ſuch agility, as he gave moſt of his blows in vain, wheras his never fell but to purpoſe; ſo that having cut <hi>Narſanders</hi> ſhield in an hundred peeces, he drew bloud from him in I know not how many places. Having then a quick eie, a confident judgement, a ſtrong arm, and a reſolute courage, his addreſſe gave marvellous content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the people, who beholding his youth prophecied, that in time he would prove one of the moſt accompliſhed Knights of the world. <hi>Narſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> almoſt in deſpair to ſee himſelf reduced into ſo ill a plight, and curſing his ſpirits, for neglecting to advertiſe him of the force of this Knight, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeved that the juſtice of heaven was armed for to puniſh his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; nevertheles hoping yet to prevail, he took his ſword in both his hands, and therwith ſtruck <hi>Alcidamant</hi> ſo dangerouſly on the helmet, that he made him knock his chin againſt his breaſt, almoſt deſpairing of his ſences, and without doubt if he had quickly redoubled upon him he had been in perill, but the Knight having time to reſettle and come again to himſelf, grew ſo furious that <hi>Narſander</hi> was exceedingly troubled with the apprehenſion of a moſt horrible blow, which lighting on his head overthrew him in the place without moving either hand or foot, wherewithall the Knight not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied was going to diſarm him, for to take his head from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when as the Iudges declaring <hi>Melania</hi> to be innocent, deſired him to ſave his life. So wicked a creature as this is, anſwered he, deſerves no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, howbeit deliver this gentlewoman into the hands of her friends with the ceremonies requiſit in ſuch a caſe, and then at your requeſt I will ſpare him.

Madam! will you not ſoon underſtand the meaning of theſe words, when I ſhall tell you that your beauty hath left me nothing free, but the will to do you ſervice, and a deſire to enjoy you? Yes, and will think I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, if you ſhould leave me in diſtreſſe, from whence I have delivered you. I did not know my power till now, anſwered ſhe with a ſmile, nor could ever imagine that my eies had been of more force then the fury of the braveſt Knights of the earth, neither did I think of bringing any remedy to your diſeaſe, becauſe I was not acquainted with the cauſe; but now that I am aſſured of it, I will take time to reſolve my ſelf, and let you ſee that I cannot be ingratefull. You ſhall never meet with better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make me happy, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant;</hi> and this place, free, as I conceive, from all danger of diſcovery, may invite you not to let me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Look now, replied <hi>Melania,</hi> how your impatience would wrong us; would you have the Sun be a witneſſe of my diſhonour, or would you have me eſpie ſome one peeping on us in the midſt of our pleaſures, which could never taſte well, accompanied with ſuch fear? We will finde a more ſeaſonable time, and ſafer place, till when, I ſhall intreat you to reſt contented; with this aſſurance, that I am won to your deſire: and withall, that you will give me the ſatisfaction, to look more merrily upon me. Why this, ſaid he, kiſſing her hand, is as much as I can wiſh, whereof I were moſt unworthy, if my looks hereafter do not give you the content you require; onely be mindfull of me, and make the way to my felicity, as ſhort as poſſibly may be.</p>

Sigh for another, ſaid he? Ah, Madam, never fear that, for I have not the power ſo to do though I would, and if my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would permit me to leave following of arms, I would not ſtir from you whilſt I have a day to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I miſtruſted, ſaid ſhe, that I ſhould finde the defect in you, which ordinarily accompanies the weakneſſe of men, who oftentimes ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but your vow hath relieved that doubt, and perſwaded me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that you will be as perfect in love, as you are in arms; which makes me reſolve to care more for your contentment, then my own reputation. This diſcourſe having laſted ſomewhat long, they walked in, where a ſumptuous ſupper waited ready for them on the table; that done, they had entertained themſelves with ſome pleaſing diſcourſe, had not <hi>Melania,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to looſe no time, feigned ſome little indiſpoſition, thereby to ſend her family to bed: Being then alone with a chambermaid, whom ſhe had made the Secretary of her thoughts, and perceiving a generall ſilence over all the houſe, ſhe accomodated her hair in a delicate manner, perfumed it with a moſt exquiſite odour, and putting on a cloak of white ſatten over her ſmock, ſhe went forth without any light, but that of her eies, and ſlipt ſecretly into <hi>Alcidamants</hi> chamber, who ſeeing her come with ſuch a grace, lept ſuddenly out of his bed, and giving her a kiſſe, whereby ſhe might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Shall the boſom of a woman, limit thy ambition, and in ſtead of nobly ſweating under the weight of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, wilt thou die inglorious in her imbraces? Remember, Knight, that fame is not acquired with unmanly courſes, and that God hath not given thee ſuch incomparable force to imploy it ill. With theſe words he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, leaving <hi>Alcidamant</hi> in a ſtrange confuſion; for reflecting on his life, and judging it indeed moſt unbeſeeming a man that deſired to be in eſteem with perſons of worth, he reſolved to quit <hi>Melania,</hi> and follow the voice of the Deſtinies: howbeit, finding no little difficulty therein, and fearing this wenches extream love would oppoſe his deſigne; he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould depart without leave, or whether it were better for him to perſwade her with reaſons to allow of his going. This laſt opinion, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faireſt unto him, in regard that this way, he avoided all occaſion ſhe might have to reproach him for deceiving her, as alſo any misfortune that

otherwiſe peradventure might ariſe from ſuch his neglect of her; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to proceed ingenuouſly with her, and to undertake nothing but with permiſſion; being perſwaded he ought that reſpect unto ſo many favours which he had received from her. Purſuing then the cry of the hounds, and finding as full a grown Boar as ever he had ſeen, he preſently advanced towards him, and not giving him time to enter into the toils, he ſtruck him to the heart with his Boar ſpear; whereupon, commanding the huntſmen to bring him away, he returned home, where at firſt he diſcovered not his intent to <hi>Melania;</hi> but night being come, and they together in bed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his diſcourſe with a ſigh, and ſaid unto her: Madam, it is with extream grief, that I deſire you to conſider the reaſons I bring for to induce you no longer to keep me heer. We are not born for our ſelves, much leſſe for pleaſure and idleneſſe, nor is a man to put on arms for once, and ever after to let them hang ignobly ruſting: The greateſt Knights that are, have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like my ſelf, but their love never kept them from ſeeking adventures in the world; contrarily, they have rendred themſelves famous by an infinity of enterpriſes atchieved by the ſole remembrance of their Miſtriſſes; ſweet Madam give me this power, permit me to raiſe my name with your praiſes, and that I may make the world ſay, how France produceth excellent war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and incomparable beauties; you ſhall have a ſhare in my triumphs, and when you ſhall hear the greatneſſe of my acts reported, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thouſand times more contentment, then that you can expect from my ſtay. I ſpeak not thus, becauſe I am weary of your careſſes, they have too much charm and delight in them; but truly mine honour will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to give the beſt part of my daies to reſt and eaſe; for ſo ſhould I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſelf the fable of the world, whereas I ſhould deſire to be the wonder of it.

Alas! ſaid <hi>Melania,</hi> I feared nothing in the world ſo much as this diſcourſe, the doubt whereof, hath many times interrupted the pleaſure I took in you. What do you think will become of me, for can I live without a ſoul? Ah no, dear heart, I cannot, your departure will procure my death, as your coming prevented it: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, I cannot blame you, your reaſons appear moſt juſt unto me, and though my love cannot allow of them, yet I muſt needs confeſſe, that you ought to live for glory, and not for pleaſure. Why will not you then, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ſuffer a little, ſince it is for my good? My weakneſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, will not permit me ſo to do; howbeit, ſeeing reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I will reſolve my ſelf for it: Go then when you pleaſe, I will ſeek for conſolation in my patience, in the praiſes which I ſhall hear publiſhed of you, and moſt of all, in the promiſe you have made me to return hither again another day. But alas, I fear, and with reaſon, that your merits, which make you ſo lovely, will furniſh you with as many Miſtriſſes, as you ſhall meet with fair women, and that you will utterly forget me.

purpoſe, your beauty may well aſſure you againſt this fear, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my diſpoſition will keep you from beleeving that ever I can be ſo far ingratefull: If I am much indebted to the favour you have done me, I muſt add to that account as none of the leaſt, this laſt reſolution of yours, wherein I find as much love as courage, and from thence draw upon my ſelf moſt powerfull obligations to make me deſpiſe all kind of objects for your ſake.</p>
                     <p>Accompanying theſe words then with a world of kindnes, he ſomewhat pacified the grief of this poor afflicted creature, but her ſorrows renewed when ſhe ſaw her ſelf alone in bed, and that ſhe conſidered how her Lover was arming himſelf to be gone, whereupon not enduring the place, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to enjoy the ſight of him as long as poſſible might be, ſhe preſently got forth, covered only with a little cloak, and went to the chamber where our Knight was, and would once again have bid him adieu, howbeit not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak but with ſighs, ſhe let him go to horſe, ſomwhat pleaſed, yet in her diſpleaſure to have ſeen a few tears on his cheeks as aſſured teſtimonies of his grief ſo to leave her, and returned to her bed, where the memory of the pleaſures ſhe had there formerly enjoied refreſhing her torment, ſhe continued a long time weeping, whileſt <hi>Alcidamant</hi> followed his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>This generous warrior being alone was no doubt very ſenſible of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he had left at Maran, but on the other ſide it gladded him aſmuch, that he was at liberty, and bethinking him of the time which he had unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſpent, it vexed him to ſee how little he had done in the commencement of his chivalry, nevertheleſſe he comforted himſelf with the reſolution to do ſuch deeds of arms as ſhould deface this fault, and give occaſion to all the world to talk of him. Travelling then with this intention, he beſtowed all the reſt of the day without meeting of any adventure, and at night took up his lodging in a village, where being at ſupper a yong Squire came in, and with a very ſad countenance deſired entertainment. As God help me, ſeid he moved with pity to behold him, your affliction diſpleaſes me, and if you will acquaint me with the cauſe of it, I will gladly indevour to aſſiſt you if you have need of my ſuccour. Sir, ſaid the Squire, your good will doth much oblige me, but alas! it brings me not the ſatisfaction I deſire, and which I cannot hope for but from heaven: If I be greeved it is with a great deal of reaſon; for having to day loſt my maſter, one of the beſt Knights in the world, I can never look for any contentment heerafter. By what misfortune did you loſe him, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant?</hi> Through the treaſon of a wicked villain, anſwered the Squire, who cauſes a bridge to be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome three leaues hence, for to ſurpriſe a Knight, from whom it ſeems he hath received ſome diſpleaſure, but others that come there are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his trechery; for aſſoon as ever any one is advanced upon the bridge, he makes the barrier by which he entred, to be ſhut upon him, and ſtraightway he is oppoſed by fowr ſtrong Knights, who ſtop him from paſſing on, till ſuch time as another, that I aſſure you is very valiant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, comes and joins with them to combat him if he will not render up his arms. My Maſter unluckily arriving there, went in boldly never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of any ſuch matter; but he had not made twenty ſteps when the Knight of whom I laſt mentioned, came againſt him, &amp; threatned him with preſent death if he would not yeeld himſelf to priſon. What do you talk
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17218:126"/>
of death and priſon to me, anſwered my Maſter? By my life you ſhall not triumph ſo eaſily of me, and as long as I am able to weild a ſword, no man living ſhall command my liberty. Saying ſo, my Maſter having given me his lance, becauſe the Knight was without one, couragiouſly drew his ſword, and not to uſe many words he began a fierce combat with him, who behaved himſelf, marvellous well, both in defending and charging my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that ſurpaſſing him in valour, had brought him to an ill paſſe having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready drawn bloud from divers parts of his body, when as thoſe that guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the barrier advanced, and having charged him altogether, overthrew him from his horſe, manacled his hands, and caſt him into a dungeon, with a reſolution to plague him thorowly for the pain he had put them unto: now becauſe their meaning is not to take any but Knights, they preſently turned me out, and told me that I was ſet at liberty in hope I would find our ſome valiant man or other for to deliver my Maſter out of their hands; but they ſhall miſſe of their purpoſe, for I will never make the misfortune grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If we venture nothing, ſaid <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> what can we do worthy of commendation, and if glory be not to be acquired by common adventures, we are without fear to attempt ſuch as are dangerous? wherefore, honeſt youth, never trouble your ſelf for me, nor enquire whether I can, or cannot; the order I have received obliges me to this deſign, which I will execute without you, conducted thither by ſome other, howbeit if you love your Maſter, I know you cannot ſtir a foot till you have made this journy. My pity of you, ſaid the Squire, drew me to give you this advice, but ſeeing you have ſo much courage as to contemn it, I will not fail to be your guide. Whereupon bidding him good night, he retired, leaving <hi>Alcidamant</hi> with an extream deſire to break ſo pernicious a cuſtome.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17218:127"/>
which we laid our nets. At theſe words, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was aſſured, that this cuſtom was eſtabliſhed for to take away his life; and obſerving the Knight well, he perceived that it was <hi>Narſander</hi> the inchanter, which having made him draw his ſword, he advanced to him with this ſpeech: By heaven, traitor, thou ſhalt not eſcape me now, neither ſhall the power of thy friends avail thee, for it is more then time to make thee give an account of all the wickedneſſe that thou haſt committed. Wherewithall, he diſcharged his ſword ſo furiouſly upon his ſhield, that he divided it in two, the point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of lighting with ſuch v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe four Knights exceedingly vexed to behold their Maſter in that caſe, charged <hi>Alcidamant</hi> all at once, making no queſtion to ſubdue him with eaſe; but he deſpiſing their aſſauits, which made not ſo much as any print upon his arms, began a moſt dangerous bickering with them; now he gave a down right blow on the head of one, by and by he ran ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clean thorow the body; howbeit, not having room enough to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, his blows fell not half ſo ſtrongly as otherwiſe they would have done, inſomuch, that the combat endured longer then he defired; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, growing into choler to ſee <hi>Narſander</hi> come again to himſelf, and offer to ariſe, he beſtirred himſelf ſo terribly amongſt his enemies, that with the firſt blow he diſcharged he cut one of them in twain, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent the arm of another to the earth. This expedition had amazed them, and they were even upon the point of betaking themſelves to flight, when as <hi>Narſander</hi> joined with them, charging <hi>Alcidamant</hi> very fiercely; who becoming more furious by the reſiſtance he found, ſtruck one of them with ſuch force, that he clave him down to the very teeth, thereby ſo terrifying thoſe which remained, that <hi>Narſander</hi> began to flie one way, whilſt the Knight laboured to ſave himſelf by another. <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who cared for nothing but to diſpatch this inchanter, followed him cloſe, and cried to him: Turn about, traitor, and adde not cowatdiſe to ſo many thy other vices; nevertheleſſe, he ran away ſtill, ſtriving to get the Caſtle on his head, for to ſhelter him from that furious tempeſt; but the Knight held him ſo to it, that entering in at the firſt gate, he diſcharged ſuch a terrible blow on him behinde, as having made him a wound on his ſhoulder half a foot deep, he laid him once more on the earth, where inſtantly going with a reſolution to take off his head, and about to unlace his helmet, he beheld a reaſonable handſome gentlewoman, and of a gracious preſence, make haſtily towards him, who falling upon her knees, ſaid unto him: Excellent Knight, have pity, I beſeech you, on me, and for her ſake whom you love beſt in the world, grant me the head of this Knight whom I ſee in your power. As I live, ſaid he, Madam, he doth not deſerve ſuch grace, but you ſo ſtraitly conjure me, that I may not refuſe you: howbeit, I muſt have the naughty cuſtom that is kept heer abrogated, and you ſhall preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the priſoners which are in your cuſtodie. My Lord, anſwered the gentlewoman, I confeſſe with you, that <hi>Narſander</hi> is be to blamed for many of his actions, and you may be ſure, that it is a grief unto me to ſee him live in this manner: But alas! my condition doth not permit me to diſpoſe of it otherwiſe, and my love to him makes me deſire his welfare.

Commanding then ſome of her ſervants to open the dungeons, they brought forth above forty Knights, who preſently departing, went pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the valour of this Knight of the Palms, in ſo many places, that all France reſounded again with the report of his famous deeds; onely the Squires Maſter remained behinde, in regard that <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> obſerving his gallant diſpoſition, had intreated him to make himſelf known to him.

If ever you have loved, you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture how great my ſorrow was, ſeeing all my hopes ſo fruſtrate; truly it was ſuch, that no whit reſpecting my life, ſince I was not pleaſing to whom I adored, I reſolved to appear no more before her; and ſo one morning I departed, with a purpoſe to undergo things impoſſible for a man to perform, to the end I might free my ſelf from farther languiſhing; and indeed, I never complained of the rigour of my impriſonment, from which you have delivered me, in hope that death would give an end to all my troubles.

What a weak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah <hi>Clariſtea!</hi> my anger ſhould make me happy, it ſhould make me forget you, ſo to deliver my ſelf out of the pain wherein I am, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not to think of you, but to hate you, ſeeing you take the courſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do me: But alas! it is not in my power, my deſires are tied to my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; I love my miſery becauſe you are the occaſion of it, and ſhall never reſolve for hate, as I do for patience: Live then, as you pleaſe, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, or inclined to favour me; alter your minde, or perſevere in your purpoſe to deſtroy me; I will never breathe, but for you, nor ſhall my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be beſtowed any other where. So, concluding to die, rather then to be wanting in loialty, he was deviſing ſome way how he might come to ſee <hi>Clariſtea</hi> again; when as a great noiſe made him give ear to certain voices he heard; but ſuddenly remembring, that the Moon ſhone clear enough to let him ſee what he deſired, he abandoned the ſhadow of thoſe trees, and got him into the midſt of the high way, where he perceived three Giants coming on, which ſeemed three towers, leading five or ſix damſels bound, who crying to heaven for help, filled the air with their complaints.</p>

This object amazed him, and if he had been armed without doubt he had ſet upon theſe Giants, although he had been ſure to die for it, but having not ſo much as his ſword about him, he returned inſtantly unto the trees with a reſolution to follow and ſuccor thoſe afflicted women aſſoone as ever he was armed. Concealing himſelf then under a walnut tree he patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to paſſe by, but he was marvellouſly aſtoniſhed, when as they were juſt againſt him, to hear the voice of his fair Miſtris amongſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their lamentations, and obſerve the very garments, as he thought, which ſhe wore the day he parted from her. Either I am enchanted ſaid he to himſelf, or I ſee <hi>Clariſtea</hi> a captive. Ah beauteous miſtris!

Wherupon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his curtelax he attended <hi>Florimonds</hi> approach, and ſeeing him come running at him with his lance in his reſt, he thought to have ſlipt aſide and cut it in two, howbeit he was not ſo quick but that he was ſurprized and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with ſuch force, as he was fain to recoil two or three ſteps back for to ſave himſelf from falling, which put him into ſo great a fury, that curſing his Gods, he advanced to cleave him in twain. But <hi>Florimond</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to fight with judgement and not with paſſion, lightly avoided the blow and letting it fall to no purpoſe, gave his enemy ſo home a thruſt under the left arm, that it entred three fingers deep into his body. When as the Giant beheld his armor all beſmeared with bloud he was ready to burſt with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and rage; and lifting up his heavy curtelax, he laboured to let it deſcend on <hi>Florimond,</hi> who knowing that death attended on that weapon, ſomtimes leapt aſide, and ſomtimes ſlipt under his enemies arm, ſo making it ſtill to fall in vain. This combat growing more cruell and furious, through the force and dexterity of theſe warriors, it continued ſo long till the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Alcidamant</hi> came galloping to them, who ſtaying to behold the fight <hi>Florimonds</hi> Squire ſaid unto him: Alas Sir! you ſee not the worſt of the adventure in this combat, two monſters like to this heer, have carried away certain Ladies who are ſure to be raviſhed by them, without your aſſiſtance.

By heaven ſaid he, aiming the point of his lance at this Giants throat, I will be as good as thou art wicked; this ſteell ſhall be the death of thee, that art ſo baſe as to go about to raviſh a woman that infinitely deſerves to be ſerved. How now, ſaid this proud Giant, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou offer to diſturb me from enjoying a pleaſure, wherein I placed a ſovereign happines. By all my Gods Ile teach thee better manners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit thy death no longer then to the firſt blow I ſhall give thee: whereupon drawing out his curtelax he thought to divide the Knight of the Palms in two peeces, but he was turned aſide to receive the encounter of the other, who having tied thoſe damſels to the foot of a tree, ran furiouſly at him with his lance charged. Their encounter was dangerous, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſtoniſhed had much ado to keep his ſaddle, but he more fortunat paſt his lance quite through the body of his enemy, who was overthrown dead in the place, and that in good time; for the firſt Giant arriving the mean while, gave him ſo terrible a blow, that it made his head bow to his ſaddle bowe: great was the pain that he felt therby, but raiſing up himſelf more furious then ever he had been in all his life, he gave his enemy ſo dangerous a ſtroak on his ſhield, that his arm being too weak to ſuſtain the brunt of it, carried it to his head with ſuch violence, that it made him knock his chin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherupon the Giant entring into extream rage, would have cloſed with his enemy, but the point of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damants</hi> ſword made another deep entrance into his body, ſo that not able
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17218:129"/>
to get within him as he deſired, he had recourſe again to his cimiter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he laid about him more dangerouſly then before. This while the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell who had ſeen her ſelf ſo neer to be raviſhed was got up, and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound her companions, was fallen on her knees, heartily praying unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to aſſiſt their Knight; and beginning to be in ſome hope by the death of the firſt Giant, and the bad eſtate whereinto the other was reduced, ſhe obſerved this valiant Knight of the Palms, admired his addreſſe and force, and comparing him to God Mars, it begot a well willing in her towards him, which by little and little converting into love, made her wiſh him the victory, that ſo ſhe might be liable to a recompence. Have you ever, ſaid ſhe to thoſe that accompanied her, have you ever ſeen a Knight fight with more grace? and who could imagin that a Giant ſo dreadfull ſhould paſſe by the ſword of one man alone? It amazes me, and the danger I was ſo lately in keeps me not from conſidering this combat with pleaſure; ſee you not his ſtrange force, and that he never gives blow in vaine; but eſpecially mark his addreſſe, he diverts his enemies ſtrokes, wiſely avoids the edge of his curtelax, and when he is ſurpriſed he ſeems a towr that contemns all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, no travell wearies him, he appears ſtronger then he was but now; briefly I obſerve in this Knight all that is moſt commendable and rare in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This beauty ſpeaking thus in the behalf of this warrior, fell inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in love with him, rendred the fear of her companions much leſſe, and made them hope for ſpeedy ſafety: The mean while <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and the Giant hewd one another, and each of them deſiring the victory entreated his adverſary as hardly as he could; howbeit our champion ſeemed to have the better; for the Giant grew more unweldy, and the great quantity of bloud that iſſued from his wounds made him ſo weak that his blows were not diſcharged with that fury as at the beginning of the fight, wheras <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damants</hi> courage augmented every minute, which put the Giant into ſuch an exceſſe of rage, that reſolving either to die or preſently to vanquiſh, he took his curtelax in both his hands thinking therwith to cleave the Knight to the very teeth, but <hi>Alcidamant</hi> making his horſe to leap aſide the weapon did only whiſtle in the air; and becauſe the Giant had emploied all his ſtrength on this blow, he bowed forward even to his horſes mane, at which very inſtant of time <hi>Alcidamant</hi> having his ſword aloft let it fall with ſuch fury juſt on his neck, as he divided his head from his body, to the infinite contentment of theſe damſels, who fell on their knees before him. Valiant Knight, ſaid the fair damſell, you have done miracles for our deliverance; but you ſhall not loſe the glory of it, for we will publiſh over all France that you are the braveſt gentleman that this day bears arms. Lady, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he having cauſed her and the reſt to riſe, you may do and ſay what you pleaſe, but the recompence already exceeds the pains. I have freed you, I ought to do it, and I do not think I have any way obliged you; wherefore your acknowledgement me thinks is to no purpoſe, let us therefore leave ſpeaking of that, and go to ſee the end of a combat wherein a Knight is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, with whom I was lodged when you paſt by the village, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovering you before me generouſly began the fight. On my faith, ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> thereupon, I doubt of ſome ill news from him, for his Squire comes galloping heer, and I fear he is ſlain. Now God defend, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> howſoever we muſt reſolve for patience: then meeting the Squire, he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Florimond</hi> was the victor, but had loſt ſo much bloud that he was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17218:130"/>
not able to ſit his horſe, nor likely to live if he were not quickly aſſiſted. Take my Squire with you, and get him to be carried to the village where we lay, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and ſend with all ſpeed for the beſt Chyrurgians of the Country; as ſoon as I have placed theſe Ladies in ſafety, I will come and look to him my ſelf, for his valour deſerves this care. He intreats you, ſaid the Squire, to have as much pity of his ſufferings, as of his life, and to indevour to make his Miſtris more tractable. His Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> is ſhe one of theſe Ladies? It is that fair one which ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Whereupon, having diſpatched away <hi>Arnides</hi> with <hi>Florimonds</hi> Squire, he returned to <hi>Clariſtea</hi> (ſo was that Lady named whom the Giant would have forced) and having ſecured her againſt all fear which ſhe might have conceived, he walked along fair and ſoftly with her towards a houſe which ſhe had ſome two leagues from thence.

That you will love me, ſaid he, and that taking pity of my pain, you will not make me languiſh in the expectation of that I ſo infinitely deſire.

In good faith, ſaid he, I ſhould wrong my ſelf if I did, for my carriage then would give me the lie, and much more to diſguiſe my ſelf to you, upon whoſe aſſiſtance I reſolve to place all my hope. <hi>Melita</hi> (ſo was ſhe called) you beleeve that I am infinitely in love, it is true: But alas! it may be I am ſo unhappy, that I am not beloved again; for I fear left the excellencie of my Lady, and my little merit, ſhould reſtrain her from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remedy to my ſufferings: Dear friend, it lies in you to oblige me as much as my life comes unto. And how, ſaid this wench, who ſeemed to underſtand him? By being my advocate to <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> anſwered he, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that favour for me, which may mitigate my pain, and render my love everlaſting. I did not think, ſaid <hi>Mileta,</hi> that my Miſtriſles beauty had wounded you, and that you had ſighed for her; but I will no longer doubt it, now that I have ſuch teſtimony of it from your ſelf. You crave my aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you ſhall have it, and I promiſe to contribute as much to your ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as poſſibly I may, being perſwaded that I am obliged thereunto, by the good office I received from your valour, when as you delivered me, with my Miſtris, out of the power of theſe dreadfull Giants, where we were ſure to have loſt both honour and life: But what ſhall I demand for you? That ſhe will do me the favour to receive me into her chamber, ſaid he, at ſuch time as all the world is at reſt, that I may repreſent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my affection unto her, ſeeing that the arrivall of ſo many perſons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17218:131"/>
that continually come to viſit her, will not permit me to talk freely with her. You demand very much, ſaid <hi>Melita,</hi> for the knowledge of this action, could not but redound to the prejudice of her honour; nevertheleſſe, I will labour to ſatisfie you, and ſhewing her how ſhe oweth all that ſhe hath to your ſuccour, I will oblige her, if I can, not to refuſe you ſuch a grace; live then in this hope, and in the mean time be patient. Beleeve me, <hi>Melita,</hi> ſaid he, kiſſing her more affectionately then ſhe expected, your ſervices ſhall not be without recompence; go and make good your promiſe, whilſt I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſelf with my thoughts. Saying ſo, he entered into an arbour of Iaſemines, raviſhed with the apprehenſion of a happineſſe, which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to injoy ere long; and <hi>Melita</hi> went directly to <hi>Clariſtea's</hi> chamber, who withdrawing thither, a little after made her unready to go to bed; whereupon, <hi>Melita</hi> ſaid unto her, being aſſured that ſhe ſhould pleaſe her extreamly in talking to her of her Knight; Madam, the honour you have done me, by freely imparting your ſecrets unto me, obliges me not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my thoughts from you: walking but now in the garden, I found your Lover in a caſe that made me exceedingly to pity him; his arms acroſſe, his hat over his eies, wherein I eſpied ſome tears to ſtand, his pace full of ſtops, which, with a thouſand ſighes, teſtified a marvellous diſtemper of minde; I approached to him, gueſſing well enough what might be the cauſe of this his behaviour, but making as though I underſtood it not, I demanded from whence it was derived; from my fear not to be loved as I love, anſwered he; and if I do not the ſooner finde relief in my paſſions, my life will quickly be at an end. Then he declared unto me, that his grief proceeded from the want of liberty, to diſcover unto you what lay upon his heart, as he wonderfully deſired; and finiſhing his diſcourſe with a ſigh, he conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to be a ſuiter for him, that you would be pleaſed to let him come and ſee you this evening, to the end he may have the felicity of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your beauty at the full, as likewiſe be free from all interruption in his talk: now it is for you to reſolve, whether you have love enough to grant him this favour. <hi>Melita,</hi> anſwered ſhe, a little troubled, thou knoweſt too well that I love him infinitely; but how can we bring him hither, without fear of incountering ſome body that might diſcover our ſecrets; I ſee no likelihood thereof, and leſſe yet, when I conſider, that he hath not bought ſo much grace with the price it ought to be rated at; me thinks, it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with empty hands, but would well conſider the time, the places, and the perſons. Whereupon, going out, ſhe left <hi>Clariſtea</hi> ſtrangely troubled; ſometimes reſolving to conſerve her ſelf, and then by and by, not to loſe ſo favourable an occaſion, which is not to be recovered, when it is once paſt. This while <hi>Melita</hi> entertained <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and leading him by the hand, ſhe ſaid unto him: Sir, I am carrying you to <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> but rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That ſhall I never be, anſwered he, but by the fruition of ſo many beauties as I behold: Ah Madam, take pity of my ſuffering, opportunity ſpeaks for me, and ſeems to ſay that you are not to deny me this favour; whereupon, laying his mouth to hers, he was faſtned there for a while, with ſuch extream delight, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear putting his hand on her delicate breaſt, with the exceeding ſmooth whiteneſſe whereof, he was marvellouſly taken; and finding himſelf in caſe not to ſtay there, he ſlipt off a night-gown that he had on, and getting into bed, he made her feel incredible pleaſures in looſing the name of maid. The firſt courſe being finiſhed, ſhe began to ſigh, and ſaid: Alas! I was reſolved to defend my ſelf better, but, Sir, accuſe your merits for this weakneſſe, and take not occaſion thereupon, to make the leſſe eſteem of me; I have given you that which was moſt dear to me, preſerve it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, with as much love as diſcretion. Aſſure your ſelf, Madam, ſaid he, redoubling his courſes, that you ſhall never ſee me diſobey ſo ſweet a commandment, and that I will never loſe the memory of ſo powerfull an obligation; but in the mean time, permit me, I pray you, to viſit you thus every night. You ſhall alwaies have as much power of this chamber as my ſelf, anſwered ſhe, nor ſhall it be at any time ſhut againſt you, onely remember to carry your ſelf adviſedly. Continuing their kiſſes thus, they perceived the day to appear, whereat they were grieved; but hoping to meet again ere long, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> returned to his chamber, and left <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> who finding her ſelf weary, ſlept till dinner time; when as ſhe was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by her chamber maid, who bidding her good morrow, fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaid: Madam, is this Knight as couragious with women, as he is valiant amongſt Giants? Come, you are jeering now, ſaid ſhe, whereas you are guilty of that fault, for if you had ſtaid heer, I ſhould have had no cauſe to complain of his boldneſſe. That is no anſwer to my queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Melita,</hi> for you deſired to be forced I know, but do you hold him worthy of your favours?

Whereupon <hi>Alcidamant</hi> being paſt into his Ladies Cabinet, and <hi>Arnides</hi> into his maſters chamber, <hi>Clariſtea</hi> went to receive her kinſwoman, giving her a thouſand thanks for the pains ſhe had taken to come and viſit her, and commanding the table to be covered again, ſhe gave her all the beſt entertainment ſhe could. Whileſt ſhe was at ſupper <hi>Clariſtea</hi> calling to mind her Lovers behaviour, very attentively obſerved the Marchioneſſe, and ſeeing ſome remains of beauty yet abiding in her, ſhe was not without ſome unquietnes, inſenſibly ſuffering her ſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that ſhe had ſome intereſt in her Knight, and that the only cauſe of her journey thither was to ſee him, ſo ſhe wiſht her far enough off, and was vexed in her mind to hear her ſay that ſhe would ſtay nine or ten daies in that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce: but not to appear incivill, ſhe made no ſhew of it, hoping to learn the truth from her Lovers own mouth: deſiring then to free her ſelf of ſo weighty a care, ſhe conducted the Marchioneſſe to the chamber which ſhe had cauſed to be made ready for her, and telling her that the conſideration of her health invited her to bid her good night, ſhe left her, and went to find out her Knight, whom ſhe preſently kift, but in ſuch a manner as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſome diſcontent, which very much troubled <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to ſee her melancholy, demanded of her why ſhe was ſo ſad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot wholly enjoy you, anſwered ſhe, for the fear you are in to appear before the Marchioneſſe of Monteclare, who makes ſhew of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that ſhe may the better without ſuſpition ſee you, hath, to ſpeak the truth, much diſtaſted me. I love you too well, for to let any other ſhare with me; I love you too well, dear heart, to poſſeſſe you by halfs, ſeeing I am entirely yours. If you will remember my careſſes, and call to mind with what a heart I have received you, how I have contemned all men to love you only, doubtleſſe you cannot ſigh for any other, ſince I live not but for your content. Alas Madam! ſaid he holding her in his arms, permit me to tell you, that your complaints are without cauſe, and conſider what wrong may be done one out of a ſuſpition not rightly grounded. You imagine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17218:132"/>
that I love the Marchioneſſe of Monteclare, I confeſſe I do, but in ſuch ſort as a ſon ſhould love his mother, ſhe hath brought me into the world, and I ow her as much aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ction as is due by nature to parents. And if I do not appear before her, it is becauſe I will not be conſtrained to abſent my ſelf from you, and quit the deſire I have to follow arms; nevertheles ſince ſhe hath reſolved, as I am informed, to abide heer with you ſome time, I think it fit for me to depart before day, and beſtow my ſelf elſwhere whilſt ſhe continues heer, that I may not be hindred in my deſigns. You make me wonder, ſaid <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> to hear you ſay that the Marchioneſſe of Monteclare is your mother, and I ſhould hardly beleeve it, but that I am confident you would not take pleaſure in deceiving a maid that loves you ſo much. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> give credit to my words, for I honor you too much to tell you an untruth; but if you would be further ſatisfied therin, talk with my Squire about it, to whom I have not ſpoken ſince ſupper. I deſire no better aſſurance, ſaid <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> then your proteſtation, but pardon me, ſweet heart, I pray you, for love is ever accompanied with fear, and my diſtruſt was rather a ſign of paſſion, then weaknes. I am not offended with it, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and though I receive great contentment in knowing my ſelf to be your kinſman, yet is it much more ſatisfaction to me that I enjoy your favour, which I will alwaies preſerve with the uttermoſt hazard of my life. If my love could augment, ſaid <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> this new tie of kindred would add unto the glory of it, but it is at the heighth of its perfection, and cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be greater. Whereupon getting to bed they renewed their delights with ſuch amorous dalliance, that the day ſurpriſed them before they were aware, which made <hi>Alcidamant</hi> take leave of his Miſtris, ſo that retiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber, he armed himſelf, and mounting his horſe, he left both her and his mother, who was afterward wonderfully joifull when ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> that the Knight of whom ſo much was ſpoken of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout France, was her ſon.</p>

This Lady wonderfull well ſatisfied with two courſes luſtily performed, ſuffered him to arm himſelf, and having advertiſed him that <hi>Narſander</hi> was not yet returned home, ſhe counſelled him to get forth into the court aſſoon as he heard a noiſe, and not to let himſelf be aſſaulted in the chamber. This done, ſhe went unto the towrs, and cauſed only fifteen Knights to advance, which heard by <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> he drew out his ſword, and covering himſelf with his ſhield, he got him into the Court, cleaving the head of the firſt in two pieces. At this blow the reſt which were ſcattered before, cloſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly together, but this incomparable warrior flying amongſt them, cut off the arm of one, ſent the head of another to the ground, and kept them in ſuch aw that the hardieſt man amongſt them durſt not approach him; the rumor of this fight ran over all the Caſtle, whereat the reſt deſcended, and encompaſſed <hi>Alcidamant</hi> with incredible fury, but he that grew every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more couragious and ſtronger cut them in pieces, and made ſo great a ſlaughter of them, that ſome of their bodies ſerved him for a bulwark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violence of the reſt. Night arriving thereupon, the ſervants of the place came running in with a number of torches, by the light whereof the battell renewed ſo dangerouſly, that above twenty men were in leſſe then an howr laid dead on the earth, whereby the reſt were terrified in ſuch ſort, that they betook them to their heels for to eſchew the mortall blows of this invincible Knight; who finding no enemy to oppoſe him, went out for to go directly to the ſtable, howbeit meeting a great Knight upon the bridge that would not ſuffer him to paſſe, he diſcharged ſo furious a blow

Having travelled then certain daies without the incounter of any adventure, worthy of his courage or my relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſaw himſelf at the ſea ſide, much grieved in that he could not find a veſſell to imbarque himſelf in, nevertheleſſe hoping that the winds would drive ſome one or other upon that coaſt, which ſeemed to be much frequented, he rode along by the ſhore till the evening, when as he met with two damſels, wherof one of them bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed her ſelf even to the pommell of her ſaddle, out of an extraordinary reſpect in ſaluting him, and ſaid: Noble Sir, what do you heer? I hoped to have found a barque, anſwered he, and was reſolved to paſſe the ſeas for to have ſearched in forrain Countries ſuch adventures, as of late are not to be encountred in this Kingdome; but my ill fortune will keep me heer for want of accommodation that way, ſo that I am conſtrained to go even as my horſe pleaſeth to carry me. If you will promiſe this damſell a boon, and me another, ſaid ſhe, we will ſoon furniſh you with a ſhip, that ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you ſafely whitherſoever you will go. In good faith, ſaid he, that is the greateſt pleaſure can be done me, wherefore I will promiſe you any thing you ſhall deſire of me. Let us deſcend then to the foot of the rock, ſaid the damſell, that we may loſe no time. I beleeve, anſwered he, you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well what you ſay; for what ſhall we do at the foot of the rock, ſeeing I can diſcern nothing proper for our voiage. Do not you trouble your ſelf for that, ſaid ſhe, you ſhall not loſe your labour. Whereupon leading the way, ſhe was followed by the other, <hi>Arnides</hi> and <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who when he came down, was marvellouſly abaſhed to ſee a great Dragon upon the waves, whoſe wings were extended, as it were to receive the aſſiſtance of the winds. Behold, ſaid the damſell, a veſſell fit for your purpoſe. God refuſe me, ſaid <hi>Arnides,</hi> if ever I come neer it; Ile rather return again into my mothers womb, then bury my ſelf in the intrails of this creature. How now, ſaid the damſell, laughing at the fear he was in, will you be more faint hearted then I, and fear a danger which I will paſſe thorow? Not more faint hearted, ſaid he, but wiſer, and more adviſed then to caſt my ſelf away after

your example; do or ſay what you pleaſe, you ſhall never perſwade me to be ſo deſperat; and if my maſter will be ruled by me, we will ſoon take a ſafer courſe. <hi>Alcidamant</hi> who took exceeding delight to hear him talk thus, and that was well aſſured this veſſell was made by enchantment, ſaid unto him; Wilt thou forſake me then <hi>Arnides?</hi> That I will, ſaid he, rather then die in this faſhion; for I pray you tell me, what glory is there to be gotten by putting our ſelves in the claws of this Dragon? Let us go away, Sir, and leave theſe women heer, which are alwaies more ready to deceive Knights, then to ſuccour them in their enterpriſes.</p>
                     <p>Thou art in the wrong, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for women have no malice in them. No have, anſwered <hi>Arnides</hi> in choler, what ſay you to her that put you t'other day in the hands of your enemy; truſt them not too much, I beſeech you, for if we are to beware by other mens harms, we are to make uſe of our own not to fall into the miſchief we have once avoided. It is true indeed, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> that a woman brought me into the danger wherof thou ſpeakeſt, but a woman alſo was the cauſe of my deliverance: you are rather to thank your own handſomnes for that, which charmed her, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Squire, then her good nature; for if you had wanted that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by my faith I know how it had gone with you. What, ſaid the damſel, ſhall the fault of one naughty one, make all others guilty? It is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ſaid <hi>Arnides,</hi> but alwaies note this, gentlewoman, that we uſually mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt a naughty generation; and talk as much as you will, I reſolve never to lodge my ſelf there. And for my part, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> I purpoſe to queſtion the entring into it no longer, for I will not give that offence unto theſe Ladies, as to doubt either their goodnes, or good will; whereupon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her unto whom he had ſpoken, by the hand, he paſt along upon the neck of the Dragon, who held it ſtretched out upon the ſtrand; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf preſently in one of the richeſt chambers that ever he had ſeen, he ſtood a good while obſerving a thouſand rarities, which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his view; but miſſing <hi>Arnides,</hi> he mounted upon the wings of this dragon for to call him, where he ſaw him ſtamp with his foot on the ground and liſtning to what he ſpake, he heard him ſay, Well it is all one, if I do caſt my ſelf away now, I ſhall not need to fear another time: whereupon croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf three or fowr times, he was about to have thrown himſelf into this Dragons throat, when as he ſaw him plunge his head into the water, and ſo vaniſh away in an inſtant.

Oh! that ſo great a Knight ſhould be thus caſt away by the inſtigation of a woman, after he had proved the malice of ſo many. Accurſed ſex! that bringeſt forth nothing but miſchief, I utterly deteſt you all, and I proteſt never to look upon you more but with hatred: well did my fear preſage this unlucky accident, and how much wiſer was I then my infortunat maſter, that hath loſt himſelf by contemning dangers? But what ſay I wiſer? No, I am far more unhappy then he; I remain in the miſeries of the world with juſt occaſion to lament all the daies of my life: he is now in the Elizian walks, where ſouls enjoy a ſweet and pleaſing reſt: I muſt follow him into the ſame tombe, and pertake the felicities which he finds in his new life, as I was ready to ſuffer with him all the pains and miſeries of this. With theſe words he was caſting himſelf into the ſea, when as he beheld a burning rock come out of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17218:135"/>
calm waters, the top whereof ſerved Love for a throne, who leaning upon an armed man ſeemed to draw his power and glory from him. Three maids of marvellous beauty appeared ſitting at his feet, one bearing his bow, the ſecond his arrows, and the third a multitude of hearts in her lap. Twelve Syrens, guided by <hi>Neptune</hi> drew him, a little eſloigned from the rock; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the which were two Tritons, who ſeemed to publiſh the greatnes of this mighty God. This wonder arreſted his fury, and ſuffered him not to put his purpoſe in execution; but that which moſt troubled him was to ſee his maſter in the middle of the flames of the rock, and to hear him call him. The ſame weaknes which made him fear the teeth of the Dragon, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to enter into the fire, he was ready to run away when as he fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Heerat all fell a laughing, eſpecially the damſell, who perceiving it to wax dark, furniſhed the table with exquiſit meat, and having ſatisfied their ſtomacks therwith, ſhe and her company retired, leaving the Knight to take his reſt. Certain daies being ſweetly paſt in this maner, the rock ſtaid in a port of Greece, to the infinit content of <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave glorious marks behind him there of his incomparable valor.

We ſhall not paſſe heer without combat, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant.</hi> No doubtles, ſaid one of the damſels that followed him; for to that end only we brought you hither, and the boon which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me, is to deliver my miſtris out of the power of the great <hi>Ariſton,</hi> one of the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My miſtris doth not love him, becauſe he is very ill favoured, and of an inſupportable humour, but in regard ſhe could not be rid of him, ſhe made him undertake this enterpriſe for the glory of her beauty, hoping that the Princes of Greece, who are not far off, would deliver her aſſoon as they heard of the violence that is offred to her will; and indeed ſhe was ſending me to ſeek the gallant baſtard of Media, or the good Knight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, but a woman that very much loves her, and that may juſtly vaunt to have excellent skill in Art Magick, counſelled her to ſend me into France, to finde out the Knight of the Palms, and to obtain a promiſe of whatſoever I ſhould demand of him; and now behold, the enemy is before you, nor is it ſo neer night, but that you may well have time to exchange ſome blows with him; do not then I beſeech you, defer the effect of your promiſe, and make it appear that we have not made choice of you but out of a confidence of your valour. I am very glad, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> that I may acquit my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17218:135"/>
ſelf by obliging you; and if the ſafety of your Miſtris doth depend on me, be aſſured that I will ſoon reſtore her into her own power. Heerwith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his lance he approached his enemy, who ready to meet him encountred him ſo furiouſly in the midſt of the courſe, that he made him loſe his ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, but his fortune was worſe, for he was thrown from his horſe, making two or three turns on the graſſe, that was bedewed with his bloud, which iſſued out of a great wound given him by <hi>Alcidamants</hi> lance on the right ſide; howbeit nothing amazed for this hurt, he aroſe more incenſed then ever he was in all his life, went to his adverſary whom he found alighted, becauſe he would not combat with advantage, and gave him ſo terrible a blow upon his ſhield, that his arm unable to ſupport the fury of it was fain to yeeld, whereby it fell with ſuch violence on his helmet that he was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſtonied therewith, which put him into ſuch a rage that claſping his ſword faſt in his hand, he diſcharged it ſo mightily on his head that he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his helmet, razing both the hair and skin. This ſo dangerous a blow made the great <hi>Ariſton</hi> to ſtagger, but being as couragious as poſſibly might be, he renewed the fight with ſo much valour, that he made it continue two howrs to the great amazement of <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who confeſſed that he never met with ſo ſtrong a man before. The time and the deſire to vanquiſh ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their blows ſtill more redoubtable. The ground was ſtrewed with peeces of their arms, and if the bloud iſſued from <hi>Alcidamants</hi> left arm, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſton</hi> loſt his out of five or ſix places, whence it proceeded that being much weaker then at the beginning of the combat, he could not ſupport the fury of a blow which his enemy gave him on the head, but tumbled down dead cloven to the very teeth. This victory gave no leſſe contentment to <hi>Cilina,</hi> the damſels miſtris, then glory to the Knight of the Palms. They ſaluted one another, he ſatisfied with her beauty, ſhe with his exceeding valor. But as they paſſed thorow the forreſt to ſeek out ſome village, that they might lodge more commodiouſly then in the wood, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> heard the voice of a perſon complaining, which carried him preſently into the thicket, where he beheld a furious Giant whipping of a damſell that was tied to a tree, ſo cruelly, as the bloud trickled down from all the parts of her body. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bject provoking him to no leſſe rage then pity, he drew out his ſword, and diſcharged it with ſuch force on the Giant, that he made him ſet one knee to the ground; howbeit ſuddenly riſing up he began a dangerous combat, which nevertheleſſe laſted not long; for <hi>Alcidamant</hi> being in a rage cut his arms into a thouſand pieces, and finally gave him his diſpatch with a blow that opened him from the ſhoulder to the very ſtomack, and taking off his head he gave it to the Lady for whoſe ſake he had made the firſt combat, deſiring her carry it to Conſtantinople, &amp; preſent it from him to the Prince of France, with the relation of all that had happened upon occaſion of that quarrell, which ſhe very willingly undertook. Departing then from the Knight ſhe uſed ſuch ſpeed, that ſhe arrived within two daies after at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, and went unto the great Hall of the Palace, where finding a number of gallant Knights, ſhe demanded which was the Prince of France. I am he, ſaid <hi>Lucendus,</hi> moſt ready to ſerve you if you have occaſion to uſe me. Excellent Prince, anſwered ſhe, the neceſſity of no misfortune hath brought me hither to deſire your aſſiſtance, but I come with a preſent to you from the Knight of the Palms, one of the beſt without doubt now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the world. Whereupon turning about to a Squire that followed her,

This good Knight not able to endure ſuch wickednes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed the Giant, who for that his revenge was diverted, grew inſolent and mad, threatning to cut him in a thouſand peeces, and ſtruck him ſo furiouſly on the head, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himſelf then in this ſort, and beſtowing not a blow in vain, I ſoon ſaw this great maſſe of fleſh opened in five or ſix places, and the graſſe all died with his bloud, which made me admire the valour of this Knight, who fought with an admirable grace, and ſeemed to recover new forces with time, nothing moved with the fury of his enemy, who deſpairing of ſafety took his huge curtel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Imagine I pray you, what extremity I was in ſeeing my ſelf on the ground; truly, I thought I ſhould die no other death: but the Knight of the Palms arriving therupon, delivered me inſtantly from that fear; for having taken his ſword in both his hands, he diſcharged it ſo furiouſly upon the Giants ſhoulder, that he cleft him to the very waſt. This victory giving me no leſſe content then it did him glory, we rode on, I being mounted on the damſels horſe, becauſe mine was ſlain; howbeit this valiant Knight having underſtood from me what I told you but now, returned preſently to the place of the combat, cauſed that French damſell to be interred, and committing the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants head unto me, deſired me in recompence of the ſervice he had done me, by freeing me from the captivity of <hi>Ariſton,</hi> to come and preſent this head unto you, and aſſure you that you ſhall never m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How came they by their ends, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant.</hi> By the greateſt treaſon that can be imagined, anſwered the Squire, and no man breathing could poſſibly avoid ſuch a like miſchance, unleſſe he had warning of it. They went out all four out of Conſtantinople, ſome three dayes ſince, with a purpoſe to ſeek ſuch adventures, as may give reputation unto men, and had the ſame day a dangerous combat with four other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17218:137"/>
Knights, the honour whereof was ſo generouſly diſputed, that the night ſurprizing them, they retired with equall advantage into a wood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to finiſh their battell the next morning aſſoon as they could ſee; but having ſtrange viſions, they aroſe all at one inſtant, and taking their horſes, they followed the firſt way that they met withall, which led them at length to a houſe about ſix miles hence; where, as they were going in, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of a wicked damſell, who pretended to do them honour and ſervice, they fell into certain foſſes, from whence they cannot hope to be redeemed, but by death. Truly, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> though I hold the miſhap of theſe Knights to be ſo great, as to oblige you to bewail them; yet you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour their deliverance, and not ſtand vainly complaining in this manner: Go back, I pray you, and guide me, for I will either die, or ſuccour them. Now God vouchſafe to proſper ſo great a deſigne, anſwered they, falling on their knees before him, and reward the good you intend to theſe Knights: Come, Sir, we will moſt willingly conduct you, but beware of thoſe falſe bridges, which overturn aſſoon as one ſets a foot upon them, leſt you be overtaken, as our Maſters were. Ile take as good heed as I can, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> but in the mean time let us make haſte, leſt the night prevent us in our enterpriſe: Whereupon, ſetting ſpurs to their horſes, they rode ſo faſt, that in an hour they diſcovered the Caſtle; whereinto as the Knight was about to enter, he heard one call to him; looking therefore all about to ſee who it might be, he perceived in the way that he came, the damſell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantreſſe, who had brought him out of France; whereof he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, and turning about to meet her, he ſaid: In good faith, ſweet heart, your abſence hath much troubled me, but now I am well ſatisfied in this your return. It is in good time for you, ſaid ſhe, for you are underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a moſt dangerous adventure, which you cannot eaſily accompliſh without my help; ſhun the great gate of the houſe, as theſe Squires have adviſed you, for otherwiſe all the world ſhall not be able to deliver you out of captivity; enter in at a little wicket you ſee on the left hand, leave the ſhield you bear, and make uſe of this at my ſaddle bow; be ſure you part not from the ſame Ring which was given you, when you fought the firſt combat for <hi>Melania;</hi> yeeld not to the intreaty, tears, nor ſighes of any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whatſoever; and above all things, make much of the new ſword, which ſhall come to your hand, for it is the beſt on the earth, and without it you ſhould never ſee an end to the adventures which are to befall you. This ſaid, <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> having curteouſly thanked the damſell, took the ſhield which ſhe gave him, whereupon there was no figure preſented; and alighting from his horſe, with his ſword in his hand, he drew towards the wicket, which he ſaw ſtood open; when as a damſel iſſuing out of the Caſtle, ſaid unto him: Knight, whether run you ſo, and why do you uſe your arms, where you ſhall be gladly entertained with all reſpect? Sheath up your ſword, for heer is none that means to oppoſe you; and not to diſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate your ſelf with ſtooping at the wicket, take the way that leadeth to the great gate, where you may enter at pleaſure. Yes, no doubt, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> if I would make you ſport with a leap; I am too well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of your villany, and if you get you not packing the ſooner, I will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take your head from your ſhoulders, to revenge an infinite number of good Knights, which you have betrayed under colour of giving them fair entertainment. What, ſaid ſhe, ſtepping in again, do you threaten me in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17218:137"/>
mine own houſe? Come, come, my maſters, cut me this raſcall in pieces, and revenge me of his inſolence: Herewith, <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> being in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle yard, heard a great noiſe, and ſaw thirty armed men come forth, who ſuddenly incompaſſed him about, and endeavoured to ſmite him to the ground; but this incomparable warrior, nothing amazed, ſet upon them ſo furiouſly, that at three ſtrokes he laid three of them ſtretch'd along upon the earth, and preſſing in amongſt the reſt, he cut off the arm of one, and the leg of another, cleft the third to the teeth, divided the body of the fourth in two pieces, and made ſo great a ſlaughter, that his very enemies wondered at it, and came no more neer him but in fear; which ſo incenſed the Miſtris of the houſe, that opening an iron door, ſhe let forth two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, of twenty foot in length, and twelve in heighth, and of ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhape, that they would have daunted the moſt aſſured courage of the world: Theſe Monſters being at liberty, began to run up and down the Court, and meeting with thoſe Knights, cruſh'd ſome of them between their teeth, and tore the reſt with their claws; In the mean time the Knight of the Palms, who could hope for no better uſage, making towards one of them, whilſt the other was ſucking the bloud of thoſe he had ſlain, by good fortune gave him ſuch a thruſt in the flank, that he ſheathed half of his ſword within his body; which made him ſo mad, that lifting up his tail of ten foot in length, he let it flie at the Knight with ſuch violence, that he laid him on the ground three ſtrices off, and opening his fearfull jaws, was like to have ſwallowed him; if, retaining his judgement amidſt the danger, he had not thruſt his ſword into his throat, wherewith he gave him a wound as great as the former, and overthrew him dead in the place. This blow coming in ſeaſon, the Knight got ſuddenly up, and taking his good ſword in hand again, which the Serpent, in the pangs of death, had made him let go, he ran preſently towards the other, and diſcharged ſo weighty a blow upon his head, that he made him ſink to the ground; but the ſcales being hard, the blade rebounded in the air, as if he had ſtruck upon an anvill; with this, the Serpent ſhewing his bloudy teeth, came fiercely upon him, and put him in ſuch diſtreſſe, that he was about half an hour, ſhifting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the one ſide, and then on the other, to ſhun the fury of the beaſt; but thinking that he muſt either die, or inſtantly vanquiſh, and remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had not found the belly of the other ſo hard as the ſcales of this, he thruſt him into the flank with ſuch fury, that his guts came forth with the ſword, which put him into ſuch a rage, that making a number of horrible leaps, he filled the air with a moſt dreadfull noiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Knight judging this to be the ſtroak of death, withdrew aſide to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent further inconvenience, and wiping his ſword in the graſſe, thought to have reſted himſelf, when it came into his mind that glory is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired but in the finiſhing of an enterpriſe; wherfore ſeeing a great pair of ſtairs he ran couragiouſly up, and finding a door open entred into a great H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

very waſt. This happy blow reviving his forces, he began to lay about him on all ſides, and bare himſelf ſo generouſly, that in three howrs he put them all to the ſword, howbeit ſo wearied, that if the night had not come to give him leave to breath a little, he could not have paſſed on to undertake any further combat. Remaining then ſomewhat amazed in the dark, he ſtood leaning a while upon the pomell of his ſword, but hearing no ſtir in the Hall, he ſate him down upon the pavement, where the pains he had taken would have invited him to ſleep, but thinking it not ſafe to reſt in ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a place, he continued as a man that looks every minute to be aſſailed by his enemy. Having been three howrs and more in this eſtate, he beheld five or ſix damſels come in, with each of them a torch in her hand, whereof one, which ſeemed to be <hi>Clariſtea,</hi> ſaid unto him: How now dear heart, can you be ſo neer me, and never deſire to ſee me? truly I have great cauſe to complain of you, and to ſay that all my careſſes have been very ill imploid. Pardon me, Madam ſaid he riſing up, Ignorance muſt excuſe my fault, for to tell you true, I thought you to be rather in France then heer. We have been taken, ſaid ſhe, by a Magician, and are ſo reſtrained, that we ſhall never get hence, if you do not give us the Ring, wherwith you undid the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Narſander.</hi> Be aſſured, Madam ſaid he, then remembring the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels advertiſement, that I will deliver you if I can, but it may not be this way; for if the Ring were once off from my finger we were in danger to abide heer till Doomſday. Out upon thee, baſe fellow, ſaid ſhe, doſt thou refuſe me ſo ſmall a matter, having given thee all, thy death ſhall revenge this ingratitude? With that thoſe damſels ſeemed to be ſo many fantoſms, who with their torches laid ſuch heavy blows upon <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> that he was much troubled; but that which troubled him and vexed him was, that he felt his armor as hot as if it had newly come out of the forge: not knowing then what to do, he whirled about his ſword, and defended himſelf the beſt he could, but all his addreſſe was in vain, his force ſerved to no purpoſe, and he had no hope but in his courage, which carried him skirmiſhing all the length of the Hall to the door, where thoſe damſels went out, before the which as he was taking new counſell, a great Giant preſented himſelf, who ſtriking him on the ſhoulder with his club, made him fall on his hands to the ground, but he quickly got up again, and with his ſword diſcharged ſo furious a blow on the Giants ſhield, that he parted it in two, giving him a great gaſh in the arm. The combat growing very fierce, all the Caſtle rang with the violence of their ſtroaks, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> made uſe of his skill with judgement, the Giant emploied his ſtrength. If the one ſtruck, the other had his anſwer ready, each of them redoubted the blows of his enemy, and though the torches of the fantoſms, who had ranged themſelves round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Hall had given no light, yet the fire which flew out of their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, was able to make them ſee where to place their blows. This terrible combat having endured above two howrs, <hi>Alciadmant</hi> who was diſpleaſed with ſo long a delay, took his ſword in both his hands, and let it deſcend with ſuch fury, that he had cleft him to the ſhoulders, if it had fallen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Knights intention, but turning in his hand, and ſtriking but with the flat, it broke in five or ſix pecces to the extream diſcontentment of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant;</hi> nevertheleſſe the ſtroak was ſo violent, that it overthrew the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the ground in a ſwown: The Knight, who deſired to make uſe of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſeeing his enemy ſenceles, went to diſarm his head, and with his own
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17218:138"/>
ſword to ſeparate it from the body, when as thoſe fantoſms came about him with much more noiſe and din then before. The Knight ſtood amazed at this charge, and thought himſelf now loſt, having not wherewithall to defend him, howbeit caſting his eie all about, as if he would ſeek for ſome place of refuge, he eſpied a tomb raiſed in the midſt of a chamber, which ſhewed it ſelf on the left hand, wherupon there lay a yong gentleman thruſt thorow with a ſword, thericheſt one of them in the world; now finding himſelf oppreſt by thoſe furies, which would not let him reſt, he went cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly in, and laying hold on that fair ſword, he drew it forth without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulty at all, which gave him ſuch content, that immediatly he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Hall, and would have run in again amongſt thoſe fantoſms, but they preſently vaniſhed, as fearing the keeneſſe of that rich ſteel; which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant</hi> ſeeing, turned to the Giant being yet in a trance, diſarm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Truly, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> wondring much at his beauty, I am ſorry that he is not, as I fear, capable of ſo ſmall a grace, your merit being worthy of a far greater. I humbly thank you, ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for I am confident he is not dead, and that ſhortly we ſhall ſee him thorowly recovered. But Sir, ſince you have granted me one boon, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you refuſe me not another. That will I not, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for there is nothing in my power which is not at your command. Theſe Sir, ſaid he, are powerfull obligations: now what my further requeſt unto you is, I will let you underſtand, when you have reſted your ſelf a little in my chamber, whilſt I give order for the recovery of this Knight, who kept me not heer, but with an intent to oblige me, although his firſt reſolution was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life. Do what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and I ſhall gladly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond you in ſo charitable an office. Then giving the Giant air, he revived preſently, and riſing up humbly excuſed himſelf to the Knight of the Palms, whom he adviſed to unarm, the better to refreſh himſelf, but he would not by any means yeeld to it till the arrivall of the damſell, which accompanied him, and that ſhe ſhould authorize him thereunto, by aſſuring him there was nothing further to be feared. Having at length then unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, but not willing to go to bed, becauſe it was yet fair day light, the Giant was intreated to ſet at liberty all ſuch as were impriſoned in the Caſtle, which being done, there came forth above fowrſcore Knights, who wondring at the horrible ſlaughter they beheld in the Court, as well of the men, as of the ſerpents, whoſe deformity they admired, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Knight of the Palms, no leſſe taken with his goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then with his unmatchable valour in ſo tender yeers, and beſought him ſince they had their liberty by his means, that he would be pleaſed to command them ſomething. I will not diſpoſe of you otherwiſe, anſwered he, but if you will take the pains to paſſe by Conſtantinople, when you go hence, and preſent your ſelves on my part to the fair Queen of France, you ſhall do me a ſingular pleaſure.

Truly gentlemen, ſaid <hi>Aleidamant,</hi> bowing himſelf down for to kiſſe their hands, and wondring to ſee them ſo bravely accompliſhed, I am more glad of your ſafety, then of the glory I have acquired by this adventure, and ſhould be very ſorry to injoin you ſo long a voiage, knowing well that your deſigns are all warlike, and that you would not willingly return to your friends, becauſe you would not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from your enterpriſes: I will lay this charge upon ſome other, and do earneſtly intreat you to command me ſomething, out of this aſſurance, that I am a Knight wholly devoted to your ſervice. Theſe ceremonies are to no purpoſe, ſaid the damſell that conducted <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> you muſt defer them till another time, and rejoice now at a ſecret you are ignorant of. Do you know that gentleman, pointing to him that <hi>Alcidamant</hi> had found lying on the tomb; no ſurely, anſwered <hi>Perſides.</hi> I doubt not of it, ſaid the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for he knows not himſelf, nor hath not known hitherto, that he is ſon to the puiſſant <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, and the beautifull Empreſſe <hi>Niquea;</hi> but it is time to acquaint him with it, that the glory of his predeceſſors may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him deſirous to be ſuch as they have been, and greater too, if it may be. He was taken away, as you have heard, when he was in his cradle, and the intent of his raviſher (who is this Giant heer, named <hi>Dorion)</hi> was to prevent the deſtruction of the altars of his Gods, which muſt be overthrown by the valour of this gentleman, how beit they that have taken upon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the houſe of Greece, have not only preſerved him in the midſt of his enemies, but have changed their minds, and have purpoſely brought hither this famous Knight (caſting her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Heerwith thoſe fowr Knights went and ſaluted <hi>Amadis,</hi> who exceedingly well ſatisfied with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his eſtate, very kindly returned their complements with the like. Whereupon <hi>Amadis,</hi> who would loſe no time, leaving all the reſt of the company, went and kneeled before <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and deſired him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the boon which he had promiſed him. Ask, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and you ſhall not be denied. Make me then inſtantly Knight, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> and give me leave to depart to morrow for to begin to imitate you. Moſt willingly, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and beleeve it I may boaſt then, that I have made one of the beſt Knights in the world. But how will you do for arms? We ſhall find ſome in the tomb, ſaid the Giant, which are worthy of ſo generous a Knight, and though I give them ſomewhat unwillingly at this preſent, yet I am perſwaded that one day they will much avail me: howbeit Sir, we ſhal have need of your aſſiſtance for to get them out.

                     <p>That powerfull Demon of our ſouls, Love; deſiring an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from me, as from all other men, made me caſt mine eie, ſome two yeers ſince upon a damſell, queſtionleſſe poor (if that which Fortune gives may be called treaſure) but extreamly rich, if grace and beauty ought to take place of ſuch periſhable things: I loved her, finding her worthy of my affection, and reſolved, without ſticking at the conſiderations of thoſe that are too much carried away with avarice, to marry her; howbeit, deſirous to know whether her diſpoſition would well accommodate with mine; meeting her upon a time with ſome Gentlewomen of my acquaintance, I gently told her, that Fortune had done her much wrong, but withall, that her merits were of power to win upon ſome, who were able to right her, provided ſhe could be contented to imbrace a fair offer. Her anſwer was very modeſt, and ſuch as I could wiſh for, letting me know, that ſhe had ſo much underſtanding, as not to refuſe the honour would be done her, nor be in ſenſible of a benefit, I ſoon made an end of giving her all the reſt which I had of power over my ſelf: after that time I went to ſee her at her fathers houſe by his permiſſion, but my viſits were not frequent, to take away all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition from my mother, whoſe covetous diſpoſition would have had more wealth, and leſſe merit; nevertheles provoked by my deſires, I made often uſe of the night to conceal my deſigns. Every day added ſome grace or other to ſo many beauties; for unwilling to ſee her in a habit unworthy of my love, and knowing that her fathers ability would not extend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on her all that I thought neceſſary to adorn her, I liberally imparted of mine own unto her, inſomuch that my affection ſeemed to augment with

time, and indeed I had no felicity but in the ſight of her. Feeling then my flame continually to encreaſe, I would fain have obtained ſome further grace of her, and authoriſed it with the faith which ties men in marriage, but ſhe wiſely repreſented unto me, how that was the way to run inſenſibly to her undoing, and utterly to ruine her under colour of her good. My love was violent, I confeſſe, and my paſſion poſſeſſed me with deſires that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully provoked me, but this government of hers ſo pleaſed me, that I blamed mine own impatience, in ſtead of accuſing her of having too little reſentment. Wherefore being infinitely ſatisfied with this modeſty, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to wait upon time, ſo that whenſoever I ſaw her it was with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that if ſhe had had judgement enough to have diſcerned her own good, ſhe was obliged to prefer my affection before any Princes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: but alas! this vertue is rarely incountred amongſt women, and ſeldom do they make the beſt choice, ſhe receives the viſits of another, fairer indeed then I, if the features of the face be more to be regarded then the vertues, and good preſence of a man, but much leſſe accompliſhed and rich, if I may ſay ſo without vanity. I obſerved the actions of this maid in regard of the intereſt which I pretended to have had in her, and all the ſpeeches which ſhe uſed to this new commer I conſidered in my mind, from thence to draw infallible conjectures of my fear or hope, ſo that within five or ſix daies, I found that the beauty of this minion, called <hi>Cli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And indeed he followed her to a little country houſe of her Fathers, where this gallant left him; having uſed means to make him drunk, and ſo got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I am not able to declare the havock which this Giant made when he awaked, and ſaw himſelf couſened in this ſort, but going in a rage to an old Inchantreſſe of his acquaintance, unto whom he diſcourſed the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, ſhe came ſome fowr months ſince into this country, and finding <hi>Clidor</hi> and this falſe <hi>Argenia</hi> in the grot together, ſhe inchanted them after a very ſtrange maner: She made them ſtrip themſelves ſtark naked, and putting great whips into their hands, left them with an extream deſire to ſcourge one another therwith, which they put in execution moſt cruelly. Eight howrs at a time they abide in this exerciſe; at the end whereof they give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and fall a railing for the cruelty they uſe upon each other. This is the puniſhment inflicted on them, wherewithall the Giant not being ſatisfied, hath ſworn not to ſpare a woman he can find; and accordingly he remains heer in this Country with two other Giants, no leſſe great and formidable them himſelf, and aſſoon as he catches any he carries them to the grot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowrs them before <hi>Argenia's</hi> face, and then takes off their heads from their ſhoulders, in revenge of the deceit which this falſe one practiſed on him. Hence I have taken occaſion not to be curell, though I were abuſed as he was, but to forſake the world, where is nothing certain but grief and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and making a good uſe of my dotage of this ingratefull fair, I have ſet up a bleſſed reſt for my future daies. Without doubt, ſaid the Knight well ſatisfied with this diſcourſe, they which can turn all things to their profit, as you have done, are worthy of great commendation; and I much approve of your reſolution to make Heaven your only object, ſince the earth is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable, and produceth nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit; live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this mind, and never alter it. I hope I ſhall not, ſaid the Hermit; but Sir, the travell you have endured requirs ſome repoſe; go and lie down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bed which you ſhall find in my chamber, and there reſt you for an howr or two, and I will endevour to make you better chear at ſupper. I can not refuſe ſo good an offer, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> though I have an extream deſire to go preſently to the Lovers grot. To morrow, ſaid the Hermit, you may take this journey more commodiouſly then to day; and if the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit which I wear would permit me to accompany you, I would willingly go along to be an ocular witnes of the puniſhment inflicted on this perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous creature, though the eſtate wherein now I am forbids me ſo much as to ſpeak of revenge. You may do as you pleaſe, ſaid the Knight; in the mean time I will follow your counſell, and as ſecure in this little lodging as in the palace of a King, I will go and take my reſt.

Theſe objects full of horror made him reſolve to deliver thoſe two afflicted perſons, and to cut off the courſe of ſuch inhumane cruelty; whereupon he alighted, and couragiouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with his ſword in his hand, he approached unto two great pillars, which ſupported an arch, where hung a Table, on the which was written theſe words:</p>
                     <q>Knight, Enter not heer, if thou be not the chief of the World.</q>

His courage which alwaies augmented in the greateſt difficulties, not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

ſo much reſiſtance, put him into ſuch a rage, that he redoubled his blows, and advancing three or fowrpaces forward, in deſpite of thoſe he ſaw not, he arrived at the entry of the grot, where all this fury ceaſed, but he had not leiſure to take breath after ſo painfull an encounter; for at that very inſtant the Lions ſet upon him, and ſeizing the one upon his ſhield, the other upon his body, laboured to pull him down, howbeit being as ſtrong and luſty as any Knight in the world, he ſuſtained the violence of him that held his ſhield, and with a blow full upon the mane of the other, laid his head in the duſt. Animated with this lucky ſtroak, he ſuddenly turned the point of his ſword againſt the firſt that had hold of his ſhield, and thruſt it ſo ſtrongly into his belly, that he ſent him dead to the ground, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding content to ſee himſelf ſo ſoon delivered from two ſuch mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Seeing the grot then open and free, he would willingly have entred in without further delay, for to have ſeen <hi>Argenia</hi> and <hi>Clidor,</hi> but fearing he ſhould meet there with ſome new occaſion to employ his ſword, he ſat him down upon a ſtone to take a little breath, howbeit the cries of theſe Lovers, which he heard, not permitting him to ſtay long, he roſe up for to go in and deliver them, when as he beheld three dreadfull Giants, who held ſeven damſels tied with cords: calling to mind then that theſe were thoſe cruell men which made ſo great a maſſacre of all the women that fell into their hands, he came preſently to his horſe, got up, took his lance, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Orfuron</hi> (ſo was the great lover of <hi>Argenia</hi> called) he ſaid unto him: Wicked monſter, whither leadeſt thou theſe damſels?

He was wonderfully troubled in receiving the blows of the one upon his ſhield, and warding himſelf from the others curtelax, managing occaſions and time with ſuch judgement, that the braveſt Knights of the earth would no doubt have admired his fight, but thinking that the length of the combat might prove dangerous, although he ſaw his enemies bloud appearing on every part of their bodies, he reſolved to put all in hazard: wherfore taking his ſword in both his hands, he ſtruck one of them in ſuch a terrible maner, that he cut his body juſt in twain, the one half tumbling down on the graſſe, and the other remaining in the ſaddle.

but deſiring to acquit themſelves worthily of their charge, they advanced forward, and kneeling all down, demanded at one inſtant for the fair Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe of the Parthians, and the beauteous Queen of France. We cannot hear you all together, ſaid <hi>Floriſel,</hi> ſeeing you come upon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Speak damſell ſaid he, looking upon <hi>Argenia,</hi> relate unto the Empreſſe of the Parthians the cauſe of your comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then we will give the like audience unto theſe Knights. Sovereign Princeſſe, ſaid <hi>Argenia</hi> then, kiſſing <hi>Richarda's</hi> delicate hands, the Knight of the Roſes, then whom I do not think there is a more valiant under heaven, hath commanded me to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you for to acquaint you with his glory, and my fortunes, which truly rather deſerve pity, then that you ſhould inflict any new puniſhment upon me; for that I did not acknowledge, as I ought, the affection of a Lord, to whom I was greatly obliged. Beginning then the diſcourſe of her love with <hi>Meleander,</hi> ſhe delivered at large the good offices which ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his aſſiſtance, proteſted that ſhe had a full intention to recompence him with what was moſt dear unto her, had ſhe not been conſtrained by a ſovereing power to love <hi>Clidor,</hi> whoſe paſſions were no leſſe violent then <hi>Meleanders,</hi> ſpoke of her incounter with <hi>Orfuron,</hi> of the ſubtlety which ſhe uſed to get out of his hands, of the revenge which he took of his diſdain, and falling upon her deliverance, concluded with the praiſes of <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> whom ſhe placed in the higheſt degree of glory, particularizing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats againſt the inviſible Knights, the Lions, and the Giants, not forgetting the horrible blows which ſhe had ſeen, and diſcourſed in ſuch ſort for the advantage of this warriour, that ſhe made the Princes of Greece amazed, and poſſeſſed them with an extream deſire to know him better. I ſhould blame your ingratitude, and bemone <hi>Meleander,</hi> ſaid the Empreſſe <hi>Richarda,</hi> if I did not think him wiſe enough to lay this fault upon Love, but knowing well, that none can diſpoſe of their will, when that proud tirant of our minds holds them ingaged; I will not ordain you any further penance then that which you ſuffered in the grot, and for this Knights ſake, whom I know not, and to whom I am much obliged without any deſert at all, I remit you to the rights of your freedome, and do counſell you to follow the advice which he hath given you, for the conſummation of your mariage. Madam, anſwered <hi>Clidor,</hi> That is it we deſire, and to effect the which we humbly receive that liberty your Majeſty hath been ſo graciouſly pleaſed to grant us, with a proteſtation to publiſh unto every one both your vertues, and the acts of that moſt renowned Knight of the Roſes. Saying thus, he bowed himſelf even to the ground for to kiſſe her hands, and ſo gave place to the Knights that were to ſpeak unto the Infanta <hi>Fortuna,</hi> whereof one began for the reſt, and ſaid; Mighty Queen of France, I acknowledge that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia's</hi> diſcourſe hath given great content to this excellent preſence, and that the valour of that famous Knight whoſe praiſes ſhe hath worthily publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth deſerve one of the chiefeſt ranks amongſt the beſt Knights of the world; but I am addreſſed unto you by the commandement of another, no leſſe generous and valiant, and that a few daies ſince hath done miracles able to aſtoniſh the whole earth, and to fill this Court with all the joy that can be expected from good news.

Queſtionles, there was reaſon to ſay ſo three weeks ſince, ſaid the Knight; but the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17218:144"/>
is well changed ſince that unmatchable Knight came thither. Being neer to that Caſtle, as I ſaid before, he met with two Squires, that lamented the loſſe of fowr excellent Knights, whom they had ſeen fall into certain foſſes made of purpoſe to entrap ſuch as came that way. He was ſenſible of their complaints, and their tears moved him to ſuch pity, that immediatly he alighted, and with his ſword in his hand entred into the Caſtle, not by the gate of the foſſes, for he had been made acquainted with the deceit, but by a wicket which was on the left hand; his arrivall was encountred with thirty armed men, who prepared to aſſault him altogether, but he quickly made them know that he was incapable of fear, for he couragiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them, and beginning the bickering himſelf, he lais fowr of them at his feet with the fowr firſt blows he gave, which had terrified the reſt, had they not been reſtrained by ſhame in regard of their number. They char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him then with more fury then before, but he fought with ſo much force and courage, that to make ſhort, ſeven and twenty of them paſt by the edge of his ſword, and the other three were in caſe not to ſurvive their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions long, when as a damſell let looſe two furious and very dreadfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, whereof if you pleaſe you ſhall ſee both the greatnes and the form, having brought hither the skins of them ſtuft with ſtraw. Theſe monſters being at liberty ran up and down the court, and finding theſe raſcals flying from their enemies ſword, tore them preſently in pieces, freeing the Knight from all further care of them; but he had little time to breath, for one of theſe horrible beaſts ſet upon him, whileſt the other was devouring thoſe he had killed, and was ready to have ſwallowed him alive, had he not ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his incounter, ſlipping then aſide he let him paſſe by, and upon his turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, thruſt his ſword into his flank, which put him into ſuch a rage, that with a blow of his tail, ten foot long, the Knight was overthrown to the ground, from whence quickly ariſing, he ſheathed his ſword again in his belly, and laid him ſtark dead on the earth. This lucky blow having aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his courage, he intreated the other in ſuch ſort, that within an howr he left him in the like caſe. His deſire to ſee the end of this adventure not permitting him to reſt long, he went up a pair of ſtairs, entred into a Hall, where ſeven furious Savages preſented themſelves, and charged him ſo ſtrongly, that he was ſomewhat amazed with the violence of the blows, which with their clubs they laid upon him; nevertheles he was quit with them, and at length with incredible pain he kild them all: night arriving thereupon gave him good cauſe to fear had he been capable of it, but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in dangers, he leaned upon his ſword, untill ſuch time as he beheld ſix damſels appear, who turning ſuddenly into ſo many hideous fantoſms, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with torches, which they held in their hands, making him ſuffer exceedingly with extreamity of heat in his armour: being much troubled in defending himſelf from theſe ſpirits, he eſpied a very dreadfull Giant come out of the next chamber, with whom he had a dangerous combat, wherein his ſword breaking through the violence of a blow which had laid the Giant on the floor, he entred the chamber, and beholding a ſword, the beſt and richeſt that ever was, in the breaſt of a yong gentleman enchanted on a tomb, lais preſently hold of it, draws it out very eaſily, and returning to his enemy, was about to have taken his head from his ſhoulders, when as the gentleman, of whom I ſpake but now, being freed from his enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, came and with intreaty obtained his life, upon condition that all the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17218:144"/>
priſoners ſhould be ſet liberty, we were then brought out of the dungeons to the number of threeſcore, all deſtined for food to thoſe ſerpents, and as we had leave given us to diſpoſe of our ſelves at our pleaſure, we ſaw fowr brave Knights brought forth of another priſon; the firſt of which, was your grandchilde, <hi>Lucibel</hi> of France, the ſecond <hi>Perſides</hi> nephew to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Emperour of the Perſians, the third <hi>Ruſsian</hi> of Media, and the laſt, <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> Prince of Aethiopia, who the ſame day were entrapped by means of the foſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof I ſpake before.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the good news, which I ſaid but now, would bring ſo much joy to this Court, but this is not all the fruit of the labours of the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knight of the Palms (ſo is that great warrior named, who was the author of our preſervation) for it was known by the means of a damſell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantreſſe, that the young inchanted Gentleman, was called <hi>Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond, ſon to the famous <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece and Niquea, and your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, excellent Queen, in which regard your ſon and his companions made wonderfull much of him, and accompanied him in the ceremonies that were performed in conferring the order of Knighthood upon him, which he received from the invincible Knight of the Palms, <hi>Perſides</hi> gave him his ſword, <hi>Lucibel</hi> his helmet, and <hi>Ruſsian</hi> and <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> the reſt of his arms. Being knighted in this ſort, and all rejoycing with him, and talking of the happy ſucceſſe of this adventure, they ſaw a chariot deſcend out of the clouds, drawn by four Griffons, whereinto the damſell enchantreſſe entred with <hi>Amadis,</hi> and mounting into the air, ſaid that his acts ſhould begin in the Empire of Martaria, a Countrey unknown, it ſeems, to all that live heer. His departure having altered the reſolution of theſe young Princes, they armed themſelves, mounted on horsback, and went away two and two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, leaving the Knight of the Palms; who following ſhortly after, only accompanied with his Squire, commanded us to come hither for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with theſe accidents, and to preſent you with the Serpents from him. Truly, ſaid the beautious Infanta, both your news and you are very welcome, and I would give the beſt town of my kingdom, that the Knight you ſpeak of were now heer; we ſhould then endeavour to acknowledge ſo great a favour, as alſo give him hearty thanks for the head of an inſolent Giant, that ſpoke ill of my Lord the King, which he ſent me the other day; if ever it be our good fortune to meet with him, we ſhall ſhew our ſelves ſolvent for ſuch powerfull obligations: in the mean time, you may aſſure him, if you chance to ſee him, that the Princes of Greece finde themſelves indebted to his valour. Whereunto adde this, ſaid <hi>Rogel,</hi> that all of us will gladly ſerve him, and will ſeek out all occaſions ſo to do. Hereupon, the Knights taking their leave, went away, bountifully rewarded with rich preſents, and all the Princes deſcended into the Palace Court for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the figure of thoſe ſerpents, which appeared wonderfull ſtrange; and cauſing them to be ſet on the gates of the City, they admired the valour of this Knight, whom they knew not, and which in the mean while ſpread his valour in ſo many places, that there was no other talke all abroad, but of him, of the Knight of the Roſes, of the Knight of the Savage, and of the fair Knight, as the onely prime men in the world. <hi>Floriſel</hi> having well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Serpents, was going up again, when as he eſpied a Knight to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive; who alighting, made himſelf known to be the Prince of Aethiopia; that unable to endure ſo long an abſence from his <hi>Polixena,</hi> was returned
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17218:145"/>
for to ſee her, and demand ſome eaſe for his ſufferings. His coming rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole company, and the praiſes of the Knight of the Palms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in his diſcourſe, for publiſhing the marvells which had been acted at the Caſtle of the Serpents, he left ſo good an odour of this warrior, that every one extreamly deſired to ſee him.</p>

Walking then up and down in his chamber, to deviſe ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe proper for his purpoſe, he was above three hours before he could ſettle on any thing that he liked; ſometimes he thought it beſt to ſuffer with ſo much reſpect, as to let his ſilence ſpeak for him, and not he himſelf; then again, he was minded to write unto her, and ſo commit his ſecrets into her hand, fearing his tongue would never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them according to his deſire. At laſt, approving neither of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, he got him forth, to ſeek out ſome diverſions from theſe thoughts; when as Love, who ſeemed to be ſatisfied with his endurings, advanced his felicity at ſuch time as he leaſt expected it. For going down from his chamber into a delicious garden, and falling upon his former ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, he perceived his Miſtris in one of the alleys, who it may be was entertaining her ſelf with the glory of his captivity; the firſt ſight of her made him to tremble, but preſently conceiving that his good fortune had not made him to meet her ſo opportunely in that place without ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, he grew more confident, and ſaid to himſelf: How happily doth occaſion offer it ſelf unto me, and what an errour ſhould I commit to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip it: I was troubled how to come to ſpeak to <hi>Polixena,</hi> and ſee, Love fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me with the means, and preſents her to me alone, according to my deſire; ſhe muſt be ſpoken to then, and acquainted with my thoughts. Whereupon, going to her with this reſolution, he modeſtly kneeled down, and with a charming voice, ſaid unto her: How long, Madam, is it your pleaſure that I ſhall ſuffer? Is my pleaſure that you ſhould ſuffer, ſaid ſhe? Am I the cauſe of your pain? Have I done you any diſpleaſure? Have you found any thing in the innocencie of my actions that hath given you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? No, Madam, anſwered he, but it is your grace that I am ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſuiter for. I muſt know wherein you have offended me, ſaid ſhe ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, before I can grant you any grace, for I do not mean to pardon you, if you have committed any thing that is hainous. Alas! Madam, ſaid he, make not a jeſt of miſerie, all the quiet of my ſoul reſts in your hands, and if I beg for grace of you, I do not preſuppoſe any forgiving offence,

Why do you not repreſſe the inſolencie of theſe paſſions which moleſt you ſo, or why do you not make you ſtrong enough to vanquiſh your ſelf, which all the Knights that have preſented themſelves to the fury of your ſword, could never yet do? Your deſires muſt be confined with diſcretion, and governed by reaſon; but if you ſuffer in ſuch ſort, and are ſo much in love with me, Why do you not ſeek for eaſe and ſatisfaction by the wayes which honour allows you? My will my Lord, is ſubject to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who, I am perſwaded, would not refuſe your alliance; if you require my conſent, I willingly give it you, and do aſſure you, that the glory to poſſeſſe you, ſhall be dearer to me then your Empire. Beautious Miſtris, anſwered he, ſetting one knee to the ground, I could not wiſh for more in this world then you have promiſed me, and the grace which I ſued unto you for, was no other but this which you have granted me. I loved you as much as it was poſſible for one to love a Lady, yet I ſhould never have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my thoughts, had not you authorized me to do it; I complained, but your noble bounty hath relieved me; and if I have cauſe to do ſo again, I will never accuſe you for it, neither ſhall any neglect in me be any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it heerafter; for I will preſently go ſeek the means of my content: but firſt, let me obtain of my faireſt Miſtris, that ſhe will be pleaſed to give me a teſtimony of her love in a kiſſe. The hope which I have, ſaid ſhe, to give you a more ample power over me ere it be long, ſhall ſo far diſpenſe with me, as not to deny you this favour, which is of no little eſteem with me. Whereupon, ſhe joyned her lips to his, with ſuch infinite content to this Prince, that his ſoul was ready to part from him with this kiſſe. <hi>Polixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſeeing him thus tranſported, was exceedingly ſatisfied, knowing that this rapture was meerly an exceſſe of love; but fearing leſt ſhe ſhould not be able to reſiſt her lovers intreaties, if he ſhould beg any further matter, conſidering withall, how favourable the place was to ſuch a liberty, ſhe departed from him, and went to her chamber, leaving the Prince in the garden, calling the trees to be witneſſe of the happineſſe he had incountered contrary to his expectation. Her abſence ſomewhat diſpleaſed him, but remembring the ſpeech ſhe had uſed, he began to think of that which touched him more neerly: Wherefore conſidering how the iron is to bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whilſt it is hot, he went directly unto <hi>Floriſel,</hi> unto whom he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his birth, the change of his religion, and paſſing on to his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto <hi>Polixena,</hi> beſought him not to refuſe him his alliance. Valorous Prince, anſwered <hi>Floriſel,</hi> if your fortune had not given you ſo tranſcendent a greatneſſe to your birth, your vertue would have deſerved more then my daughter; wherefore ſince you think her worthy of you, ſhe ſhall moſt willingly be yours; onely permit me to be ſo good a father, as to know how ſhe is inclined towards you; for though nature hath given me an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17218:146"/>
power over her, yet ſhe will not have me to be a tyrant to her, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her affection in ſo important a matter, and whereon the good of all her future life depends. This anſwer being marvellous acceptable to <hi>Prig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> he gave him a thouſand thanks for the facility he brought to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and proteſting to hold the ſame obedience unto him, which he could attend from his daughter, he departed the moſt contented man in the world. In the mean time <hi>Floriſel,</hi> who held this fortune to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for <hi>Polixena,</hi> conſidering the valour and merit of the Prince, called unto him <hi>Don Rogel, Lucendus, Spheramond, Dorigel, Silvan,</hi> and ſome others, communicated this affair with them, and deſired them to deliver their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therein; they all approved of the match, and <hi>Polixena</hi> being preſent, declared, that after the conſent of ſo many of her friends, ſhe was well pleaſed to lead her life with this Prince; inſomuch, that he being ſent for, they were affianced preſently; the celebration of the nuptials being defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till the fifteenth day after; againſt which time, <hi>Floriſel</hi> cauſed a turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be proclaimed, gave ſafe conduct to all manner of Knights that would come thither, and promiſed one of the richeſt tents on the earth for a prize, to him that ſhould be victour. This fortnight ſeemed ſhort to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all that was neceſſary for the magnificence of a marriage ſo profitable to all Chriſtendom; but too long to theſe lovers, who converſing more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly together then before, it rendred their deſires inſupportable; but ſubmitting to neceſſity, they reſolved to attend with patience that ſo much wiſhed for howr; and in the mean while, they prepared to appear in their higheſt luſtre on their wedding day, wherein thoſe wonders happened, which ſhall be recounted to you in the Chapter following.</p>

The lances brake in a thouſand pieces, and each Knight thought his enemy on the ground, howbeit not one of them ſo much as moved, and all of them paſt bravely on, without ſhew of any the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, for ſo dangerous a ſhock. This incounter having poſſeſt them with aſmuch anger, as the aſſiſtants with wonder, they took new ſtaves, and met one another again with the ſame deſire to vanquiſh, but there was no advantage again perceived on either ſide; and their fortune proving to be equall amongſt them all, they were conſtrained to have recourſe unto the third lances, which being ſtronger then the former, and managed with more fury then before, they were all ſix overthrown from their horſes in ſuch a dangerous maner, that many doubted they had been ſlain: nevertheleſſe, they were ſeen quickly to riſe again with no leſſe rage then ſhame, and drawing out their ſwords they were about to charge one another, when as eight Giants arrived in the place, who ſeeming to be ſo many Coloſſes put the people in a marvellous fright. The inſolence of theſe monſters, that with great cudgels overthrew all in their way to make themſelves a free paſſage, incenſing the Knights, with one accord they ſheathed up their ſwords, and chooſing out the greateſt lances they could find, they oppoſed themſelves to the fury of theſe barbarous men, juſt at ſuch time as they ſaw a big Knight appear in the place, that carried three Roſes in the midſt of his ſhield; by this device ſo famous in the Empire of Greece, and by his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant carriage, he was inſtantly known to be the valiant Knight of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of whom every one ſpake as of the prime man of the earth. <hi>Floriſel</hi> and the Princes of Greece were infinitely glad at the arrivall of ſo braves warrior, aſwell for the deſire which they had to ſee him, as for to know whether his valour did equall his renown. This noble Knight having noted the outragious demeanor of theſe Giants, ranged himſelf preſently on <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſide; and to loſe no time ran with ſuch incredible fury againſt him hapt to be his oppoſite, as he paſt his lance quite thorow his body, ſending him ſtark dead to the ground.

As often as the Giants lifted up their ſwords, it was like ſo many thunderbolts that ſhould fall; and if the Knights had not been agil and quick the fight had not long endured, but their addreſſe made them ſubſiſt, and rendred them dreadfull to their enemies. <hi>Grian</hi> the Savage beſtirred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſtrange fury. <hi>Brandimanda</hi> by little and little triumphed over her enemy; <hi>Silverin</hi> of the deſert, made good his party; the brave Knights of the Serpents fought with an admirable grace, and gave certain hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; but the moſt part of the aſſiſtants had their eies fixed on the combat of the valiant Knight of the Roſes, whoſe ſword ſeemed more heavy to his adverſary, then the fall of a towr overthrown by the violence of the winds.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17218:147"/>
Every one admired his blows; if he ſtruck upon his ſhield, the moiety of it went to the ground; if upon his armor, the bloud ſtraight guſhed out; if fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made him beſtow any otherwiſe, the Giant ſeemed to be aſtoniſhed with ſo fearfull a charge; briefly, every time that he advanced his ſword, they were ſure to ſee ſome abridgement of his daies. <hi>Floriſel</hi> wondred at his fighting with ſuch force, the other Princes did the like; aud all the people ſtood amazed at it. At length the combat having endured two howrs, his enemy was laid along with the violence of a blow, which divided his head in two. <hi>Grian</hi> the Savage deſiring to appear no leſſe valiant, ran his quite thorow; <hi>Brandimanda</hi> diſpatched hers with a dangerous blow in the thigh, and another full in the breaſt; the three Knights of the Serpents took off the heads of their enemies from their ſhoulders; and <hi>Silverin</hi> of the deſert moſt generouſly ranked his in the number of the dead, with a ſtroak that cleft him even to the ſhoulders. This done the three Knights of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents were returning to their firſt place for to renew the combat with <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Brandimanda,</hi> and <hi>Silverin,</hi> when as <hi>Don Rogel</hi> having cauſed ſome of the Giants ſervants to be arreſted, deſired them to ſtay till he had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the intent of theſe inſolent men. At this requeſt ſheathing up their ſwords, they went to a yong Squire, who ſeeing himſelf among ſo many perſons ſpake fearleſly in this maner. The victory which you have gottea to day ſhould not make you rejoice as you do; for of thirteen Brothers, which peaceably govern the redoubted Iſlands of <hi>Barrocand,</hi> the five ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt are yet living, whereof you ſhall find two ſo puiſſant, that they will make you give an account of the lives of theſe whom you behold there laid on the earth. Sirrha, ſaid <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> your threats ſhall not trouble us a whit and if your maſters come, we ſhall receive them otherwiſe then they think for: whereupon turning him to the three Knights of the Serpents, and their adverſaries, he ſaid unto them: Gentlemen, I know you purpoſe to end your difference with the ſword, but the night is at hand, and me thinks, if you hold it ſit, it were more expedient that you ſhould ſhare the honour of the juſts betwixt you (which queſtionlesis equall to you both as yet) then to diſpute it longer; your valour is too well known, for any further proof to be made of it, and the advantage which you ſhould ſeek to get of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would rather be a point of vanity, then a mark of glory. We are wholly at your commandement, anſwered one of the Knights of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, wherefore if our enemies be of our mind, we will ſeparate our ſelves with equall fortune; but I deſire that the conditions of the juſts may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that the Ladies of Greece may carry away the content, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the faireſt of the World. Sir, anſwered <hi>Grian,</hi> we ow as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this great Emperour, and are no leſſe ſervants to the Ladies then you, ſo that we ſhall not be very ſcrupulous to ſign this accord, conſidering how fairly it is concluded: wherupon he turned about for to go and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Knight of the Roſes, but finding him departed he was extreamly diſcontented, becauſe he had not honoured him according to the merit of his vertue; nevertheleſſe hoping to meet him again the next day at the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, he returned to the Palace, where every body was talking of the incomparable valour of the Knight of the Roſes, of the three companions of the Serpents, and their adverſaries, whom they ranked in the number of the beſt on the earth. The Tables having been more ſumptuouſly ſerved, then in the morning, the dancing began in the Hall, whileſt the fair <hi>Polix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena</hi>

This glorious warrior, conceiving that the honour of the turnament conſiſted not in the multitude of men, but in the courage of the Chieftains, made head againſt the Knights of the Serpents, whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour he had admired, and knowing that great trees are not overturned with a little wind, or with one ſilly blow of an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, theſe valorous Knights began to charge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not as in a turnament, but as two, whoſe hatred would be the death of each other. The Knight of the Roſes conſidering that he fought before his friends, who had alwayes ſhewed themſelves inſenſible, did wonders, imployed his ſword with fury, and uſed all the ſleights that are practiſed in combats; but his adverſary was ſo cunning, that if he reached him one blow, he was ſure to receive another, as dangerous and weighty <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

Fowr hours being ſpent, without any ſhew of deſiring to reſt themſelves, the ground was ſtrewed with their armour, the bloud flowed from divers parts of their bodies, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſparkles flew about their ears, and as every one conceived, their forces to be alike, nothing could be expected from their rage, but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and mortall blows. The Knight of the Roſes mad, to finde ſuch reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one man, ſet both his hands to his ſword, and ſtretching himſelf forth upon his ſtirrups, diſcharged it ſo manly on his ſhield, that he divided it in two, the point thereof falling with ſuch fury on his caſque, that he was conſtrained to ſtrike his head againſt the crupper of his horſe, ſo far from himſelf, that the moſt part of the aſſiſtants beleeved he was dead; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he was ſeen quickly to re-ſettle himſelf up, and claſping his ſword faſt in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd, he gave his enemy ſuch a terrible blow, that it ſtruck the Princes of Greece into admiration, making the Knight to bow with his head to the pommell of the ſaddle; ſo aſtonied, that the bloud guſhed out of his mouth and eyes, every one thought him to be neer dead. By my life, ſaid <hi>Spheramond,</hi> this is one of the dreadfulleſt blows that ever I ſaw given; and if the Knight of the Roſes receives many ſuch, without all doubt he is not far from his end. I do not know, ſaid <hi>Rogel,</hi> what wil become of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, I ſee no cauſe the one hath to brag more then the other, for if the Knight of the Palms ſhews ſtrength, he of the Roſes manifeſts but little weakneſſe. As he thus ſpake, <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported with rage to ſee himſelf in the ſtate he was in, flew at his enemy, wherupon, they charged one another more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly then before, inſomuch that ſix hours was paſt, &amp; they never ſpake of reſting themſelves; the more they fought, the more courage and force they ſhewed: Nevertheleſſe, ſeeing the night approach, they redoubled their blows, and little regarding the trumpets, that ſounded a retreat, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued labouring to kill one another. <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> perceiving them to be ſo wilfully bent, deſcended with <hi>Lucendus</hi> and <hi>Spheramond,</hi> deſiring them to part, and become friends for his ſake; but their rage being uncapable of reaſon, they made as though they did not hear him, intreating one another more cruelly then before; howbeit, conſidering that at length they ſhould be obliged to yeeld unto him, they ſtood up in their ſtirrups, and taking their ſwords in both their hands, they diſcharged them both at one time,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17218:150"/>
with ſuch wonderfull fury, that they overthrew one another to the ground at the ſame inſtant, giving great appearance of death in their fall. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident infinitely diſpleaſed the Princes of Greece, who held the loſſe of thoſe Knights to be irrepairable, and therefore went in all haſte to ſuccour them; <hi>Spheramond</hi> to the Knight of the Roſes, unto whom he bore a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inclination, not knowing wherefore, &amp; <hi>Lucendus</hi> to him of the Palms, unto whom he thought he was obliged, when as a damſell appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that addreſſing her ſelf unto <hi>Spheramond,</hi> ſaid thus unto him:</p>

Saying thus, ſhe cauſed <hi>Alcidamant</hi> to be laid upon a blanket, which two Dwarfs carried between them, who retiring out of the preaſe went with him towards the wood, and entred into a ſhepherds cottage, where ſhe loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſo carefully to him, that within two howrs he came to himſelf again; but ſo infinitely grieved in that he had not vanquiſhed his enemy (for he did not know that he was in as bad a ſtate as himſelf) that it is likely he would have advanced his own death, had not the damſell aſſured him of the truth.

This while ſome of the Princes of Greece were imploied in careſſing the brave Knights of the Serpents, which were <hi>Perſides, Lucibel,</hi> and <hi>Ruſsian;</hi> and the reſt laboured to bring <hi>Rozalmond</hi> to himſelf again; who within two howrs being ſome what recovered, and finding himſelf between a pair of ſheets, and not knowing how he came there, he began to deteſt his wicked fortune that had not permitted him to triumph over his enemy. Shall I live, ſaid he, with the ſhame of one vanquiſhed? and that which is more, ſhall I dare to appear before Princes, which never learnt ſo baſe a leſſon? No, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurvive the loſſe of mine honour, and the glory of the combat, which mine adverſary hath carried from me.

There with he was running himſelf upon it, when as he perceived his Father comming in, unto whom his Squire had diſcovered this fury.

abroad to ſee the world a little. Now verily, anſwered the Squire, this is as I deſired, and all the favours that poſſibly might be done me, could not be comparable to ſo ſweet a commandement as this. Arm your ſelf, my Lord, and beleeve it you ſhall not want horſes. Whereupon going to the Stables, he took two extraordinary horſes, and went preſently with them to the place appointed, where <hi>Rozalmond</hi> ſtraightway met him wonderfully well ſatisfied to ſee himſelf at liberty.

Where fore being gotten into a forreſt the way which he took, brought him by that time it was night into a place ſo obſcured by the thicknes of the trees, that he could not ſee a whit, whereby he was conſtrained for fear of falling into ſome precipice to alight, to unbridle his horſes, and to lay him down upon the graſſe in expectation of the next day. <hi>Armazia</hi> comming then into his mind, his paſſion carried him to complain in this maner: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Knight, why doſt thou abſent thee from ſo fair a ſun, to live thus in darknes? The deſire of glory deprives thee of a ſovereign felicity; in the mean time thou doſt nothing that can excuſe thy abſence; one Knight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts thy ambition, oppoſes thy conqueſts, and takes the lawrell from thy head to appropriate it to his valour. It is true indeed that the grief heerof ought to kill thee, but thou muſt live to be revenged, and thou art to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing till that be decided to thy contentment, ſince ſo to do thou haſt abandoned all thy friends. Whereupon his anger increaſing with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that he bore to the Knight of the Palms, he wiſhed for day, that he might go ſeek him out; howbeit as he turned him on the other ſide the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reſt himſelf, he perceived a little glimps of light to ſhoot thorow the trees; at firſt he was ſomewhat amazed, as unable to imagin from whence it ſhould proceed, nevertheles, he preſently ſtart up, and liſtned attentively, but meeting with nothing but ſilence, he went very ſoftly towards certain trees, which Nature had planted in maner of a round, ſo neer together that they even touched one another, except one place which ſeemed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for to give an entrance to this cabinet, and ſaw by the light of a torch two damſels, the one laid upon the graſſe leaning with her cheek on her left hand, which was bedewed with the tears that trickled from her eies, and the other reading of a letter; the noiſe which he made treading on ſome leaves, having eaſily been overheard by her that was reading, ſhe ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, who goes there?

in diſorder, when I thought them moſt ſure; for <hi>Carinda</hi> being every way very amiable, the King fell in love with her, who taking pleaſure in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one day diſcovered himſelf unto her, deſiring ſhe would give him ſome caſe to his pain. She was much amazed with the diſcourſe of this Prince, and her affection to <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> commanded her to return him but a ſharp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; nevertheleſſe conſidering what reſpect ſhe ought to uſe both in her ſpeech and cariage towards him, ſhe modeſtly replied, that ſhe could not be ſo vain as to beleeve, that ſhe was able to triumph over a Prince, who knew well how to vanquiſh his enemies, and not to yeeld to any body, ſo that this demand being but to prove her diſcretion ſhe hoped to make it alwaies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him, that ſhe would never be failing therein. Some would have been driven away with this anſwer, and for ſpite would have diſpiſed a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ingratefull woman, but it wrought a contrary effect in this Prince, who finding more glory in the difficulty, never left praying and importuning; every day ſhe had a Page, letters were continually walking, there was no ſpare of preſents, but firm in her affection ſhe made no reckoning of all theſe things, becauſe ſhe would not offend againſt her Lover. Only one fault ſhe committed, which was that ſhe made him not acquainted with this purſuit; for if ſhe had, without doubt he had proceeded in another faſhion, and never been ſo wickedly tranſported with jealouſie. <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon a time found his Miſtris Cabinet open, chanced to fall upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain papers, amongſt the which by ill fortune were the two laſt letters which the King had ſent to <hi>Carinda,</hi> wherewith he was wonderfully aſtoniſhed. Hath <hi>Carinda</hi> ſaid he, being gone out to walk in the garden, hath <hi>Carinda</hi> intelligence with the King, and doth ſhe thus forget the vowes ſhe hath ſo often made me? Ah I will never indure it, Ile change as ſhe doth, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to love her, I will not be a rivall to him, to whom I am indebted for all my fortunes. And this ſhe ſhall know, that ſhe may not ſay I have left her without reaſon, or that I am ingratefull. In the heat heerof going to his chamber, without any further deliberation, he wrot theſe lines, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the hands of this poor gentlewoman, it ſo afflicted her that ſhe fell into a ſwown, out of the which with much ado being brought, ſhe brake out into all thoſe lamentations which a deceived maid might juſtly make. I had been the ſecretary of her pleaſures, and ſo I was of her complaints, and misfortune; ſhe came to me, and ſhedding a river of tears ſhe obliged me to talk with this faithles man, and fully inform him of the truth of the buſines, but he rejected all that I could ſay, ſhewed me the Kings letters, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he would not be perſwaded that ever it was done without ſome affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on her part, he willed me to tell <hi>Carinda</hi> that ſhe ſhould ſeek her another husband, an anſwer that reduced this poor creature to ſuch diſpair, as aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Court under pretence of going to viſit her friends, ſhe departed out of the Kingdome with me in her company, who could not find in my heart to let her go alone; and ſhe is reſolved to travell every day a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe hath found out ſome deſert to her mind, where ſhe purpoſeth to ſpend the reſt of her life in complaining againſt the ingratitude of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Behold Sir, the occaſion both of the tears which you ſee ſtanding on her cheeks, and of our voiage; ſo that if you had as much pity of her caſe, as you have promiſed me aſſiſtance, you will counſell her to change her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. That I will indeed, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> I will adviſe her unto it, and if ſhe pleaſe to make uſe of me to be revenged of this diſloiall man, that

upon a ſimple ſuppoſition forſakes her after ſuch powerfull obligations, I will promiſe her his head. I do not think ſhe will conſent to that, ſaid the damſell, but of theſe extremities we will chuſe that which ſhall be moſt expedient. Herewith <hi>Carinda,</hi> awaking, was much amazed to ſee ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Knight talking with <hi>Darimella</hi> (ſo was the ſecretary of her love named) but growing ſomewhat more confident, with a pleaſing voice ſhe ſaid unto him: Sir, how came you thus to arrive in a place ſo full of horrour, heer to behold the wretchedeſt maid now living? Fortune, that conducts ſuch as make the ſame profeſſion I do, anſwered he, hath brought me hither, it may be for your good, for having underſtood what cauſe you have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the ingratitude of a man which hath deceived you, I am moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to right you upon him, with his deſtruction.

came to day. Your fair demeanour, anſwered the Squire; obliges me to ſatisfie you in few words; you are in the kingdom of Florertan, neer to the Capitall city thereof, called Valderic; there is no great news ſtirring, for the King by his wiſdom maintains all in peace; as for the occaſion of my journey, I think I ſhall not give you much ſatisfaction in relating it, I am going to ſeek a Gentlewoman of this Countrey, who hath not been heard of theſe two moneths. What is her name, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond? Carin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> anſwered the Squire; as fair as any in this Kingdom, but unhappy, in loving a man, that now dies with grief, for building her diſpair upon a falſe opinion. Explain your ſelf a little, I pray you, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this matter more clearly unto me. That can I eaſily do, anſwered the Squire, <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> and (ſo is he called of whom I ſpeak) loved <hi>Carinda, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> no leſſe affected him, each joyed in the other, and now both expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hour that ſhould fully make up their happineſſe, when as fortune would needs divide two united hearts; the King of Florertan became ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of <hi>Carinda,</hi> ſolicites her a thouſand wayes, by ſpeech, by letters, and by the charms of preſents: Nevertheleſſe, this maid firm in affection to her lover, never yeelds to his deſires, but wiſely defends her ſelf; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſhe kept ſome letters written unto her by the King, rather out of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I am perſwaded, then any inclination ſhe had to cheriſh any thing that came from him; which falling afterwards into <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> hands, rendred him ſo jealous, that without further informing himſelf of the buſineſſe, he ſent <hi>Carinda</hi> word that he would love her no longer; whereat the poor maid fell into ſuch diſpair, as ſhe quite abandoned this Countrey, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt think ſo; for <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> having cauſed her to be ſought in vain, even to the uttermoſt parts of Florertan, it is preſumed that ſhe is not in it. Why does he ſeek for her now, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> ſince he does not care for her? Excuſe me, Sir, ſaid the Squire, he loves her more then ever he did, and her abſence hath made him ſee that he was jealous without a cauſe; for having been ſurpriſed by the King in his complaints againſt the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of women, his Majeſtie aſſured him, that ſhe had alwayes with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted modeſtie refuſed his affection; howbeit, deſiring to be further cleared, preſuming that the King out of his diſcretion, and to preſerve her reputation, might be drawn to make theſe proteſtations, he ſent for an old inchantreſſe, who for a ſumme of money, made him behold in a glaſſe, all the actions which <hi>Carinda</hi> had done in her life; amidſt the which, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but reſpect in the Kings ſuit to her, he condemned his raſh humour, and blaming himſelf for having been ſo credulous and cruell, he wrote a letter full of amorous lines, tending all to asking of pardon; cauſed forty or fifty copies to be made, and giving them to ſeverall meſſengers, he ſent them to all parts of the Kingdom; but hearing no news of her, he had recourſe unto the ſaid inchantreſſe, who told him that he ſhall meet with her at a time when he leaſt hopes for it, and counſelled him in the mean ſpace, to have ſome ſtill watching at the ſea ports; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that amongſt others, I am now going by his commandment to wait there in expectation of ſome good fortune for him that way. This ſaid, he ſpurred on, leaving <hi>Carinda</hi> as much contented, as ſhe had been troubled all the time of his diſcourſe. What ſay you to this, Madam, ſaid <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond?</hi> Do not you beleeve now, that after a tempeſt follows a calm, and that there is no bitterneſſe but is accompanied with ſome ſweet? Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17218:153"/>
ſhe, with a ſmiling countenance, I confeſſe, that the Gods do give us bleſſings after croſſes, and that they recompenſe our miſeries with contentments; but I feel a new care ariſing, and know not how I ſhould preſent my ſelf at Court; for to write to <hi>Cleraſtes,</hi> I do not hold it fit, and ſtill to conceal my ſelf is not the way to my happineſſe: What ſhall I do in this caſe? Madam, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> leave this to me, I beſeech you, I will ſo carry things, that you ſhall have as great cauſe to commend me, and when <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> underſtands of your return, it ſhall be for your glory. By this time, being come to a village, they were kindly entertained by a rich ſhepherd, who having given them a good ſupper, prepared two chambers for them to lie in; but <hi>Rozalmond</hi> having another deſigne in his head, deſired the ſhepherd to ride along with him, and leaving <hi>Artander</hi> behinde him, cauſed him to conduct him to Valderic; where arriving very early in the morning, he went to the Court, and there enquired for <hi>Clera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> who being awake, was informed by his Squire, that a man armed at all points required to ſpeak with him. Let him come in, ſaid he, for he comes not ſo early but upon ſome important occaſion. Whereupon, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond</hi> entring the chamber, and finding <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> out of his bed in his night-gown, he ſaid unto him: Sir, get on your clothes, and, as I am, arm your ſelf, that I may receive ſatisfaction for the wrong you have done <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> in refuſing to acknowledge her for your wife, after you have obtained all your deſires of her under a promiſe of marriage. Alas, Sir! anſwered he, I would to God ſhe were heer, and then we ſhould enter into no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell upon this occaſion; for there is nothing grieves me ſo much, as that I cannot diſcharge my duty in that regard. Are you reſolved to give her all content, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond?</hi> Yes verily, anſwered he, and if you knew what I ſuffered ſince I fell into that fault, you would rather pity then deſtroy me. Follow me then without more delay, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and I ſhall quickly make you happy, ſince you will become an honeſt man, as I was ready to have ſpoiled you, if you had perſiſted in your malice, for <hi>Carinda</hi> is hard by. Is my <hi>Carinda</hi> hard by ſaid <hi>Cleraſtes?</hi> Ah Sir, how am I obliged to you! Come, bring me my clothes, and let one ſaddle an horſe for me. Whereupon, having ſuddenly made himſelf ready, he rode away with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond,</hi> unto whom he gave a million of thanks by the way, and they made ſuch ſpeed, that within five or ſix hours they arrived at the ſhepherds houſe; where at the firſt approach, <hi>Cleraſtes</hi> fell on his knees before <hi>Carin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and made demonſtration of his true repentan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By the faith of a Prince, anſwered the King, your enterpriſe ſeems ſo noble unto me, that I could find in my heart to be one of the party, but that I purpoſe to be the Iudge thereof, and obſerve who ſhall behave him ſelf beſt; wherefore I authorize you to order it as you ſhall think good. The Knights having obtained their deſire, withdrew themſelves, cauſed Liſts to be prepared with all expedition, and giving direction for fitting of their arms, enriching their helmets, furniſhing their horſes, and the reſt of their equipage; they went into their Miſtreſſes, and craved ſome favours of them whereby they might be obliged to combat with the more courage and better ſucceſſe. Each one was well pleaſed, and all in generall wiſhed that the Knight of the Roſes, by every one ſo eſteemed, would make one. The Queen who could not behold him without affection, deſired it much more then all the reſt, and therefore could willingly had intreated him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but not knowing well how to acquaint him with her mind, ſhe was much troubled; nevertheles enforced by her deſire, ſhe called <hi>Carinda</hi> unto her, and making ſhew of intreating her with ſome diſcourſe, ſhe fell to ſpeak of the juſts which were to be made the next day in honour of her nuptials; and demanded of her, as it were by chance, whether the Knight of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would combat in favour of the Ladies of the Court, or of the ſtrangers. Madam, anſwered <hi>Carinda,</hi> I do not think he means to be on any ſide, either in the juſts, or turnament, which are deviſed only by your Courtiers for to ſhew their courage; but if your Majeſty deſire to ſee what he can do, upon notice of your pleaſure, without doubt he will ſoon give your Majeſty that ſatisfaction; and think himſelf happy that he may receive your commands. I would be loath to ſhew my ſelf uncivill, ſaid the Queen, not knowing what quality this Knight is of, but truly I very much long to ſee whether the effect be anſwerable to the bravery of his preſence and demeanour. Madam, ſaid <hi>Carinda,</hi> leave this care to me, Ile oblige him thereunto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado; looking about then, and perceiving him not far from her, ſhe winked to him, whereupon he approaching with a great deal of reſpect unto the Queen, ſhe ſaid unto him: Sir, will you be one of them that runs to morrow? Alas Madam! anſwered he, I am not ſo fortunate to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore have no purpoſe to be of this amorous troop; howbeit
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17218:154"/>
if you pleaſe to command me, I ſhall ſoon alter my reſolution, and obey you. Why then, ſaid the Queen with a little bluſh, I am contented to be your Miſtris to morrow, and to behold you there as my Knight. Madam, anſwered he, bowing himſelf very low for to kiſſe her hands, I ſhall never merit ſuch glory; but ſeeing you are pleaſed to make me capable of it, I wil not refuſe this honour; wherefore you ſhall ſee me there amongſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and if I perform any thing worthy of regard, beleeve Madam, it will proceed meerly from your favour. I am quite of another opinion, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, for if fortune proves contrary unto you, I ſhall attribute it to the defects which every one acknowledgeth to be in me. He would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but the King comming out of his cabinet called him unto him, and not dreaming of his wives deſire, asked him whether he would be of the number of the Combattants. Sir, anſwered he, I might juſtly be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if I ſhould ſit ſtill whilſt others were at ſo noble an exerciſe. I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad of it, ſaid the King, and if you want any thing, you have the power to command it. <hi>Rozalmond</hi> having given him very humble thanks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, leaving the Courtiers wonderfully well contented with this reſolution of his. The next day appearing, the Trumpets awaked the Knights, the town was full of arms and horſes, the place was covered with people, and the chalengers (two of the chiefeſt of the Realm) attended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the preſence of the King, who having made a ſlight dinner, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf at the window, and ſaw that the firſt courſe was much for the advantage of the undertakers, who continuing their victory laid two and twenty Knights on the ground, without ſo much as being once moved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſuch glory that moſt part of the aſſiſtants cried them up already for conquerours. Whileſt they had juſt occaſion to rejoice in their valour, the Knight of the Roſes arrived in the place, with ſo gallant and martiall a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that the people began to clap their hands, as it were congratulating the victory, which he had not yet obtained. The Count <hi>Folſue,</hi> one of the chalengers, took a freſh horſe, and chooſing out a great and ſtrong lance he ran with ſuch a grace that he brake it very bravely in peeces, finding aſmuch reſiſtance as if he had met with a tower, but not able to ſupport the fury of his adverſaries lance, he was overthrown ſo rudely, that he made two or three turns in the duſt, ſo much aſtoniſhed as he was fain to be taken up. His companion having beheld this rough incounter, would gladly have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xempted from his courſe, but not to loſe the honour, which he had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly gained through cowardiſe, he ſpurd on againſt him, breaking as the former had done, and as infortunate as he, was thrown three or fowr paces beyond the crupper of his horſe. Whereupon <hi>Rozalmond</hi> put himſelf in their place, and oppoſing all ſuch as preſented themſelves, he laid eight and fifty on the earth, with ſuch wonder to the King, ſo infinite content to the Queen, and great amazement of all the people, that every one ſtrived who might moſt magnifie him. The King then having declared him conqueror, in regard no man appeared againſt him, the moſt part of thoſe whom he had overthrown ranged themſelves on his fide for to conduct him in triumph to the Palace, when as a damſell preſented her ſelf, accompanied with one of the greateſt and moſt formidable Giants of the world, who making his way as he came, ſaid with an horrible voice: Let no man think to part from hence with the glory of Conquerour, unles he will confeſſe this Lady to be fairer then his miſtris, for otherwiſe Ile put you all to the ſword. Proud

Knight, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> on whom all mens eies were fixed, doſt thou think to perform what thou ſo vainly boaſteſt to do? There is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Knight heer, but can take thy head from thy ſhoulders, whereas thou preſumeſt to defeat them all, as if they were a company of fearfull women, thou deceiveſt thy ſelf inſolent creature; and to teſtifie that we make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of thee, take the field, and let us ſee thy valour, otherwiſe then in bravadoes. O ye Gods! ſaid then the Giant, do you permit one only Knight to be ſo daring as to outrage me with injuries? I vow I wilbe reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on you, and all the aſſiſtance you can give him ſhall not keep him from being cut in a thouſand pieces. Saying ſo, he turned about to take the field, leaving all the aſſiſtants more amazed at <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> confidence, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo dreadfull a monſter. His Courſe was very dangerous; for the girths not being ſtrong enough to endure ſo rude an encounter, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> ſaw himſelf upon the ground, with his ſaddle betwixt his legs; but the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant found himſelf laid in the duſt with a deep wound in his ſide; which poſſeſſing him with more anger then fear, made him riſe much enraged, and charged the Knight ſo terribly, that every minute his death was expected; nevertheles, when they beheld how he diſplaid his force, and that he drew bloud of his enemy, they were of another opinion. His blows were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſuch infinite fury, that the place was ſtrewed with pieces of the Giants armour, and the fire flying out of his helmet and cuirace, made men judge that the Knight would carry away the victory. At length three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an howr being ſpent, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> vext at ſuch reſiſtance, raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his ſtirrups, and advancing his ſword, he let it fall with ſuch ſtrength that he cleft him to the very teeth, ſending him ſtark dead to the earth with no leſſe noiſe then if it had been a Towr overthrown by Lightning. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the people with a world of acclamations extolled him to the heavens, conducted him to the Palace with as much magnificence as if one of their Gods had been deſcended unto them; and leaving him at the feet of their King, who received him with unſpeakable content, they went to make bonefires for joy of the death of this Giant, the ſcourge of the Realm, and the terror of the neighbouring Provinces.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll things were diſpoſed to pleaſure, the King of Florer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to the acknowledgement of the obligations wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtood ingaged to the valour of <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and the Queen to the affection wherunto ſhe was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the rare perfection which ſhe found in him; nothing was ſpoken of, but of the beauty, vertue, goodly perſonage, and gallant grace of this brave ſtranger, who was beheld with wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whileſt the moſt amorous were entertaining their miſtriſſes, thoſe that were free from that paſſion thought fit to deſire the Knight of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that he would not enter into the turnament, which was to begin the next morning; addreſſing themſelves then unto him, one in the behalf of the reſt ſaid: Noble Sir, you have this day given ſuch powerfull proof of your valour, that your name ſhall ever live in the memory of men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of thoſe of this Kingdome, where Altars are juſtly to be reared unto you; ſo that having no need to ſignalize your ſelf any further for to make you more renowned amongſt us, we humbly beſeech you that you will not arm your ſelf for to combat in the turnament; for we yeeld you the glory of it before hand, well knowing that we are not able to acquire any honor but in imitating of you. By the faith of a Prince, ſaid the King, laying his hand on <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> ſhoulder, they have reaſon to make this requeſt unto you; and if you will oblige me, you ſhall to morrow be judge of the blows. Sir, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> I did not run but by your commandment, neither will I combat, ſince it is your pleaſure I ſhall not. Heerupon all the Knights dividing themſelves made an equall party of an hundred againſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſo going to order their affairs, they left <hi>Rozalmond</hi> with the King, who finding himſelf ſomewhat indiſpoſed, bad the Knight good night, and got him to bed, where he entertained the Queen with extolling the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of this ſtranger. This Princeſſe hearing him ſo highly commended, received the character which Love had imprinted in her heart, and unable to reſiſt her deſires ſhe ſaid: Why ſhould not I affect a man, whom even men themſelves ſeem paſſionately to love? and who would condemn me if my thoughts ſhould chance to be known? My weaknes would eaſily find excuſes in the merits of this Knight; he ſhall underſtand then that I love him, and ſeeking mine own ſatisfaction, amidſt the content which he is to attend from my careſſes, I will recompence the travell he hath undergone for me, entring into the juſts as my Knight; and to give a beginning to this deſign, I will oblige him by a preſent that ſhall be far greater and rarer then I would have beſtowed on any other which had remained victorious. This reſolution ſeeming to quiet her thoughts, ſhe ſlept till morning, when ſhe cauſed a crown of lawrell to be made, wreathed about with a chain of pearl, of very great price, the end whereof was cloſed up with a diamond of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17218:156"/>
valew, and giving it to a damſell whom ſhe had choſen for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of her deſires, to the end ſhe ſhould preſent it from her to the Knight ſhe commanded her carefully to obſerve with what countenance he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. This wench too well inſtructed with her Ladies wil, went and found out the Knight before he was fully ready, and making a very low obeiſance unto him, ſhe ſaid: Brave Warrior, my Miſtris meeting with no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence worthy of your invincible courage, hath commanded me to preſent you this lawrell, with a certain aſſurance of more if you be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. This preſent proceeding from the hand of ſo fair a Queen, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, much exceeds my expectation; but I will ſtrive to render her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervices, that ſhe may not repent her of her liberality: pleaſe you then to return her my humble thanks, and to tell her, that I will moſt charily keep this lawrell for her ſake, and that ſhe ſhall never be willing to imploy me, but that ſhe ſhall find me very readily diſpoſed to obey her command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The damſell returning with this ſo favourable an anſwer, gave the Queen unſpeakable content, who finding it according to her deſire, trickt up her ſelf with all the art ſhe poſſibly could uſe to make her appear more beautifull; and indeed ſhe went forth ſo curiouſly dreſt, that ſhe ſeemed not to be the ſame ſhe was the day before. The ſacrifices done, the King after a ſhort dinner was placed at a window with <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and the Queen hard by at another; but unable to endure the eſloignment of her Knight, ſhe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the King, and with a grace that could give no ſuſpition, ſhe ſaid unto him: Sir, this Knight was not born for you alone, lend him me a little that he may inform me which are the valianteſt Knights amongſt our Courtiers. In good faith little one, anſwered the King, your requeſt is ſo reaſonable, that I am willing to quit his company, though I very much deſire it, for to give you ſatisfaction. Wherefore go, ſaid he, deer friend, and content the curioſity of this woman. Whereupon <hi>Rozalmond</hi> making a very low obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance unto him, went to the Queens window, who ſeeing him ſo neer her, could not chuſe but change colour, being much perplexed in that ſhe knew not how to diſcover her thoughts unto him, at length vanquiſhed by her paſſion, ſhe ſaid pointing to the comabttants: Perceive you not, Sir, how our Courtiers blows are not delivered with ſo good a grace as they parted from your hand; I conſidered yeſterday your addreſſe, the admirable ſtrength of your arm, and I wondred how the Gods could impart ſo much force to a mortall wight, but I was no leſle diſpleaſed, when I ſaw that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Giant arrive, my bloud congealed in my veins, and the fear I had of your danger, left me neither colour nor motion, beholding you reſolved for the combat. Madam, anſwered he, theſe were the effects of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your ſweet diſpoſition, which made you doubt the loſſe of that which is yours. Mine, ſaid ſhe, O Gods! that this ſpeech were true, I ſhould then think my ſelf far happier then I am. Madam, ſaid he, I cannot beleeve that ever you had any juſt cauſe hitherto to charge me with diſobeing your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. I do not accuſe you, my Knight anſwered ſhe, but we will talk of this another time, for this is not a place proper for it; well, what is your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of theſe Knights? That they combat bravely, ſaid he, but thoſe that queſtionles will carry away the honour of the turnament, are they which maintained the juſts yeſterday; for ſee you not how their enemies are in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and that they had got on the better part of the field. Their blows are ſtronger then the others, their addreſſe greater, and their fight more

lively. Heerwith Count <hi>Folſuc</hi> having overthrown the adverſe chief, the reſt were chaſed out of the field, and the turnament ended with exceeding content to the King, who approaching the Queen, ſaid unto her: Now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, will you render me this Knight again? It is equall, ſaid ſhe, that you ſhould have him in your turn; but let me not live, I had taken no great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the ſight if he had not let me underſtand the valour of theſe Knights, more by diſcourſe, then by that which I obſerved. The King laughing heerat took the Knight by the hand, and led him to walk in a gallery, where he intertained him till ſupper, which was not long; for the King feeling his old indiſpoſition, withdrew ſuddenly, to the extream grief of ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and infinite content to the Queen, who not to loſe this opportunity, ſent <hi>Rozalmond</hi> word, that ſhe would ſpeak with him.</p>
                     <p>This Knight knowing but too well by her former ſpeeches whereto her purpoſe tended, would not willingly have been preſent with her in a place, which might favour her deſigne; howbeit, not daring to refuſe, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the damſell, and beholding the Queen alone ſitting on her beds feet, he advanced very modeſtly, and with a grace able to ſtrike any heart in love, he wiſhed her a good night. It will be the ſweeteſt, anſwered ſhe, ſo as you will correſpond to my deſire: Knight, I love you, and all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance I could make was not able to preſerve me from the charms of your ſo excellent parts, I am compelled to bluſh, but I finde ſo much excuſe for my fault, that I can ſpeak this without ſhame; you ſee an effect of your merit, and not of my weakneſſe, as peradventure you may conceive. Think of the favour is preſented to you, and be not precipitious in your anſwer; but firſt conſider, that it is a Queen which intreats you, a woman fair e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to enamour a God, and one that it may be loves you more then all the world beſides. Madam, ſaid he, with a confident countenance, pardon me, I beſeech you, if I anſwer otherwiſe then you deſire, I ſhould commit many irreproveable faults in this action, I ſhould be a traitour, and unworthy the favours which the King hath conferred on me, I ſhould incur aſſured death if ever it were known, as well it might be by any the leaſt accident, I ſhould wrong you in ſtead of honouring and ſerving you, I ſhould incenſe the Gods, who are grievous puniſhers of adulteries, and ſhould loſe that good opinion which your people have of me, who cannot beleeve that I am capable of ſo great a wickedneſſe. Madam, make ſome other uſe of me, and do not ruine me under colour of loving me; the pleaſure you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, is ſo ſoon paſt, that we are not to offend for ſo momentany a delight; let us ſhew our government then, in commanding over our ſelves therein; Madam, I beſeech you, ſaid he, falling on his knees, force your ſelf ſo far, as to deſire the contrary of that which you demand, and do not think that it is out of ingratitude that I give you this good counſell, I had too much underſtanding not to acknowledge the honour you do me, but you are alſo to conſider, that I have more reſpect and fidelity to your ſervice, then to undo you in ſtead of giving you content. Your reaſons, ſaid ſhe, with a countenance that teſtified her diſpleaſure, are ſo weak, that not taking them in good paiment, I will ſtudy how I may clear my ſelf otherwiſe out of theſe toiles, wherefore get you gone, and remember how much you have neglected me to day. Whereupon, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> with a moſt humble obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance departing, retired to his chamber, extreamly vext at that which had paſt; and reſolving not to ſtay long in that Court, he got him to bed, where
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17218:157"/>
after he had made a thouſand turns, with ſtrange unquietneſſe, he ſlept till the next day; when as he had ſuch a good morrow, as ſhall be related in the next Chapter.</p>

This incenſed Queen ſeeing her Knight gone, at firſt had recourſe unto her tears, but thinking that unprofitable, and unfit for the reſentment of an offence ſo great, ſhe wiped her eies, and walking up and down very faſt in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe ſaid: Shall I be ſo ſimple as to afflict my ſelf thus for one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull? Nay rather let me remember that his refuſall obliges me to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters? I muſt ſeek his death with more paſſion then ever I have done his careſſes; ſhew that it is not a Queen intreating, but revenging; a Lover languiſhing in expectation of her deſire, but a woman that receives not an affront without a home reſentment of it; and that will make it appear that diſpite hath more power in her ſoul, then all the flames of a childiſh God. Whereupon cauſing one to be ſent for, whoſe wicked diſpoſition ſhe very well knew, ſhe gave him a round ſum of money, and enjoined him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and ſtab the Knight of the Roſes the next day, whereſoever he could meet with him. Madam, ſaid this curſed wretch, I do not deſire to know what cauſe of diſpleaſure you have againſt him; ſufficeth it that I go upon your commandment; his laſt howr is at hand, and I aſſure your Majeſty that you ſhall have the ſatisfaction you require, I the glory of ſerving you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and he the puniſhment which he hath deſerved; for I have thoſe that will help to do the feat. Heerwith he departed the chamber, leaving the Queen ready to go to bed, wherein ſhe was no ſooner laid, but the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her affections, who more adviſedly conſidered the event of things, went directly to <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> chamber, where finding his Squire at the door, ſhe advertiſed him of the miſchief was preparing for his Maſter.

I ſhall acquaint him with the buſines, and take my word it ſhall never be known that you diſcovered it. Saying ſo, he went into his chamber after he had made the outter door ſure, and ariſing by break of day he laid his maſters arms upon the table, which obſerved by

The noiſe increaſing, the whole Court was in an uproar, and every man roſe to ſee what the matter was; <hi>Cleraſtes,</hi> whoſe lodging was not far off, looked alſo out of his window, and perceiving his friend in ſuch danger, he preſently armed himſelf, and went forth with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to his ſuccour, where finding this troop to be the Queens Guard, he cryed to them: Rogues, how dare you aſſault this Knight? By my life, Ile have you all hanged; but they neither regarding him, nor his words, he joined himſelf to the valiant Knight of the Roſes, that ſeemed a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt amongſt theſe raſcals; whereof, he laid twenty three dead on the ground: and ſeconding him with a marvellous courage, three parts of this multitude was diminiſhed; when as the King, being advertiſed of this hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burly, deſcended in his night-gown, and commanded a ſurceaſe. At his preſence every one withdrew, and he going to the Knight of the Roſes, demanded of him the cauſe of this quarrell.

I remembered the laſt night that I had ingaged my ſelf for the execution of an adventure, to the performance whereof, being reſolved to go, and making account to depart aſſoon as your Majeſtie had been ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and that I had received the honour of your commandments, as I was to take my leave of <hi>Cleraſtes,</hi> all theſe folks invironed me with their ſwords drawn, charged me moſt furiouſly, without ſaying wherefore, Sir, we bear arms for our own preſervation, and am ſorry that I have made uſe of them againſt ſuch as appertain unto you; but your Highneſſe knows, as I ſaid even now, that it is lawfull to repell force with force; in which regard, I hope your Majeſtie will not take it ill, that I have ſaved my ſelf by their loſſe.

                        <hi>Cleraſtes,</hi> being ſo infinitely obliged to this Knight, and knowing that your Majeſtie loves him, I armed my ſelf in this ſort, for to run his fortune: wherein, if I have done any thing againſt the reſpect which I ow to your ſervice, by laying hands on ſuch as belong to the Queen, I humbly beſeech your pardon. No, no, ſaid the King, you have done me a ſingular pleaſure in it; but come, let us go to my chamber, in the mean time let theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants be carried to priſon, for to teach them not to undertake any thing, but by order. Sir, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> I am ready to depart, pleaſe it your Majeſtie to do me the honour that I may receive your commandments. Now on my faith, anſwered the King, this ſudden departure of yours troubles me; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I will not oppoſe your deſignes, but whenſoever you think good to come and ſee us, you ſhall alwayes have an abſolute power heer. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt humble ſervant, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> hath never deſerved this grace; ſo kiſſing his hand, he waited on him to his chamber door, where making another low obeiſance, he returned with <hi>Clariſtes,</hi> for go and take his leave of <hi>Carinda,</hi> never ſpeaking ſo much as a word of the cauſe of his deſloign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though he were much intreated to it. Theſe lovers ſhed tears at the departure of this Knight, but it was nothing in regard of the Queen, who burſting with ſpite to ſee things fall out otherwiſe then ſhe deſired, lamented, railed on <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and was even mad with rage; nevertheles, being adviſed by her Secretary, to make no ſhew at all of any diſpleaſure for the departure of this brave warrior, leſt thereby her love, together with her malice, might be diſcovered, ſhe forbare weeping, and ſetting a modeſt countenance on the matter, and ſhewing little alteration, ſhe wiſely covered that which was obſerved, with a ſeeming diſpoſition; ſo letting this Knight go, of whom ſhe was much more fond then before, ſending every where to ſeek him, with excuſes of all that was paſt, and comforting her ſelf, with the hope, that upon the receit of her letters, his minde would alter, and and that one day ſhe ſhould enjoy him, ſhe remained better contented then this accident ſeemed to permit.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17218:158"/>
the occaſion of that their haſty ſlight: This behaviour of theirs made him judge, that there was ſomething more then ordinary to do there within, and indeed being entred into the baſe court, he found the great gate of the place ſhut, over the which was a reaſonable handſome Gentlewoman, who having deſcried him, ſaid to him with abundance of tears: Sir, if there be any valour in you ſuccour me, and ſuffer not a wicked Knight, that hath ſurpriſed me heer, to obtain that by violence, which by love he hath never deſerved. Gentlewoman, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> cauſe but this gate to be opened, and I will chaſtiſe him in ſuch ſort, that he ſhall never attempt to force a woman again. Alas! ſaid ſhe, the gate is in the power of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and they guard it. If they will not open it at my requeſt, ſaid <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> Ile ſet fire on it, and puniſh them rigorouſly for their treaſon. Who you, ſaid a big Knight, that inſtantly came forth, thinking to deſtroy him eaſily being alone, who are you that ſo audaciouſly menaceth folks whom you do not know? You have but ill luck to fall into the ſnares which were not laid for you, and the pity which you ſeem to have of this woman, is like to coſt you your life; wherefore you may enter, if you have ſuch a mind to it. <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> that deſired nothing elſe, preſently alighting, paſt in, never fearing the fury of five or ſix men, whom he beheld attending him with their ſwords drawn, and placed himſelf in the midſt of the Court, where theſe Knights ſtraightway invironing him, charged him on all ſides: Five blows deſcended at one inſtant upon him, three on his ſhield, and two on his head; but contemning theſe attempts, as too weak to move him, he gave one of them, that would ſeem to be more valiant then the reſt, ſo rude a blow on his helmet, that he divided his head in twain, the ſecond he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from the ſhoulder to the waſte, and ran the third quite thorow the body. This ſo ſudden an execution aſtonied the reſt of his enemies, which would gladly have ſaved themſelves by ſlight, had they not been reſtrained by ſhame, and the preſence of the big Knight, who inraged at the defeat of the others, was newly advanced to ſecond theſe; and with his firſt ſtroke, which lighted on <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> head, he made his eyes to ſparkle; but he boaſted not long of this advantage, for <hi>Rozalmond</hi> quickly recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, diſcharged his ſword with ſuch violence on his ſhield, that not reſting there, it almoſt cut off half his left arm; whereat he grew ſo furious, as he ran upon him thinking to get within him, and overthrow him that way; but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond</hi> that fought with judgement, and that held it not ſafe to be ſeiſed upon by his adverſary, gave him ſuch a thruſt in the belly, that he fell down ſtark dead in the place: The other three, to avoid theſe horrible blows, betook them to flight, truſting more to their heels then totheir weapons; but it would not ſerve their turns, for <hi>Rozalmond</hi> following them cloſe, made two pieces of the body of the firſt he overtook, and having cut off the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds head, was conſtrained to let the third eſcape, for to give ear unto the ſhrikes of a woman that cryed out for help: Hearing then a great noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, he preſently got up the ſtairs, and found a man of a wilde and terrible aſpect, his colour ſwart, his eies deep ſunk into his head, the motions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were full of horrour and fear, his ſtature tall, but wonderfully miſhapen, his countenance furious, and his voice moſt dreadfull; in his hands he bare a club, wherewithall he had broken up one door, and was beginning to deal ſo with the ſecond, for to get into the chamber whither the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was fled; when as <hi>Rozalmond</hi> approached, who wiſhing him to arm

Worthy Sir, ſaid the Gentlewoman, having beheld the blow, you have freed the world even of the wickedſt man that was in all this Countrey, which is infinitely obliged to you for his death, and my ſelf more particularly, who had by this time loſt my honour or my life, if you had been leſſe ſtrong and valiant. I am exceeding glad, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> that I have diverted ſo great a miſchief; But how fell you into it?

Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taking him by the hand, ſhe led him into a goodly chamber, where <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tander</hi> having unarmed him, ſhe cauſed him to put on a rich cloak, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him ſo well, that this Gentlewoman, named <hi>Baſiliana,</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, without the feeling of a ſecret fire that began to conſume her heart. Good Gods, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, how happy were I if this gallant Knight would love me as much as <hi>Dramant</hi> did, I ſhould ſoon change my minde, and would not forbid him to repreſent his paſſions unto me; I muſt incourage him unto it then, and by my carriage let him know, that I will be more facile to his deſires, then I was to his whom he hath ſlain, which I may do without ſhame; for covering my boldneſſe with the reſentment I ow to his aſſiſtance, I may make him beleeve, that my careſſes are without artifice, and ſo carry him inſenſibly to crave ſome more particular favours. This reſolution ſeeming proper to her for her contentment, and having preſented him with confects, ſhe drew him to walk in the garden, whilſt preparation was made for ſupper, and buriall for the dead bodies. Seeing her ſelf alone with him, and in the liberty to ſpeak, ſhe would fain have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and diſcovered her thoughts, but baſhfulneſſe ſtopt her wouth as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ſhe opened it for that purpoſe; ever and anon ſhe changed colour, and remaining ſilent, ſhe left her eyes to perform that office, whereby <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond</hi> judged eaſily of her pain; but remembering his <hi>Armazia,</hi> and not permitting his heart to conceive a thought to the prejudice of his love, he made as though he underſtood not the myſterie of ſo great a ſilence, and entertained her with ordinary diſcourſe; wherewithall not being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

it made her at laſt reſolve to break the ice, and begin this language to him, with a ſigh: I have reaſon to rejoyce at your arrivall in theſe parts, whereby your valour hath preſerved me; but withall, I am much afraid, Sir, that it hath drawn me out of one danger, to plunge me into another far greater; for loving you more paſſionately then the ſmall time of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you will ſeem to permit, and doubting to finde your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ingaged to ſome happier beauty, I can expect no other then a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched death from the refuſall you will make me of correſponding to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: I have diſcovered this ſecret unto you, being unable to conceal it, not with an opinion that you will deſpiſe what is ſo freely offered you, but to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Madam, the truth is your ſpeech doth not only amaze but much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe me, for knowing how far the power of love doth extend, I would gladly both give you ſome reliefe, and yet not offend againſt mine own duty, but conſidering to what I am obliged, I may not for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſatisfie your deſire. The firſt is, that I am forbidden by the religion which I hold to love any other woman but her whom heaven hath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully legitimated me, eſpecially Idolaters as you are: the ſecond is, that I am not permitted as a Knight to ſpoyle a woman of her honour after I have nobly preſerved it, ſince our order is chiefely inſtituted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Ladyes; the third and moſt important of all is, that my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingaged under the power of another that loves me, I may not to pleaſe you deceive her, unleſſe I will become a diſloyall traitor; thus have I dealt as frely with you as you have done with me, and letting you ſee what cauſe I have to deny you, it muſt oblige you to clear me from all ingratitude: the meekneſſe of men I confeſſe is great, but we are to doe all things with reaſon: and never ſo to ſubject our ſelves as not to be our owne maſters ſtill. What glory ſhould I gaine by the ſuccour I have given you, if I ſhould now undo you, and what were you the better for eſcaping <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants</hi> violence, if under the colour of my ſervices I ſhould do you the like wrong? Not a whit (Madam) nor could your beauty that might ſeeme to excuſe me before the world leave me without blame before heaven; I muſt be then more conſtant and you more generous, to the end that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory obtained over our own deſires may ſettle a quiet peace in our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. You have given me reaſons, anſwered ſhe with a ſad countenance, which are but ſo many ſhifts, for to excuſe your ſelf upon the difference of our religions is nothing; men are generally borne for the ſatisfaction of one another, and a ſingle opinion ought not to be denied them in that point; to ſay alſo that it were a diſhonour for you to caſt me away after you have ſaved me from ſhipwrack is but a poore obligation: for it is not to ruine but to preſerve what is frely given you; that only &amp; that alone which you may inſiſt upon is that you will not betray a Lady that truly loves you, but thereunto likewiſe I anſwer, how you ſhall do her no wrong in loving me at at this time, ſince my intention is not to deprive her abſolutely of the power which her merit hath aſſuredly given her over you; nevertheleſſe I will not preſſe you further, but leaving you to the liberty, either of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting

me, or making me to dye, I will only beſeech you to read in my eies that which I ſhall ſuffer in your deniall. Whereupon going out of the garden ſhe lead him into a Parlor where the beſt of the meat was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſhe tooke in beholding him, ſtill obſerving ſome one perfection or other that rendred her love far greater. <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> who feared that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and the teares of this mayd might overcome him at length, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to bed, being reſolved to get him a way the next morning by break of day, as he did, notwithſtanding all the lamentation and prayers of <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana</hi> to the contrary. Being departed thence he rode three howrs in a great thick forreſt, out of which he was no ſooner paſt but he eſpied a Knight of ſo goodly a repreſentation, that he ſtayed to obſerve him, being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly well pleaſed with the grace wherewithall he ſate his horſe; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then attentively all the parts of his arms he perceived three Palms amidſt his ſhield, which gave him aſſurance that this was the Knight whom he ſought, and that he ſo much deſired to be revenged of, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who having been healed by the damſell that had carried him out of Conſtantinople, and conducted by his adventures, was partly by land, and partly by ſea, arrived in the kingdom of Florertan; the ſight of him renewed <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> hatred, and incenſed him in ſuch ſort, that not ſeeking for any pretext of ataquing him, he cryed to him to defend himſelf. In good faith, ſaid he, touching his lance, you have challenged me without cauſe, but I hope you will be the firſt that ſhall repent it, ſo ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, they met in the middle of the courſe with ſuch fury, that tumbling down both together, they made two or three turns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the graſſe, with ſo much diſpleaſure, for that they had never done the like before, that riſing extreamly tranſported with choller, they drew their ſwords, and charged one another ſo cruelly, as the meeting of two raging ſeas could not have made a more dreadfull noiſe. Hate animated <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Alcidamant</hi> combated for glory, and imployed his arm with ſo much force, that the weight of his blows, equalled the violence of his enemies; their ſhields fell away in pieces, lightening flew from their helmets, and as often as their ſwords deſcended, the bloud coloured their armour; one gave a down-right blow, the other a thruſt; briefly, they were ſo ſet upon one anothers deſtruction, that their lives ſeemed to depend upon every ſtroke they gave. Good God, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond</hi> to himſelf, is this warrior come into the world to bear away the honour of all the brave deeds of arms that are to be performed in his time? Yes verily, for his match is not to be met withall; and queſtionleſſe he will carry the glory of being the beſt combatant in the world; his blows do not onely make me deſpair of the victory, but every minute poſſeſſes me with a fear of death: What ſpeak I of the fear of death, I am reſolved to vanquiſh, or to die? Charging then with more fury then before, he left <hi>Alcidamant</hi> in the ſame minde, and the ſame diſcourſe, very much afraid of the end of this battell. Having entertained themſelves five howrs together in this manner, ſometimes ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a knee, ſometimes an hand to the ground, knocking their chins againſt their breſt, recoiling two or three ſteps back, they forſook their ſwords, fell to grapſing with one another, and began a moſt dangerous wreſtling. <hi>Rozalmond</hi> ſeemed to have an advantage in his ſtature, but <hi>Alcidamants</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being contracted in a more well ſet body, rendered their encounter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that if you have as much courage as your perſon doth promiſe, you will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly imbrace the defence of her, and not ſuffer her to fall into the hands of ſo beaſtly a creature. If her remedy lie in my power, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> be aſſured, ſweet heart, that this Giant ſhall not long boaſt of the cruelties which he commits in her Countrey, for I am ready to go along with you, and would to God we were now in the city. We may be there to morrow, ſaid the damſell, if we will but put our horſes a little to it. So riding on, they travelled till it was towards evening, when as they eſpied a big Knight a little before them, who admiring the gallantry of <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ſtayed for to obſerve him more exactly. The damſell judging him by his demeanour to be valiant, went and beſought him to grant her one boon. I ſhould be very ſorry, ſaid he, to deny one of your merit, wherefore you may be confident to obtain your deſire. You ſhall accompany me then, ſaid ſhe, in an enterpriſe, whereunto I am conducting this Knight, and joyning your forces with his, you may make them dreadfull to the enemies of a young Princeſſe likely to be diſinherited. Let us ſet forward when you pleaſe, ſaid he, I will ſerve her moſt willingly, and will not ſpare the little valour I may have for to deliver out of the troubles ſhe is in.</p>

Whereupon the two Knights having ſaluted one another very courte ouſly, the new commer would faine have diſcourſed, but <hi>Alcidamant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he could not well expreſſe himſelfe, ſaid unto him, Sir, I ſee you are a ſtranger, and that in another language you might be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; wherefore be pleaſed not to force your ſelfe, but ſpeake as they do in your own countrey. I doubt, ſaid he, you will underſtand me worſe: for the kingdome of France, whereof I am native, is ſo remote from this place, that no man heer is acquainted with the language. Why? are you a Frenchman, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant?</hi> Yes, anſwered he, and I was never abroad, till that about ſome four or five moneths ſince, I put my ſelfe to ſea, with a purpoſe to travell through the world for to raiſe my glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my fortune, which is ſo mean, that it hath furniſhed me with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the order of Knighthood, and the power to become great by my Arms. My name is <hi>Troilus:</hi> Of the houſe whereof I am deſcended, I will not ſpeak; having no other eminent title, than that I am nobly born, my reſolution is to caſt my ſelf into the moſt difficile enterpriſes, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve honour by my valour. You cannot chuſe, replied <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> but become great, and of eſtimation, being poſſeſſed with ſo worthy a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of doing bravely; and no doubt Fortune will be conſtrained to look with a favourable eye upon you one day: therefore let nothing diſcourage you, but perſevere in your noble deſigne. I have taken leave to ſpeak thus freely unto you, becauſe I am a Frenchman as you are, and one that infinitely deſires to ſee you raiſed according to your merit. Worthy Sir, ſaid <hi>Troilus,</hi> then being extreamly contented to underſtand that they were both of one countrey, how much am I ſatisfied with this encounter of you, and what an obligation hath this Damoſell laid upon me, for bringing us thus luckily together. The acknowledgement is equall, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant:</hi> for I ſo eſteem of your company, that I muſt needs ſhare with you in the joy you take to meet with me. Theſe two warriours entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this manner with a great deal of pleaſing diſcourſe, ſometimes talking of the affairs of France, ſometimes of the adventures which they had encountred, paſſed away the night before they were aware, and never alighted till about dinner time; when deſiring to refreſh themſelves a little in the houſe of a Forreſter which they found in the middeſt of a wood, they let their horſes repoſe themſelves whileſt they ſlept a matter of three or four hours; at the end whereof underſtanding that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five leagues from <hi>Alfarta,</hi> they took horſe again, and uſed ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, that they diſcovered both the Citie and the enemies Camp: Whereupon the Damoſell which conducted them, making a ſtand, ſaid, that to avoid the encounter of the enemies troops, they were to take a by way, which ſhe ſhewed them, that would bring them, without danger, to the very walls thereof: But <hi>Alcidamant</hi> deſiring to ſignalize his comming with ſome memorable act of valour, told her, that his reputation obliged him to enter honourably into the town, that he was reſolved to paſſe through the midſt of ſo many enemies; and that therefore ſhe might go before, and deſire the fair <hi>Merodiana</hi> to cauſe four hundred horſe to ſally forth for to favour their retreat. This maid by no means approving theſe Knights enterpriſe, debated very ſtrongly with them for to conduct them more ſafely; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſeeing her ſelf importuned by <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ſhe went away very covertly to the gates of the Citie; which as ſoon as ſhe was known,

were inſtantly opened unto her: from whence ſhe took her way directly to the Court, where finding <hi>Merodiana</hi> in her chamber ſhe fell on her knees before her, and beſeeching her to be of good chear, deſired her hands to kiſſe for the good news ſhe brought her. Alas <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> ſaid ſhe with a ſorrowfull countenance, I know not what thou wilt ſay; but the ſtate whereunto I am reduced, will not permit me to hope for much, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, tell me, I prethee, wherein conſiſt theſe good news? In the arrivall of two Knights, anſwered <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> the braveſt and moſt valiant, in my opinion, upon the earth: and that taking pitty of the wrong which this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant does you, are come with a reſolution to ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I judge ſo by their brave carriage, anſwered ſhe; and I may well ſay, that you never beheld Knights of ſo gallant a diſpoſition, eſpecially one of them that bears three Palms on his Shield: He hath a marvelous good face, an excellent ſhape, and a brave warlicke countenance. Theſe are parts indeed common to many men, ſaid <hi>Merodiana,</hi> and if the effect be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the commendations thou giveſt him, it may be I ſhall find ſome conſolation in his preſence. But where haſt thou left them <hi>Ciſtenia?</hi> Faſt by the enemies Camp, anſwered ſhe, reſolved to make way through it with their ſwords, and give you ſome proof of their valour before they enter the towne; and therefore do deſire you to favour their retreat, by ſending forth four hundred Knights when the alarm ſhall begin, among the the enemies. Good gods, ſaid ſhe, make way through the enemies camp! why thou amazeſt me, <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> either they are mad men, or valiant beyond expreſſion. Do not think, anſwered ſhe, that this reſolution of theirs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from any raſhneſſe: among all the qualities which recommend the Knight of the Palmes, I have alwayes found him to be very diſcreet and adviſed, wherefore I imagine that he hath undertaken this onely out of greatneſſe of courage, which makes him deſpiſe all common and inglorious deſignes. I know not what will become of this enterpriſe, ſaid <hi>Merodiana,</hi> but I will be moſt carefull to ſecure their retreat; wherefore cauſe ſome of my Commanders to come hither. Whereupon five or ſix of the chief of her Court preſenting themſelves before her, ſhe related unto them how two ſtranger Knights purpoſed to aſſail the enemies camp: and therefore having commanded them to ſally forth with the number they had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to charge the enemy at ſuch time as they ſhould perceive any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore in their camp, ſhe retired into her cabinet, where ſhe began to think of the ſpeech which <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> had uſed concerning the Knight of the Palms: Sometimes ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> figured unto herſelfe the beauty of his perſon; and then again preſently imagined that ſhe ſaw him thundring amidſt a ſquadron of armed forces, and found herſelf poſſeſſed with I know not what kinde of good will towards him, which converting into love, made her infinitely deſire the preſence of this gallant Knight. If he be worthy of me, ſaid ſhe, I am ready reſolved to love him, and his ſervices are to attend their recompence in my favours. But what if the eminence of his race ſhould be reſponſible to my condition? without doubt I would marry him: and ſay he ſhould be poor of means, his vertue would ſupply that great default of fortune. Well, he muſt be ſeene, and then time ſhall adviſe. Saying thus, ſhe called <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> to help her to bed, when as news was brought her, that the enemies camp was all in a tumult; She trembled at this report:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17218:162"/>
for ſhe feared that her Knight would not bring his enterprizes to paſſe; howbeit taking better heart, ſhe commanded her C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The noyſe increaſed, the camp was up in Arms, the ſouldiers ran confuſedly up and down: Some asked what quarter it was that the enemy had aſſailed, and with what numbers, but no man could return any anſwer, they knew not from whence their deſtruction came, and their terrour was no leſſe then if twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men had fallen upon their trenches. The moſt part notwithſtanding being advertiſed that two Knights only were the cauſe of this hurly-burly, they returned into their tents, laughing at their own fear, and thinking themſelves diſhonoured for having been frighted by the temerity of two men. In the mean time the two invincible Knights beſtowed their blows with ſuch fury, that all paſſed under the edge of their blades; they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw as many enemies as preſented themſelves before them, cut off the arms of ſome, divided the heads of others in pieces, made ſo great a havock amongſt them, that every one feared their ſwords as if they had been thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, the wayes were free, none oppoſed their rage; and if any one durſt ſtand before them, he was ſure to be ſlain but with one blow. <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> many times obſerved that great Knight of the Lions, (ſo was <hi>Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> named) and ſeeing with what grace he maſſacred his enemies, put the moſt confident to flight, commended him as one of the valiant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſlaughter having endured above two howrs, <hi>Merodiana's</hi> Knights appeared, and gave ſo furiouſly on the enemy, that with the feare they were in, they layd above three hundred on the earth. But the Gyant who would not ſtir forth upon the firſt bruit, arriving thereupon, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and the Knight of the Lions put themſelves in the Rear, and cauſing a retreat to be ſounded, ſuſtained the brunt of his troops, untill ſuch time as they had gotten to the walls, from whence, a thouſand Croſſe-bows diſcharged ſuch a multitude of ſhot upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that he was conſtrained to retire, extreamly vexed to have been ſo beaten by two Knights, who ſeeing themſelves within the gates, demanded whether <hi>Merodiana</hi> were withdrawn to bed. No anſwered <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> that came forth to receive them amidſt the troops, ſhe attends you in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for to begin the thankes which ſhe owes to your valour. So taking them by the hand, ſhe conducted them to the Court, where <hi>Alcidamant</hi> finding <hi>Merodiana</hi> much fairer then <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> had deſcribed her, would have ſaluted her upon his knees; but ſhe that through this warlicke countenance was ſtrucken with the flaſhes of an unreſiſtable beauty, ſtayed him from doing ſo, and ſaid, Valiant Knight, in all right I ow that reſpect unto you, if you would receive it from me: for being come to the ſuccour of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan maid, which expected nothing but death to avoid the violence of a wicked man, I cannot uſe too much ſubmiſſion for to honour you: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully reſolved to ſhew my ſelf more ſenſible of benefits, then offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in my complements, I will leave it to another time, and in the mean while do deſire you to repoſe your ſelfe at leaſure, after ſuch painfull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travell.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17218:163"/>
and could tell you, that having done nothing, whereunto I was not tied by the law of Knighthood, I could not expect any thank for it, no more then this good Knight, that accompanies me; but referring my reaſons to ſuch time as you ſhall be pleaſed to take for to ſpeake unto us, we humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to accept of the little ſervice which we ſhall do you. You will every way remain invincible; but, Sir, you muſt ſuffer me to ſay thus much in your preſence, that I am exceedingly indebted to your pity, and ſo be pleaſed, I pray you, to let me ſhew you the lodging where you ſhall lie: Then, taking him by the hand, ſhe led them to a very fair and rich cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (notwithſtanding all the intreaty the Knights made her to the contrary) where having bid them good reſt, ſhe retired, ſo much beſides her ſelf, that ſhe walked up and down a long time without ſpeaking a word. <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> beholding her loſt in this ſort, and gueſſing from whence it proceeded, ſaid unto her: W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Exceeding well, Madam, anſwered he, and am ready with this Knight to go and viſit your enemies again, for to let them know that you no longer ſtand in fear of them: I have cauſed the moſt part of your Captains to meet heer, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take their advice with ours, and permit us begin to ſerve you. The time of their puniſhment is not yet come, replied ſhe, and I ſhall deſire you not to ſtir from hence, untill the ſuccours which I expect from the Iland of Silvana be arrived; for if the chance of war ſhould fall amiſſe on you, I am ſure that there would be no more hope left for me in the world; wherefore refreſh your ſelves a little after your travells paſt, and if you will be but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a while, we will finde out entertainments to paſſe away the time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.

Diſcourſing in this manner, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a ſouldier, that came from the enemies Campe, who recounting the ſlaughter which the two Knights had made of four hundred ſeventy and two Knights, cut in pieces by them as they paſt along, thoſe excepted which fell upon the arrivall of the troops ſent forth by <hi>Merodiana,</hi> amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of three hundred; as alſo the rage <hi>Fangomadan</hi> was in, not ſo much for the loſſe, whereof he made no great account, as for ſhame, that he was not able to arreſt the fury of two men alone, rejoyced all the Court, which admired the exceeding valour of theſe Knights, whom eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one beheld as a wonder.

You are alwayes in the midſt of your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, how can I tell you then before them that my ſoul is all of a flame? Your minde is continually carried away with the care of affairs that every minute are preſented unto you, what place can there be left then for a thought of me? No, Madam, you ſcarce think of me at any time, and that is it which makes me deſpair of all remedy. I acknowledge with you, that I never deſerved the grace which I demand, but you are the onely cauſe of it, and the little power which you have left me, hath not permitted me to have cut your enemies Camp already in pieces: if that be it you look for, Madam, keep me no longer heer, I will ſoon rid them away, and deliver you, though every ſouldier were converted into a Giant.</p>

For my part I do not, but am perſwaded, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them occaſion to talk to my diſadvantage, I ſhould ruine that which I am raiſing for your glory; we are to carry our ſelves more adviſedly, and with better diſcretion, nevertheleſſe I am reſolved to commit an errour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then diſcontent you. What is it you require of me? That you would be pleaſed, ſaid he, to grant me admittance into your chamber when all the houſe is at reſt, to the end I may diſcover my ſufferings with that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which a lover ought to have. That were too much, anſwered ſhe, if I loved you leſſe; but relying on your vertue, I will be contented to grant it you, ſo as you will preſently ſwear unto me to attempt nothing but with leave. That reſpect you alwayes bear about you, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Madam, I proteſt unto you, by the faith of a Knight, no way to offend you. Be ready then for to morrow night, ſaid <hi>Merodiana,</hi> and follow <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenia</hi> when ſhe comes for you. Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> kiſſing her hands, this is the happieſt promiſe that ever was made; howbeit I muſt beſeech you to add yet ſomething more to my felicitie. That I will, ſaid ſhe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it do no way contravenne the proteſtation you have made to be contain'd. No Madam, anſwered he: for my requeſt is, that you will render me worthy of this grace by the defeat of ſome of your enemies; and that you will not hinder me from waking them to morrow morning. I ſpeak not this without reaſon, we came hither for your ſervice, we have enterpriſed nothing theſe three weeks that we have been heer, your people begin to loſe the good opinion which they had of us, and ſome ſtick not to ſay, that this courſe of ours is not correſpondent to our great words. Moreover, I ſhould not find ſo much pleaſure in the favour you purpoſe to do me, if I ſhould not appeare before you like a generous and valiant Knight: Sweet Madam, be carried by theſe conſiderations, to yeeld unto this intreaty of mine, whereby you ſhall infinitly oblige me, and teſtifie that you repoſe confidence in me. I will not hinder you, ſaid ſhe, ſeeing my word is paſt; howbeit tempt not Fortune, nor hazzard your ſelf too far, if you love me, but carefully preſerve your life, whereupon depends all the happineſſe of my dayes. This diſcourſe finiſhing with our French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans infinite content, he aſſembled the Captains, communicated to them his deſigne; and finding them well diſpoſed to his mind, he choſe out two thouſand of the moſt reſolute men, and commanded them to be ready an howr before day, and ſo retiring with <hi>Troilus,</hi> he went to take a little reſt. This deſigne running in his mind, he ſlept not long, but aroſe, armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, put <hi>Troilus</hi> in the head of a thouſand horſe, cauſed him to ſally forth at one gate, and making a ſhorter cut, went and charged the enemies with ſuch fury, that being ſurpriſed, he made an horrible ſlaughter of them before they had the leaſure to put themſelves in array. The firſt that he encountred being diſpatched, all the Camp was in an uprore, every place rang with crying, Arm, arm: Heer ran the ſouldiers to their Colours, there the Knights call'd out for their horſes; briefly, all was in confuſion. In the mean time <hi>Alcidamant</hi> gained ground, killed, maſſacred, cut off legs and arms, and making large way to his Knights, overthrew tents and pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, putting the whole Camp in ſuch fear, that it was thought all had been loſt. Time &amp; neceſſitie having quickly ranged the enemy into order, the moſt part of the armie conducted by <hi>Fangomadan,</hi> went to fall upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant,</hi>

when a new uprore began on the north ſide, the troops felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves charged in flank, and the ſlaughter grew ſo great, that the formoſt ſquadrons betook them to flight. <hi>Fangomadan</hi> amazed with this ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, know not which way to turn himſelf, finding the danger to be no leſſe on the one ſide, then on the other: But being a man of courage and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he preſently drew out eight thouſand men, and ſending them away under the leading of ſome of his moſt expert Commanders, againſt the laſt commers, he marched with the reſt to arreſt the fury of our Knight; when as he, being every way as wiſe as valiant, cauſed the retreat to be ſounded, thinking it not fit to attend the ſhock of this Squadron, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the town, maugre all that <hi>Fangomadan</hi> could do, who curſing Heaven and Nature, carried himſelfe ſo furiouſly, that not one of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourits durſt come neer him. He would have turned head for to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the others, whom he ſaw yet in the field; but word being brought him, that they alſo were retired, he entred into his tent with a proteſtation to overthrow all his Gods, and never to ſuffer his enemies to be at reſt; cauſing all things to be prepared then that ſeemed neceſſary for an aſſault, he called his Captains before him, and commanded them to die or take the Town, vowing with ſtrange menaces, to cut them in pieces which ſhould recoile but a ſtep back, and to give extraordinary recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſuch as ſhould be valiant and couragious; whereupon every man put himſelf in readineſſe to fight. But the Gyant thinking it fit to ſurpriſe his adverſaries, as he had been ſurprized by them, forbore all preparations till night, to the end the enemies ſhould not be advertiſed of his deſigne: who in the mean time, little regarding his rage, made Bonfires for joy of ſo glorious a victory, which having coſt them but threeſcore and five Knights, had laid two thouſand and ſix hundred of the contrary part dead in the place, with infinite contentment to the beautifull <hi>Merodiana,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe gallants with ſo much kindneſſe, that they were almoſt aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it.</p>

Riſe, Knight, ſaid ſhe, you have no leſſe grace in delivering your paſſions, then valour in vanquiſhing them that encounter you; and your parts have no leſſe power over me, then your arm hath over mine enemies. I was reſolved to have conſerved my ſelfe, but you have won me, and I am conſtrained to tell you, that you may diſpoſe of my bed as you pleaſe, I will not complain of the loſſe of that which I hold moſt dear, ſo as your diſloyaltie give me no cauſe to do.

Knight, ſaid ſhe, exceedingly troubled, and gueſſing at his deſigne, I grant it you whatſoever it be; howbeit, think, I pray you, not onely of your own, but of my peoples, and particularly of my preſervation. That is the onely care I take, anſwered he, and there is nothing ſo dear to me as your ſafety. Wherefore (addreſſing his ſpeech to the Herauld) you may tell your Maſter, that I was reſolved to free this Countrey from his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17218:167"/>
and that I am infinitly glad he hath furniſhed me with the means to do it. I will encounter him to morrow under theſe walls, with the arms common among good Knights; namely, the Lance and Sword, not with a companion: for generous and valiant men never fight with advantage, but ſingle, and with courage enough to make him pay for the ſpoil which he hath made of this Princeſſe territories. Theſe words bravely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, no leſſe amazed the enemy then the aſſiſtants, who knowing how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious the ſtrength of <hi>Fangomadan</hi> was, could hardly beleeve that any one man durſt threaten him, much leſſe preſent himſelfe before him; howbeit, ſeeing with what aſſurance this valiant Knight ſpake, and calling to mind what he had done in the paſſed encounters, they beheld him as a wonder, the moſt part with pitty, as if his death had been faſtned to the firſt blow he ſhould receive from his enemy, and others with ſome hope of good ſucceſſe. <hi>Merodiana</hi> being here with extreamly afflicted in her mind, ſtood a good while beholding him with an eye that ſufficiently teſtified the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe was in; but doubting that thus ſhe might offend him, ſhe ſet a good face on the matter, and ſpeaking to the Herault, ſaid unto him, Friend, this Knight hath given you your anſwer, which I avow; and to ſhew the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have in him, I am contented (making no more account of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate then his life) that it be comprized within the hazzard of the combat, and that this Iland be united to your Maſters crown, if he prove the victor; reſerving nothing but the power to diſpoſe of my ſelf according to mine own fancie, if my Knight be flain. The Herauld departing herewith, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant</hi> kneeled down again, and rendring a thouſand thankes to <hi>Merodia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for her good opinion of him, he promiſed her, by Gods aſſiſtance, not to deceive her hope. Going then to his chamber for to viſit his arms, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aw a Damſell enter with a Dwarfe, carrying a trunk on his ſhoulder, who making him a very low reverence, ſaid, Brave warriour, the learned <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> who loves you well, knowing what is to betide you in your enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hath commanded me to give you this armour, and to tell you, that you ſhould not be troubled for the loſſe of the Arms which ſhe cauſed to be brought in to you in the wood where you were made Knight, your former combats have made them in caſe to do you but ſmall ſervice in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you have now in hand, which hath induced her to furniſh you with theſe new ones. This is not the firſt favour ſhe hath done me, ſaid <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> having no way obliged her thereunto: but you may aſſure her, ſhe may diſpoſe of me when or however ſhe pleaſeth. Whereupon, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Dwarfe a green cuiraſſe, ſet all over with double hearts, wherein appeared an A and a T, an helmet of the ſame, the richeſt that could be, and a ſhield whereon were three Palms, as in the other, he was better pleaſed then if he had obtained a Kingdome; howbeit, he marvelled to ſee them ſo thin and light: whereat the Damſell ſmiling, ſaid unto him, Sir, never wonder at that: for my Miſtreſſe hath cauſed them to be made ſo of purpoſe, that you may fight with the leſſe pain and more eaſe. But if you dare not credit my words, make triall of them your ſelf, and ſee if the ſtrength of your arm and the goodneſſe of your ſword can open them. Here with ſhe vaniſhed away leaving <hi>Merodiana</hi> no leſſe amazed then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; who finding herſelf at night with her Knight, could not forbear ſhedding of ſome tears at the remembrance of the danger wherein he was to be the next day: Whereupon our Frenchman taking occaſion to carreſſe

her, told her, that ſhe was not to afflict her ſelf ſo, nor conſider the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his body, and that of his enemy, that vertue conſiſting in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage rather then in the largeneſſe of limbs, ſhe was not to doubt, but that love would furniſh him with new forces, ſeeing her life and welfare were in queſtion. Comforting her thus with ſufficient ſtrong reaſons, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her fearleſſe, and her hope greater. The time which he could ſtay with her, being ſweetly paſt away, he retired to his chamber, and ſlept two howrs; at the end whereof the Sun growing ſomewhat high, he aroſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf with his rich armour, wherein he ſeemed a <hi>Mars:</hi> and going to take horſe, he was told, that the forces of the Iland of Silvana, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſix thouſand choyce Knights, were arrived. New occaſions, ſaid he, then ſpeaking to the Captains that followed him, muſt have new reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: this ſupply comes very opportunely, and not to let them cool, put them preſently in battell aray with four thouſand of ours, the reſt ſhall ſerve to guard the walls, with the inhabitants; but be ſure to commence no fight till the combat between <hi>Fangomadan</hi> and me be ended; my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion will take care to diſpoſe of you as you ſhould be. Herewith the Knight of the Lions being particularly advertiſed of his deſigne, gave his Lance that he carried in honour to his Squire, and letting him go, inſtantly ordained that which was to be done, and put ten thouſand men in order after he had given notice thereof to <hi>Merodiana,</hi> who being richly attired, was already on the walls, for to encourage her lover, and be judge of his valour. I am reſolved, ſaid ſhe, when ſhe was acquainted with the buſines, in all things to follow the counſell of the valiant Knight of the Palms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let his command be executed. The Knight of the Lions ſeeing his men diſpoſed, and being very well ſatisfied with this anſwer, went out to behold the combat of his companion; who finding the Giant in the Liſts, met him ſo roughly with his Lance, that he made him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lie to the ground, himſelf remaining ſomewhat aſtoniſhed with the encounter. The Giant ſeeing himſelf overthrown, contrary to his expectation, roſe ſooner then could be imagined of ſo huge a maſſe of fleſh, and drawing out a great and weighty courtelax, ſtruck ſuch furious blows at his enemy, that the leaſt of them had been able to have cut him aſunder, if he had received it; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving avoided them with an admirable dexteritie, he charged him ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both with point and edge, that he amazed both the Armies.</p>
                     <p>The Giant ſtormed exceedingly for that he could not faſten one ſtroke on his adverſary; and caſting a thick ſmoke out of the viſor of his helmet, he hindred himſelf from ſeeing where to place his blows: whereas <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> that fought with judgement, ſpent not a minute unprofitably. The firſt fury of theſe warriours having endured above two howrs, the place was covered with the Giants Arms, which went to pieces whenſoever the rich ſword of his enemy fell upon them: the bloud trickled down from three or four parts of his body; and that which carried his choller to the higheſt degree of rage, was, that his adverſaries armour appeared entire. <hi>Merodiana</hi> beheld this combat with ſtrange motions; if the Giants courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax were aloft, ſhe feared the violence of it, and ſhe rejoyced when ſhe ſaw it light without effect; ſhe conſidered the valour of her Knight, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his agility in ſaving himſelf from his enemies ſword, wondred at the force of the blows which he gave; and above all, took extream pleaſure in the grace of his fight. Am I not very happy, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, to enjoy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17218:168"/>
a Knight the braveſt of all that live; and is it not exceeding glory for me to triumph over him, under whom the ſtrongeſt Giants of the earth are conſtrained to bow? Yes, without doubt, and I doe not repent the giving of him that which he hath nobly gotten: would to God <hi>Fangomadan</hi> were diſpatched out of the way, that my content might be perfect, I would then embrace this gallant warriour, and in deſpight of detraction declare before all, that I love him infinitely. Entertaining her ſelfe with theſe thoughts, ſhe fixed her eyes upon him, and perceiving the Giant to be more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and her lover far abler, as ſhe conceived, then at the beginning of the combat, ſhe was tranſported with exceſſe of joy. This while <hi>Alcidamant</hi> purſued his advantage, charged his enemy more furiouſly then before; and obſerving that <hi>Merodiana</hi> beheld him, accuſed himſelf for being ſo long defeating a man in the preſence of her, whoſe favours had made him moſt happy. Vext then then to ſee the victory ſo long diſputed, he took his ſword in both his hands, and letting it fall terribly on his enemies ſhield, he ſo aſtoniſhed him, that he made him reel three or four ſteps backward: whereupon taking his advantage, he redoubled ſuch a dangerous blow on his head, that he cleft it in twain, to the unſpeakable contentment of <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi> and her ſubjects, who ſeeing the good Knight of the Lions in the head of their troops, ſet forth in good array, and following the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Giant, who made them way with his ſword, they fell ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the enemies, amazed with the death of their maſter, that they ſlew above two thouſand at the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Advancing then whilſt the two ſtrangers refreſhed themſelves with the Armie, which commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to the skies, and eſpecially him of the Palms, whom they would fain have adored, if he would have permitted it; he preſented himſelf three dayes after before Alfarta, where the fight commencing by light skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, grew ſo hot upon the arrivall of the two invincible warriours, who were accompanied with eight hundred horſe, that they came to a generall battell; in the which the army of theſe new enemies, greater by the half then the former, were all cut in pieces by the exceeding valour of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> and his companion, who thundring whereſoever they went, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſouldiers, made them fight without feare, and ſo terrified their adverſaries, that they were dead before the ſwords of theſe lightnings of warre fell upon them. The enemies being in this manner utterly defeated, the whole Iſland reverted to the obedience of the faireſt <hi>Merodiana;</hi> who daily found out new entertainments for her lover: and having no other care but to pleaſe him, held her ſelfe the happieſt Princeſſe of the world.</p>

She made them deſcribe unto her his ſtature, the proportion of his body, his countenance, the colour of his hair, and the beauty of his face; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Nature had made him every way compleat, ſhe her ſelf kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fire which by little and little conſumed her; but paſſing to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for to know what marvells he had done for her ſiſter, ſhe cauſed them to recount unto her the manner of his fight, his courage, his skill, his blows, how he had moſt valiantly ſlain the King of Licagena, and put his armies to flight at the only ſight of his arms, which fully imprinted the character of love in her heart, and made her care for nothing ſo much as to finde out ſome occaſion to ſee him, and render him enamoured of her. O Gods, ſaid ſhe, how accompliſhed is this knight, if he have all thoſe parts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port confers upon him! Have I not reaſon to wiſh I may enjoy him? No queſtion I have, he is worthy of my favours, and deſerves to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of my bed, if he will accept of it. But alas! I very much fear my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath already prevented me of that fortune, and unable to reſiſt what I ſuffer, that ſhe hath given her ſelf to him, bereaving me of the means ſo to do. Yes, yes, I doubt it is but too true, for this Knight being every way ſo compleat, who could forbear loving him? Queſtionleſſe my ſiſter doth enjoy him, and I am out of hope to ſee the end of my deſires ſucceſſefull; howbeit, the dice are caſt, I am no longer mine own, and this conſideration muſt not ſtay my deſignes; if my ſiſter love him, I may love him too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him as ſhe doth, and cover my deſires with a pretended ignorance of their affections. This amorous and jealous Princeſſe, entertaining her ſelf after this manner, in the beginning of her paſſion, lived with ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, ſometimes ſhe reſolved to ſend a damſell unto him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him not refuſe her his ſuccour, for the delivering of her Iland from a dreadfull monſter, that rendered it almoſt inhabitable; and then imagining that her ſiſter would never permit him to undertake that voiage, becauſe ſhe would not let him go out of her ſight, ſhe was of another minde, and purpoſed to have him by ſome other wile; but not meeting with any, that was not either too long for the impatience of her deſires, or too difficult for any good ſucceſſe ſhe could hope from it, or too hazardous for to endanger all, ſhe could not draw any reſolution out of ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17218:169"/>
of thoughts. At length having more affection then to undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſhe concluded to quit her Iſland, and to ſee him at her ſiſters, under colour of going to congratulate with her for the happy iſſue of ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a war, hoping there to finde out ſome invention or other for to bring her deſigne to paſſe. Taking along with her then twelve Knights and ſix damſels, for ſhe had but an arm of the ſea to croſſe over, ſhe embarked her ſelf, and within four dayes after landed in her ſiſters Iſland, whom ſhe would not acquaint with her comming; but mounting upon a delicate nag, ſhe rode along till ſhe came to a forreſt, neer unto the which, cauſing certain pavillions to be pitched, ſhe reſolved to paſſe away the night there. Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then alone by her ſelf in the evening, and continually thinking on the means ſhe might uſe for to bring her buſineſſe wiſely about, ſhe perceived a huntſman paſſe by, of whom ſhe demanded what news there was at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodiana's</hi> Court. I can deliver you no better, anſwered he, then that which is reported of the excellencie of the Knight of the Palms, whom it ſeems hath a purpoſe to become Lord of this Countrey, whereunto our Princeſſe will not be much averſe, as every one probably conjectures, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at this inſtant in the world which ſhe regards ſo much, as the content of this Knight, with whoſe converſation ſhe is infinitely taken, ſhe leads him forth into the gardens and walks, where moſt of the trees carry marks of their loves, in a million of characters, graven on their barks; and when the heat of the day will not ſuffer them to walk, they withdraw into her chamber, where the time is inſenſibly ſpent in the aſſurances which they interchangably give of loving one another eternally. Theſe words were ſo many mortall wounds that renewed the grief and jealouſie of <hi>Silvana,</hi> who ſaw apparant proofs of that which ſhe had alwayes feared; ſhe ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her head, changed her colour every minute, many times bit her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for anger, and teſtified (if the huntſman had well obſerved her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that this news touched her to the quick; but he whoſe minde was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon his diſcourſe, went on thus: Briefly, theſe ſo great familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites induce us to beleeve that they are reſolved to make a marriage, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, we honour him already as if he were our Maſter, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying no leſſe reſpect to his commandements, then to thoſe which come from <hi>Merodiana:</hi> And to witneſſe the truth of that I ſay, aſſure your ſelf I would not walk thus with a purpoſe to lie all night in the wood, if it were not to lodge him Deer which to morrow he means to hunt in this Forreſt very early in the morning. But, Madam, time calls me away, wherefore you muſt excuſe me, if I break off thus abruptly. <hi>Silvana</hi> being better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the concluſion of this diſcourſe, then with the beginning, would not ſtay him any longer, but returned to her pavillion; where being arrived, ſhe called one of her Damſels whom ſhe favoured moſt, unto her, and ſaid, <hi>Falerina</hi> (ſo was ſhe named) out of the confidence which I repoſe in thee, I come to impart a ſecret unto thee; wherein, without any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the importance of the matter, I would have thee to ſerve me, not according to thy opinion, or as reaſon ſhall counſell thee, but according to my deſire and fanſie. I am deſperately in love with that brave Knight of the Palms, of whom ſuch wonders are reported of late: and whereas I have undertaken this voyage, it was not as I gave out, to congratulate with my ſiſter for her good ſucceſſe, but to ſee him, and to diſpoſe him to love me: to effect the which, a favourable occaſion preſents it ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17218:170"/>
it lies in thee to make me happy if thou wilt. To morrow he is to hunt a Stag in this wood; but let us make him take another way, and find out ſome invention to draw him hither, where, I doubt not, but I ſhall with little diffieultie, obtaine what I deſire: for I have beauty enough to make the moſt invincible man in the world to affect me. And this may eaſily be done: for thou ſhalt encounter him at his beginning to hunt, thou ſhalt humbly demand a boon of him, and withdrawing him from his company, thou ſhalt conduct him hither, where thou ſhalt find me alone, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with none but <hi>Elania,</hi> whom I can diſpoſe well enough to my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For I will command my train to ſet forth by break of day, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for me three leagues hence, and not to ſtir from that place, till they hear further from me. <hi>Falerina</hi> amazed with this ſpeech (for ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obſerved a great deal of modeſty in her Miſtreſſes actions) would willingly have replied for to have reduced her to a better regard of her honour; but perceiving that the venome had wrought its effect, and that her remedies would be to no purpoſe, ſhe promiſed her no leſſe fidelity then diligence. Sleeping then but a little, ſhe aroſe with the day, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to horſe, placed her ſelf in the way which the hunters were to take; where ſhe had not continued halfe an howr, but ſhe diſcovered a troop of Gentlemen, before whom ſhe preſented her ſelf, and eaſily diſcerning the Knight of the Palms from the reſt, ſhe acoſted him with a very good grace, and ſaid unto him, Noble Sir, I know not whether you be as cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as you are gallant. Gentlewoman, anſwered he with a ſmile, you ſhall underſtand that better if you thinke good to make uſe of me. Follow me then, replied ſhe, and be pleaſed to exchange the pleaſure of your hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a greater adventure, this enterpriſe will take you up but for one day: and if theſe Gentlemen be troubled with your departure, let this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe comfort them, that they ſhall ſee you again to night, or to morrow at the furtheſt within Alfarta. Knights cannot limit their return, ſaid he, becauſe they are ignorant of what will betide them in their adventures; howbeit ſeeing you aſſure them of my return by to morrow, I will not bid them farewell but till then: Whereupon the Damſell leading the way, he followed her with a marvellous deſire to know whither he was conducted; nevertheleſſe ſhe would reveal nothing till ſhe came within ſight of her Miſtreſſe pavillion. Here it is, ſaid ſhe, where you are to enter for to make ſatisfaction concerning a wrong that you have done. At theſe words the Knight alighting, and thinking that he was to fight, advanced with his ſword drawne, and his ſhield on his arm; but beholding in ſtead of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, a moſt beautifull Lady, who carried a million of charms in her eyes, made a ſtand, and being amazed, ſaid unto her, Madam, I am conducted hither for your ſervice. Yes, ſaid ſhe, reaching him her hand, but not with an intent to make you enter into combat with any: The commendations which the world gives you, have begot an extream deſire in me to ſee you; and to that end I have left my countrey, throughly ſatisfied in finding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more perfections in you, then report delivered. Madam, anſwered he, you may commend me as you pleaſe; but there is nothing in me which is not wholly at your ſervice: And be aſſured, that if I had known your mind, I would have gone to the utmoſt part of the earth for to have found you out, rather then you ſhould have taken the pains to come hither. I ſhall think it well beſtowed, replied ſhe, ſo as you do not prove ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17218:170"/>
and be not offended with my ſaying ſo, till you are acquainted with my meaning. Sir, I love you, and all the conſiderations I could bring for to contain me within the limits of modeſty and my duty, have been too weak againſt the force of your merits, which having deprived me of all power over my ſelf, have conſtrained me to come out of my State, to ſeek relief in your pitty,. It may be you will deſpiſe me, becauſe I preſent my ſelf thus unto you; and you may make an ill conſtruction of my carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: but if you underſtand your ſelf well, you wil excuſe my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Say that I have reaſon to love you, and not holding me immodeſt, will recompence my affection with the like, as alſo give me juſt cauſe to publiſh, that you are the moſt accompliſhed Knight that this day bears Arms. <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> to whom the like encounters were ſoveraigne favours, ſeeing ſuch amiable beauty in his power, did not ſo much as ſtand on the conſiderations which ſhe brought, to render her action the more allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but proteſting in what great obligations he was ingaged to her favour, the more powerfull in regard he had ſo little deſerved it, he diſarmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all the haſte he could; and beginning his careſſes with a kiſſe, made her a woman to both their incredible contents. After a world of dalliance, ſhe declared unto him, how ſhe was ſiſter to <hi>Merodiana,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the fear ſhe had, leſt his long converſation with her ſiſter, and their privacie together, might keep him from affecting her, it had ſomewhat troubled him, but that he remembred how an underſtanding lover ſeldome wants cunning devices to palliate his deſignes. Aſſuring her then, with a thouſand oathes and promiſes, never to loſe the memory of her favours, and to hold her as dear, or dearer, then her ſiſter, he paſt away the reſt of that day, and the night following with her, not ſo much as thinking how <hi>Merodiana</hi> would take his abſence, and found this content ſo pleaſing, that it grieved him to be deprived of it. Nevertheleſſe, being conſtrained to conſider what might follow of ſo long a ſtay, he took his Arms, went a little beyond the village where <hi>Silvana</hi> had commanded her train to abide, and placing himſelf under certain trees, waited till he ſaw her appear: then advancing into the middeſt of the high way, and deſiring to give this his new Miſtreſſe ſome entertainment, he ſent his Squire to her Knights, for to tell them, that he would not permit them to paſſe without breaking a Lance for their ſakes whom they beſt loved in the world. This meſſage made the Knights to laugh: for they could not imagine that one man alone could ſubdue them, and each of them ſtrove for the firſt courſe, when as one of <hi>Silvana's</hi> Damſels being got before the reſt, returned ſuddenly to acquaint them, that this Champion was the Knight of the Palms, ſo much redoubted over all the countrey. By my faith, ſaid then the forwardeſt of them, we will not encounter him: for ſo ſhould we be more fool-hardy then he is valiant. What, ſaid <hi>Silvana,</hi> that much deſired to ſee how far the valour of this Knight extended, will none of you run againſt him? Yes that we will, anſwered one, if you would take pleaſure in our defeat. Your misfortune would no way pleaſe me, ſaid <hi>Silvana,</hi> but it would much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me to ſee whether that be true which is ſo publiſhed of this Knight; and if you deſire to oblige me, run one courſe with him. I will obey you Madam, ſaid he, though I am ſure before hand of a fall; howſoever it will be glory to me, that I have run againſt the beſt Knight living: whereupon putting down his Bever, he advanced towards <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17218:171"/>
him ſo bravely, that he made him quit his ſaddle, and caſt him four or five paces of. I knew well enough, ſaid he, riſing leſſe hurt then was imagined, that I ſhould give my fellows occaſion to laugh; and that I ſhould not reſiſt that incomparable force which is dreadfull to the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Giants upon the earth; but I will be more charitable then they: for I will let you know, that this Princeſſe which you ſee, is ſiſter to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Merodiana,</hi> to the end you may not employ your Lance againſt her Knights. You have reaſon, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> to beleeve that I will not run againſt them, and if I had known you, I had not juſted with you; and that you may not complain of your fall, I am ready to repair that fault when you pleaſe. Whereupon advancing towards the fair <hi>Silvana,</hi> he ſaluted her as though he had never ſeen her before: and riding along by her, they took the way to Alfarta, where the faireſt <hi>Merodiana</hi> received them at the firſt very heartily, never doubting of the prank which was plaid to her preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; but who can blind the eyes of a lover? This Lady calling to mind the abſence of her Knight, led away, as ſhe was informed, by a Damſell which was ſhewed to her a little after, preſently ſuſpected, not the matter as it was, but ſomething near unto it, inſomuch that ſhe obſerved their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therein finding but too much proof of their love, ſhe grew ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that ſhe could not reſt. On the other ſide, <hi>Silvana</hi> was in the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: for ſeeing how coldly her Knight ſpake to her in the preſence of <hi>Merodiana,</hi> and marking the amorous looks they gave one another, it mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her; nevertheleſſe, they concealed their thoughts, and watched for more pregnant teſtimonies, to complain upon a ſure ground; but <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> was ſo diſcreet, that he deceived them both. My deareſt Knight, ſaid <hi>Merodiana</hi> ſighing when ſhe had him in bed, take it not ill, I pray you, if the extremity of my paſſion conſtrains me to be a little jealous of you, you look upon my ſiſter with too affectionate an eye; and the care which you ſeem to have of her ſervice appears to me more then good will, ſhe is amiable, you deſerve to be ſought unto, what may I then think of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity? Too much I fear for my content; but if you will conſider what you owe to ſo many carreſſes which you have received from me, how I undo my ſelf to oblige you, that regard no ſlanderous tongue to give you ſatisfaction, and how I have freely beſtowed on you what was moſt dear unto me for to pleaſe you, I hope you will not be my ruine, nor impart your imbraces to another, ſeeing no man partakes of my kiſſes, but will be pleaſed to let me onely enjoy you, that ſeeks for nothing ſave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion how to delight you. Theſe words finiſhing with tears, made our Frenchman ſomewhat to repent, who ſeeking to excuſe his fault, covered it with the name of reſpect, repreſented that in regard ſhe was her ſiſter, he was to carry himſelf fairly towards her, proteſting that he had never ſo much as a thought of that which ſhe imagined, he ſomewhat pacified her, and interrupted the courſe of her complaints; after which he was ſure to have the like of the fair <hi>Silvana.</hi> Deareſt love, ſaid ſhe when ſhe could ſpeak particularly to him. I have great cauſe to complain, my ſiſter hath all your careſſes, ſhe hath dayes to enjoy your company, whereas I have not minutes; your eyes are alwayes fixed on her, and I but a few glances; if you ſpeak to me, it is with too much reſpect, and too little love: what have I done to deſerve ſo cold an entertainment? or what have I not done to be more kindly intreated? I have freely given my ſelf to you, but alas! it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17218:171"/>
may be your neglect proceeds from thence. I have left my countrey for to ſee you, and yet I cannot enjoy that, but anothers careſſes makes you find no delight in my embraces. Now I would fain know what is the cauſe of it, ſhe hath no advantage of me, we are ſiſters, her beauty exceeds not mine (at leaſtwiſe I think ſo) I accompany my kiſſes with as much Art as a woman can uſe, to render them more pleaſing; love you as much, or rather more then ſhe doth (for I know that all the affections of the earth do not equall the violence of my flames) yet I muſt ſuffer whilſt another lives contented, and reaps the reward of my travels. Ah, this is great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, carry leſſe reſpect to perſons, and be more equall. If you think your ſelf obliged by the conſideration of your being here with her, ſhall not I give you in the Iland o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Silvana the ſame pleaſures which you find here? Yes, my deareſt, I will find out, if it be poſſible, far greater delights, and ſo behave my ſelf that you ſhall not repent your abandoning her for to follow me. He that beholds a rock between two ſeas, ſometimes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the one, and then again with the other, may figure out this Knight between theſe two ſiſters, equally importuned with either of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. He loved <hi>Merodiana</hi> very much; <hi>Silvana's</hi> kiſſes were of no leſſe power with him, her reaſons moved him, the others ſighes found him not inſenſible, his heart was divided betwixt them, and taking pleaſure in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodiana's</hi> careſſes, he met with as much content in thoſe of her beautifull ſiſter. At length this laſt ſpeech which <hi>Silvana</hi> made, had prevailed with him, had he not called to mind the reſolution he had taken to carry himſelf in ſuch manner, as he would loſe neither the one nor the other of them. Returning then the ſame reaſons, the ſame excuſes, the ſame diſſembling, the ſame oathes, and the ſame careſſes which he had uſed to <hi>Merodiana,</hi> he ſomewhat appeaſed her diſpleaſure; nevertheleſſe he could not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emean himſelf, but that there remained ſo powerfull a ſuſpition in the minds of theſe ſiſters, as converting into jealouſie, it made them odious one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they laboured wiſely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o diſguiſe their thoughts. If <hi>Merodiana</hi> was alone, ſhe preſently imagined that her Knight was in her ſiſters arms. If <hi>Silvana</hi> ſaw him not, ſhe beleeved he was in private with her ſiſter, they went to one anothers chamber, and met oftentimes in the mid-way: they were ſiſters, love made them ſecretly rivals. <hi>Merodiana</hi> obſerved all <hi>Silvanas</hi> actions, <hi>Silvana</hi> had a continuall deſire to underſtand what her ſiſter did; briefly, all their motions were ſuſpitions, their ſuſpitions ſtrong jealouſies, and their jealouſies inſupportable griefs. It is not a care of my honour, ſaid <hi>Merodiana,</hi> that induces my ſiſter to watch me in this faſhion, much leſſe any exceſſe of affection to me: for I know her thoughts but too well, it muſt be then the ſpite ſhe bears me for croſſing her deſire; but why ſhould I give entertainment to a controller of my actions? ſhe is amorous of my Knight, ſhe loves him paſſionatly, and would fain deprive me of him, but I will not endure her boldneſſe; and quietly deſiring her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto her Iland, I ſhall appeare rather an angred ſiſter then an ill lover; howbeit I will wait a fit opportunity, and in the mean time uſe ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to her that may make her acknowledge her fault; but if ſhe prove ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, we will part never to ſee one another again as ſiſters; and love, who admits of no conſideration, that will have one regardleſſe of times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, places, and conditions ſhall authorize my reſentment. Whilſt ſhe entertained her ſelfe in this manner, <hi>Silvana</hi> did the like. I perceive well
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17218:172"/>
enough, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, that my ſiſter looks not upon me but with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that ſhe forbids this Knight to talk with me, and that I expect nothing ſave diſpleaſure: wherefore I reſolve to return home, howbeit if be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will be accompanied with him, ſo ſhall I be no longer croſt in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. He is courteous, he is obliged to me, he will deny me nothing I ſhall demand of him: wherefore covering my deſigne with the pitty I take of my people and countries, which every day fall to ruine by the cruelty of a monſter that continually deſtroyes them, I will beſeech him to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me, like a valiant and generous Knight; and if I can get him once out of my ſiſters hands, I will never permit him to undertake ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, but preſerve him for my future contentment. Inſiſting then on this reſolution, as the beſt ſhe could deſire, ſhe ſaid unto him one day in the preſence of <hi>Merediana,</hi> who commended to every one the aſſiſtance which ſhe had received from him, Sir, you ſee how your benefits are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that praiſes are alwayes in the mouthes of ſuch as are obliged, and generous Knights doe ordinarily find ſome recompence in the glory is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their vertues: If you had done any thing for me, I ſhould ſpeak of you as others do, and would raiſe your name to heaven, holding the world unworthy to retain the greatneſſe of it. Madam, anſwered he, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her there, the fault ſhall not be mine if you have not the ſatisfaction to ſee me combat for your ſervice; doe but furniſh me with occaſion, and you ſhall find me ready whenſoever you pleaſe. My people, ſaid ſhe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by a cruell monſter, reach out their hands unto you; now adviſe with your ſelf whether you will oblige me by ſuccouring them. Moſt willingly, Madam, anſwered he, and ſhall think my ſelf moſt happy to ſerve you in this occaſion. We will depart then to morrow, replied ſhe, in the mean time take order for your journey. <hi>Merodiana</hi> hearing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſeeing a departure reſolved ſo ſoon, knew not what to ſay, ſhe would have accuſed her lover, but having very great teſtimonies of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhe laid all the fault upon her ſiſters malice, whom ſhe blamed in very plain tearms, ſaying that ſhe ought not to precipitate the dayes of ſo brave a Knight, who could not enter into that combat without apparant loſſe of his life; but <hi>Silvana</hi> reſolved the contrary, and caring for nothing but how to draw him from thence, made no reckoning of her anger. All this night was beſtowed in ſighs and tears, and <hi>Merodiana</hi> a thouſand times curſt her ſiſters comming to ſee her. I will not let you go to imminent death, ſaid ſhe, and notwithſtanding any promiſe you have made my ſiſter, you ſhall not ſtir from hence, ſhe is too impudent to be obeyed, and I knew her comming too well for to leave her the liberty to put it in practiſe: but if you be reſolved to go with her, be confident that I will follow you, and croſſe the pleaſures which ſhe expects, as much as ſhe hath done my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. O God, Madam, ſaid he, kiſſing her moſt amorouſly, do you make doubt of my faith? now truly you do me infinite wrong, for ſo many oathes and proteſtations as I have made to you, ſhould, me thinks, remove this falſe opinion out of your imagination, I muſt go, becauſe I am obliged therunto by my promiſe; but Madam, be aſſured it ſhall be to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently again, if I happen to live after the combat which I purpoſe to enter into againſt the Serpent; and to perſwade you to beleeve what I ſay, behold your ſelf in your glaſſe, then think upon <hi>Silvana,</hi> and you ſhall find that your beauties being unlike, that ſhe having leſſe charms then you, leſſe

love, and leſſe merit, I ſhall never abandon you to follow her: Live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in the expectation of my return, and in the mean time permit me to imbrace occaſions that may acquire my glory; ſo ſhall you teſtifie a true affection to me, and oblige me to eſteem my ſelf happy in your love. Theſe ſo powerfull reaſons having mitigated, but not defaced <hi>Merodiana's</hi> grief, ſhe ſlept till morning, when giving him a farewell kiſſe, he retired to arm himſelf, leaving her in tears and ſorrow.</p>

Then this amorous Lady, more openly ſhewing the joy ſhe conceived for being freed from a concurrent in her love, rendered the length of the way ſo ſhort by a million of oaths to love him eternally, and by as many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt her ſiſters jealouſie, that he found himſelf almoſt out of the wood, before he thought of being in it. The place repreſenting to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the pleaſure which he had received at his firſt acquaintance with <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana,</hi> he would fain have ſtept aſide with her for to alight under ſome buſh; but conceiving that they could not blinde the eyes of ſo many perſons which followed them, they travelled to the ſea ſide, where a ſhip attended to tranſport them over; howbeit, <hi>Silvana</hi> would not imbark this night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew ſhe ſhould not have the liberty aboord as in her tents; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, to avoid all fear of diſcoverie, ſhe cauſed her train to be ſhipped, reſerving no body about her, but <hi>Falerina, Alderia,</hi> her Knight, and him of the Lions, who having good intelligence with <hi>Falerina,</hi> made but one bed with her and the fair <hi>Alderia,</hi> which was not more ſquemiſh then the other, whilſt his companion took up a place by <hi>Silvana's</hi> ſide. The night being ſpent with many more careſſes and kiſſes then I am able to deliver, the Knights armed themſelves at break of day, and ſeeing that a favourable gale ſollicited their departure, they took their Ladies by the arm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed them aboord; whereupon, commanding the Maſter to hoiſt ſail, they began to cut the waves, which on a ſudden ſwelling very high, had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly frighted the women, but that they were cheared with the preſence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17218:173"/>
and ſpeech of the Knights. Howbeit, the ſtorm increaſing, the noiſe of the waters growing every minute more dreadfull, and the night, which rendered every thing full of horrour, arriving thereupon, gave them new fears of ſhipwrack; inſomuch, that <hi>Silvana</hi> caſt her ſelf into <hi>Alcidamants</hi> arms, who deſiring to make uſe of the darkneſſe, without any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at all of the tempeſt, he fell a kiſſing of her, laid his hand on her breaſts, and finding his ſpirit raiſed, he careſſed her ſo ſweetly, that ſhe vowed afterward, ſhe never felt ſo much pleaſure in ſo little time. Whilſt they drew their delight out of a ſubject dreadfull, and full of danger, <hi>Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> intreated <hi>Falerina</hi> in the ſame manner, and making her loſe her ſelf in his imbraces, kept her ſo, till the day and calm weather arriving together, cauſed them to retire wonderfully ſatisfied with the love of each other. The Maſter, finding himſelf neer to the Iſland of Silvana, yet far enough from the place where he meant to have put in, advertiſed his Lady thereof, who underſtanding that it was on that coaſt which the monſter had ruined, ſhe would with all haſte have made from it, but that ſhe was retained by the Knight of the Palms. How Madam, ſaid he, will you oppoſe my glory, and make more eſteem of my life, then of mine honour? What would all the world ſay, and particularly your ſiſter, whom I left onely to defeat this creature, if I ſhould part hence without ſeeing it? Not to lie, I ſhould in a moment loſe all the honour I have acquired by ſo many labours; let us land a Gods name, or if for your own part you be afraid, permit me to do that which becomes a good Knight, who will not be wanting to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor fail in his duty. Ah, my Knight, ſaid ſhe, with her eyes full of tears, will you yeild more to your own deſires then to mine? Have you forgotten how you have told me a thouſand times that you would never diſobey any commandment I ſhould lay upon you? And yet you will now do a thing which infinitely diſpleaſes me, and more cruell then can be expreſt, you ſeek my deſtruction, in running headlong to your own. Do but conſider beforehand what danger there is in affronting this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the moſt horrible and dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I make a dear account (as I ought) of my people, and countrey; but you are not of that conſideration, as to prefer common men and lands before your ſafety; Let them periſh, I beſeech you, and tempt not the power of the Gods, to go to meet dangers, which without blame, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may avoid. The glory you aſpire unto, is to be found in actions that one man may bring to paſſe, not in deſparation. But if you will not be retained by the care of your ſelf, yet at leaſtwiſe be moved with my tears, with my ſighs, with the regard of my very life it ſelf, which ſhal not be long if you perſiſt in your wilfulneſſe. Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> pardon me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, if I ſay that your requeſt is unjuſt, and that you wrongfully complain of me for not rendering that obedience to your commandments which I ought. You brought me hither for the good of your people, and now you are offended that I indeavour to relieve them. I know not what to ſay to this humour, and although the pity which you ſeem to have of me obliges me; nevertheleſſe, it is ſo repugnant to my reputation, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow of it without infinite blame. You affirm, that we are to ſeek ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures which are eaſie; ſuch will never give us glory, and therefore we preſent our ſelves to thoſe which ſeem impoſſible; you think to divert me
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17218:173"/>
from this deſigne, by figuring forth unto me a monſter, dreadfull beyond all that ever was; that, Madam, works in me a contrary effect: If an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Knight could overcome it, I would not vouchſafe to land heer for to fight with it, the difficulty which I meet with in this enterpriſe, gives me a marvellous deſire to undertake it to day rather then to morrow. Ceaſe then, I beſeech you, from afflicting your ſelf, and reſtraining theſe tears, which more reproach your weakneſſe, then teſtifie your love, command me to march on couragiouſly, that I may triumph over this terrible enemy under the favour of your beauty.</p>
                     <p>Your reaſons ſeem ſo juſt, anſwered ſhe, that I am not able to with-hold you any longer from this adventure; but ah! my Knight, when I think how I behold you craſh: between the teeth of this horrible Serpent, or torn in pieces by his mercileſſe claws, I cannot forbear weeping, when I call to mind how I was the cauſe of this your death; howbeit, ſeeing you are reſolved to attempt this combat, go under the protection of the Gods, my Knights ſhall aſſiſt you. By no means, Madam, ſaid he: for I will be accompanied with none but my friend heer, and my Squire, that ſhall onely go to know what will become of me. Whereupon cauſing himſelf to be landed with <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Arnides,</hi> after he had deſired the beauteous <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to ſtay for him in the ſame part, they got to horſe, and rode along ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly aſtoniſhed to ſee all the countrey round about diſinhabited, a multitude of houſes ruined, and trees every where overthrown by the wonderfull force of this formidable Monſter. Having travelled certaine howrs, they approched to a forreſt, entertaining themſelves with ordinary diſcourſe, when as their horſes began to ſnore, prick up their cars, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil back, maugre all the ſpurring they could uſe, for to make them advance into the wood. Never credit me, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> if this beaſt bee not amongſt theſe trees; whereupon liſtning attentively, they heard a dreadfull noyſe, with ſome horrible hiſſing, and ſeeing two or three little trees overturn, they perceived the monſter whom they ſought, comming forth with a ſtrange fury: he had the body of a Dragon, as big as an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, covered with ſcales of divers colours; he had two heads, the one of a Serpent with a three forked tongue, the other of a furious Lion: his legges were different the one from the other; one of the foremoſt had the claws of a Serpent, two foot and a half long, and ſo ſharp, that they would pierce even ſteele; the other was armed with the paws of a Lion, able to cruſh Iron, and tear armour in pieces; behind he was ſupported with two legges of an horſe, wonderfull great; after which he trailed a tail ſo long and ſtrong, that therewith he eaſily overthrew all the trees which ſtood in his way. <hi>Alcidamants</hi> courage was new put to the teſt: for beholding a creature ſo deformed and monſtrous, he marvelled how Nature could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in ſuch a form, and could not chuſe but fear to fall into the danger of his paws or teeth, which were in each head a cubit long and more; but aſſuming confidence from the glory which he ſhould acquire by defeating this monſter, he deſired his companion to retire, and recommending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, he ſet ſpurs to his horſe, who ſtaring up with his mane, ran clean away with him, do what he could to retain him: but at length having ſtayed him, he quickly alighted, took his Lance, and making head to the Monſter, which followed him with incredible celerity, he ran it ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into one of his chops that ſtood wide gaping, as it paſt into his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17218:174"/>
throat, where it brake, after it had made a very deep wound; but not able to withſtand the violence of the encounter, he was overthrown to the ground, with ſuch pain, that he thought his body had been all cruſhed: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe riſing up ſuddenly, for the Monſter was gone on, he drew out his rich ſword, and with a reſolute courage waited to charge him as he ſhould paſſe by; but conſidering that his legerity would more advantage him then his force, he concluded to combat him with judgement, ſtepping lightly aſide, then when he ſaw him return with rage, he gave him ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a blow full upon the body, that it was able to have cleft a rock; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in vain: for he found his ſcales ſo hard, as the Sword left no mark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind of the ſtroke. O God! ſaid he then aſtoniſhed, what can I expect from this combat, but the death which <hi>Silvana</hi> ſo many times foretold me to day, Lord aſſiſt me, and puniſh me not according to the greatneſſe of my ſinnes? Whilſt he made this ſhort prayer, the dangerous Monſter ſpared him not: for preſently turning about, he laid hold on his ſhield with his Serpents claws, and having torn it from his arm, laboured to bite it in pieces with his teeth, offering at the ſame inſtant to ſeaze on the Knights armour with his Lions paw; but he that with reaſon feared theſe approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, leapt wonderfully quick a tone ſide, and grieved to ſee himſelf thus deſtitute of a ſhield, he took his ſword in both his hands, and therewith cut his paw ſheer off at one blow; whereat he gave ſo lowd a cry, that it was heard 3 leagues off.

The Monſter feeling ſo dangerous a wound, mounted once again into the aire, with ſuch an incredible force, that hee lighted ten paces off when he came to ground, which gave our Frenchman leaſure to riſe, ſo bruiſed with his fall, and ſuffering ſuch pain from the hurts the Monſter had made with his teeth, that he could hardly ſtand; howbeit forcing himſelf, and drawing new ſtrength out of his generous courage, he approached the Monſter again, who made a moſt horrible noyſe, and by good fortune giving him a thruſt juſt in the eye, ran him to the very brain, but being ſurprized before he could retire him, the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter caught him with his Serpents claws, and in the pangs of death that tormented him, drag'd him up and down a good while: then taking him between his teeth, as if he would make a ſepulchre for him of his throat, he made way for his bloud to iſſue out at ſundry places, and had without doubt killed him in this ſort, had not the wound which he had received in the belly, cauſed him to tumble down, breathing out his laſt. <hi>Alcidamant</hi>

Hereupon her people arrived, who thinking it almoſt incredible, that one man could kill ſo great, ſo furious, and ſo formidable a monſter, publiſhed his praiſes in ſuch manner, as if they had no tongues but to proclaim him for the moſt excellent Knight of the earth.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt theſe lovers lived thus without croſſe or fear, whilſt the trees and gardens were witneſſes of their pleaſures, whilſt they bathed themſelves in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and every day incountered ſome new way or other to render them more pleaſing, all forrain parts were filled with admiration, and the name of the Knight of the Palms became ſo famous, that there was no other talk but of his valour; the pictures of the monſter ran from countrey to countrey, his figure was wondered at, his greatneſſe and force was conſidered, and every one held it for a miracle, that one man alone had the courage to affront him, forces ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat him, and ſo much valour as to kill him. <hi>Merodiana</hi> having ſent <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> to obſerve the carriage of her Knight, was advertiſed of this victory, which made her reſolve to paſſe into the Iſland of Silvana, for to draw her lover out of her ſiſters arms; but ſhe loſt her labour, for the Deſtinies, that meant to diſpoſe otherwiſe of the exploits and fortunes of this Knight, would not permit her to ſee him, for to hinder his happineſſe, and thus it was: The fame of the glorious victory, which he had obtained, running from countrey to countrey with pictures thereof, as I have related before, came to the cars of <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> the faireſt and moſt valourous, but withall the proudeſt Princeſſe of the world. She was daughter to the Emperour of Tramazond, a mighty Potentate, and that deriving his originall from the Sun, found the antiquity of his houſe in the race of the Gods, an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that rendered this beauty ſo glorious, that ſhe eſteemed no mortall wight capable of her alliance, nor worthy of ſo great and precious a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This Princeſſe then, who deſpiſed men, and ranked her ſelf among the Deities, who thought ſhe deſerved Altars, and that held nothing ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nor redoubtable as her arms; hearing the commendations which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one gave to this Knight, could not beleeve at firſt that he was ſo ſtrong,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17218:175"/>
ſo valiant, and every way ſo compleat as was reported; but having uſde the means to have his picture made to the life, together with that of the Monſter which he had ſlain, ſhe beheld it often with wonder, and finding nothing to be added to the proportion of his body, and leſſe to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his beauty, ſhe ſaid; If the Painter hath not flattered this Knight, he is in my mind the moſt accompliſhed under heaven: But that which moſt amazes me, is to ſee him ſo young, and to hear tell how he hath defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Monſter, whoſe figure alone gives terrour to the moſt confident; verily he is worthy of a place among our Gods, the world may adore him, and if I were at any time to bow unto the affection of a mortall wight, I ſhould never chuſe any other to ſort my greatneſſe withall. But good Gods! what do I ſay, if I were to bow unto the affection of a mortal wight? me thinks I feel already a new paſſion that torments me; &amp; by what I could comprehend from the complaints of them that have been in love, it muſt needs be that love whoſe power hath been ſo vaunted of, and that means to triumph over me, as over all the reſt of humane kind. For having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes diſdained to ſet mine eyes upon any one, I am marvellouſly ſatisfied with this picture, the ſight of this warriour pleaſeth me, and I find ſuch powerfull charms in him, that I love him with an extream deſire to ſee him. O ye Gods! from whence comes ſo great a change, <hi>Traſiclea?</hi> Where is that ſpirit which made thee raiſe thy thoughts to the heavens? Art thou ſo weak as to ſuffer thy ſelf to be vanquiſhed by a man, nay to take delight in confeſſing it? Where are thoſe high reſolutions of thine, to joyn thy ſelf to none but one of the greateſt of the Gods, as capable alone to enjoy the merit of thy beauty? I vow this is a ſtrange baſeneſſe in thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore altering thy mind, reaſſume thy former motions. My former moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? why this is the way to follow my former motions: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Gods which I meet not withall in this Knight: behold, here is the beſt face in the world, this grace contents me wonderfully, this gentle eye demonſtrates an agreeable diſpoſition, this warlicke counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a moſt generous courage, and this ſhape an incomparable valour: What ſhall hinder me then from loving him with ſuch infinite perfections? Nothing, nor ſhall I ever be perſwaded that I fail in my choyce, ſince I find in him all that can be wiſhed for in a divinity. But to what end ſerves all this, if he do not know my mind? For nothing but to trouble me, wherefore I will no longer forbear to let him underſtand that I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to love him, ſo ſhall I be no way acceſſary to my own ſuffering. In this manner did this proud beauty, forcing her naturall inclination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to ſee our Frenchman; but deſiring firſt to be ſatisfied, how far his valour extended, ſhe took her Arms, where with ſhe was as much redoubted as with the charms of her eyes; and encharging a Damſell with a picture which repreſented her ſo well to the life, that there wanted nothing but ſpeech: ſhe left her fathers Court, and rode four dayes together with little or no intermiſſion, till ſhe came neere the Iſland of Silvana, where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted her ſelf in a ſhepheards cottage, that joyned cloſe to a bridge, over the which he was neceſſarily to paſſe; and giving her Damſell, that followed her, ample inſtructions of her pleaſure, as alſo aſſuring her that ſhe ſhould find her in that place, ſhe ſent her into the Iſland of Silvana for to draw the Knight of the Palms from thence. This Damſell then proceeding in her journey, travelled three dayes with much amazement to hear nothing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17218:176"/>
ſpoken of but the commendations of this warriour; and being come neer to the capitall Citie of the Iſland, ſhe met with twelve Damſels, and as many Knights, whereof one having kindly ſaluted her, demanded whither ſhe went: I am going, ſaid ſhe, to ſee the wonder of the world, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Knight of the Palms, the <hi>Hercules</hi> of this Iſland, and the <hi>Mars</hi> of the earth, that I may one day boaſt I have ſeen the onely rarity of our time. Now beleeve me, ſaid the Knight, you do not praiſe him without cauſe: for if you had beheld him in the middeſt of Armies, as I have often done, when he fought for the beautifull <hi>Merodiana,</hi> who is going heer in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for to ſee him, you would ſay more if it were poſſible. I have heard, ſaid the Damſell, what he did in the wars: for it is bruited every where, that in ſingle co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bat he defeated the ſo redoubted King of <hi>Licagena,</hi> and routed his forces with ſuch marvellous valour, that in an army of thirty or fourty thouſand men which he had, ſcarce two hundred eſcaped: But it is ſtrange, that neither in all this countrey, nor of any one that ever I did meet withall yet, could I never learn what he is Marvell not at that, ſaid the Knight, theſe great warriours go alwayes unknown through the world, nor ever diſcover themſelves, but upon ſome extream neceſſity. I have known him divers months together in <hi>Merodiana's</hi> court, yet could I never learn his name, or condition, nor do I think, our Miſtreſſe, who queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hath a great power over him, can ſo much as tell of whence he is. He is very reſerved, ſaid the Damſell; but I imagine that he conceales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo, to decline all diverſions from his enterpriſes: howſoever we muſt conclude, that he is the prime Knight of the world. This diſcourſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried them to the Citie, the Damſell followed <hi>Merodiana,</hi> who was received by her ſiſter with much ſhew of gladneſſe, though in her heart a thouſand times ſhe curſed her comming; howbeit underſtanding that the Knight of the Palms was gone a hunting, and would not return again till the next day, ſhe preſently got to horſe again, thinking ſhe ſhould have more liberty to ſpeak with him in the woods, then at the Court; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her ſelf which way he went, ſhe got to the Forreſt, where having rode up and down a good while, at length ſhe incountred a place where the Knight of the Palms, in a hunters habit, was ſtaying to refreſh himſelf. Sir, ſaid ſhe, gueſſing by his goodly preſence it was he, can you tell me where I may finde the Knight of the Palms, who they ſay is in this forreſt? Gentlewoman, anſwered he, you ſee him heer before you, ready to do you any ſervice, if you pleaſe to employ him. Why then, ſaid ſhe, my travell is at an end, and my mind at reſt. My Lord, I do not ſeek you to importune you with any requeſt, but to let you ſee a peece, the like, I am perſwaded, is not in the world again: Whereupon opening the box, ſhe preſented him the picture of <hi>Traſiclea;</hi> which as ſoon as ever he had caſt his eye upon it, ſo tranſported and troubled him, that he ſtaggered as if he had been ſtruck with thunder. Ah! what a beauty is here, ſaid he, and who would beleeve that Nature could be ſo prodigal in the diſtribution of her graces? Surely all her treaſures are here aſſembled, to make this creature perfect; and, queſtionleſſe, ſhe took the patern of her out of heaven. You may well imagine ſo, ſaid the Damſell: for ſhe derives her originall from the father of the ſtarres; but alas! you cannot judge of half her perfections: for this peece repreſents not the grace which ſhe giveth to her actions, and deprives her of the moity of her glory. I eaſily beleeve it, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:17218:176"/>
but had ſhe leſſe then I behold, it were enough to force the moſt inſenſible ſoul of the world. Boaſt then, ſaid ſhe, that you have ſeen the rareſt thing in the earth, and reſtore me my picture, for I mean to take my leave of you, that I may not be benighted before I get me a lodging. How Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid he, will you ſo ſoon bereave me of a thing whereon all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent depends? Be not ſo cruell, I beſeech you, but let me injoy the ſight of this Goddeſſe a little longer. By my faith, ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, Ile make no bargain with you, untill you have ſworn to grant me ſuch a boon as I ſhall one day ask of you. You ſhall have all that you can deſire of me, anſwered he. Why then this picture is yours, ſaid ſhe, and further to oblige you, I will bring you to the ſpeech of her whom it repreſents, and place you in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. O God, ſaid he, can I be ſo happy!

Their news extreamly diſcontented the two ſiſters, who having recourſe unto their tears, reciprocally accuſed each other of ſo great a misfortune: Their grief was alike, their complaints were the ſame, and ſo was their opinion, that they were betrayed by one anothers malice. My Knight unwilling to diſpleaſe my ſiſter, ſaid <hi>Silvana,</hi> hath abſented himſelf, becauſe he will not careſſe me before her, though I think he will will return again aſſoon as ſhe is gone; but I have great cauſe to complain of him, for this fear teſtifies love, and puts me in a jealouſie. The abſence of my ſervant, ſaid <hi>Merodiana,</hi> gives me no leſſe content then vexation, it ſhews both reſpect and weakneſſe, it makes me ſuſpect ſome familiarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſiſter and him, and yet declares that his affection lives ſtill for me: They have been inward together, I beleeve it, nevertheleſſe, I will not impute that fault unto him, for it is a hard matter for a Gentleman to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſurpriſes of a ſhameleſſe woman; my ſiſter hath preſented her ſelf unto him, occaſions tempt men, and make the moſt reſolved to erre; but I muſt divert this miſchief, retire my ſelf, and ſend to him to come unto me; he is much indebted to my favours, and I have alwayes known him too amorous for to fail me. Whereupon, calling for ink and paper ſhe wrote a letter, ſuch as her paſſion indited, and commanding <hi>Ciſtenia</hi> not to

Entertaining himſelf in this manner, and with the Damſells diſcourſe, three dayes paſt away without any adventure at all; but on the fourth, approaching a bridge, he ſaw a Knight preſenting himſelf with a Phoenix in the midſt of his ſhield, ſitting his horſe in ſuch a comely manner, of ſo brave a preſence, and ſo rich armed, that it did him good to behold him. Now on my faith, ſaid he, turning him to the Damſell, yonder is the gallanteſt Knight that ever I beheld; but I doubt, in regard of the deſire I have to meet with no impediment in my journey, that I muſt be forced to combat with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall have our paſſage free; howſoever, if I be conſtrained to it, I carry the key at the end of my lance. Herewith, the Knight approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a pikes length of him, ſaid: Noble Sir, I am obliged by the commandment of a Lady, that ſoveraignizes over me, to die upon this bridge in maintaining that ſhe is the faireſt in the world, or bring her the ſhields of all ſuch as ſhall paſſe over it; wherefore I am come to demand yours, and in caſe you deny it me, then to wiſh you to prepare your ſelf to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17218:177"/>
fight with me, though I am very loath to hinder the deſignes of ſo brave a Knight as you ſeem to be. Verily, anſwered he, if the condition of your enterpriſe did not extend to the glory of Ladies, your gentle language would peradventure have made me take my ſhield from off my arm, and given it you without fighting; but ſeeing there is queſtion of the honour of beauties, we muſt ſee which of us two is the ſtrongeſt, for having been ſo happy as of late to ſerve the faireſt and moſt accompliſhed Princeſſe of the earth, I cannot leave you in the errour you are in, nor ſuffer any other to be preferred before her Excellence. We may perchance have one and the ſame Miſtris, ſaid the Knight of the Phoenix, and ſhe whom you adore, may be her that I ſerve. So much the worſe for you, ſaid the Knight of the Palms, that being a juſt occaſion to make us everlaſting enemies, for not enduring a concurrent, the diſpatch of you ſhall free me of all compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or I ſhall leave you without jealouſie by my death. Herewith, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about their horſes, they came to encounter one another with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the ground trembled under them; their fortune was equall, and their lances were broken upon each others ſhield without any other effect, ſo as they paſſed by one another unmoved, like two ſtrong towers ſhock'd together by the violence of the winds. <hi>Alcidamant</hi> being extreamly vext to ſee his adverſary in his ſaddle, couragiouſly drew out his ſword with an intent to aſſault him; but he of the Phoenix deſired him to run ſtill untill ſuch time as one of them was overthrown. By my life, ſaid he, wood is too weak for our deſires, and the importance of the quarrell; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, do as you pleaſe; whereupon the Knight of the Bridge having cauſed four lances to be brought, each of them choſe that which he thought was the ſtrongeſt, and taking the field again, they incountered once more in ſuch a rude manner, both with ſhields and bodies, that they ſeemed to have hit againſt great rocks; the Knight of the Bridge loſt a ſtirrup, paſſing along with ſome aſtoniſhment, and the Frenchman finiſhed his courſe ſomewhat amazed at the valour of his enemy, whom he commended in his thoughts for the ſtrongeſt that ever he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Howbeit, rage and jealouſie together made him take up the third lance, wherewithall he reſolved to vanquiſh, or to die; when as he perceived three furious Giants to appear, whereof one eſpying the Palms on his ſhield, cryed out: Mighty Gods, how much am I bound to thank you for putting the murderer of <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomadan</hi> into my hands, that I may in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Herewith <hi>Alcidamant</hi> perceiving him to make towards him, turned his horſe about, and ſetting ſpurs hard to him, ran his Lance ſo juſt againſt this new commers viſor, that he paſt it quite thorow his head, ſending him ſtark dead to the earth, to the infinite diſcontent of the other two, who charging him both at one inſtant with two heavie and terrible blows, made him bend with his ſhoulders even to the ſaddle bow; but raiſing himſelf quickly up again, he drew out his rich ſword, and laying at him that firſt preſented himſelf, he cut his Shield in two, and gave him a great gaſh in the arm, whence the bloud trickled down apace upon his armour: therewith preſently ſtriking at the others head, he had cleft him to the brain, if his ſword had not turned in his hand; nevertheleſſe the blow was ſuch, as it aſtoniſhed him, and forced the bloud out of his ears and eyes. In the

I, ſaid the other, who wondred at the greatneſſe of his courage, if you were in better caſe; but the pains you have taken in this combat, will not permit you to begin another at this inſtant; take time to breath and refreſh your ſelf, to morrow we will try for the maſtery; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it now, would be no glory to me.

Nor may I, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant</hi> in choller, ſuffer you to part from hence, but upon theſe conditions: and let me be forſaken at my need, if I leave you till ſuch time as either you or I be in caſe not to hurt one another any further. How, ſaid the Knight of the Phoenix, will you force me to fight againſt my will? I that I will, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> or you ſhall confeſſe before this Damſell, which hath the honour to belong unto her whom I ſerve, that you utterly renounce all pretence unto her. Are you ſo hardy, ſaid the Knight of the Phoenix, that you dare threaten me, and think to vanquiſh me in the eaſe you are in? I know well enough, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> that you are ſtrong and valiant, the triall which I have made of you, makes me not doubt, but I had rather die a thouſand deaths, then offend my Lady in any maner whatſoever. It ſeems you love her
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17218:178"/>
much, ſaid the Knight, ſeeing death is of leſſe conſideration with you, then the loſſe of her favour. I, more then you imagine, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> but to what end is all this diſcourſe? Knight you muſt ſatisfie me otherwiſe then with words, there is day enough yet to break a Lance, and two have two or three bouts with our Swords: come, let us diſpatch, and be not too backward where it concerns you ſo much; this delay does not teſtifie the paſſion which you ſay you are in for her. Well, ſaid the Knight of the Phoenix, who took great pleaſure in <hi>Alcidamants</hi> choller, I am ready to give you contentment; but it ſhall not be before you have told me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you know your Lady, or what her name is. I am not ſo happy, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, for I never ſaw her but in picture. Well, I will do you a good office then, ſaid the Knight, in letting you know her indeed: Whereupon dof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing her helmet, ſhe diſcovered an Angelicall face; which our Frenchman beholding, obſerved it to be the very ſame that Love had engraven in his heart. O God! ſaid he, preſently alighting, and falling on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, Madam, how have I erred in imploying my Arms againſt you, to whoſe ſervice alone they are dedicated? aſcribe this fault to my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which may juſtly excuſe me; and, receiving my vowes, be pleaſed I beſeech you, that as your Knight I may give an end to all the adventures of the world under the favour of your name. Valiant warriour, ſaid ſhe, being alighted to raiſe him up, my greatneſſe, which is more then humane, would not permit me to abaſe my ſelf ſo much as to ſalute you, did not your vertue render you worthy of that honour: your valour, that carries your name over all the earth, hath made me deſire to ſee and try you, that ſo I might know whether the effect be anſwerable to the praiſes which the world gives you; but beleeve me, you have wrong, in that you have not altars erected unto you, and your glory placed where it deſerves: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſufficeth that you are eſteemed of me as you ought to be, and that I have ſuch an opinion of you, as obliges me not to pardon you, (becauſe you have never offended) but to grant you the favour to be my Knight. Wherefore I receive your ſervice and your vowes, and do further promiſe to give you one day that place in my bed which I had reſerved for ſome one of the Gods, being hitherto perſwaded, that the earth had not a man worthy of that fortune. Madam, anſwered he, trembling with joy to hear the ſentence of his felicity pronounced in ſo ſweet a promiſe: Be ſure, that to merit ſuch grace, I will do things above the power of man; and that in my ſervices, you ſhall finde all that can be expected from an obliged ſoule, proteſting nevertheleſſe, never to diſpence with my ſelf for the reſpect which I owe to your greatneſſe. No, no, ſaid ſhe, love will endure no conſtraint, and I deſire we may live together without ceremony, that we may with the more ſweetneſſe enjoy out converſation. I will ſubmit to ſuch lawes as you ſhall preſcribe me, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and you ſhall ſee me eternally diſpoſed never to fail againſt the obedience of your command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That is it which I deſire, ſaid <hi>Traſielea,</hi> in the mean time get you to horſe, and follow me to the Emperour my father; unto whom I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you for to be admitted into the number of his Knights. Whereupon <hi>Alcidamant</hi> mounting on horſeback, after he had very humbly kiſt her hands in ſome acknowledgement of the grace ſhe did him, rode along with her, and entertained her with the beſt diſcourſe his troubled minde would permit him to uſe.</p>

Touching theſe Arms, which were given me by a learned Inchantreſſe, when I was to combat <hi>Fangomadan;</hi> I conceive they were made upon the occurrence of our loves: for heer are the firſt letters of our names interlaced, a T, which ſignifies <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> and an A, which is as much to ſay, as <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ſo that I preſume with reaſon, that all this hath been governed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of heaven: But Madam, I have been long meditating on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you bear in your Shield, and do therein finde no leſſe a myſtery then in theſe characters: for bearing two birds which never meet together, as being unique in their kinde, I am perſwaded that you would thereby figure your merit, and my love, which ſeparately, or together, can receive no compariſon in the world, nor ever can be incountred in one and the ſame

This ſmall repaſt being done, they began to renew their diſcourſe, when as they heard the voice of one that complained hard by them. Their curioſity thereupon cauſing them to ariſe, they took one another by the hand, and with their helmets on, went ſoftly to the place from whence the voice came, and heard one ſpeak in this ſort: Wretch that I am! To what extremity doth fortune reduce me, bereaving me of the means to free my Lady, and reſerving her deliverance to the valour of ſome Knight, who finding her endued with ſuch excellent beauty, may with reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her for the recompence of his labours, and deprive me of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, which I had promiſed my ſelf in the fruition of her. What, ſhall I ſurvive then the grief of her loſſe?

This victory having given me all intereſt in her, which a modeſt virgin may accord unto her lover, I lived ſo contented, that I did not think fortune was able to croſſe me: But alas!

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17218:181"/>
found he was too weak for them. We will doe what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiclea,</hi> but if you enterpriſe this to give us ſome teſtimony of your valour, your very countenance doth ſufficiently aſſure us of that. I ſhall be glad, ſaid he, to maintain this good opinion of yours in the proof: wherefore, with your favour, I will undertake them ſingle; ſo that being not far from thoſe Knights, he cried unto them, Turn about you villains, and defend you from thoſe that mean to puniſh this baſe outrage of yours to women.</p>
                     <p>Yes Maſter foole, ſaid they, hoping to diſpatch him quickly before the other two arrived, we wil chaſtiſe your inſolence, and teach you how to threaten ſuch as we are: wherewith they all three charged their Lances at him, and incountred him in ſuch ſort, that had he been leſſe ſtrong and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, he might have kiſt the ground; but being not ſo much as once moved with this incounter, he ran his Lance quite thorow the body of him at whom he had aimed it; &amp; advancing out his Sword at the finiſhing of his courſe, he diſcharged it ſo dangerouſly on the helmet of him that was moſt forward, as he cleft him to the very teeth; which made the third betake him to the wood, in hope to ſave his life from the fury of this warriours blade: but his fortune was little better; for wanting diſcretion to avoid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanels</hi> companions, <hi>Traſiclea</hi> incountred him ſo ſtrongly with her Lance, that ſhe caſt him out of his ſaddle with ſuch miſchance, as his right foot hanging in the ſtirrop, he was drag'd by his horſe into the wood, whither none of them followed to diſpatch him, each of them making to the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, that upon ſight of the defeature of her enemies, was returned. As ſhe came neer them, <hi>Traſiclea</hi> perceiving her to be <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> whom ſhe had ſent to her fathers Cour to learn ſome newes, wondred much at this which was befallen her, and cried out, <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> how cameſt thou by this misfortune? Through the inſolence of <hi>Brandamar</hi> King of <hi>Dramir,</hi> anſwered ſhe, who in revenge of a word I let fall, as I paſt by him, made theſe Knights purſue me for to do me ſome miſchiefe; but that you may be the better informed of all, pleaſe you to underſtand, that being entred into Tarſipolis, as you had commanded me, I was much amared at the meeting of novelties wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your curiofity: for the firſt object appearing unto me in the hall, was a burning rock that walks of it ſelf (at the leaſtwiſe one can ſee no body that conducts it) and ſtayes ordinarily three dayes in the Court of a King or Prince in expectation, that ſome Knight ſhould make trial of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which in truth gives as much occaſion of pitty as of fear: for in the hollow of the rock, one may behold a very beautifull young Lady in the middeſt of the flames, who lamenting with a million of ſighes and tears, intreats for ſuccour, and beſeeches all good Knights to draw her out of the fire, which divers have undertaken to do; but at the very inſtant when they go about it, a Knight all covered with fire comes out, or if there be many that attempt it together, each one findes ſuch a one to incounter him, who having given him three or four blowes with his ſword, or more, if the valour of the Knights be greater, he layes him all along in the place, where all his pain is in the heat that he feels, which is not allayed till ſuch time as his arms be taken from him: and that which breeds the moſt wonder, is, that the hall is not any whit the hotter for this fire, which queſtionleſſe is not materiall, and that no body feels the heat but onely the Knights that prove the adventure. This marvell ſeeming worthy of my pains, I was upon returning to acquaint you with it; but eſpying two of my fellowes, I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17218:181"/>
ſtaid a while, and underſtood by them how all the Court was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with your abſence, eſpecially at a time when your preſence was moſt neceſſary there in regard of the intereſt of your beauty: for the King of Dramir, named <hi>Brandimar,</hi> preſented himſelf with intollerable inſolencie, in the liſts of Tarſipolis, where he maintained, that the beauty of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe ſurpaſſeth all others whatſoever, and mads all the world to ſee him triumph over every one that undertakes him, having ſo little right on his ſide, and from thence proceeded the cauſe of my danger: for unable to conceale the anger I was in for the wrong he did you, by preferring one before you that is not worthy ſo much as to look on you, I ſaid aloud as I paſſed by, that I would go and fetch a Knight able to remove him from that errour, and abate his pride; which put him into ſuch a rage, that he commanded them to follow me, and do me ſome outrage. And this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is all the account I can give you of this journey. It is more then I could hope for, ſaid <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> but I am glad I met with thee ſo opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to free thee from thoſe Knights: Touching <hi>Brandamar,</hi> I doubt not but to take ſuch order with him, that either my Lance or Sword ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the puniſhment of his temeritie. Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat appertains unto me, and I ſhould think my ſelf moſt infortunate if any other ſhould undertake the defence of your beautie, reſerve your ſelf for more glorious interpriſes, and permit me to give you ſome ſmall proof of my love in this action. I grant it you, ſaid <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> and ſhall be very well contented to ſee him chaſtiſed by your hands. Whereupon doubling their pace, after they had rendred thanks to <hi>Rozanel,</hi> who wondred to behold ſo fair a Princeſſe bear Arms, they arrived at Tarſipolis; where the firſt thing they did, was to go ſtraight way to the Camp to combat the King of Dramir, whereof the Emperour being advertiſed, betooke him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the windows, as much admiring the gallant carriage of the Knights, as ſatisfied with his daughters return, whom he eaſily knew by her Arms; and that having eſpied him, went up inſtantly to him to do her dutie. Your long ſtay abroad, ſaid he, hath extreamly diſcontented me; but your ſafe return makes a full amends for it: You will have more cauſe to rejoyce, Sir, anſwered ſhe, when you underſtand how I have brought you that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Knight, who hath filled all the regions hereabout with wonder: he that ſlew the mighty King of Licagena, that with a handfull of men cut his Army in pieces; that killed the monſter of the Iſland of <hi>Silvana,</hi> and in my preſence three furious Giants, with fingle might had made the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the world to tremble. What a rich booty haſt thou got, my daughter, ſaid the Emperour, if thou canſt keep him here. He comes with an intent to be of the number of your Knights, anſwered ſhe, wherefore may it pleaſe you to affoord him as gracious entertainment as poſſibly may be: for I aſſure you, Sir, he merits it more than any other Knight whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Be confident, daughter, ſaid he, that I will give him very much cauſe to abide in my court: for all my treaſures ſhall be upon him, and my chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Princes ſhall yeild him place. But let us ſee how he will carry himſelf againſt the King of Dramir, which would prefer a common beauty far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yours, whoſe excellencie onely deſerves the title of Divine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, going to the windowes, they ſaw <hi>Brandamar</hi> flye over the crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his horſe, and the valiant Knight of the Palms paſſe on with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable grace. Behold an encounter of the Lance, ſaid the Emperour, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17218:182"/>
does not belye the fame which this Knight hath acquired in the world; and if he can manage a Sword as well, our <hi>Amoroſo</hi> ſhall miſſe of the content he expects here. <hi>Traſiclea</hi> was about to reply, but was retained by hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her lover, who was alighted, becauſe he would not fight with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and ſaid to his enemy, that made but little haſte in riſing, having been ſhrewdly ſhaken with his fall, Why how now King of Dramir, are you no forwarder in defendidg the beauty of your Miſtreſſe? queſtionleſſe ſhe will have but little reaſon to careſſe you: up, up, it may be you ſhall reſt in another faſhion by and by. Theſe words, which made all the people fall a laughing at him, having put him into an extream rage, he roſe as if he had received no hurt, and drawing out his Sword, went and ſtruck at <hi>Alcidamant</hi> in a moſt violent manner; but he wifely avoyding it with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable agility diſcharged a full blow on his left arm, cutting it off ſheer from his body. Whereat this lame lover being ſtrangely incenſed, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned another with all his force on the Frenchmans Shield, which proving impenetrable, it recoiled in vain; howbeit nothing abaſhed therewith, he laid about him moſt furiouſly, and rendred the combat very doubtfull; but <hi>Alcidamant</hi> confidering that he fought before the Father, and for the glory of his Lady, and diſdaining to have the victory any longer diſputed, he advanced his Sword, and let it deſcend in ſuch a terrible manner on <hi>Branda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> that it divided him to the very girdle; wherwith all the aſſiſtants were ſo amazed, as they could not beleeve that this blow could proceed from any other then the great God of Battles, and for ſuch would have adored him, would he have endured ſuch vanity: but ſheathing up his Sword, and going to the Palace, he preſented himſelf to the Emperour, who received him with all the teſtimonies of a moſt extraordinary reſpect. Sir, ſaid he, kneeling down before him, the report which runs of the worthy eſteem your Majeſty makes of good Knights, hath given me the confidence thus to become an humble ſuitor that you wil be graciouſly pleaſed to accept of my ſervice. I am more contented with your preſence, ſaid the Emperour, then with the addition of another Empire: whatſoever you deſire in my Court ſhall be yours, and my people ſhall honour you no leſſe then mine own perſon. I ſhall never be worthy of this favour, ſaid the Knight: But Sir, I will perform ſuch deeds of Arms for your ſervice, that you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent any grace you have conferred on me. Then turning himſelf to his fair Princeſſe, and kiſſing her hands with incredible delight, he aſſured her of the continuance of his vowes. This done, the Emperour would have had him conducted to his chamber; but being moved with the complaints of that beauteous Infanta which he ſaw in the middeſt of the flames of the burning rock, he beſought the Emperour that he would vouchſafe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelfe a while with beholding the triall of this adventure; and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame from his Lady, he was drawing out his Sword, when as he perceived <hi>Rozanel</hi> advancing towards the rock, with the countenance of a man half beſtraught. My noble friend, ſaid he unto him, whither run you thus? Either to dye with my <hi>Angelea,</hi> ſaid hee, whom I ſee in that fire, or deliver her out of her pains. Herewith the Emperour being advertiſed by <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> of the love between this Knight, a great Prince among the Chriſtians, and that beautifull Infanta which he beheld in the rock, he ſtood to obſerve the ſucceſs of this enterpriſe; &amp; ſaw, that having touched the rock with his Sword, a Knight came forth of it, whoſe armour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17218:182"/>
was covered all over with great flames, and that ſhewing a confident look, began one of the rougheſt combats with <hi>Rozanel,</hi> that could be between two Knights, their blows were mighty, and according to the extream fury which <hi>Rozanel</hi> expreſſed in his fight, every ſtroke he ſtruck, gave an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the end of this combat; howbeit, the glory being reſerved for another, he remained a little after extended in the place, with an opinion that he ſhould be conſumed in his armour; nevertheleſſe, the heat allayed as ſoon as he touched the ground, nor was he further tormented therewith when he was once unarmed, but ſuch was his grief and diſpleaſure, that he would have thrown himſelf into the Rock, for to die with <hi>Angelea,</hi> had he not been reſtrained by <hi>Alcidamant;</hi> who ſtaying him by the arm, declared unto him the fault he had committed by ſhewing himſelf ſo weak.</p>
                     <p>Wherewithall, being ſomewhat pacified, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> drew his ſword, and ſeeing a man all in flames iſſue forth as before, he charged him with ſuch fury that all the hall was full of ſparkles. The combat growing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gave a world of expectation to the beholders, every one looked with paſſion upon the Knight of the Palms, who preferring death before the ſhame of not vanquiſhing in the preſence of his Miſtris, preſt the inchanted Knight ſo hard, that ever and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Whereupon aſſuring them, that they ſhould receive all the aſſiſtance they could poſſibly deſire from her, ſhe left them to entertain <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> to whom they gave a world of thanks, and commanding the Count <hi>d'Alcane</hi> to ſee them furniſhed with money and ſhipping for their return into Greece. After they had refreſhed themſelves a while in Tarſipolis, ſhe was going to retire with <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> when as the inchanted Knight having put off his Helmet, went and kneeled down before him, humbly thanking him for the ſuccour he had given him. The goodly preſence of this Knight poſſeſſing <hi>Traſiclea</hi> with an extream deſire to know him, ſhe intreated him to tell his name. Madam, anſwered he, I am called <hi>Florisbel,</hi> ſecond ſon to the great King of France, who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conſtantinople a while ſince, for to ſeek adventures abroad, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by ſea into Cataya; where meeting with no leſſe attractions in the beautiful <hi>Semarimis,</hi> daughter to the King of that countrey, then my couſin here, meaning <hi>Rozanel d'Aſtre,</hi> who as yet had taken no notice of him, hath incountred the Princeſſe of Sopradiſa, I ſet my ſelf to ſerve her with that good fortune as ſhe received me for her Knight; whereupon I undertook ſuch enterpriſes for her ſake, as were worthy the glory of my Anceſtors, ſent her two hundred ſhields, of Knights that I had overthrown at a Iuſt which was held for to publiſh her the wonder of beauties: and not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therewith, I went up and down doing marvellous deeds of Arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Grey Knight; when as one morning I met with 3 old witches, who conducting this inchanted Rock, laid ſuch powerfull charms upon me, that I entred all armed in it, having no other deſire then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all thoſe that offered to deliver this fair Princeſſe. And this, Madam, is all the ſatisfaction I can give you for the preſent, but not all that you may expect from me hereafter: for I will ſeek out occaſions to ſerve both you and this brave warriour that accompanies you. <hi>Traſiclea</hi> having courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thanked him, preſented him with the ſame favours which ſhe had offered to <hi>Rozanel,</hi> who by this time comming to know him, entertained him with a world of kindneſſe, and had therein continued longer, but that <hi>Traſiclea</hi> deſiring to accompany her Knight to his chamber, ſo to ſhew her ſubjects how ſhe would have them to honour him, cauſed them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to another, giving the fair <hi>Angelea</hi> three Damſels to attend her, with a charge to ſee her extraordinarily ſerved. All things being thus happily diſpoſed, <hi>Traſiclea</hi> left her Knight, went and unarmed her ſelf, put on one of the richeſt gowns ſhe had, dreſt her ſelf wonderfull wealthy, and appeared ſo beautifull at ſupper, where the three Knights were ſet at table with the Emperour, that every one thought ſhe had ſome divinity in her. The cloth being taken away, and the Emperour having diſcourſed with <hi>Rozanel</hi> and <hi>Florisbel,</hi> who then took their leave of him, whilſt <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was talking with his Lady, every one withdrew till the next morning; at which time our Princes of Greece having kiſt <hi>Traſiclea's</hi> hand, &amp; bidden the Knight of the Palms adieu, who would not make himſelf known to <hi>Florisbel,</hi> imbark themſelves with <hi>Angelea</hi> for their return to Conſtantinople, where we will leave them for to proſecute our hiſtory.</p>

Some dayes being ſweetly paſt away in walking, familiar diſcourſes, and ſolitary entertainments, one evening he eſpied his Miſtreſſe fitting in the ſhadow, under certain trees; where, kneeling down before her, and taking her hand to kiſſe, he ſaid unto her: Madam, conſider I beſeech you, the extremity of my paſſion by the exceſſe of your beauty; and marvell not, if unable to ſupport the violence of my deſires, you ſee me in ſome unreaſonable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience: I endure all that a poore lover can undergoe; and the ſight of you, which ſhould aſſwage my martyrdome, encreaſes it: for apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the felicity which I am to expect from your more ſecret careſſes, I cannot bear the retardment of them but with incredible torment. I am too forward, I am too forward, I confeſſe, and this complaint of mine, which ſeems unreaſonable (ſince you have alwayes aſſured me that you live for me only) may juſtly offend you: But alas! that which I feel, will not permit me to be longer contained, ſo that I am forced to diſcover it, for to finde ſome remedy, and that wholly depends on you, which I beſeech you to grant me, if you have reſolved to render me one day happy, and without making me longer to languiſh, advance my felicity with your delitious frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sir, anſwered ſhe, I did not think our familiarity would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you to ſuch inſolencie, or that my affability would have made you forget the reſpect which you ought to have: Have you well conſidered that you deſire, and upon what conditions doe you demand it? Alas! ſaid he with a trembling, which thorowly teſtified his love, and that gave marvellous ſatisfaction to <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> who therein obſerved that which ſhe deſired in this feare: Madam, do you ſet down the lawes your ſelfe, I will never oppoſe them, I opened my heart to you, to make you ſenſible of my ſuffering, not to provoke you to diſpleaſure; be not offended then, I beſeech you, with this liberty I have taken: or if it be diſtaſtfull to you, command me to ſuffer and be ſilent, and you ſhall never hear me open my lips hereafter, but with that very reſpect which may be uſed to a Deitie. I do not require, ſaid ſhe in a gentler accent, that you ſhould live after with me: for my affection will not endure ſuch ceremonies, but you ſhall oblige me for hoping for any thing more from me, then what honour will permit me to grant you: for our conditions being ſo different, that they may well draw my father to be otherwiſe diſpoſed then I am, if he were

aware of our determinations; it is very neceſſary, in my opinion, to wait the time, when as your ſervices, and my perſwaſions may induce him to receive you as his ſon in law, rather then ruine them by precipitation; I do beleeve that this expectation is grievous to you, and that it leaves you not without much deſire, for I judge of your ſuffring by mine own; but ſay, my Knight, will it not be worthy of your pain, and will not your pleaſure taſte the ſweeter for your enduring? Yes verily, it will be dearer to you, having gotten it with difficulty, then if you injoyed it otherwiſe. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain no longer therefore, I pray you, but live with more content, and give me occaſion to love you everlaſtingly.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid he, it is no little grief to me that you ſhould finde any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in my complaints, but ſince they diſpleaſe you, be aſſured they ſhall never importune you more, I will ſuffer with ſilence, and if the violence of my paſſion ſhall inforce any ſighes from me, I will ſo carry my ſelf that none but theſe trees ſhall be witneſſes of them; In the mean time be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to ſweeten the bitterneſſe of my diſpleaſure with ſome more particular favours, and incouraging me to attend the happineſſe which you make me to hope for, permit me to come and viſit you in your chamber when all the world is at reſt, that ſo I may have the content to ſee you without fear. I will advice with time upon that, ſaid ſhe, for it is a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe that requires good deliberation; but not to be ſo ingratefull as to give you nothing, receive this kiſſe, the firſt that ever man received from my divinity forbidding me the imparting of ſo great a favour; receive, I ſay, this kiſſe for an infallible aſſurance of my promiſe. Whereupon, laying her mouth to his lips, ſhe raviſhed him with the incredible delight of ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous a touch. In this manner did theſe lovers ſpend the time, and lived with ſuch a tranquillity of minde, that never did two finde leſſe diſtaſt in the birth of their affections. If they ſaw one another, it was with new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of their love, if therein they were hindered by any occaſion, that defect was ſupplied with letters; <hi>Arnides</hi> and <hi>Ceſarina</hi> were alwayes walking with new commiſſions; briefly, their diſcourſe and converſation was a very Paradiſe. This contentment being without croſſes, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> without jealouſie, (becauſe the pride this Princeſſe had eſloigned all ſuch as deſired to preſent her with their ſervice) ſhe without ſuſpition, not being able to imagine that ever he will be in any paſſion for another, their life was rather divine then humane, and all things diſpoſed themſelves by little and little to render them happy; when as fortune, that takes pleaſure in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, would needs let them ſee that the content of men depends upon her will, and that their deſignes do never arrive at a good port without her aſſiſtance. Two ſtorms aroſe at once, whereof one was like to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the greatneſſe of that Empire, by reducing the Emperour and his daughter to the extremity of the loſſe of their lives, and the other to have utterly ruined theſe lovers hopes for ever injoying one another. The firſt happened by the treachery of <hi>Drumelia,</hi> Aunt unto <hi>Brandamar</hi> King of Dramir, ſlain, as you have heard, upon the quarrell of his Miſtris beauty; and the ſecond through the indiſcretion of <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> whom <hi>Merodiana</hi> had left in the Iſland of Silvana, with a letter directed to the Knight of the Palms, as I ſhall deliver by and by, having ſpoken of that which did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede this misfortune.</p>

Howbeit, not thinking it fit to preſent her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him any where but in the Palace, becauſe ſhe would not play one match without the other, ſhe followed fair and ſoftly after him, giving the people occaſion to laugh, for to ſee her walk between five ſuch ill-favoured crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and comming to the hall, even as <hi>Traſiclea</hi> entered, ſhe preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards her, and kneeling down, with tears and ſighs, ſhe thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: Excellent Princeſſe, I am reduced to that paſſe, as it is not poſſible for a wretched woman to be more miſerable; in ſo much, that if I do not finde ſome aſſiſtance of your pity, you ſhall ſee me cut off the poor remainder of my life heer in your preſence, and this poniard in my hand ſhall ſecond the cruelty of my fortune, which hath lately deprived me of a ſon, whom I may richly boaſt to be one of the beſt Knights of the earth, rendering him a priſoner in the hands of a mercileſſe Giant, that loving the ſame Miſtris, which he ſerved, to free himſelf of a rivall, purpoſeth to take away his life, if he be not ſpeedily ſuccoured: Now the fame which runs of your valour, hath induced me to make this addreſſe unto your greatneſſe, with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I ſhall not be refuſed. No verily, ſaid <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> that you ſhall not, for I will ſerve you moſt willingly in this extremity. Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> extreamly diſcontented to ſee her ſo reſolved, I beſeech you
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17218:185"/>
to pardon me if I ſay, that you promiſe too lightly; I am fitter for travell then you, and your divine perſon is not to be expoſed unto hazzard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more occaſion. Leave the care of this to me, and give your ſubjects the ſatisfaction of your preſence, whilſt I go and diſpatch the affair. Why my Knight, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, are you not contented with ſo much glory as you have acquired in the world already, but that you would bereave me of this too? Let me intreat you to ſtay heer for to ſerve the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour my father in my ſtead, and becauſe it will not be long ere I return, you ſhall ſeek to entertain him in the mean time. Now by my Crown, ſaid the Emperour, I am alſo of his minde, daughter, and do not hold it fit that you ſhould undertake this enterpriſe, wherein it may be there is more danger then you think for. Sir, ſaid <hi>Drumelia,</hi> who was very much afraid that her deſignes ſhould be very much diſcovered, you need not doubt her eſloignment, her valour exempts you from that; and to let you ſee that I do not venture her perſon lightly, as you imagine, Ile ſtay heer my ſelf with you, and ſhe ſhall be conducted by two of theſe Dwarfs, ſo that in caſe ſhe return not ſafely by to morrow, with all the contentment you can deſire, inflict the cruelleſt puniſhment you can upon me. <hi>Traſiclea</hi> ſaid unto her father, My Lord, there are ſo few occaſions of glory preſented in theſe quarters, that I cannot without much wrong to mine honour refuſe this ſame; therefore permit me, I beſeech you, to depart with your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and comfort your ſelf the mean while in the company of this noble Knight of the Palms. Well, ſince you will have it ſo, ſaid the Emperour, Ile no longer oppoſe your deſire, but I am in ſome miſtruſt, I know not wherefore, and cannot be perſwaded that this voiage will be proſperous. <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> having thus obtained leave, preſently armed herſelf, little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuſpition her father had of the enterpriſe, which ſhe imputed rather to the imbecility of his age, then to any aſſured judgement; and therefore having caſt a thouſand looks on her Knight, for to bid him tacitely adieu, ſhe departed with <hi>Ceſarina</hi> and two of thoſe Dwarfs, ſomewhat troubled for that ſhe had not the company of <hi>Alcidamant:</hi> The diſpleaſure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo took up her thoughts, that never minding her enterpriſe, ſhe rode on till ſhe came to the wood, whereinto the Giants were no ſooner entred, but they re-aſſumed their former ſhape, laid two blows with their heavy maces on the head and ſhoulders of this Princeſſe, who thus ſurpriſed, fell, and kiſt the ground, with little or no memory at all. The Giants ſeeing her in this poſture, inſtantly alighted, bound her with cords, and laying hold on <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> that ſeemed more dead then alive, they tied her to the foot of a tree. Whilſt this Tragedy was framing in the wood, a more bloudy one was acted in the City: <hi>Drumelia</hi> thinking <hi>Traſiclea</hi> ſure enough in the hands of theſe Giants, deſiring to play her part, touched the three Dwarfs with a wand ſhe had in her hand, and making them appear with their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall greatneſſe, much amazed the aſſiſtants, eſpecially the Emperour, who going to ſave himſelf, received a blow with a ſcymiter on his arm, which laid him on the ground, liker to die then to live. Whereupon, a great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour aroſe in the hall, the Courtiers betook them to their ſwords by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamants</hi> example, who, with his cloak wound about his left arm, gave one of the Giants ſo furious a blow on the ſhoulder, that he opened him to the very girdle, and inſtantly ran one of the other two quite thorow the body; the third, who made a horrible maſſacre of the unarmed Knights,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17218:185"/>
ſeeing the fall of his companions, in a mighty rage flew at <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to cut him in pieces; but the adviſed Knight, whoſe judgement was not overcome with fury, ſlipt aſide from the blow, and loſing no time, gave him a deep and dangerous wound in the thigh. The Giant, boyling with choller, was not then much ſenſible of it; but a little after, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his heavy ſcymiter to diſcharge it on the Knight, and ſtretching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his feet to render his ſtroke the ſtronger, he fell all along, and carried with him more then half of our Frenchmans cloak, who receiving a light hurt on the arm, did for all that forbear the taking of his enemies head from his ſhoulders, and ſuddenly running to the door, made ſtay of <hi>Drumelia,</hi> who, beholding the miſerable end of her kinſmen, would have ſaved her ſelf. By my life, ſaid he, you old witch, you ſhall not eſcape me ſo, your head ſhall anſwer for <hi>Traſiclea's</hi> life; Say, wicked creature, Whither haſt thou cauſed her to be conducted? What, wilt thou not ſpeak? No, I will be torn in pieces, ſaid ſhe, before I will diſcover it; her death ſhall yet make ſome ſatisfaction for the King of Dramirs, and the inhumane butchery of theſe his kinſmen. What a horrible treaſon is this, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant?</hi> But the horribleneſſe of thy puniſhment ſhall be anſwerable to it. Whereupon, dragging her into the hall, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to the cuſtody of certain Knights, whom he commanded to look well unto her, as they would anſwer it with the perill of their heads; and perceiving the Emperour to be come again to himſelf, and that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons aſſured there was no danger in his hurt, he ran preſently to his chamber, cauſed himſelf to be armed with all ſpeed, and mounting on his horſe, gallopped away towards the wood; where at the firſt arivall, he heard certain cries, which made him put himſelf amongſt the thickeſt of the trees, at one of the which he ſaw <hi>Ceſarina</hi> tied, and his beautifull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris in the hands of two Giants, who were pulling off her armour for to raviſh her. This ſight poſſeſſing him with a ſtrange fury, he alighted, and with his ſword drawn, approached theſe two Coloſſes, and finding the head of the greateſt unarmed, divided it in two, thinking he was not obliged to uſe any curteſie to perſons that were not capable of it. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, grown wiſer by his companions misfortune, laced on his helmet, and cryed out: Stand, Caitiff, that I may revenge the death of a man, whom thou haſt baſely ſurpriſed, and let this one blow be the reward of all thy wickedneſſe. Saying ſo, he diſcharged his curtleax with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that he ſtun'd the Knights arm, making him recoil a pace or two back; but his wrath increaſing, and conſidering that the ſafety of his Lady was at ſtake, he laid at his head with ſuch a tempeſt, that albeit his ſword turned in his hand, and that he ſtruck him but with the flat, yet he ſent him dead to the ground, his brains flying out with the horrible violence of the blow.</p>
                     <p>That done, he came ſpeedily to <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> and cutting the cords where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ſhe was tied, he ſaid, O God! what inhumanity is this, to inchain her that is able to captivate all the world? Madam, theſe barbarous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains were not ignorant of your valour, and therefore the fear of your ſword had made them ſecure themſelves by binding you: But what trick did they uſe to reduce you thereunto?

you came, theſe villains were unarming me, and threatned to make me ſerve for the ſatisfying of their brutiſh luſt; but thanks be to the Gods, I am freed by your valour: yet I wonder how you could leave the Emperour, for to arrive here ſo luckily. How? ſaid he, leave the Emperour? Wee have ſeen ſtrange things within theſe two howrs. Then he recounted unto her all that had paſſed in Tarſipolis, whereat ſhe remained ſo much amazed and contented, that ſhe could never commend her good fortune enough, which had made her the Miſtreſſe of ſo brave and valiant a Knight. Let us go my dear friend, ſaid ſhe unto him, let us go and releaſe the Emperour out of the care he is in for the loſſe of me; and let us think upon the pains wherewithall we may ſufficiently puniſh this wicked creature that had ſo cunningly betrayed us. It were fitter to think of that which I endure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he; and if you were as juſt as fair, you would leave the care of that execution to the officers of the Empire, for to undertake a noble reſolution to give ſome ſpeedy end to our ſufferings, nevertheleſſe, ſeeing you have commanded me to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ilent herein, I will proceed no further, but refer the performance of your promiſe to your own gracious pleaſure. Why ſee now, ſaid ſhe, how time begets occaſion to content you: for have you not to day done things able to oblige my father not to deny you what you ſo much deſire? yes, my Knight, you have, and if you will be patient, you ſhall quickly ſee your ſelf at reſt: let not your complaints then diminiſh the obligation of your ſuccour, but let me feel the contentment of it without grief. Whereupon <hi>Ceſarina</hi> being untied, they took the way of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherein they met with five or ſix troops of Knights, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had ſent for the deliverance of <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> who ſeeing her return with the valiant ſtranger, (for ſo was <hi>Alcidamant</hi> ordinarily termed) and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how matters had paſt, they raiſed his praiſes to ſuch an height, that he was aſhamed of them, &amp; <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> the moſt contented on the earth. The ſpeed they made, having ſoon brought them to the Citie, <hi>Traſiclea</hi> went ſtraight to ſee her father, who taking her by the hand, fell a weeping with extream joy. Do I ſee thee again, my dear child, ſaid he, being out of all hope both of mine own ſafety and thy life? Ah! how much am I bound to the Gods for ſo great a grace? and what do I owe to this brave ſtranger, who hath this day done ſuch wonders, as never will be forgotten as long as the world endures? Daughter, it is you that muſt requite them, I leave you the power to do it, and will no way oppoſe whatſoever you ſhall ordain for his recompence. My Lord, anſwered ſhe, this ſervice deſerves no leſſe then a Crown; but we ſhall have time enough to think of it: our preſent care muſt be to look unto your health. I finde my ſelf ſo well, ſaid he, that the joy of your return ſurpaſſeth the pain I feel of my wound: Go and refreſh your ſelves both of you, whilſt I take a little reſt, as I am advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by my Phyſitians. Thereupon thoſe lovers bidding him good night, went and warmed themſelves, and then walked into the hall together for to behold an infinite company of Bonfires which the inhabitants of Tarfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis made in every part of the Citie for joy of the good ſucceſſe of this adventure; which done, they both withdrew into their chambers, <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> ſtudying how he might demand ſome eaſe for his ſufferings, without offending his Lady, and <hi>Traſiclea</hi> what more greater favour ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on him, then formerly ſhe had done, and not contravenne that modeſty which a vertuous and diſcreet mayden ought to have in her actions.</p>

He was then ſo entertained by his fancies, as he ſpake not a word; but his ſilence laſted not long: for ſuddenly he ſaid, O Madam! how hard is this commandment? and what may I hope from the extremitie of my paſſions, if you will not permit me to ſhew them? Either you love me, or your promiſes are feigned. If you have reſolved to make me happy by giving your ſelfe unto me upon ſuch conditions as honour allowes of, why do you refuſe me that now which you will grant me then? you will ſay, that reſpect reſtrains you: Ah Madam! that is but an ill opinion for to make lovers languiſh: and ſhe that admits of ſuch a conſideration cowardly, deprives herſelfe of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I would to God, not that you ſhould feel my pain (for I will never wiſh you ſo much hurt) but that you may know the rigour of it, that you might ſee a million of tears in my eyes, and that you might judge by theſe

infinity of ſighes which ordinarily I fetch, whether I can be without grief to ſee my ſelfe ſo long delayed from the greateſt bliſſe which a Knight can hope for in the world, you would then, without doubt, be more ſenſible of my endurings, and advancing my felicity, give end to the martyrdome wherein you had ſeen me. Theſe complaints moved <hi>Traſiclea</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and had ſhe not been arreſted by that baſhfulneſſe wherewithall maids are uſually retained, queſtionleſſe ſhe had made uſe of time and place to ſhew her lover that ſhe deſired his contentment no leſſe then himſelf; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſtealing ſoftly back, ſhe returned into the garden, where conſidering her lovers reaſons, ſhe ſometimes reſolved to give him ſatisfaction, and then by and by was quite of another minde. At length, having continued a good while in theſe extremities, ſhe concluded to make no further diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty therein, ſeeing ſhe meant to take him for her husband. This is, ſaid ſhe to herſelf, this is but to defer his contentment with too weak conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; &amp; ſo many nights as paſſe away unprofitably, ſeem to accuſe me of want of love, I do my ſelf wrong to be ſo difficile for mine own content; but I will repair this fault, and living otherwiſe hereafter, I will give my Knight no more occaſion to complain. This reſolution carrying her back again to the orchard, ſhe began to ſing a far off, for to draw <hi>Alcidamant</hi> out of his fantaſies, who was very much amazed to behold her, and to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with tears in his eyes; whereupon he took his hankercher for to wipe them, but <hi>Traſiclea</hi> ſtaying his hand, ſayd unto him: I am very glad, my Knight, to ſee you weep in this ſort, not that I take pleaſure in my cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, but to make it ſerve for your content: your complaints which I have heard, have had the power to alter both my will and minde, ſo that I am now reſolved to give your ſervices their recompence, to eſpouſe you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and to let you enjoy all the priviledge which marriage can affoord you, untill ſuch time as we may diſpoſe my father to receive you more openly. Wherefore be of good cheer, and prepare your ſelfe to come to morrow in the evening to my chamber, where <hi>Ceſarina</hi> and my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall be witneſſes of the faith you ſhall plight me to legitimate our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. Thus have I reſolved to do, both as your merit and my affection require. O God! ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> falling on his knees before her, can I, Madam, ever deſerve this grace? and may I not well repute my ſelfe the happieſt man of the earth? yes, without doubt, I may, nor do I think that my felicity can be matched with another whatſoever. O bleſſed ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings! what reward are you to have? What fruit do I gather from my tears? and what treaſure have I found in my patience. O the moſt fortunate Knight breathing! Doeſt thou promiſe to thy ſelfe not onely an Empire, but the poſſeſſion of a Divinity? No, no, thou couldſt not, this favour ſurpaſſeth all thy hopes by far, and obliges thee never to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull: neither, Madam, will I ever be, I will labour to be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this grace by a million of ſervices: and the more you have exalted me, the more humbler and more acknowledging you ſhall finde me; give me therefore, I beſeech you, theſe fair hands, that I may, upon their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, imprint my thankfulneſſe for the compaſſion you have been ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to have of me. My deareſt Knight, anſwered <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have promiſed you an abſolute power over the reſt, ſure I ſhall never permit you more to kiſſe my hands: for purpoſing very ſhortly to be your wife, I am to intreat you otherwiſe then heretofore: wherefore now you
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17218:187"/>
ſhall have my lips (ſaying ſo ſhe kiſt him) wherewithall I ſhall deſire you to be contented, untill our marriage ſhall authorize you further.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon theſe two lovers taking one another by the hand, walked up &amp; down a while in the garden; but <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> to avoid all ſuſpition that might have grown by their being met ſo together, modeſtly withdrew her ſelfe, and left him with ſuch an extaſie of joy, that he knew not where he was. Night enſuing thereupon, he went to ſee the Emperour, who finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe healed of his hurt, and in better ſtate of health then he had been of a long time before, reſolved to hunt the next morning by the break of day; which fitted our Frenchmans diſpoſition wonderfull well, who thinking he ſhould that way paſſe the time better then to remain in the Court, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to wait upon him; and accordingly no ſooner did the Sun appear the next morning, but he got into the field, where thinking of his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching happineſſe, he made his horſe to bound with ſuch a grace, that it amazed every one to ſee how bravely he ſate him: Then calling to minde his Miſtreſſes amorous words, and conſidering them ſeverally apart, he thought no felicity could be comparable to his, nor that he could ever be ſubject again to the croſſes of Fortune. But alas! ſhe made him ſoon know, that our good or ill depend upon upon her inconſtancie, and that it is a great errour in men to promiſe any thing of certainty to themſelves in this world. Whilſt he croſſed the woods, following the cry of the hounds, <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> the ſecretary of <hi>Merodiana's</hi> affections, left (as you have heard) with a letter in the Iſland of Silvana, arrived at Tarſipolis, and going to the palace, by ill fortune met with <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> and enquired of her for the valiant Knight of the Palms. Gentlewoman, ſaid <hi>Ceſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> unto her, is it for the execution of any enterprize that you ſeek him? No, anſwered this unadviſed maid, but onely to deliver him a letter, which I beleeve will be accptable unto him, comming from one of the faireſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the world, and that loves him infinitely. Marry, and he is worthy of it, replied <hi>Ceſarina;</hi> but he is not now in town: wherefore if you pleaſe to reſt you in my chamber till his return, which will be in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, you may then ſpeak with him at leaſure. I ſhall gladly accept of your fair courteſie, ſaid <hi>Ciſtenia,</hi> ſince you are pleaſed ſo far to olige me. Whereupon going into <hi>Ceſarina's</hi> chamber, ſhe ſet ſome to attend her whilſt ſhe went unto <hi>Traſiclea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Alas! I was going to commit an irreparable fault, and giving my ſelf to the moſt diſloyall Knight that lives, had made my ſelf a grief for all my future dayes. Art thou a deceiver, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant?</hi> Ah! how is that valour ill beſtowed, and how unjuſt are the Gods in the partition of their treaſures? Thou thoughteſt to beguile me upon ſuch a promiſe as thou madeſt to that unfortunate Lady, but thou art far from thy reckoning, and the happineſſe which I was preparing for thee, ſhall be for ever withheld. Thou wilt finde out ſome reaſons to cover thy cunning, but Ile not permit thee, nor do thee the favour to hear ſo much as one poor excuſe; but baniſhing thee for ever from my ſight, I will preſerve my ſelf from faulting a ſecond time. Come then and take me away all theſe preparations which I have made for this wicked man, and thou <hi>Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> give me ſome paper, a Letter is the cauſe of my good, and a Letter ſhall be the occaſion of his pain. Whereupon, walking a great pace up and down her chamber, ſhe remained a good while penſive; but not caring how ſhe wrote, ſo as ſhe might expreſſe her minde, ſhe framed a Letter, and ſealing it up, commanded <hi>Ceſarina</hi> to deliver it unto the Knight aſſoon as ever he returned, but not to receive any anſwer. Which being done, ſhe fell to walking again; and every minute finding new cauſe of diſpleaſure, ſhe rendered her paſſion and hatred greater, inſomuch that ſhe was more in rage, then ever ſhe had been in love. Whilſt fortune was thus putting all in diſorder, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> returned moſt contented, thinking of nothing leſſe then the miſchief which was to fall upon him; and declining the Emperours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he might not fail his Lady, he betook him to his chamber, where within a little after <hi>Ceſarina</hi> preſented her ſelf to him. Beholding her, he was troubled with extream joy, and thought that ſhe was come to lead him to the paradiſe of his delights; but ſhe entering with a ſad countenance, ſaid unto him: My Lord, my Miſtris hath commanded me to deliver you this Letter; <hi>Alcidamant</hi> taking it with a great change of colour, and kiſſing it, though it were with a ſtrange ſuſpition, which <hi>Ceſarina's</hi> countenance had begot in him, he opened it, wherein he read theſe words.</p>

Behold, ſaid he, how from the ſupremeſt degree of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, I am faln into the abyſmes of a miſery, out of the which I cannot get without miracle. Good God! who would have thought, that having but one tedious minute to paſſe, for to ſee my ſelf in an unmatchable glory, fortune ſhould have found out the means to croſſe me? I could never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it, but to my coſt I perceive, that man cannot aſſigne a time for his good, no more then for the evill that is to arrive unto him. Ah, <hi>Ciſtenia!</hi> How well thou makeſt me pay for the pleaſures thou procuredſt me from thy Miſtris? How dearly, <hi>Merodiana,</hi> do I buy your favours? You ſay, that I promiſed to eſpouſe you: Alas! I had never ſuch a thought, our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes have been free, and the power of diſpoſing our ſelves never parted from us; Why do you ſay then, that it is time to render our imbraces le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate? Can I be your ſiſters friend, and your husband? By no means, it is a thing whereof you ought never ſo much as to think; nevertheleſſe, I endure the pains of your folly, and my baniſhment proceeds from your paſſions; it is unjuſt, but I muſt bear it; the heavens have alwayes had a care of my life, the ſame regard they will have ſtill of my actions, if they pleaſe, and will aſſiſt me with ſome extraordinary favour, ſince that I have a divine power for to make me hope for relief. Pronouncing theſe words, he ſhed ſo many tears, that he ſaw not the way which he went, though the moon ſhone very bright, in ſuch ſort that he croſt thorow a wood, more by chance then otherwiſe, and finding himſelf, at the break of the day, in a beautifull meadow, bordered about with numbers of trees, he alighted, let his horſe feed, and laying him down upon the green graſſe, began to think of his ill fortune, and was about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I beleeve, ſaid he, that thou takeſt me for <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> that ſlew <hi>Fangomadan,</hi> and the Monſter of the Iſland Silvana, that defeated the Giants on the wooden bridge, that brought <hi>Brandimar</hi> to reaſon, that maſſacred the guards of the Sorcereſſe <hi>Drumelia,</hi> and that would have made no difficulty to have combatted a million of armed men; thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, <hi>Arnides,</hi> I am but his ſhadow, and the weakneſſe of my arm could not fear the meaneſt Knight that is. Theſe deſire to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the wrong that I have done them, let them uſe their pleaſure upon me, here is my throat, which I will moſt willingly offer to their ſwords; for loathing my life, I care not what becomes of it. Why this is ſpoken like a deſperate man indeed, ſaid <hi>Arnides;</hi> What a glory were it for them to vaunt in the Empire of Tramazond, that they had overcome you vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and how might they abuſe <hi>Traſiclea</hi> if fortune ſhould give her into their hands, as ſuch a thing may be? Now in good faith, this womaniſh courage of yours exceedingly grieves me; and give me leave to tell you, that you loſe much of the reputation that you have acquired in the world, and particularly with <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> who peradventure is not ſo much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17218:189"/>
as ſhe makes ſhew for. Well, <hi>Arnides,</hi> ſaid he, I ſee thou wilt prevail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and make me once more, againſt my will, to draw my ſword. Therewith ariſing, and tranſported with ſorrow and rage, he advanced towards two Giants and three Knights, whom he ſaw at the other end of the meadow, and never examining the matter any further, charged the firſt Giant ſo rudely, that he made his ſword, arm and all, flie to the ground together. You die, ſaid he, for daring to attempt upon the lives of <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> and her Knight, nor ſhall all your Gods ſave you from my hands.</p>
                     <p>Putting this high menace then in execution, he laid two of the Knights, that ſhewed themſelves forwardeſt, dead on the earth, and ſtriking furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly at the other Giant, gave him three or four blows, which all drew bloud of him; howbeit, the firſt having taken his ſword into his left hand, began to preſſe him very hard; but this brave Champion being in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt degree of his rage, overthrew them both in the place with two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blows; and ſeeing but one Knight, who on his knees begged for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he gave him his life, upon condition that he ſhould go to <hi>Tarſipolis,</hi> and preſenting himſelf before the Emperour, recount the buſineſſe how it had paſt. This done, he remounted on his horſe, and riding along, began his lamentation and complaints, to the great diſcontentment of his Squire, who having eating nothing of a long time, much blamed theſe ſtrange hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his Maſter in his minde. Whilſt <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was making thus from Tarſipolis, the Knight of the Giants arrived there, and preſenting himſelf in the palace before the Emperour was riſen from dinner, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what he had in charge; and publiſhing in the preſence of <hi>Traſiclea</hi> the moan which the Knight of the Palms made at his departure, it pierced ſo deep into the heart of this diſpleaſed Princeſſe, of whom the Emperour demanded the cauſe of his abſence, that ſhe repented hereof a thouſand times for entreating him ſo cruelly, as to condemne him unheard. This action, ſaid ſhe to herſelf, is an infallible teſtimony that he loves not <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana;</hi> and in that he obeyes my command, it is clear that I do him wrong to ſuſpect his loyaltie. It may be that this Lady, vanquiſhed by her paſſion, or rather by this Knights charms, which are inevitable, hath given her ſelf to him upon ſome hope of marriage; but that this Knight hath promiſed her, I cannot think it, he is too noble to be ſo wicked; and if he were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by his word, queſtionleſſe he would have gone to her now, but he hath taken a clean contrary way; and howſoever, his ſorrow renders him innocent.</p>
                     <p>Now, to be offended with him for what is ſecretly paſt between them, I have no reaſon at all: for their careſſes were precedent to my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, ſo as he was no wayes tied to obſerve any faith to me; wherefore I condemne my jealouſie, and precipitious carriage towards him, and do proteſt before my Gods, to receive him into grace again, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf before me. But alas! that, I fear, he will not do, but will have more regard to my will, then the ſatisfaction of his own deſires: howbeit I may quickly remedy that; I have committed the fault, I muſt make the amends; and ſending <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> who may eaſily follow him by the fame of his brave acts, let him know, that I acquit him as freely as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I condemned him unjuſtly. Whereupon writing a letter full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and giving it to <hi>Ceſarina,</hi> commanded her to repair her errour, and to uſe ſome means for to bring back this Knight, who, in the mean time,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17218:190"/>
rode on with incredible ſpeed, never regarding the wayes, which at length having brought him to the kingdome of <hi>Clariana,</hi> he met with a Deſart, wherein the gentle current of a bubbling ſtream, together with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beauty of a ſavadge grot, and the ſhade of certain trees, which ſeemed to make a pretty walk from the rock to the water, ſo pleaſed him, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his horſe, he reſolved there to ſpend his daies. Living on the fruits that he found there, and drinking of the water that pearled out of the ſtone, he lay upon a couch of leaves, and limiting his walk among thoſe trees, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his time in his uſuall complaints, accuſing his ill fortune, blaming <hi>Traſiclea's</hi> cruelty, adoring her picture which <hi>Ceſarina</hi> had given him in the Iſle of <hi>Silvana,</hi> and which he had kept as the onely relique remaining of all his hopes; and leading a moſt ſolitary life, took pleaſure in nothing but his own lamentations and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Five or ſixe dayes being paſt away with theſe pleaſing diſcourſes, one morning, even as the Sunne began to enlighten the world, hee heard a dreadful noyſe, proceeding from the incounter of the billowes, which the violence of the winds raiſed ſometimes as high as Heaven, and then by and by caſt down to the very center of the earth, herewith awaked he looked round about to ſee from whence it came, and amidſt the ſtrange diſorder of theſe enraged waters, hee eſpied a Ship, whoſe ſayles were rent all to fitters, her ſhrouds and Tackle torne, her Maſts blowne over board, and every part of her beſides ſo terribly ſhaken, and beaten with the fury of the mercileſſe waves, that having no Guid but the evill fortune of thoſe ſhee carried, at length ſhe ranne againſt a Rocke, that was neere to an adjoyning Port, and ſplit in a thouſand pieces, leaving ſome thirty perſons to the mercy of the cruell ſeas. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo full of pitty moved him very much; and as hee was about to bewayle the miſhap of them hee had ſeene ſwallowed up, and to deſire that hee could ſuccour the reſt which were alſo ready to periſh, hee perceived that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot deſcended conducting him to the incounter of a young man, who ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming tugged couragiouſly for his life, with that pittileſſe element, making uſe then of this occaſion, that ſucceeded according to his wiſh, he thruſt his Arme into the ſea, and catching hold of the young man drew him up into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, which inſtantly landing on the ſhore vaniſhed with its Guid, leaving them both on the ſands very much aſtoniſhed thereat. Howbeit, <hi>Amadis</hi> ever confident, would not ſeeme to bee troubled with ſo ſudden a departure, but turned to his companion, whom for his beauty &amp; comely perſonage he much admired, and ſaid unto him. Gentleman, take courage, and be not diſmaied,

for now you are out of the power of the waues, nor can this land you tread upon be ſo dangerous, though it be unknowne to you. I cannot chuſe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hee, after hee was ſomewhat come to himſelfe againe, but bee ſomewhat amazed with the late perill I was in; yet Sir, it hath not ſo deprived me of judgement, that I ſhould not have ſufficient left me, to know how much I am obliged to you for my ſafety; you have ſaved my life, which you ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes diſpoſe of; in the meane time may it pleaſe you to permit me to ſeeke out meanes to dry my ſelfe, for I cannot continue long thus wet without ſome danger to my health. Here ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> unbuttoning a coat, which many times he wore over his Armour, cover your ſelfe with this whilſt your clothes are a drying, for I will not leave you till I ſee you in better caſe. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taking the coat went preſently aſide, and having ſtripped himſelfe, ſate downe on a ſtone, whither not long after <hi>Amadis</hi> came to him, whereupon wondring much at his goodly preſence in ſuch rich armes, hee aroſe ſomewhat aſhamed to be ſeene ſo halfe naked, and ſaid. Sir, what may I doe to ſhew my ſelfe gratefull for ſo many good offices, which I receive from your curteſie? You may, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> pay all this debt with a few words, and by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me who you are, and what occaſion brought you hither, you may oblige me as much, as you thinke you are ingaged to me. Could I ſerve you, ſaid hee, by declaring whom I am, without doubt I ſhould ſoone obey your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but Sir, my name being of ſo ſmall conſideration in the world, it wil import you little to know, and me much to conceale it, in which regard I ſhall humbly deſire you, to diſpence with me therein, and to be pleaſed if I onely ſay, that I am commonly called, the Knight of the Flowers: Touching my arrivall in this place, my deſtiny had unluckily brought mee hither, had I not met with you; for having imbarqued my ſelfe in a Port of <hi>Greece,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to travell the world, in the queſt of glory I ſayled very proſperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for three weekes together; during which time I never combatted but once, and that was with a Gyant for the reſcue of a Gentle-woman, whom hee had forcibly carried away; preſently whereupon the ſea began ſo to rage, that all the skill and courage the Marriners had were faine to give way to the violence of this tempeſt, which continued very neer three moneths, and by reaſon we went ſtill afore the wind, I cannot be perſwaded, but that we are now on thoſe unknown lands, whereof they of Aſia and Europe ſpeak only by conjecture. Theſe Knights having ſpent a good part of the day in this and the like diſcourſe, at length were ſo called upon by their ſtomacks, that ariſing from the graſſe where they lay, the Knight of the Flowers with his clothes on thoroughly dryed, and <hi>Amadis</hi> in his armour, they walked almoſt two hours without meeting any one that could direct them the way to the next Village, in ſuch ſort that growing ſomewhat weary, they layd them down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of certain trees, wher not long after they fell aſleepe, but they continued not ſo long, for they were awaked with the ſound of ſome Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, which marched in the head of threeſcore horſ, that were followed a good way off by four Coaches, invironed with three dreadfull Gyants, and a number of men unarmed on horſ-back. O me! ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> riſing up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amazed, what adventure is this? No very good one for you, ſaid one of that troop, who upon diſcovery of them came galloping before his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, for landing here without the licenſe of our Prince, you are to expect nothing but Irons for ſuch your temerity; By my beſt hopes, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will not be fettered ſo eaſily as you thinke for, and if I muſt die Ile ſell my

This while <hi>Amadis</hi> beſtirred himſelf with an admirable grace, for beholding himſelf inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with two Gyants, and three and twenty Knights, that were ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the firſt troop, he avoided moſt part of their blowes, and let his own fall with ſuch force, that in leſſe then an houre the two Giants ſaw their arms all dyed with their own blood, and themſelvs unable to hinder the death of twelve of thoſe that accompanied them, which put them into ſuch a rage, that their motions ſeemed to bee very thunder. Wherefore being aſhamed, that in the preſence of a number of Ladies which were in the Coaches, one man alone ſhould withſtand them, they diſcharged two ſuch mighty blows at an inſtant, the one on the Helmet, the other on the Shield of <hi>Amadis,</hi> that hee vvas conſtrained to knock his chin againſt the pommel of his ſaddle, caſting great abundance of blood out of his mouth and ears, but preſently reſetling himſelf, and more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then ever he was in his life, he advanced his rich ſword, and letting it deſcend on the head of him he firſt incountred, he cleft him down to the very waſt: This dreadfull blow having terrified all the aſſiſtants, vvho beheld him with wonder, did but more incenſe the remaining Giant; for in the higheſt exceſſe of his rage, he took his great Curtelas in both his hands, and thinking to determine this combat with one only blow, he diſcharged it ſo ſtrongly on his enemies Shield, that he devided it in two, and gave him a greatgaſh on the arm, wherat <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſomoved, as caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remains of his Shield over his ſhoulder, he made ſuch a lucky thruſt with all his force at his belly, that he ran him quite thorow and thorow,

ſending him ſtark dead to the ground; wherwithall not contented, he was turning him about to the reſt of the Knights, when as he perceived them to gallop away, and ſeek their ſafety in their flight; which cauſed him perſently to ſheath up his ſword, and approach unto the Coaches (where he beheld a many of Ladies in very great fear) for to comfort and aſſure them againſt any doubt they might be in of him; howbe it he had no more time then to ſee them, for before he could ſpeak to them, their Coachmen drove away withall poſſible ſpeed towards the Citie, which he diſcovered a little on the left hand; and ſo left him with extream diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, for ſo ſudden a departure; his ſoule being deeply engaged by one ſmall glimpſe he had of a Princeſſe, whoſe eys contained a million of charms.

the ſight of ſo many men ſlain with ſuch horrible blows, and the courage which you ſhewed in combatting ſuch dreadfull enemies, makes them talke of you, as of ſome prodigie: You are known not by your name, (for it is ſaid you are a ſtranger) but your armes have been ſo well noted, that you cannot carry them here without greatdanger; wherefore I would adviſe you for your good, either to change them, or to get you quickly out of this Empire. Out of what Empire, ſaid <hi>Amadis?</hi> How, anſwered the Shepherd, do not you know, that you are in the Empire of <hi>Martaria,</hi> one of the goodlieſt, and powerfulleſt Monarchies of the world? No verely, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I did not know it; for being arrived here but to day by a ſtrange accident, I could not have been informed of it, if by good fortune I had not met with thee; but letting that paſſe, canſt not thou inform me who thoſe Ladies were, which I ſaw in the Coaches du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the combat, and particularly ſhe in the green? That is ſaid he the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this Empire, and I am perſwaded the faireſt of all the women li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſhee is called <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and the other two were her ſiſters, named <hi>Amplamira,</hi> and <hi>Archeſidella,</hi> both of them ſo accompliſhed, as they may well diſpute ſomewhat with the eldeſt. Thou hadſt fully ſatisfied mee, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> wouldeſt thou but reſolve me of one thing more; what was the reaſon, ſay they, why the Giants and the Knights their followers, did not aſſaile me in the wood, having ſo much advantage of me as they had? The reaſon was apparent, anſwered he, for the way which you took was ſo dangerous, that it was wiſdom for them to retire, as they did. Wherefore was it dangerous, ſaid <hi>Amadis?</hi> In regard of a moſt dradfull Monſter, replyed he, which arriving there not long ſince hath made ſo great a ſpoyl and havock, as the Emperour himſelf will be conſtrained to abandon Cardana, the capitall Citie of his Empire, for to reſide in ſome other place. He hath ſent whole ſquadrons of armed men under the conduct of three or four Giants againſt it, but ſtill they have been torn in pieces, for the fury of this creature is ſo terrible, that the moſt confident tremble at the very ſight of it: He hath a body far bigger then an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, covered with green and yellow ſcails, ſo hard as no ſteel is able to pierce them; hee hath two heads, one that caſts forth a million of ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames, through the midſt of a number of teeth a cubit long, and the other armed vvith two very huge horns, wherunto the inevitable death of all ſuch as dare aſſail him is faſtned; his tayl is eight foot long, ſo ſtrong and mighty, that with it he overthrovvs all the trees that ſtand in his way; briefly, he is ſo horrible and cruell, that if the gods do not the ſooner put to their helping hand, this Province vvill ſhortly be laid vvaſt, vvhich vvere a lamentable thing, being ſo fertile and populous as it is: But pardon me, Sir, if I be ſo bold as to aske of you, hovv you having been upon the Mountain of Bears, vvhere his ordinary hauntis, could elcape his fury? for to ſpeak truth, I hold it a kind of miracle. Heaven, that hath preſerved me for his glory, ſaid he, vvould not ſuffer me to fal into the power of this Monſter: but leaving this diſcourſe, tell me what is become of the Gentleman that combatted by me unarmed? I beleeve, anſwered he, that hee will pay for the harme you have done, for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour having found him to be living, hath commanded the Surgeons to have a ſpeciall care of him, reſerving him as I think, for to ſacrifice him to his Gods, in regard of the extraordinary beauty wherewithall he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.

I hope hee ſhall do better, replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> in the mean time not to be ingratefull for thy good information of that which I deſired to know, I will give thee ſomewhat to relieve thy poverty, therwith hee took a Ring which he had on his finger of great value, and beſtowing it on him made him no leſſe amazed, then contented. Look, ſaid the Shepherd bowing himſelf even to the ground for to thank him, how our opinions do many times bring forth contrary effects, I thought I ſhould have been undone by incountring with you, and thereby I have found wherwithall to overcome the miſeries of my birth. Sir, your liberality obligeth mee to have a care of your ſafety, paſſe on no further with theſe armes, for you ſhall be ſure to meet with none but enemies wherſoever you go, time will beſt adviſe you for your future preſervation, in the mean while you ſhall ſpend this night if you pleaſe in a poor cottage of mine, wher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of any danger you may take a little reſt. <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing it was night, and perceiving the fellowes good will ſuffered himſelf to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by him to a Village hard by, whereunto entring ſecretly, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the care of his horſe to him, he ſate him down to ſupper, and having fed heartily on a Kid, that was ſerved into the table, he laid him down, all armed as hee was, on a bed, hoping to ſleep quietly thereafter his hard travell; howbeit his new paſſion would not permit him ſo to do, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the beauties of his Lady unto him, with the difficulties which appeared in his love, that ſo diſquieted him, as hee could do nothing but toſſe and tumble all the night long, at length being fully reſolved, I muſt hope, ſaid he, inſtead of complayning and afflicting my ſelf: I fear my Miſtreſſes, and the Emperours diſpleaſure, in regard of the combat which I had with their Knights, but I may repair that fault, and give them as much cauſe to favour, as now they have to hate me; this Monſter that ſpoyls their Territories muſt be fought withall; if I prevail, I ſhal oblige them with a ſervice that will produce their content, and the good of their people; if I fall in this attempt it will give an end to my miſeries, ſo that no way it can prove amiſſe for me to undertake this Enterpriſe: Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then with himſelf in this ſort he fell aſleep, and ſo continued till the Sun was of a pretty height, when ariſing, and finding his breakfaſt ready, after he had eaten a little he drew the Shepherd aſide, and ſaid unto him.

Aſſure your ſelf my Lord, ſaid he, that I will make little account of my life wher it ſhall concern your intereſt, only command, and without any doubt of my fidelity, be confident that I will not fayl in obeying you. Well, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> that which I would have thee do, is to go along with me to the Mountain of Bears, to the end thou mayeſt be witneſs of my actions, ſo as if I dye in the Combat, which I reſolve to undertake againſt this Monſter, that deſtroys ſo goodly a countrey, thouſhalt be obliged to find out the beautious <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and ſhalt tell her that the Knight, who ſlew her Guard, ſtuck not to expoſe his life for the conſervation of her people, therby to obtain her pardon, for the diſpleaſure ſhee received from his ſword; But if I get the victory, time ſhall further direct us.

Then it was that this Monſter feeling the pangs of death fell to ſtorming, and making ſuch horrible cryes, that they were heard even to Cardana, the Mountain ſhaking as if it had been ſtrucken with a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of thunderbolts: Wherupon the Knight perceiving him breathing forth his laſt, retyred aſide for to kneel down, and render thanks unto God for ſo glorious a victory; but being exceedingly weakned by the loſſe of his blood, and overcome with the vile ſent of the venom, which flowed out of the Monſter, hee fell all along on the ground with little appearance of life in him.

                     <p>That do I grant moſt willingly, ſayd <hi>Palmirenna;</hi> and ſeeing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to me hath made him ſo regardleſſe of ſuch a danger, I ſhall be as ſenſible of that good affection, as I would have been of his offence: Wherfore your Majeſtie (ſayd ſhe, continuing her ſpeech unto her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhall do well to command your Chyrurgions away before, whil'ſt we go fair and ſoftly after to behold this miracle. The Emperour very well pleaſed herewith, preſently diſpatched away his Chyrurgions, with a great charge to employ the uttermoſt of their skill for the recovery of the knight; and getting into his Daughters Coach, he followed them, accompanied with all his Nobilitie, who could not wonder ſufficiently at ſo prodigious a thing.</p>
                     <p>But we will leave them (thronging the wayes, and ſtriving which ſhould make moſt haſte to behold this redoubted Warriour; to whom this ſuccour had been unprofitable, if Heaven, that reſerved him for his glory, had not otherwiſe ordained of him) for to deliver what arrived to him after the Shepherds departure. Recovering then by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; he was ryſing to unarm himſelf, when he pereceived a Dwarf that ſayd unto him: Be of good cheer ſir, this action will bring you more glory, than harm; it is true, that your wounds are very dangerous, by reaſon the Monſters teeth are venemous; but I have aſſured remedies to preſerve you, and will do that for your recoverie, which the experience of the beſt Chyrurgions in the World would attempt in vaine; onely follow me, and let us not decline thoſe which come to ſeek you, for I hold it not fit to put you into their hands; not in regard of the Emperour or his Daughter, who with good reaſon prefer that which you have now performed, far before yeſterdaies offence, but the Gyants death having rendred their kindred your enemies, all the Princes favour cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you from being treacherouſlie murthered; wherfore be carefull, if you mean to abide here to keep your ſelf unknown. Saying thus, and and reaching him his hand, he helped him up with ſuch caſe; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very much amazed, to find ſo much ſtrength in ſo little a bodie.

                     <p>In the mean time the Emperours Chyrurgions were much troubled, for being come where the Monſter lay; and miſſing the knight that had been ſo recommended to their care, they were exceedingly afflicted; but eſpecially the poor Shepherd, who bitterly weeping, cried out. Alas!

Saying ſo, hee ſtript himſelf out of his clothes, put on the green velvet Gown, fitted his hair under the tyre with the aſſiſtance of a glaſſe, and admitting nothing that might ſerve to ſet forth a beauty, tricked up himſelf ſo neatly, as hee might well have been in love with his own form, had hee not been ſo with <hi>Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

wherefore wrapping up his ſword, which hee very much eſteemed of, in ſome linnen clothes hee buried it in a corner of the grot under a little earth, to the end hee might find it there again upon occaſion; that done, and little caring for the reſt of his Armes, hee left the grot, and taking the moſt beaten way, hee walked on, ſtill thinking how hee might make uſe of his diſguiſe: wherupon fortune being more favourable to him then hee expected, hee heard ſome comming, whom hee made ſhew, as though hee would ſhun, but deſiring nothing more then to fall into their hands, hee ſuffered himſelf to be ſeen, and then ſuddenly retiring under the trees, ſeemed to be much afraid of thoſe hee ſaw, which were about ſome ſix, who ſetting ſpurs to their horſes came up preſently to him wher he was. Beautious ſtranger, ſaid one of them that was formoſt, and that marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very much to behold ſo rare a creature, be not afraid, here are none but ſuch as are wholly devoted to your ſervice, be therefore pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what occaſion hath brought you hither; No other, alas; ſaid hee, ſhedding ſome tears the better to beguile them, but my evill fortune, for departing from the Empire of Greece, for to go unto Sicilia to the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of a ſiſter of mine; who was to be wedded to the Viceroy there, I was carried by the violence of a moſt furious tempeſt into this coaſt, wher not farre from hence our Ship ran againſt a Rock, and was caſt away with all that were in her as I beleeve, my miſerable ſelf excepted, who am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved I fear for greater misfortune. You are to hope better, anſwered this Barbarian, for the Gods have not preſerved you but for happier ends, as ſhall ſoon be made good unto you, if you can but love me, as I affect you. Now by my life, ſaid one of the others, whoſe heart was as deeply wounded as his, ſhee would ſhew but little judgement to preferre your affection before mine, that loves her more, and hath greater credit, and authority to aſſiſt her then you. At theſewords, the firſt giving him a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look, they both drew out their ſwords, and ſeconded by their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who inſtantly ſided with them, they charged one another ſo hotly, that in a quarter of an houre four of them were laid on the ground to the great contentment of <hi>Corazinda</hi> (ſo had <hi>Amadis</hi> then named himſelf) who ſtepping in between the other two, deſired them to become friends, and to tell him the name of the countrey. Fair Nymph, anſwered the one, you are in the Empire of Martaria, commanded by the beſt Prince of the world. Lead me to him then, ſaid ſhe, and not hazarding your lives for ſo worthleſs a ſubject, ſhare that recompence between you, which your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of me unto him may produce. Theſe Knights embracing ſo ſafe an offer, and leaving the dead bodies in the place went away with her to the Citie, where arriving at the Court before the Emperour, <hi>Corazinda</hi> with a ſweet and modeſt look fell on her knees, and making the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, which ſhee had done before unto his Knights, ſhe beſought him to have ſome compaſſion of her fortune, not permitting her to be any way injured.

In the mean time the Emperour acquainted his daughters with the acquiſition he had made of one of the faireſt ſlaves in the world.

This Coloſſus having heard it often ſaid, that handſomneſſe had as much power over the will of a woman, as the continuance of ſervices that were done her, laboured to ſweeten his look, which was moſt dreadfull, cauſed his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rough beard to be perfumed, combed his hair, that was harder then any horſes Mane, painted his ſwarthy face, apparelled himſelf in the richeſt robes hee could get, which made him more hideous, and omitting no occaſion to accoſt our Gentle-woman, entertained her with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his valour, of his wealth, and of the antiquity of his race; and propounded unto her incredible contentments in the poſſeſſion of him.

Alas, ſaid hee (no whit diſmayed with this ſurpriſe, but reſolved to diſcover himſelfe, ſince this encounter had hapned according to his wiſh) my diſpleaſure proceeds not from the grief of ſeeing my ſelfe eſloigned from my Countrey, ſince I voluntarily forſook it, for to travell the world, but I complain for that I am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, as I cannot hope for any content whilſt I live, unleſſe you wil take ſome pitty of my ſuffering, I muſt ſpeak, I can no longer conceale my thoughts; <hi>Almerina,</hi> in your hands reſts my life or death, I have indured incredible things before I would reſolve to diſcover my ſelf; and the fear to offend <hi>Amplamira,</hi> whom I love beyond all compariſon, far more then mine own ſoul, hath hitherto cloſed up my lips, but now the violence of my pains ſo terribly afflicts me, that I muſt impart this ſecret unto you; Sweet <hi>Almerina,</hi> have ſome compaſſion on me, tell her that which I ſay, and joyning your intreaties to my tears, render her ſenſible of my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: I am too daring, it is true, for ſuch an accompliſhed beauty deſerves no leſſe then the affection of a God, but if her eyes might ſtoop to a man, my birth hath not made me ſo mean, but that I may juſtly equal my ſelfe with the greateſt of the earth; now if I may receive a good office from you, bee aſſured that you ſhall not confer it upon an ungratefull perſon, nor ever repent any aſſiſtance you may give me.

That brave ſtranger, the Companion of him that defeated the Monſter, hee lay upon the graſs under the ſhadow of thoſe great trees, which make a demi-circle at the firſt door of the walk, and ſpake ſomewhat loud, not imagining that I was ſo neer him; His firſt ſpeeches were nothing but complaints againſt fortune, that ſpares no body, and that ordinarily fals upon the greateſt, the better to demonſtrate her power; but paſſing from that to ſpeak of Love, hee fetched ſome ſighes, and then proceeded in this manner. O yee gods, ſaid hee, how fair is <hi>Amplamira,</hi> but why doth not ſhee know that I love her? I have a thouſand times reſolved to let her underſtand my affection, and a thouſand times again hath reſpect ſhut up my mouth, fearing to offend her by the overture of my heart; nevertheleſs it is neceſſary that ſhee know it, at leaſt wiſe if ever I will hope for content, but how ſhall that be, dare I be ſo hardy as to ſpeak unto her? No verely, fear would tye up my tongue, and the lightning of her eyes would ſtrike me dumbe: To acquaint her with it otherwiſe, alack I ſee little likelihood, here I am unknown; and of millions that in my own countrey would moſt gladly ſerve mee, not one is preſent to undertake this afair, I muſt dye then with this regret, that I have loved the faireſt, and moſt excellent creature in the world, and durſt not publiſh it. Theſe words being drowned with a ſea of tears, hee turned him about, and took a paper out of his pocket, over the which hee lamented anew. How happy wouldſt thou be, ſaid hee, if thou mighteſt bee permitted to touch the delicate hands of my Miſtris, and what would not I give then to ſee my ſelfe in thy place? Doubtleſſe J ſhould not grieve at the loſs of ſo much greatneſſe as a tends mee; and though it ſhould immediately preced my death, I ſhould be no way ſorry for it. What ſhould I ſay more? All his motions, Madam, were full of love, hee wiſhed a thouſand, and a thouſand times that hee might be beloved of you; in the middeſt of this Agony he roſe up, and went away, leaving the paper which it ſeems hee forgot, behind him upon the ground, where I found it all bedewed with his tears, and which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent here unto you, open it, peradventure you will meet with the ſame diſcourſe in it, as I made you but now. Whereupon kiſſing the Letter, which <hi>Floridan</hi> had given her, ſhee delivered it to the Princeſſe, who made ſome difficulty at the firſt to receive it, howbeit being a little urged by <hi>Almerina,</hi> but more by the deſire ſhee had to learn who the Knight was, ſhee opened it, and read this which followeth.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17218:204"/>
howbeit, ſeeing no body appear, hee got into an arbour, covered with Iaſemine, where the fear of meeting with new difficulties in his enterpriſe, aſſailing him, he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In vain I attend a felicity that I have never deſerved, <hi>Amplamira</hi> will not come, and the ſweetneſſe of thoſe hopes, which had already placed me in the ſupremeſt degree of glory, will, I doubt, be changed into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, the houre preſcribed me is paſt, <hi>Almerina</hi> appears not, what ſhal I think then of ſo grievous a retardment, but that which hath always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the evill fortune of my actions?

                     <p>Herewith going out of the Arbour, as if hee would have ſought for the end of his days, hee perceived that Sun to appear, whoſe approach he had attended with ſo much impatience, which ſo tranſported him with the exceſſe of a ſudden joy, as notable to ſuſtain himſelfe hee fell on his knees, but ſo oportunely, that <hi>Amplamira</hi> arriving thereupon, by the cunning of <hi>Almerina</hi> (who had gotten her down into the Garden, under colour of conferring privately with her, about the laſt nights Affair) ſhee beleeved that it was purpoſely done to obtain that of her which hee had ſued for by his Letter. Their amazement being great, they beheld one another a good while without ſpeaking a word, <hi>Floridan</hi> trembled, <hi>Ampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> found her ſelfe ſurpriſed by ſo unexpected an incounter, and knew not how to ſpeak to this Lover, doubting to ſhew her ſelfe, either too free, or too reſerved; howbeit receiving incredible content, to ſee him at her feet in ſuch great humility, and judging by his fear, that hee was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love; ſhee ſaid unto him, with a behaviour that teſtified more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, then good will, Knight what is it that you demand? That which I can never hope for, anſwered he, if you ſhall conſider the excellencie of your beauty, the greatneſſe of your birth, and the merit of your vertues; I wiſh for a place in your heart, and that I may be permitted to bear Arms as your Knight. Why who are you, replyed ſhe, that askes ſo freely what the greateſt Prince of the earth could not have without infinit labour? Madam, anſwered he, I will boaſt more in being yours, and will draw more glory from your ſervice, then from all the kingdoms of the world, nevertheleſſe if you will know who I am, it is fit I ſhould obey your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; wherefore I will declare it to you, but Madam be pleaſed, it may be conditionally that no body know it but your ſelfe, untill ſuch time as it ſhall be requiſite to have it publiſhed in the Court, I am named <hi>Floridan</hi> of Perſia, the ſonne of <hi>Rogell</hi> of Greece, Heir to the Empires of <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond,</hi> Conſtantinople, and Perſia, of which peradventure you have heard little ſpoken, in regard of the dangers which are met withall in traverſing the Seas that ſeparate them from this Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Ariſe Prince, ſaid <hi>Amplamira</hi> then (lending him her hand with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full content to have learnt that his birth was ſo tranſcendent) your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not permit me to leave you in the ſtate where you are, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms you ſpeak of, are indeed very remote from hence; but yet we have had ſome knowledge of them, for our Admirall about three yeeres ſince viſited all thoſe coaſts, and at his return recounting a good part of the warlike exploits of the Princes of Greece, hee brought us their names,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17218:205"/>
amongſt the which I well remember, how that which you give to your Father is one; come let us make a turn in this Garden, and I will tell you my reſolution upon the demand, you made me: Whereupon walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the allies with incredible content to <hi>Floridan,</hi> who held and kiſſed his Ladies hand, whilſt ſhee accepted of his ſervice, and commanding him to be no leſſe faithfull then loving promiſed to meet him oftentimes in that place; provided that it might ſtill bee with that reſpect, which was to be obſerved to one of her quality; whereunto <hi>Floridan</hi> having deeply ſworn, ſhee wiſely retyred to avoid the incounter of any one, and left him better ſatisfied, then ever hee was in his life.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Love wrought ſtrange miracles, he made <hi>Palmirenna</hi> in love with her ſlave, and poſſeſſed her with as much deſire as the other; beholding her continually to ſigh, ſhe likewiſe ſighed, and ſaid to her ſelf; O yee gods! how cruell is my fate to make me feel the ſame paſſions for a Woman, as I ſhould doe for a Knight! that which ſhe indures for mee, ſhould make me wiſe, and keep me from falling into the like inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; what elſe can I expect from this deſire, but an impoſſible content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a pain without all hope? I called thee fool <hi>Corazinda,</hi> but alas I am a greater, and yet not ſo, our errour is common, our miſeries are equally ſhared, I can give thee no remedy, nor canſt thou bring mee any, nature having made us ſo wretched, as to render us impotent to our wiſhes. Why art not thou a man, or why am not I one? So ſhould wee not languiſh in this ſort; for preferring thy merit before the greateſt Crowns of the earth, I would become thy Wife, or I would ſoon be thy husband; wherwith looking on her fair ſlave, who had then the ſame thoughts, ſhee took her in her armes, and feeling ſome thing by chance that women have not, ſhee joyned her lips to hers, with ſuch ardour, as did denote a more then ordinary paſſion, whereof our Warriour was ſo ſenſible, that he was about to diſcover himſelf, but being retained by the fear of precipitating his felicity, hee contented himſelf with giving her two kiſſes for one: upon the continuance of which, <hi>Palmirenna</hi> ſtil think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the incounter ſhee had made, ſaid laughing unto him. Ah, <hi>Cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinda,</hi> nature hath done us great wrong, for if you had been a Knight, we might have lived together with incredible contentment. I Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, ſo as you would have conferred the ſame favour on me, which now I receive from you. Beleeve me, replyed ſhe, that I have wiſhed it a thouſand times of late; whereupon rounding her in the eare, that hee might not be over-heard by <hi>Creſtia,</hi> the moſt intimate of her Women that was by, hee ſaid unto her, Madam, be pleaſed to remember this ſpeech; the gods that heretofore have animated a work of Marble, for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a mortall man, may authoriſe your wiſhes, in hope wherof I will inſtantly go and ſacrifice unto them, for to obtain ſo infinit a grace.</p>
                     <p>This ſaid hee departed, and leaving a mighty ſuſpition in the mind of this Princeſſe, hee retyred into a room, that was but little frequented; and walking there a good while, hee reſolved to diſcover himſelf as ſoon as he could; and indeed not long after <hi>Palmirenna;</hi> who was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, comming thether with an intent to know more of the matter, he met her, and began the diſcourſe, which he meant to make unto her, with new aſſurance of his love, when as ſhe taking him by the hand, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, ſaying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17218:205"/>
                        <hi>Corazinda,</hi> I am not hereto inform my ſelfe, whether you love me or no, I have too certain proofes of that, but to underſtand the truth of a ſecret, whereof I have already ſome knowledge, your ſpeeches have opened my eyes, and doe almoſt aſſure mee, that you are a Knight, diſguiſed for ſome great deſign, diſcover your ſelfe freely unto me, if you deſire that I ſhould contribute to your Enterpriſe, I love you too much, either to reveale it, or to diſcover you therein.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid hee, falling on his knees before her, you indeed behold a moſt infortunate Knight, if you ſtand on the offence he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, appearing before you otherwiſe then in Armes for your ſervice; but the happieſt in the world, if you ſhall pleaſe to continue thoſe favours unto him, which you have given to the beliefe of his ſex. Love, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves a Lover, without ſome means of relief, having two dayes after I had to my griefe defeated your Guard, conducted mee to the Sea-ſide, made me at the very ſame time meet with a woodden Cheſt, wherin were the clothes that I had on, when I was brought hether as a ſlave, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with the invention to fit my ſelfe with them, imagining as it is fallen out, that I ſhould fall into your hands, and that Time, or my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices might oblige you to love me: I know well, that this ſo audacious a part deſerves no leſſe then death, wherunto I moſt willingly ſubmit my ſelfe; but when you ſhall have conſidered, Madam, that it will be more blame to you, then praiſe, you will preſerve him, in ſtead of ſeeking his ruine.</p>
                     <p>It were but reaſon (anſwered ſhe ſomewhat coldly, the better to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the greatneſſe of the Knights affection) that I ſhould ſeek out puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to chaſtiſe this daring impudence of yours, but being more gently diſpoſed, I will only baniſh you my company, with a commandement never to preſent your ſelf again before mee. O this is too rigorous a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſaid hee, to leave a Lover with life, Madam. I will go and revenge you of my inſolence. Therewith he fell down in the place with ſo little colour, and motion, that <hi>Palmirenna</hi> verely beleeved he was dead, which put her into ſuch a confuſion, as ſhe was ready to follow him, howbeit taking a little courage to her, ſhe got her ſpeedily away, and calling <hi>Creſtia</hi> declared what had hapned, conjuring her to aſſiſt her in ſo important an Affair.</p>
                     <p>This Maid perceiving by her Miſtris's ſpeech, that ſhe was deeply in love, ſaid to her with a ſmiling countenance. Madam, you are too much troubled upon ſo little occaſion, have you never heard that love hath done far greater wonders, onely tellme whither the death of this Knight will pleaſe you, or whether you deſire hee ſhould live? Alas, ſaid hee, <hi>Creſtia,</hi> doſt thou not know that I was never cruelly minded. Enough Madam, anſwered ſhe, leave the care of this to me, and you ſhall ſee that I will cure you both; ſaying ſo, ſhee took a little water in a diſh, and going ſpeedily to the room where <hi>Amadis</hi> lay in a ſwound, ſhe ſprinkled it on his face till he came to himſelf againe. Seeing him then to open his eyes, ſhee ſaid unto him: Verely I did not think you had had ſo little heart, as to be diſcouraged for a word ſpeaking: Vp, up, Love is like to favour you more then you imagine.</p>
                     <p>Hereat <hi>Amadis</hi> was going to riſe, but hee was ſo faint, that he was not able to do ſo, without the helpe of <hi>Creſtia,</hi> who led him to his Chamber,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17218:206"/>
and having given him a little preſerve to comfort him, ſhe ſaid. Come it is no time now to diſſemble, or to conceale your thoughts from me; I know that which hitherto you have kept ſo ſecret, for the Princeſſe my Miſtris hath diſcovered whatſoever hath paſt betwixt you unto me, I am able to doe much for you, but I will never ſerve you, unleſſe you will ſweare unto me by the faith which you owe unto the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to acquaint mee truly with that I ſhall deſire to know of you, for therupon depends all your future good or hurt. Let Heaven ſhew ſome ſtrange judgement on me, anſwered he, ſomewhat faintly, if I do not tell you freely whatſoever you ſhall demand of me. Declare then unto me who you are, replyed ſhe, that if it can be done with reaſon I may reſtore you into the good grace of my Lady, who doubtleſſe had juſt cauſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, as ſhe did. I will obey you moſt willingly, ſaid he; My name is <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſonne to the great Emperour of Greece and Trebiſond, but the moſt unhappy Knight breathing, if having ſuch powerto helpe me, you take not ſome compaſſion of my caſe, dear <hi>Creſtia</hi> paſſe by my little merit, and perſwade this incenſed beauty to pardon mee, or if ſo be my death is more agreeable to her, order it in ſuch ſort that I may receive it from her hands, or by her commandement, for it would grieve me far leſſe, to have it come to me ſo ſweet a way. Shee ſhall not bee ſo rigorous, anſwered <hi>Creſtia,</hi> let me alone to make your peace, and be comforted, whilſt I take care to render you happy.</p>
                     <p>So leaving him in his bed, ſhe went to find out <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at her comming, fearing ſome ill news of this Knight, whom ſhee infinitly affected; but ſeeing her look merrily, ſhee was confirm'd, and with-drawing her to a Window, that jetted upon the Garden, ſhe asked her what ſhee had done. Much more then you think for, anſwered <hi>Creſtia,</hi> your Knight is living, and which is more, I know him for one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Princes of the world, ſonne to the excellent Emperour of Greece and Trebiſond, of whom our Admirall hath ſo often ſpoken ſince his return. Good gods, ſaid <hi>Palmivenna,</hi> what is this thou telleſt me? is it poſſible that hee is iſſued out of ſo high, and noble a race? how great an errour have I committed to uſe him ſo cruelly, I fear <hi>Creſtia,</hi> he will be too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this affront. Nay rather, ſaid <hi>Creſtia,</hi> it hath made him more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee you, but that hee dares not doe, becauſe hee will not diſobey your commandement, before hee knows that you will be pleaſed with it; He is in his bed, go to him after dinner, it will give you a great deale of ſatisfaction to talk with him.</p>
                     <p>This Princeſſe, being carried more by her paſſion, then <hi>Creſtia's</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell failed not to viſit this ſick patient, as ſoon as ſhe was riſen from table, and perceiving ſome tears in his eyes, which the doubt of finding his Miſtris inexorable to <hi>Creſtia's</hi> perſwaſions, had produced, ſhe comforted him with ſo amorous a grace, that he preſently recovered his former hue, giving her a million of thanks for the care ſhe took of his health. There needed no leſſe a Phyſician, ſaid he unto her, then you to cure ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a diſeaſe; but, Madam, will you never remember my offence? no my Lord anſwered ſhe, but to love you the more; for aſſuring my ſelfe that the violence of your affection counſelled you to diſguiſe your ſelfe, and that your intents were fair, I find my ſelfe indebted to my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſo as you excuſe me if ignorant of your quality, I have ſpoken

more rudely unto you then was fit. Ah, Madam! ſaid he, kiſſing her hand, you kil me with talking in this manner, for you have abſolute power over my life, and may intreat me as you pleaſe, at which too I may not repine: whereupon moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Madam, you have ſo ſurpriſed me, that in good

faith I ſcarce know yet wher I am; for that which you deſire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of me, concerns me ſo neer, that I could rather dye, a thouſand times, then confeſſe it any other where; but deſiring to give all obedience to your commandements, and ſatisfaction to the friendſhip of this Knight, I will not ſtick to acknowledge unto you, that the Princeſſe <hi>Amplamira</hi> wiſhes me well, and that ſhe hath declared how ſhe is pleaſed with my ſervitude. That is enough, ſaid <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> our danger will be brought to a good port, Sir follow me, and be not troubled with the captivity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into I will put you, it ſhall not be but to make you reliſh your liberty the better.</p>

Love, whoſe power is unreſiſtable, unable to put me into paſſion, for any of thoſe many Princes, which heretofore have ſighed for me, hath poſſeſt me with ſo much for this ſlave, that not to lye, I was reduced to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of diſpair, thinking that my affections was mad and impoſſible, but my good <hi>Genius</hi> having opened mine eyes, I came this morning to know, that the habit ſhe wore, was uſurped for the love of me, and that it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the body of the valiant Knight, who cleared this Province of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it was in, by the death of that dreadfull Monſter, which would have rendred it deſolate, this hath induced me to reſolve (after I had learned of him that he was the ſonne of the renowned Emperour of Greece) to make him this day my husband, wherof I deſire you ſhould be participant, as well to teſtifie the truſt I repoſe in you; as to intreat you to be a witneſſe for me, that I do not receive him into my bed, before he hath taken a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath to eſpouſe me publikely in his Empire, or here in our fathers dominions, if we can diſpoſe him therunto: do that then (continued ſhe ſpeaking to <hi>Amadis)</hi> which is to be done on your part, to the end that the careſſes, which you ſhall receive from me, may be without blame.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> then, I proteſt before heaven, before this excellent Princeſſe, and before theſe faithfull Ladies, never to have other Wife, then you, and to eſpouſe you ſolemnly, whenſoever you pleaſe, as now I do eſpouſe you. Saying this, he took a rich Diamond from off his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and put it on his fair Miſtreſſes, who giving him an amorous kiſs, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him her husband and Knight.</p>
                     <p>O yee gods, what have I ſeen (ſaid <hi>Amplamira,</hi> almoſt loſt in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe things) and what may not one beleeve, concerning the power of a divinity that works ſuch ſtrange miracles? A woman changes her ſex, a ſlave becomes in an inſtant Lord of Martaria, and I have for my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Soveraign, the Prince of Greece, whom but even now I beheld to be a vagabond Girle. Verely I am loſt, and muſt needs beleeve that theſe things are done by inchantment: Is not all this an illuſion ſiſter? or do you not tell it me to make ſport with me?</p>
                     <p>No indeed, ſaid <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> I have ſpoken nothing but the truth, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17218:208"/>
therefore you muſt be aſſured that this Prince here, whoſe name is <hi>Amadis,</hi> is my Lord and Husband. It is fit then, replyed <hi>Amplamira,</hi> that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your choyce, I acknowledge him for Sovereign of <hi>Martaria,</hi> and that I kiſs his hands in token of the homage which he is to expect from his Subjects. Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadis;</hi> it wil be more glory for me to be your Brother, then your Lord, wherfore you ſhal do me a favour, to let me have yours to kiſs, by way of humble thanks, for the conſent you are pleaſed to give unto my good fortune, for a beginning wherof I intreat you not to refuſe me one boon I ſhal demand of you. My Lord, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, I have no other will but yours, and therfore you may eaſily obtain whatſoever you ſhall deſire of me. Confer then (replyed <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſtepping ſuddenly to <hi>Palmirenna's</hi> Cabinet, and preſenting <hi>Floridan</hi> unto her) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer then, Madam, the ſame grace on this Knight, who is my Nephew, as I have received from your Siſter; the Empire of Perſia attends him, and the merit of his perſon deſerves it from you.</p>
                     <p>O ye Gods! (cryed <hi>Amplamira</hi> againe, and moreamazed then before,) what ſecond wonder is this? muſt I be of the partie too? That you muſt, Siſter, anſwered <hi>Palmirenna</hi> ſtraight, if you deſire your own good, for this Knight being one of the handſomeſt, greateſt, and moſt accompliſhed Princes of the world, you cannot fall into a better hand. I receive him then with all my heart, ſaid ſhe, but I would have the conſummation of this Mariage deferred for a while. Ah, Madam, ſaid <hi>Floridan,</hi> be not leſs kind then your ſiſter, nor give her the glory of loving better then you, how miſerable ſhould I be, to ſigh whilſt others live happily amidſt their delights: Behold me with an eye of pittie, ſaid he, kneeling down before her, and conſider that time may make an end of me with grieving. Ariſe, ſaid ſhe, joyning her lips to his, my love and your merit have overcom me. Herewith, <hi>Floridan</hi> having ſworn the ſame to her, which <hi>Amadis</hi> had done unto his Lady; ſhe took a Ring of him, and accepted him for her Husband. That done, they departed one from another, after they had concluded to keep this affair very ſecret, and to leave unto <hi>Amadis</hi> his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and name, under colour wherof he lay with <hi>Palmirenna</hi> without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition; and ſo getting to bed, they appeaſed the violence of their deſires, wherin let us leave them for to ſee what reſolution <hi>Bruſtafard</hi> took, being wonderfull paſſionate for the love of the faire ſlave.</p>

Go then, ſo as it may ſtand with his Majeſties pleaſure, I wil be the prize of your victory. O ye Gods! ſaid <hi>Tarfander</hi> to himſelf, what is this I heare? my hopes are at an end, nor can I wiſh for any thing now but death, which I wil ſeek for at the point of my rivals Launce. Ah! <hi>Cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinda,</hi> how unadviſed are you voluntarily to ingage your ſelf in ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a captivitie? do you think to find delight in the bed of ſuch an ugly fellow, or any ſweetneſs in the kiſſes of ſuch beaſtly lips? you will curſe the time that ever you were ſo light of your promiſe, for had you done it with any hope, there had been comfort yet, but alas! your misfortune is remedileſs, the whole Empire hath not a Knight able to reſiſt the force of this Gyant, ſo that of <hi>Palmirenna's,</hi> you wil become <hi>Buſtrafards</hi> ſlave.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt this Lover complained in this manner; <hi>Buſtrafard</hi> having eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained permiſſion to Combat, went and armed himſelf, leaving the Courtiers not ſo much marvelling at his vain craking, as at <hi>Corazinda's</hi> raſh promiſe, who turning her fair eies to <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> ſaid unto her: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Miſtris, do not ye think that I had reaſon to entertain this gailant? No marrie do I, ſaid <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> who ſeemed to be diſcontented with this accord, you have been a great deal to raſh, for ſince you are mine, my Wil ought to be a Law unto you. Why, Madam, ſaid <hi>Corazinda,</hi> do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at my good fortune? Now on my faith, ſaid <hi>Amplamira,</hi> who could not forbear laughing, there is no body here that wil envie you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſo ſweet a ſervant. Howſoever I ſhall have this advantage of you, replyed <hi>Corazinda,</hi> that my beautie wil do wonders, whilſt you ſhal not be ſo much as ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe having redoubled their laughter, the Princeſſes led <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razinda</hi> in triumph to the windowes, where ſhe and <hi>Palmirenna</hi> placed themſelves together for to be hold the cariage of this valiant Lover; who in the mean time being very richly armed, appeared in the field with ſuch a daring confidence, as no body durſt undertake him. Howbeit not very long after, a big Knight arived in the Liſts, who addreſſing himſelf unto <hi>Bruſtafard,</hi> ſaid, Gyant, I come not hither to diſpute with <hi>Corazinda</hi> for the glorie of being one of the fayreſt creatures in the world, for my eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her is as great, if not greater then thine; but to abate thy pride, which perſwades thee, that no other Knight beſides thy ſelf is worthy to ſerve her. Now by my beſt hopes, ſaid the Gyant, ſomwhat netled with his ſpeech, I find thy body too little for ſo great an attempt; nevertheleſs being here to receive all commers, I hold it fit to give thee content.

                     <p>In the mean time the Gyant, with no other but his firſt Launce over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the King of Arbales, the Duke of Corzan, the King of Calizant, the Marquis of Bonport, the Duke of Plemond, and the Earl of Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, brave Knights, and that had acquired much glory in the adventures of the world.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Warriours ſo eaſily unhorſed, retyred with extream diſcontent, and not long after the Emperour ſeeing no more appear, returned likwiſe into his Pallace, where he demanded of his Daughters what they thought of the Gyants deſignes. We think, anſwered <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> that there is more folly then courage in it, for it is an unprofitable labour, in regard we are perſwaded that <hi>Corazinda</hi> wil never yeeld her ſelf up into the power of ſo ugly, and il-favoured a thing, if his valour ſhould happen to make him triumph over all that oppoſe him. O Madam, ſaid <hi>Corazinda,</hi> do not judge ſo amiſs of a Maidens promiſe, for why ſhould not I love him? I find no defect in him, his hair is not yet cleane white, the perfuming of his beard takes away the ill ſavour of his flat noſe; he affects me much, I ſhould be very ingratefull then, to let him conſume away without ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him. I but, prettie one, ſaid the Emperour, ſpeak you in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt? That I do verely, anſwered ſhe, laughing with <hi>Palmirenna</hi> at the Emperours fear; for if ſome valiant Knight do not dſ-ingage me, I may not be worſe then my word, though it be in my choice whether I wil love him or no. Now in good faith, ſaid the Emperour, drawing her aſide, you wil much wrong your ſelf, to prefer his ſatisfaction before mine. Why Sir, ſaid <hi>Corazinda,</hi> can you think I am ſo baſe-minded? beleeve it he ſhall never draw any favour from me, and if I entertaine ſuch an opinion in him, it is but to make ſport; the honour of your affection is dearer to me then my life; and if I do not ſatisfie your deſire, yet aſſure your ſelf, Sir, it is out of the conſideration of a thing which you wil allow of hereafter.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe finiſhing by the arryval of <hi>Bruſtafard,</hi> who came glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in with the ſpoyls of the vanquiſhed, which he placed at the feet of his Miſtris; every one talked of this love til ſupper; where <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and her Siſter <hi>Amplamira,</hi> would not be preſent, to have the more libertie to careſs their Lovers in private: Commanding a Table to be covered them in <hi>Palmirenna's</hi> chamber, they ſate them down all foure; being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by none but their Secretaries, and falling to ſpeak of <hi>Bruſtafards</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; <hi>Amadis</hi> intreated <hi>Floridan</hi> to combat him the next day, which queſtionleſs had been moſt inſupportable to his <hi>Amplamira,</hi> had ſhe not been perſwaded that <hi>Amadis</hi> would not have expoſed him to ſuch danger, if it had not been to have given him the greater reputation in the Court, wherfore arming her ſelfe with patience, ſhe permitted him to undertake it, and perceiving it to be bed time, ſhe ſecretly retyred with him, leaving <hi>Amadis</hi> with <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> without any ſuſpition of her women.</p>
                     <p>The night being ſweetly paſt away, <hi>Floridan</hi> aroſe, and deſiring <hi>Ampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> to be preſent at his combat with <hi>Buſtrafard,</hi> he went to the King of <hi>Arbales,</hi> with whom he had contracted ſome friendſhip; and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by him with all that ſeemed neceſſary for his enterprize, he mounted upon a luſtie Horſe, and appeared in the Liſts at ſuch time as the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17218:210"/>
Gyant having overthrown the King of Ariſdan, the Marqueſſe of Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, and the Count Cordena, with an intollerable arrogance, challenged the Knights of the Court to combat with him altogether, the brave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this Warrior, that managed his Horſe in a moſt gallant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having turned the eys of all the aſſiſtants upon him, eſpecially of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plamira,</hi> who beheld him with motions of love and fear, he approached unto <hi>Buſtrafard,</hi> and ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Knight, your inſolence doth ſo diſtaſt me, that I reſolve to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom you have driven out of the field, or cure your brain of the diſtemper, wherwithall <hi>Corazinda's</hi> beauty hath infected it. I had thought, anſwered he incholler, that others example would have made thee wiſe; but ſincethou wilt needs be loſt with them for company, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thine own folly for it. Charging his Launce then with more fury then at any time before; he met <hi>Floridan</hi> in the middeſt of the courſe, whoſe Shield being unable to reſiſt the violence of ſo ſtrong an incounter, was pierced in ſuch ſort, as the ſtaffe paſſing under his arm, had almoſt put <hi>Amplamira</hi> beſides her ſelf, out of the opinion ſhee had, that it was run through his body, but ſeeing her Lover in his ſaddle, and his enemy on the ground, with a dangerous wound in his ſide, and judging by the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and clapping of the peoples hands, who therby teſtified the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they took in beholding that proud maſſe of fleſh overthrown, ſhee grew ſomewhat confident, and prayed unto her gods, for to give her Knight the ſame honour in his combat on foot, as he had had on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Giant full of rage aroſe with ſtrange blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and in regard his enemy was alighted, becauſe he would not fight with advantage, he advanced his ſword, and thinking to divide him with the firſt blow, he let it fall with ſuch force, that queſtionleſſe the effect had anſwered his expectation, had not <hi>Floridan,</hi> ſeeing it comming, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily avoided it, letting him then cleave the ayr, and the ground in vain, he diſcharged ſo furious a ſtroak on his Helmet, that hee made him knock his chin againſt his boſom, carrying away to the very skull, all that his blade met withall. O yee gods! ſaid the Emperour, what a horrible blow was this? doubtleſſe this Knight is one of the valienteſt of the earth; and if he continues in this ſort <hi>Corazinda</hi> will have power to beſtow her favours on ſome other.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the Emperour was ſaying this, the Giant, that did not beleeve he could have found ſo much ſtrength in one man, ſtaggered a little; but inſtantly recovering himſelf with an incredible rage, he began to deale ſuch deſperate blows, that every one looked each minute to ſee the Knight cut in pieces; howbeit he avoided them with ſuch quick agility, and gave him ſo many wounds, thatall which beheld him cryed out, that the very God of battails uſed not more grace in his fight, nor more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in his ſtroaks. Some hours being ſpent in the heate of this Duell, the Gyant would have retyred, to take a little breath; but <hi>Floridan,</hi> who was vexed to be ſo long in vanquiſhing before his Miſtris, preſſed him ſo hard, as he was conſtrained to defend himſelf, and renew the combat, charging one another then with greater fury, then at the beginning, they delivered a world of blows, wherof one chancing to light on <hi>Floridans</hi> ſhoulder, gave him a wound more large then dangerous, which put him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17218:210"/>
into ſuch choller, that taking his ſword in both his hands, and advanting it with an intent to cleave him aſunder, he perceived a great Knight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two dreadfull Gyants, entring the Liſts, who came gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopping in for to part them, but in vain; for <hi>Floridan</hi> having his ſword aloft, let it deſcend in ſuch terrible force on <hi>Buſtrafards</hi> head, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ſtruck but with the flat, he ſent him to the earth, caſting great abundance of blood out of his mouth, and ears; wherupon leaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſaddle, he made head to the Giants, who this while were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, that ſo furious a blow ſhould proceed from the hand of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man; howbeit, ſeeing that they ſtirred not, and gueſſing by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that they were not come to aſſault him, hee retyred to the King of Arbales, who received him with incredible content, leaving <hi>Buſtrafard</hi> to the care of his brothers, that grumbling vowed to take a cruell revenge of this affront.</p>

                     <p>Great Monarch of Martaria, the reputation you have of being as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and magnanimous a Prince, as any is in the world, hath drawn hither <hi>Don Rifantes</hi> the Heir of Cabilla, <hi>Brundemor</hi> King of Corcutan, and <hi>Rozagant</hi> King of Alfanar to obtain two things of your Majeſtie, the which you may grant with this aſſurance, that they ſhall not be requeſted of you, but for the good of your eſtate, and the glory of your Crown;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17218:211"/>
The firſt is, that we may be permitted to maintain both with the Launce and Sword for three days together againſt all Commers, that the beauty of theſe three excellent Princeſſes your Daughter, doth ſurpaſſe that of all other Women living; and becauſe the effect of our valour ought to preceed that of the ſecond, to the end you may willingly accord unto it; we will forbear to ſpeak of it till ſuch time as you have ſeen the power of our Armes.</p>
                     <p>Brave Prince, ſaid the Emperour, riſing out of his Thron to embrace them, the pains you have taken, ſo much obliges mee, that I gladly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to both of your demands: my Daughters do not deſerve that your Swords ſhould be employed to recommend them in the world; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſince you will do them ſo great an honour, you ſhall find the Liſts ready againſt you pleaſe, and my ſelf diſpoſed to refuſe you nothing which lyes in me to grant. This is as much Sir, ſaid <hi>Don Rifantes,</hi> as we can deſire from you, ſo that if your Knights have Miſtreſſes, wee ſhall not want work; departing then, notwithſtanding the Emperours intreaty to have them lodge in the Court, they cauſed a rich Pavilion to be ſet up in the place wher <hi>Floridan</hi> had demeaned himſelf ſo valiantly againſt <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrafard,</hi> and there attended the comming of ſome Aſſaylant.</p>
                     <p>The Arrogance of theſe Knights growing odious to al the Courtiers, eſpecially to our Lovers, who were confident what their ſecond deſign would be, divers Knights went to arm themſelvs for to combat them, of whom <hi>Floridan</hi> would have been the foremoſt, had not his Lady abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded him to forbear, untill the Chyrurgions had taken order with his wound.</p>
                     <p>The place being on an inſtant covered with a world of people, ſix Knights preſented themſelvs, wherof three ſeeing <hi>Don Rifantes,</hi> and his companions ready mounted, ſet ſpurs to their horſes, but with ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune for them, that they were all three overthrown to the ground, their Adverſaries not ſo much, as ſeeming to be any whit moved with ſo furious an incounter; Their fellows exceedingly vext at this accident, put themſelvs preſently in their places, with ſome hope to revenge them, howbeit their fortune was nothing better, receiving ſuch cruell fals, as made all the aſſiſtants talk of their enemies extraordinary force, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their ſtation in a moſt proud manner, were perſwaded that they had terrified all the Court from attempting them again; but they were not long in that mind; for <hi>Tarſander</hi> appeared in the Liſts, accompanied with the the Marqueſſe of Bonport, the Earle of Tranates Son, the Marqueſſe of Rocque, the Duke of Corzan, the Prince of Balivana, a young Knight but very valiant, and couragious.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſix Warriors furniſhed with ſtrong Launces, planted themſelves juſt againſt the Gyants, who at the ſound of the Trumpet diſlodged with ſuch fury againſt <hi>Tarſander,</hi> the Marqueſſe of Bonport, and the Prince of Balivana, that they broke their ſtaves into a thouſand ſhivers, leaving the three Knights ſo ſhaken, that the leaſt touch in the world had infallibly carried them to the earth; howbeit reſetling themſelvs, they took freſh Launces, and returned againſt their enemies, who vexed to ſee them ſtil in their ſaddles, incounterd them ſo rudely, that they were conſtrained to fly over the Cruppers of their horſes, to the extreem diſcontent of the Duke of Corzan, who advancing then with his companions, received the ſame

                     <p>Theſe ſix of the beſt Knights of the Empire, being ſo eaſily vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not a man more preſented himſelf, ſo that night approaching, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was fain to retyre, marvellouſly commending the valour of theſe ſtrangers, but particularly that of <hi>Rifantes,</hi> who having nothing ſo great a maſs of fleſh as the reſt, yet had ſhewed as much force, and more addreſs.

Whereupon making haſt to be up, they repayred a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the windowes, and obſerved that the ſtrong Knight <hi>Lorgades</hi> Prince of Grizolia, the Emperours neere kinſman, who arrived but the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being accompanied with <hi>Rodamans</hi> and <hi>Arbalion, Buſtrafards</hi> brothers, were ready to charge their Launces againſt the Prince of Cabilla.</p>
                     <p>The gallant demeanour of this Knight, and the unmeaſurable corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of <hi>Rodamans,</hi> and <hi>Arbalion,</hi> that oppoſed the two Gyants, no leſs dreadfull and great, perſwading them, that the courſe would be worth their ſight, they leaned together cloſe by the Emperour, where they had not been long, but they ſaw thoſe furious Warriours ſet forth, who mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the middeſt of the courſe broke all alike, without ſo much as once moving in their ſaddles. Now by my life, ſaid the Emperour, this is one of the braveſt incounters that ever I beheld, and queſtionleſs <hi>Lorgades</hi> hath juſtly acquired the name of a very good Knight, ſince he is able to withſtand <hi>Rifantes,</hi> but let us ſee what wil enſue.</p>
                     <p>Here with the two Knights having taken freſh Launces ſpurred away, and followed by their companions that carryed Maſts of ſhips, they broke again with extream furie; <hi>Lorgades</hi> loſing his ſtirrops, was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling, had he not caught hold on the Horſes mane; <hi>Rifantes</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gallantly on, though ſomewhat aſtoniſhed; <hi>Arbalion</hi> and <hi>Rodamans</hi> were overturned upon their Horſe cruppers; <hi>Brundamor</hi> and the King of Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar did but how a little with the violence of the ſhock; the Aſſiſtants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained all amazed with ſo furious an incounter, and exceedingly deſired, that the inſolence of the ſtrangers might be abated, howbeit in vain; for theſe three valiant Champions tranſported with an exceſs of rage to find ſo much reſiſtance before Princeſſes whom they adored, diſlodged the third time, and encountred their enemies with ſuch violence, that <hi>Lorgades</hi> and his friends were laid in the duſt, which ſo filled the Victors with arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, that after two houres reſt, no Knight appearing in that time, they went and preſented themſelves before the Emperour, where on their knees again <hi>Don Rifantes</hi> ſpake to him on this manner.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I think that by this you have good experience of the force of our Armes, and the greatneſs of our courages; wherfore we deſire you wil
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17218:212"/>
be pleaſed to grant us the boon now, which yeſterday you promiſed us. I have told you, ſaid the Emperour, that you ſhal diſpoſe of all that is in my power as I my ſelf, do but ask, and I wil moſt willingly grant it you. Sir, continued <hi>Don Rifantes,</hi> you have then three ſons in Law, <hi>Palmirenna</hi> is for me, <hi>Amplamira</hi> for the brave King of Corcutan, and the Infanta <hi>Archiſidella</hi> for the King of Alfanar.</p>
                     <p>The word of a King, anſwered the Emperour (a little ſurprized) ought doubtleſs to be irrevocable, but Princes, you muſt underſtand, that in matters of ſuch high importance, I am to take the adviſe of my people, ſince all my authoritie depends on their good wil; beſides, I muſt know whether my Daughters affections, which cannot be forced without tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, may be accommodated to my commands; I wil propound this Affair to my Councel, ſpeak particularly with my Daughters about it, and draw them, if I can, to receive this honour from you, after you have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the conditions of the Jouſts which you are to maintain all day to morrow.</p>
                     <p>Wherupon embracing them (though much againſt his heart) he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into his Cabinet to reſolve ſo difficult an Affair, leaving divers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall paſſions in the minds of them that remained in the Hall: The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Empire were troubled; <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and her Siſters were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſpleaſed, <hi>Floridan</hi> was mad with ſpight, and jealouſie, but every one was amazed at the furie of the faire Slave; who with eyes ſparkling fire, addreſt her ſpeech unto <hi>Rifantes,</hi> and ſaid, Prince of Cabilla, thou thinkeſt that <hi>Palmirenna</hi> is already in thy power, but thou wilt be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for be aſſured, that in ſatisfaction of the diſtaſt thou haſt given her, I wil draw the bloud out of thy body, even to the laſt drop; and if I might combat now, as the Women of my countrey that are bred up in Armes uſe to do, I would let thee languiſh no longer, but to morrow wil come.</p>
                     <p>Saying ſo, ſhe depaated in a rage out of the Hall, leaving all there in wonder at her ſpeech; the Knight and Gyants excepted, who laughed her to ſcorn, and cauſing a Nag to be brought her, ſhe rode toward the grot, where ſhe had left her Sword, being ſoon got thither, ſhe found not the Armes which ſhe had left, but others enamelled all over with greene and red, ſo rich and curiouſly wrought, that ſhe was much amazed at them, howbeit conceiving that <hi>Caſſandra</hi> had done this miracle, ſhe would loſe no time, making them up then in a bundle with incredible content, ſhee took her Sword that was fairer then ever it had been, and remounting on her Horſe, ſhe rode to <hi>Cardana,</hi> where ſhe came in time to free <hi>Palmirenna</hi> from a great deale of feare ſhe was in for her.</p>
                     <p>From whence comes my <hi>Corazinda,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto her, kiſſing her on the forehead? from ſeeking out means to be revenged of theſe gyants inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, anſwered ſhe, wherefore Madam, look here. Saying ſo ſhe undid the bundle, and made them all marvell to ſee ſuch rich and faire armes. Then you are reſolved <hi>Corazenda,</hi> to fight, ſaid <hi>Palmirenna?</hi> But alas, how can you ſcape the furie of their ſwords, which are ſo dreadfull to the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſt Knights that are. Madam, anſwered <hi>Corazinda,</hi> I am not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fight, but to dye a thouſand times over, rather then let you fall into the power of a man ſo unworthy of your greatneſs and merit, do but get the Emperour to give me the order, and you ſhall ſee me cut out work enough for your enemies.</p>

I cannot but wonder much at your courage, but withall I do no leſſe pittie you.

Saying ſo, he laid his hand upon her head, bleſſed her after his manner; put her on a paire of golden ſpurs, and kiſſed her on the forehead, left her to take the reſt of her Armes from the hands of his Daughters, who preſently invironed her, and were going to leade her to the field in triumph, when as there was a Knight ſeen entring into the Hall, armed in azure Armes, tall of ſtature, bravely diſpoſed, of a very goodly preſence, and marvellous faire of face; who at the firſt ſight knowing <hi>Amadis</hi> and his companion, was about to embrace, and careſs them, had not the Prince of Perſia ſtayed him with a wink of his eye, which made him inſtantly conceive that he was to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; advancing then in a majeſticall manner, he ſet one knee to the ground before the Princeſſes, and addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> who went formoſt, he ſaid unto her.</p>
                     <p>Madam, if ſtrangers may ſpeak without offence, take it not ill, if being unknown to all here, I dare ask of you, to what Enterpriſe you conduct theſe two Knights, with ſuch a train of Women? We are going to expoſe them to very great hazard, anſwered <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and to confrom them with three moſt redoubted Knights, to the end they may revenge us of ſome inſolence they have offered unto us, I will accompany them then, if you pleaſe, ſaid the Knight, that ſo the party being equall, their danger may be the leſſe; but I would be glad it might be by the commandement of one of you. Apply your ſelf then to me, ſaid <hi>Archeſidella,</hi> for theſe two being my Siſters Knights, it is reaſon that now you ſhould be mine, ſeeing I have no leſſe intereſt then they in the quarrell. Madam, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, raviſhed with her beauty, which from henceforth enthralled his liberty, I expected not ſo great an honour, but you rendring me worthy of it, I will endeavour to deſerve it as long as I live; wherupon he took her hand and kiſſed it, in token of his ſervitude, and placing himſelf by her, he followed the reſt to the field, wher all the world was in an uproar for the death of the gentle Knight <hi>Lorgades,</hi> who deſiring to try his fortune again in other arms then thoſe he wore the day before; was ſlain by the King of Alfanar: but the tumult ceaſed by their arrivall, and the griefe which the Emperour conceived, for the loſſe of ſo valianta Gentleman, was ſomewhat appeaſed by the ſight of his <hi>Corazinda,</hi> who having very much careſſed <hi>Lucibel</hi> of France, (being that Knight which ſo lately arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and unto whom ſhe had alſo in few words diſcovered the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of this Affair) mounted upon a ſtrong and mighty Courſer, ſhe went
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17218:213"/>
unto the Prince of Cabilla, unto whom ſhe ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Rifantes,</hi> behold I am come hither to make good the menaces which I made unto thee yeſterday, wherfore bethinke thee of thy evil life paſt, and call upon thy gods. Saying ſo, ſhe turned about to her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who had planted themſelvs juſt oppoſite to the Gyants, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring all the world amazed at her gallant demeanour, ſhe ſtood ſtil, untill ſuch time as the Trumpets made them diſlodge all ſix with ſuch fury, that the earth ſeemed to tremble under their horſes feet.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Knights being of the beſt on the earth, their incounter was marvellous; <hi>Rifantes</hi> made two or three turns with his horſe in the duſt, the Gyants were carried to the ground, wounded both in their bodies, the Princes of France and Perſia, being unable to ſupport the violence of ſo terrible a ſhock fell a little after, with extreem diſcontent to be unhorſed before their Miſtreſſes, <hi>Corazinda</hi> alone remained in her ſaddle, to the incredible ſatisfaction of <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> and the Emperour, who being no leſſe joyfull, then aſtoniſhed, did infinitly commend the valour of this <hi>Amazon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time our Warriors equally tranſported with rage roſe up, and drawing out their ſwords, began one of the moſt outragious combats that ever had been ſeen in this Empire; the Gyants whoſe motions were exceeding dreadfull, gave moſt horrible blows, and ſuch as promiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then death; but our Princes were ſo active, and dextrous, as they avoyded the moſt part of them, and warded the reſt with ſuch force, that they left no hope of prevailing to their enemies, who feeling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs hurt every minute, made ſuch a terrible noiſe, as put al the Aſſiſtants in a mighty fright. On the other ſide, <hi>Rifantes</hi> and <hi>Corazinda</hi> (who ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning advantage, had quitted her Horſe) entreated one another far worſe, jealouſie animated their ſtroaks, and as often as their ſwords were aloft, they fell with unexpreſſable fury, the place was ſtrewed with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, fire flew continually about their heads, they ſet their knees and hands to the ground, and the rage wherewithall they aſſayled each other, was ſo great, that the moſt confident Warriors of the aſſembly, were ſome what touched with fear.</p>
                     <p>Two hours being ſpent in this ſort, the violence of <hi>Brundamors,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaganss</hi> blows, began to relent, contrary to our Knights, whoſe ſtrength increaſing with their travell rendred their ſwords more dreadfull, which ſo madded the Gyants, that <hi>Rozagant</hi> taking his Curtelas in both his hands, diſcharged it with ſuch force on <hi>Floridan,</hi> that having divided his Shield in two, and given him a great gaſh in the arm which ſuſtained it; he made him ſet his knees to the ground, where queſtionleſſe his life had been in no little danger had hee permitted the Gyant to redouble upon him; but getting up inſtantly, much aſhamed that this accident was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him before <hi>Amplamira;</hi> he ſtruck the Gyant with ſuch unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fury on the ſhoulder, that he cleft him to the very girdle, ſending him ſtark dead to the earth, to the great aſtoniſhment of <hi>Brundamor,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wounded <hi>Lucibel</hi> in the thigh and head, couragiouſly diſputed the honour of the combat, when as this Prince extreamly vexed, to ſee his arms dyed with his blood, lent him ſo terrible a blow on the arm, that he made it together with his Sword fly to the ground, and inſtantly redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a furious thruſt, he ran him quite thorow and thorow; ſo making him to breath out his laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:17218:214"/>
Theſe Gyants being diſpatched thus, to the incredible content of the two Infantaes, who rejoyced to ſee their Lovers victorious with life aud honour; every one caſt their eyes upon the furious combat, between <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razinda</hi> and <hi>Rifantes,</hi> which was moſt fearfull; for <hi>Rifantes</hi> mad at the ſlaughter of his two Coſins, laid about him ſo deſperately, that a Warrior leſs ſtrong and couragious then our <hi>Amadis</hi> had fallen under his fury, but he no leſs enraged to find ſo much reſiſtance in one man; &amp; in a quarrel where <hi>Palmirenna's</hi> happineſs, and his own were in queſtion, returned him ſuch an exchange, that his body was wounded in nine or ten places; howbeit chooſing to dye a thouſand times, rather then make the leaſt ſhew of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; he maintained his party with marvellous valour; and at length being in the ſupremeſt degree of rage he reſolved to ſet up his reſt upon one only blow; wherefore taking his ſword in both his hands, he ſtruck <hi>Amadis</hi> ſo dangerouſly on his Shield, that having parted it in twain, the point thereof light upon his ſhoulder, and hurt it, making him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ſtagger in ſuch manner, that he was fain to ſet one knee to the ground to ſave himſelf from falling; but ſuddenly ariſing with unſpeakable fury, and gnaſhing his teeth for anger, he advanced his rich ſword, and let it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with ſuch violence on <hi>Rifantes</hi> Helmet, that if it had not turned in his hand, he had cleft him down to the teeth; neuertheleſſe the blow was ſo rude, that he fell all along quite deprived of ſenſe, and caſting out ſo great abundance of blood at his eyes, mouth, and ears, as without doubt he had been quickly dead, had he not been inſtantly ſuccord. Immortall gods, ſaid the Emperour, what a blow was this! Thunderbolts fall not with mightier force: Ah <hi>Corazinda,</hi> had Heaven made thee a man, thou wouldeſt have been the prime Knight of the world.</p>
                     <p>Saying thus, he abandoned the window to careſſe the two Knights, and his <hi>Amazon,</hi> who keeling before the Princeſſes demanded their hands to kiſſe, but they beholding them ſo beſmeared with their own blood, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much of the joy, which otherwiſe they would have had for ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a victory, and not willing to entertain them longer, they ſent the Knight of the Flower <hi>De-luces,</hi> (ſo was <hi>Lucibel</hi> called) into <hi>Floridans</hi> Chamber, where <hi>Amplamira,</hi> and <hi>Acheſidella,</hi> who held herſelf happy in meeting with our Frenchman, would fain have been preſent, for to have taken care of their wounds; but knowing that ſuch liberty was unfit for them, they left the Phyſicians to viſit them, and followed <hi>Corazinda</hi> into <hi>Palmirenna's</hi> Chamber, who not able to forbear weeping at the ſight of the pretious blood, which ſhe ſaw flow from her hurts, ſhe had been loſt with grief, if the Chyrurgions had not aſſured her, that there was no cauſe of fear, comforting her ſelf then with the hope of her ſpeedy recovery: ſhe cauſed every one to voyd the room, for to leave her to her reſt, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into her Fathers Chamber, to diſcourſe with him of the valour of the ſtrange Knights; and of her fair ſlave, who had filled every one with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the wonders ſhe had performed, ſhe learn't that <hi>Don Rifantes</hi> being come again out of his ſwound, had cauſed himſelf, together with the bodies of the Kings of Alfanar, and Corcutan, to be carried aboard his Ship, for to return into Cabilla, with furious reſolutions, to be the death of an hundred thouſand men, in revenge of the affront which he had received. Let us give him leiſure then to arrive in his countrey, to muſter up his friends, and ſubjects, and our Princes time to recover of

their hurts, and entertain themſelvs with their Miſtreſſes, who failed not to meet them every day, and let us come to the excellent Knight of the Roſes, whom ſo long we have left.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE combate between <hi>Roſalmond,</hi> and <hi>Alcidamant</hi> receiving ſuch an end as was delivered in the five and thirtieth Chapter of our ſecond part. The incomparable Knight of the Roſes travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on ſo vext to have met with a man that was able to arreſt the fury of his arms, as he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken by the night before he had ſo much as thought of the place where he meant to lodge; ſeeing it growne dark then, and himſelf faſt by a Shepherds cottage, he reſolved to alight, and ſtay there till the next morning, as he did, with more reſt and content then he expected: for the Shepherd amidſt the ſervices which he did him, ever and anon told one tale or another, that inſenſibly he forgot the occaſion of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and in that humour caſting himſelf upon a bed, he ſlept till ſuch time as the ſun being of a good height, raiſed him to continue on his journey, wherin he ſpent ſix hours, and met not with one living ſoul that might informe him of the name of ſo deſart a Countrey.</p>
                     <p>At laſt having diſcovered a Caſtle, ſtately and fair enough to invite him to obſerve it neerer, he made to it with a reſolution to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there, if the Maſter of it were ſo courteous as to give him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherfore knocking at the gate, it was a good while ere any one would ſpeak to him; but continuing ſtill knocking, he perceived a yong Mayd, who looking out of the window, asked him what he would have? Gentlewoman ſayd he, I am a Knight errant; that not knowing where I am, would willingly learn it of you, let me therfore obtain of you that the gate may be opened. You may not hope for that, anſwered ſhe, for we admit no body here. Truly I ſhall have great cauſe then ſaid he, to publiſh the diſcurteſie of the place, however let me know the name of it. Herewith a very fair Gentlewoman in mourning ſhewed her ſelf at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hard by, and ſaid unto him: Sir what is that you would have? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he, I would fain have been let in, to refreſh my ſelf a while, but being denied it, I know not how to deſire it of you again. Sir, ſaid ſhe, very modeſtly, be not offended at it, for it is not done but upon great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; howbeit you ſhall enter, your demeanour doth forbid me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any harm from you. Saying ſo, ſhe cauſed the gate (which inſtantly was ſhut again) to be opened, and deſcending into the Court for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17218:215"/>
him with more honour, ſhe ſhewed him ſo good a countenance, that he could not forbear ſaying to her. Madam, to ſpeak truth I find ſo much difference between this gracious entertainment, and your Mayds anſwer, that it much amazes me. Sir, anſwered ſhe with tears and ſighs, I have not lived hitherto without knowing what is due to the honour and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of good Knights, nor hath this houſe ever been ſhut againſt them; but the ſtrange misfortune which hath befaln me of late, hath conſtrained me to ſeem leſſe courteous then I am; Ile tell you the reaſon in few words.</p>
                     <p>This miſerable beautie whereof you yet behold ſome reliques, maugre the injuries of time, and the diſcontents I have undergone, having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me the Sun of this Dutchie of <hi>Bonnemar,</hi> wherein we are adjacent to the great Kingdome of the Iſland of Silvana; I ſaw all the great Lords of the Countrey ſigh at my feet, and amongſt the reſt, two couſins of the Prince therof, the moſt diſloyoll man that lives: Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I had of the many vices wherwithall they were infected, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> permitting me to give them a good look; I made choice of the Marqueſſe of Valombre, ſo is this place called; and finding him courteous, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and handſome, I married him publickly, which begot ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight in the minds of thoſe two couſins, that from thenceforth they conſpired his death, and my undoing: and indeed three years after our marriage they ſurprized him in a wood, and taking him without other Arms, then his ſword, they moſt inhumanely butchered him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall not contented (alas my hair ſtands an end to think of it) they went to <hi>Marcandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Bonnemar,</hi> a man apt to commit any kind of villany, and perſwaded him to take his pleaſure of me, in ſuch ſort as he arrived here with the two murtherers; where to make ſhort, they ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the complaints of ſeeing my ſelf raviſhed by them, with the tears which I ſhed for the loſſe of my Husband, whom I had buried that day. This wretched fact being perpetrated, they made themſelves maſters of the houſe, and keeping me three dayes together with a dagger at my throat, if I offered to reſiſt, they glutted their beaſtly appetites, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me in the ſorrows befitting ſo mighty an affliction, they went away without any fear of their reſentment unto whom I appertain, that farre from ſeeking any revenge, durſt not ſo much as receive mee into their houſes, dreading the fury of this brutiſh and tyrannicall Duke, who hath ſet ſuch ſure Guards on all the paſſages, as I ſhould try in vain to eſcape away unto the Queen of Sylvana, to avoid his further cruelty; or to ſeek out ſome powerfull perſon, that might do me juſtice for ſo odious an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence; judge now, Sir, whether I had not cauſe to lock my ſelf up as I did.</p>
                     <p>You had indeed, Madam, anſwered <hi>Roſalmond,</hi> but I wonder that the people will indure the tyrannie of this barbarous Prince; well, I will ſee him; and I promiſe you by the order which I have received of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, never to part from this countrey, till I have fully revenged you. Oh Sir, ſaid ſhe then, take heed how you venture upon an enterpriſe, where the danger is too apparant; for he himſelf is very valiant, his Couſins that always accompany him, are ſtrong and couragious; and he never ſtirs abroad, but with a great train of ſouldiers. All that is nothing, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond;</hi> God fights ſtill againſt the wicked, his death is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17218:215"/>
and if you will permit one to conduct me even now to the place of his aboad, you ſhall ſoon ſee his head at your feet, in ſatisfaction of this crime. I may not ſuffer you to part from hence to day, ſaid ſhe; to morrow doe what you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Saying ſo, ſhe led him into a Chamber, to unarm himſelf, and from thence into a fair Garden, where having diſcourſed of the miſeries that follow the licentiouſneſſe of a vicious Prince, they went to a table furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with very good meat, wherwithall havit, well ſatisfied their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, they heard a great knocking at the Gate. Ay me, ſaid ſhe with a pale and frighted countenance, the Murtherers of mine honour are come. Yes Madam, ſaid a fellow, that in a mighty fear came running in, it is the Duke of Bonnemar, and his companions. O Sir, ſaid ſhe, turning her to our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, have ſome pitty on me. Madam, anſwered he with a mervellous confidence, be not diſmayed, but think that Heaven hath ſent them hither, to receive the puniſhment their wickedneſſe hath deſerved, only give me time to arm my ſelf, and then let the Gates be opened a Gods name; yet ſo as preſently upon their entrance they may be ſhut again, that they may not eſcape me.</p>
                     <p>Wherupon going inſtantly to his Chamber, whilſt <hi>Artander</hi> ran to the Stable, he put on his arms, and finding his Horſe ready he vaulted into the ſaddle, commanding the Gates to be opened, where they were ſtill knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king very hard; which being done, the three couſins entred in great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when as <hi>Rozalmond</hi> having his ſword aloft, diſcharged it ſo furiouſly on <hi>Marcandon,</hi> (who had been ſo well deſcribed unto him, as he knew him from the reſt) that having cut off one of his arms, he ſent him to the earth under his Horſes belly, to the extream diſcontent of his couſins, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him two blows at once, the one upon his Shield, and the other upon his ſhoulder, made him bow even to the Horſes crupper; whence riſing in a rage, he ſtruck him that was next him with ſuch force, that he divided him in two, wherwith the other was ſo terrified, as he turned about to have fled away, but finding the Gates ſhut he fell to beg for grace. Villain, ſaid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond,</hi> dareſt thou ſpeak for mercy in a houſe that hath no Maſter by thy treaſon, and before a woman, whom thou haſt wickedly raviſhed? I ſhould be guilty of the miſchiefs thou wouldeſt doe hereafter, if I ſhould ſpare thee now, wherfore take this; and ſo advancing that dreadfull blade, which never found reſiſtance, he cleft him down to the ſhoulders, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet more unwilling to pardon <hi>Marcandon,</hi> whom he ſaw getting up, he went and tyed him to an Horſes tayl himſelf, and cauſing <hi>Artander</hi> to mount upon him, he made him to be dragged up and down the Court ſo long, till his brains flying out, his ſoul was ſent to Hell.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this ſo horrible a revenge, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> commanded the Dukes Squire to be locked up till the next day, and returning into the Hal the Lady Marqueſſe with tears of joy fell down and embraced his knees, unable to ſpeak a word; whereat being aſhamed he raiſed her up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her not to uſe ſuch ſubmiſſions unto him. I have done nothing, ſaid he, but what I was obliged unto by the order of Knighthood, which was given me upon condition to employ my arms for the ſervice of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and particularly for Ladies, wherfore you are no way bound unto me; ſo unarming himſelf he talked with her about advertiſing her friends of what had paſt, and then got him to bed with a reſolution to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17218:216"/>
depart the next morning very early, as he did to the exceeding grief of the Lady Marqueſſe, who would fain have ſtayed him longer.</p>
                     <p>Taking the next way then that he met withall, and entertaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the remembrance of the valiant Knight of the Palmes, whom he ſo mortally hated, and of his <hi>Armazia,</hi> whoſe abſence was very grievous unto him, he arrived about evening at a Town, wher finding it fit to lodge that night, hee was entertained by a rich fellow, that having no other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but one daughter, a very handſome Mayd, endeavored to make him the beſt chear he could, but without doubt it had been the laſt lodging that ever he would have had, if Love that reſerved him for the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Lady, had not rendred his Hoſts Daughter paſſionatly in love with him.</p>
                     <p>This Town being under the obedience of <hi>Marcandon,</hi> the inhabitants were immediatly advertiſed of his death, and underſtanding that the Knight, which was lately come thither, was the man that had ſlain him; they aſſembled together in an inſtant, and arming themſelves with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, Pitchforks, Swords, and Iavelings, they reſolved to kill <hi>Rozalmond;</hi> but conſidering with themſelves that they ſhould not be able to reſiſt him, if once he ſet hand to his ſword, they concluded to ſurpriſe him in bed, and unarmed; wherupon they ſent one to the Maſters of the houſe where he lay to advertiſe him of their enterpriſe, that he might contribute therunto on his part, and in the mean time fearing ſome reſiſtance, they diſpatched one in poſt to a Garriſon, thereby to acquaint them alſo with it.</p>
                     <p>The man, that queſtionleſſe was ſorry for his Princes death, though his vices rendred him odious to all good folks; and that on the other ſide was very unwilling to betray his Gueſt, which had truſted him, was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with this meſſage; nevertheleſſe fearing leſt the people would kill him, if he ſhould not ſhew himſelf zealous to revenge their Lord, he received one of them into his houſe, and becauſe <hi>Rozalmond</hi> was in his Chamber, ready to go to bed, he thought it the beſt courſe his Daughter ſhould go up, and under colour of ſeeing whether he wanted any thing, that ſhe ſhould ſteale away his Sword; but ſhe, that to dye would not ſee him harmed, being come into his Chamber, ſhe told him in few words, how much ſhe loved him, and the danger he was in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rozalmond</hi> exceedingly ſurprized with her relation, anſwered her briefly thus; Sweet heart, your love doth infinitely oblige me, and it ſhall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be recompenced as it ought, in the mean time wear this for my ſake; ſaying ſo, he drew a rich Diamond from off his finger, and preſented it unto her, and forth with arming himſelf, he ſent her down furniſhed with an excuſe. Alack, ſaid ſhe, ſeeming to be vext; you will not do what you deſire without difficultie; the Knight is indeed on his bed, but he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quit his Armes, nor his Sword, which he holds in his hand, ſo that I have loſt my labour. What ſhall we do then, ſaid the Maſter of the houſe, to him that accompanied him? why burn him in his chamber, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, if we cannot ſurprize him.

Good Knights, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> wil never be inforced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing, much leſs be diſarmed by their enemies without fighting, wherfore I am not reſolved to give you any thing that appertaines unto me, till you have dearly bought it.

                     <p>Theſe horrible blowes making them think, that at length their Knights would have the worſt, they preſently ſet forwards, and advancing their heavy Scimitars, they diſcharged them ſo dangerouſly on him, that they forced him to knock his chin againſt the pommell of his ſaddle, which ſo incenſed him, that rayſing himſelf up in rage, he took his Sword in both his hands, and therewith ſtruck one of the Gyants with ſuch violence on his ſhield, as he divided it in two, ſending his arme withall to the ground, and redoubling on the ſecoed, who with reaſon feared the tempeſt of that Sword, hit him ſo rudely on the helmet, that he made him reele three or foure paces back; whereupon perceiving the Knights had run his Horſe into the belly with an Halbard, he quit his ſaddle inſtantly, and flying in amongſt them, covered the ground with three or foure of them, before the Gyants were come to themſelves again, both of them returning then with incredible furie, they began to charge him with ſuch terrible blows, as he was many times conſtrained to bow with his knees, nevertheleſs he fought ſo couragiouſly, and ſo often drew bloud from them, that they had little cauſe to brag of any advantage; but being reſolved either to vanquiſh or dye, one of them took his Scimitar in both hands, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing all his force, ſtrook ſo mainly at his head, that if he had not wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoyded the blow, it had queſtionleſs been his death, howbeit leaping very lightly aſide, he let it fall upon the ground, whereinto it entred up to the hilts, and taking hold of opportunitie, whilſt the Gyant was drawing

                     <p>Our Warriour ſeeing himſelf freed from theſe Coloſſes which had exceedingly troubled him, was going to ſet upon the reſt, when as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Lady comming in, marvellous beautifull, and followed by two and twentie Knights richly armed, with a Gyant far greater than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who addreſſing her ſpeech unto him, ſaid; Knight, perſiſt no further in this Combat, but put yourſelf into my hands, if you love your life. I know very well, that your valour makes you confident; for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I behold here may perſwade you, that you can couragiouſly paſſe through any danger whatſoever, but I am able to oppreſſe you ſo with multitudes, that you muſt needs fall at laſt; beſides, the Guards of this place were not eſtabliſhed here for you, but to ſurprize a Knight, who though he be not ſo tall, yet is no way inferiour to you in valour and ſtrength; ſheath up you Sword then, and follow me with this aſſurance, that you ſhall receive no diſpleaſure here.</p>
                     <p>Madam, anſwered he, much amazed to behold ſo rare a beautie; I wil gladly ſubmit my ſelf to your power, for ſo ſweet a captivitie can not be but moſt pleaſing to me; and would I had ſpent more bloud then this which is in my Armour, that I had met you at the gate of your houſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould I then have been in the ſtate I am in, nor you have had cauſe to complain for the loſs of your people, for yeelding all obedience to the merit of fair Ladyes, and principally of thoſe of your qualitie, I ſhould freely have granted whatſoever you had demanded; but their inſolence having conſtrained me to draw my Sword, I ſecured my ſelf by their deaths, wherwithall I am now infinitely diſpleaſed, becauſe it may be an offence unto you, which I ſhall labour to repayr by all the beſt ſervices my uttermoſt abilitie may be able to do you.</p>
                     <p>I perceive, ſaid ſhe, laughing, that I ſhall have as much adoe to overcome you with courteſie, as my Knights have had with their Armes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will debate no longer with you, but let us walke to a Chamber, that your wounds may be viſited.

Wherupon cauſing his Squire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme him, he diſcovered a ſmall hurt on his ſhoulder, and another ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what greater, but one more dangerous in his thigh, which the Chirurgions having dreſt, he got him to bed, where he continued till the next morning; when as he aroſe, feeling little or no pain, for to preſent his ſervice to the fair Princeſs, who being wonderfully wel ſatisfied with his goodly perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and behaviour, entertained him awhile with ordinarie diſcourſe; and finding him no leſſe witty, then he had ſhewed himſelf before valiant, ſhe led him into the Garden, where ſhe freely diſcovered to him the ſecreteſt of her thoughts, telling him that ſhe was Queen of the Iſland of <hi>Silvana,</hi> and that the Guards of this place were ſet to apprehend a Knight that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed three Palmes in his ſhield.</p>

of ſo many Knights, and ſtrong Gyants, ſince it was to arreſt a man, whoſe like is hardly to be met withall in the world: why, replyed the beautifull <hi>Silvana,</hi> Do you know the Knight of whom I ſpeak: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> I neither know his name, nor original, but all the earth is acquainted with his valour; and would to God he were here now, that we might finiſh a Combat, which hath twice already reduced us to the extreameſt peril of our lives, without diſcerning to whom the honour of it was juſtly due: wherupon relating all that had paſt at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, and afterwards upon the confines of Florertan; he gave her marvellous contentment, to hear the prayſes of this Knight ſo publiſhed by his greateſt enemy. Verely, anſwered ſhe, you have a great deal of reaſon to ſpeak wel of this Knight, who hath done miracles in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Combatting, and killing a Monſter, the hugeſt and moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ever nature produced, but far more in my ſiſter <hi>Merodiana's</hi> ſtate, where the moſt redoubted Gyants of the world, have paſt under the edge of his Sword in the head of a mightie Army, which the ſame day was cut in pieces by the ſole vertue of this Knight, and not by the multitude, or force of our ſouldiers, the Enemie being at the leaſt three for one.</p>
                     <p>But, Madam, (ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> who was ſomewhat vexed, to hear ſo much glory given to his Adverſarie:) if this Knight hath done ſo much for you, why wil you expoſe his life to the hazard of the furie, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your men, which ſure were but an ill acknowledgement of his ſervices. O that is a ſecret, ſaid ſhe, which may not be imparted, I wil have have him if I can, not to put him to death, for I would ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to mine own ruine, but to oblige him to keep his faith. Your eyes, Madam, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond</hi> (who then gheſt at her diſeaſe) wil more prevail with him then your Armes, and he wil ſooner be conſtrained by your beautie, then by your Gyants; in which regard you are to procure rather by gentleneſs then force. That courſe have I held already, ſaid <hi>Silva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Your good wil doth much oblige me, anſwered ſhe; but if you deſire to do me a pleaſure, forbear the execution of your intent, for the Combat between you, could not be determined without an irreparable loſs; wherefore if you have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of my ſuffering, rather counſel him to remember his vowes, the favour which he hath received from me, and making him ſorry for abuſing them, repreſent unto him, that my Crown, one of the richeſt, and braveſt of the earth, may arreſt the ambition of any Gentleman, how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he be.</p>

                     <p>Leaving <hi>Silvana</hi> then in much griefe for his departure, he went unto her ſiſter, who inſenſibly forgetting <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> was ſo taken with the beauty and comelineſs of this Prince, that ſhe took no greater care, then to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her ſelfe more amiable with the grace of clothes, and dreſſings (though nature had made her excellent that way) for to win him to love her; but he that had a conſtant ſoul, and that was wholly given up to his <hi>Armazia,</hi> was nothing moved with her paſſion; howbeit fearing leſt his faith at length might waver by the continuall purſuits of this beautifull Queen, who queſtionleſs had charms of power to captivate the heart of the coldeſt affection, he reſolved to depart; wherefore one day taking his leave, which he had very much adoe to obtain, he got him to Sea, leaving ſo good an opinion of his valour in the Kingdoms of theſe two ſiſters, as he was of no leſs eſteem there, then the famous Knight of the Palmes.</p>

                     <p>All this cannot move me, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for you know not the reſpect a Lover ought to carry to the commandements of his Lady or elſe you would not condemne me for that I doe, which is nothing but what her pleaſure and my obedience require. It is true that in all likelihood I ſhould be better in the world, where I might be uſefull for the aſſiſtance of ſome afflicted perſons; but ſhall I doe ſo when it is not pleaſing to her, whom I will prefer before all that is under heaven. No verely, I muſt abſolutely comform my ſelf to her will, ſhe deſires my death, and I will not avoyd the occaſions of it: As for that you alleage, how it may be ſhe repents the miſeries ſhe hath made me to ſuffer, I can never beleeve it, for then ſhe would have let me underſtood ſo much.</p>
                     <p>Doth ſhe know ſaid <hi>Rozalmond</hi> interrupting him there, that your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair hath reduced you to this deſart? without doubt ſhe doth not know it, anſwered he, but my good genius would lead them hither that ſhould come to ſeek me, if ſhe had any mind to ſee me again. Look now ſayd <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> how extravagantly you ſpeak, and how your judgment is loſt in the confuſion of your thoughts, or with the affliction that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you, what likelihood is there that one may find you out in this place, whither fortune alone can addreſſe thoſe that ſtray out of their way?</p>
                     <p>Be not, I pray you, ſo wilfully bent to end your days wretchedly here, rather live for the ſervice of your Princeſſe, and labour to make your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence appear unto her, in ſtead of beſtowing your time unprofitably in ſighing out your ſorrows amidſt theſe trees; your vertue which to day hath begot a deſire in me to doe you ſervice, contrary to the reſolution which formerly I had taken for to purchaſe your ruin, makes me to uſe theſe words, therfore be pleaſed that I may be your Phyſician ſince you are ſo ſick, and accept of the good counſell I give you for your better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>Why now, we are come juſt to the point I deſired, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for ſetting aſide the reaſons, I could oppoſe yours with, touching my purpoſe to dye here, clear me in that particular, where you ſay you never loved me till to day. I beleeve indeed, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> that you doe not know me yet, becauſe I want my Shield; but if you call to mind the combat we had together at Conſtantinople, and afterwards upon the frontiers of Florertan, when we were parted by <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> you will quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the ſpeeches I have uſed to you; then you were the object of all the anger that a man could have againſt another which diſputed the glory of Arms with him, but finding you in ſo miſerable an eſtate, I was ſo ſenſible of your misfortunes, as I could not be more for any that ſhould arrive unto my ſelf, ſo that now I love you far more then I hated you before, and doe alſo humbly beſeech you to change your

I will no longer complain of my misfortune, and the content of this incounter is ſo dear unto me, that I wil paſs by all remembrance of the cauſe of my ſorrow for to careſs you, if not aſmuch as I would, yet as much as I can.

                     <p>You behold indeed, anſwered he, the pleaſing features of her face, you may here likwiſe judge of the delicacie of her complexion; but not of the grace ſhe gives to her motions, nor of the powerfull charms of her eyes, for there nature far ſurpaſſeth the art of the Painter. Whereupon without further intreatie he diſcourſed unto him his whol life, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all that had paſt at Tarſipolis, after he met with <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> which was very acceptable to the Knight of the Roſes, who alledged all the reaſons he could any way deviſe to diſwade him from ſo ſad a retyrement; but perceiving that he ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You are too wilfully ſet, ſaid he, upon your own miſery; nevertheleſs, being perſwaded that you do all things with judgement, I intend, becauſe I wil enjoy your company, which I hold ſo dear, to paſs my dayes here with you, and never to return again into the world, after I have diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one voyage for an enterprize, wherunto my faith hath ingaged me; I may not limit my return, in regard we cannot diſpoſe of time, nor of accidents that befall us, but I ſwear unto you by the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to come hither again, aſſoon as poſſibly I can, ſo as you likewiſe promiſe me, not to depart from hence upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Dear Sir, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> it were moſt unreaſonable to confine you ſo without cauſe, continue ſtil in the world, wherof you are now the wonder, for it would be far more content unto me, to know you in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights abſented from me, then to have you here leade a languiſhing life; as for me, I am accuſtomed therunto, and be aſſured I wil never abandon it for any cauſe whatſoever, ſince I doe it not at your requeſt.

                     <p>This <hi>Megera,</hi> going upon a time to invoke her ſpirits in a wood, incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with <hi>Cardoran,</hi> Earle of Garaman (a countrey adjoyning to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kingdom of Corolandaya) and finding that in him which might ſtrike one in love, ſhe left the buſines wherabout ſhe went, and arreſting him, entertained him firſt with ordinary diſcourſe; but a little after told him moſt impudently, that ſhe was no longer her own, that his beauty had raviſhed her; and briefly that a violent paſſion inforced her to offer her ſelf unto him. <hi>Cardoran,</hi> who carried a noble mind, hearing this ſpeech, and ſeeing that the eyes of this Sorcereſſe had no other charms, but ſuch as were fit to captivate a Devill, had much adoe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing, but deſiring to appear as courteous, as ſhe had ſhewed her ſelf ſhameleſſe, he told her that he was very ſorry for the harm ſhe had received againſt his will, and modeſtly excuſing himſelf upon the fidelity which he owed to his deareſt wife <hi>Lindorenna,</hi> he walked fair and ſoftly away; whereupon this woman, enraged to ſee her ſelf ſo deſpiſed, took hold of his arm, and ſaid unto him. <hi>Cardoran,</hi> remember that no man ſcornes ſuch as I, but that repentance accompanies his offence, you have kindled a fire in my heart, and will not quench it, burn eternally in the like flames, or at leaſtwiſe</p>
                     <q>Vntill ſuch time as you have found out the excellent Dove, and the royall Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulcon under a diſguiſed Plume.</q>
                     <p>Herewith taking her Girdle ſhe knit it about his arm, and tying him to atree that was cloſe by, ſhe preſently raiſed a fire full of brimſtone under him, wherewithall his Horſe was ſo frighted, that he flew away from his Maſter, leaving him ſuſpended by the arm, and making ſuch grievous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as all the Woods about reſounded therwith.</p>
                     <p>This me thinks was ſo cruella revenge, as might well have ſatisfied the anger of any furious woman, but ſhe that would not have <hi>Lindorenna</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from torment, becauſe <hi>Cardoran</hi> had neglected her for her ſake, cauſed her to be advertiſed by one made for that purpoſe, of that which this wretched Gentleman ſuffered; wherupon ſhe inſtantly diſlodged with me, hoping to ſuccour him by ſome means or other; But alas, as ſoon as ſhe was come to the tree, ſhe ſuddenly with her husband, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of this their miſery, I was ſo ſenſible, that I began to tear my hair in an outragious manner, when as the wicked woman comming to me, ſtruck me with a wand that ſhe had in her hand, and ſo impoſing a ſilence to my complaints, adviſed me, if I deſired the good of theſe infortunate Lovers, to carry them up and down till I could meet with ſuch as could deliver them from ſo horrible a torment, the which I have now done five yeeres together, but to no purpoſe, for of all that preſented themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they always wanted either courage or fidelity, the two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the undoing of this inchantment.</p>
                     <p>Opening the Litter then, and ſhewing them <hi>Cardoran,</hi> and <hi>Lindorenna</hi> amidſt the flames, which made a very dreadfull noyſe, and that burned them, without conſuming any part of their bodies, ſhe thus purſued her diſcourſe. Their deliverance conſiſts in two points, in the perfection of a pure and unſpotted love between two perſons, and in the confidence to goe and kiſſe them amidſt theſe flames; now ſee gentle Shepherds whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Love which is talked of, as of a miraculous thing, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the compaſſion of the pains wherein you behold them, can induce you to free them.</p>
                     <p>I am well aſſured, replyed <hi>Clariſel,</hi> gently turning himſelf towards his <hi>Miralinda,</hi> that my love being without all defect, and as great as poſſibly may be, I cannot be wanting to the ſuccour of theſe afflicted couple, but now it is that you muſt open your heart, and here ſatisfie the truth of thoſe proteſtations, which a thouſand times you have made unto me. Why Shepherd (anſwered ſhe ſmiling) do you yet doubt of my faith? Verely, I have juſt cauſe to complain of you; but not to give you the glory of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better then my ſelf, I will deferre the diſputing of this matter, untill I have demonſtrated by the contempt of this cruell fire, that I feele one in my ſoule far more violent and great: Saying ſo, without any fear at all of the flames, ſhe couragiouſly layd her lips on <hi>Cardorans,</hi> and therwithal taking him by the hand rayſed him up ſo eaſily, that ſhe ſtruck all the aſſiſtants with wonder, who beholding <hi>Lindorenna</hi> in the ſame eſtate by <hi>Clariſels</hi> confidence, filled the ayr with a million of acclamations in the prayſe of theſe two Lovers, at whoſe feet <hi>Cardoran</hi> and <hi>Lindorenna</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently threw themſelves, being every way in as good a diſpoſition as they were before their misfortune, deſiring them to give them their hands to kiſſe in acknowledgement of ſo remarkable a benefit.</p>
                     <p>Our condition, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> doth not permit us to receive this duty from you; wherfore be pleaſed to ariſe, and command us any other thing, if you think us yet uſefull for your ſervice. Gentle Shepherd, ſaid <hi>Cardoran,</hi> the honour which I have done you, I rendred to your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue rather then the habit you weare, on which I doe not much ſtand, but ſince you are ſo courteous, as to oblige us twiſe, I moſt humbly beſeech you to grant me one boon, and this beautifull Shepherdeſſe another to my wife; for thereupon depends the conſummation of our bliſſe.</p>
                     <p>Demand what you will, ſaid <hi>Clariſel,</hi> for I am ſo much yours, as not to deny you any thing you ſhall deſire of me, and be aſſured this fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe will be no more difficill in whatſoever this Lady ſhall be pleaſed to command her. No verely (ſaid <hi>Miralinda,</hi> who was no leſſe ſatisfied with the proof ſhe had made of her own love, then with the knowledge ſhe had of her <hi>Clariſels</hi> fidelity) I have had as much courage, and I will be

                     <p>The Enemie approaching the Walls, began a moſt cruell and furious aſſault, the great Soldan of Aralafia, <hi>Rifantes,</hi> and the proud <hi>Araſtron,</hi> mounted firſt, followed by fiftie thouſand men, but they were ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed by the foure Gyants, by the Kings, the gentle Knight <hi>Tarſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and the forces that were under their command, which remained in the Town, as the ditches were full of dead bodyes, whereat notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were ſo little abaſhed, that it ſeemed rather to augment their courages, in ſuch ſort, that their followers carryed by their example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves ſo manfully, as the Citie was in danger to have been forced, had not the Faire Slave appeared in the head of ten thouſand Horſe, who entring furiouſly amidſt the enemies troups ran a Gyant quite thorow and thorow, overthrew ſix Knights, before ſhe brake her Launce, and thundring amongſt the reſt with her Sword, ſhe ſo cleared their rankes, that ſhe eaſily made way to the Walls, where incountring <hi>Don Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes</hi> with thirtie thouſand Horſe, which he had ſuddenly aſſembled, ſhee gave him ſo mightie a blow on his Helmet, that ſhe layd him on the crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                     <p>This blow having terrified the enemies, they were ready to have beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves to flight, had not the proud Pagan arrived thereupon, followed by a great multitude of Souldiers, who with a dreadfull cry falling upon our Warriours troups, began to make a terrible ſlaughter, in the nick whereof <hi>Lucibel</hi> comming in, charged them a flanke ſo furiouſly, that he cut off four thouſand of them. <hi>Brizardan</hi> ſeeing the confuſion they were in, forſook the Wall, and went to the ſuccour of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but <hi>Floridan</hi> having ſurprized his men in diſorder, put a number of them to the ſword, nevertheleſs the Soldan, being an excellent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, quickly reduced the moſt part of them into order, and then addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe to run againſt <hi>Floridan,</hi> who obſerved his comming, incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him ſo furiouſly in the carriere, that they were both overthrown in the duſt, where our Knight had been in danger of ending his dayes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the horſes feet, if the valour wherewith the Gyant, that accompanied him, arreſting his enemies, had not given him leiſure to remount on his horſe, which <hi>Brizardan</hi> could not ſo ſoon doe becauſe of the Gyant, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, being at length relieved by the aſſiſtance of thoſe about him, he drew out his ſword, and began to make ſo cruel a maſſacre, that all the world flew from before him.</p>

King of Filzandria, make uſe of their good deſire, to rendery on their Father-in-law, and doe not endure the ruine of ſo godly an Empire as yours is, their ſuit is advantageous to you, and the poſſeſſion of your Daughters will give them more ſatisfaction then your eſtate, think that they will be ſo many Pillars, wherupon your greatneſs may firmly reſt, and conſider that it is better to careſs them as your children, then to ſee them the enemies of your Crown; This is the buſineſs of our Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, wherunto be pleas'd to returne us a ſpeedy anſwer, to the end that either we may conclude an abſolute peace with you, or reſolve for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the War.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, anſwered the Emperour very gravely, I am not ignorant of the vertues, and qualitie of theſe three Princes which have ſent you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but having hitherto defended my ſelfe from their violence by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of my friends, it is reaſon that I take their counſell in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an affair, wherfore repoſe you here a little I pray you, whilſt I adviſe with them therupon.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I wonderat you, that in the middeſt of all your Subjects you are afraid; what will the world ſay when they ſhal hear, that after ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable outrages, you could ſo ſoon, and eaſily be perſwaded to forget them? Do you fear that your Daughters being ſo accompliſhed, and beautifull, ſhall never meet with Princes ſo great and valourous, as theſe which now preſent them ſelves? Sir, I know ſome, that yeeld not to them either for merit, or birth, and from whom you may have more aſſiſtance, and content, then you hope for from theſe. They threaten you with a continuance of the War, are not your Walls all entire, and doe not they know to their coſt, that it had been determined otherwiſe, had not Fortune ſhewed her ſelf what ſhe is? ſhe hath done her worſt, and therfore is not to be further feared, nor ſhall this arm, wherin hitherto you have found ſafetie, ever be wanting to your ſuccour, provided your reſolution be more generous; at leaſtwiſe underſtand from your Daughters, whether they like of theſe matches, and doe not more then the gods, which leave us a power over our own wills.</p>

Thoſe matchleſs Princeſſes did like wiſe ſimpathize with them in the like paſſions, exceedingly joying at their happy eſcape from ſo deſperate an enterprize, but ſorrowing no leſs at the number of their Lovers hurts, which for want of a skilfull Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion in the Ship might prove dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit <hi>Amadis</hi> bethought himſelf of a box of pretious Balm, that he found in the Grot, where the Dwarf dreſt his wounds after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the Monſter of the Mountain of Bears, which inſtantly he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſought out and delivered it to his fair Miſtris, who refuſed to entruſt any other then her ſelf with his cure, and attendance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being layd down with the other Princes, his aſſociats, <hi>Palmirenna</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wounds with that ſo precious oyntment; which having done, not without ſome tears and kiſſes, ſhe preſented the Box unto her Siſters, who performed the like office unto their Lovers, and ſo having ſhut the windows, withdrew themſelves, and left them aſleep.</p>
                     <p>Mean while the Sea growing high and boyſtrous, overmaſtered the Pilots, and in deſpight of their art, and induſtrie, drave them back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place from whence they were departed: they not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their deſtinie, were in the end inforced to ſtrike ſayle, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the preſent neceſſitie; Driving along then with the current, they came to the Iſle Du-bois, two ſmall leagues from Cardana, the Marriners not knowing what Countrey it was awakened the three Princes, who found theſelves whole and ſound, to the no leſs joy and contentment, then wonder and aſtoniſhment of the Ladyes: now, becauſe the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rough, and the Harbour exceeding open, there was no ſafetie in the Ship, they perſwaded the Lovers to goe aſhore, to which they willingly aſſented, in regard they thought themſelves out of the reach of Fortune, and far enough from Martaria.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, as they walked on, they eſpied a ſtately Houſe, where they reſolved to reſt themſelves untill the weather grew more calme; Comming therefore to the Maſter of it (a rich Merchant) he gave them very courteous entertainment, but ſoon after taking notice of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

and being thoroughly acquainted with that dayes paſſage, which already was grown publike, allured with hope of reward, as alſo therby to ſhun the Emperours diſpleaſure, he reſolved with himſelf to diſcover their arrivall unto him: Diſſembling then his intent, and masking his countehance with chearfulneſs, the better to avoyd, all thought of ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſtayd till ſupper was ended, and the ſaid lovers were retyred to their Chambers, at which time he ſpeedily went to Cardana, where being brought to the Emperours preſence, he fell at his feet, and ſpake in this manner;</p>
                     <p>Sir, the affection I owe to your ſervice, as your moſt faithfull ſubject; hath brought me hither for diſcoverie of a ſecret of no ſmall importance: The Sea hath inforced your Daughters, with them that ſtole them away, to land in the Iſle Dubois; They are in my houſe, and you may eaſily have them in your power without running the hazard of trying anew the fury of their Arms, for I left them in bed more diſpoſed to ſleep; then to fight, where I am confident they may be ſurprized without danger.</p>
                     <p>Immortall gods I ſaid the Emperour, how welcome are theſe news to me, and how much doe I owe unto their providence, that reſtores my honour to its firſt glory, by affording me the means to right my ſelf for the outrage done unto me; Ah traytors, racks and torments, ſhall not be wanting to your inſolence, and I ſhall take ſo horrible a revenge, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages ſhall ever ſpeak of it; And you, impudent and diſobedient Daughters, who have preferred the inticements of ſtrangers, before the grave admonitions of a Father, be confident that your puniſhment ſhall be proportionable to your offence; You ſhall find how powerfull the reſentments are of a Father, and a Prince thus provoked. Friend, ſaid he, ſpeaking to the Merchant, thy ſidelitie deſerves no little recompence, wherof thou ſhalt be moſt aſſured, but to ſecure this buſineſs, fetch me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Captain of my Guard. Then walking in his Chamber after a ſtrange manner, and with geſtures, both of head and hands expreſſing much paſſion, he expected the Captains arrivall, under whoſe command having reduced all ſuch Courtiers, as he could gather on a ſudden, he departed ſuddenly with nine hundred Horſe, and about two in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning arriving at the Iſle Dubois, he inveſted the Merchants houſe on all ſides without the leaſt noyſe.

Madam, ſaid ſhe, they are ſuch, that ſhould I undertake to give you a particular relation thereof, you would hardly be induced to beleeve them: I bring you the names of two hundred brave Knights manfully overcome by <hi>Silvion,</hi> and of threeſcore and twelve Princeſſes beſides, over whoſe beauty yours hath moſt juſtly tryumphed; but which ſurpaſſeth all, I have brought with me the faireſt, ſtouteſt, the moſt courteous, and moſt lovely Knight in the world. The Prince of Argilles, though he were rank't with the beſt, by reaſon of that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proweſſe, which renowned him every where, yet compared with the valour of the Champion, whereof I ſpeak, was but as a common man, whoſe actions being no leſſe full of ſweetneſſe, then of courage, makes him ſo amiable, that he ſteals the hearts of all that behold him.</p>
                     <p>The praiſes thou giveſt this Knight are ſo great, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> that I ſuſpect thee to be in love with him. Alack, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arlandria,</hi> ſuch flowers are too precious for my wearing; neither doe his affections ſtoop ſo low, for as he is the moſt accompliſhed Knight that is, or ever was, ſo hath he made choiſe of the moſt abſolute and peerleſs Miſtris in the world. Doſt thou know her, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> that felt ſome unaccuſtomed motions? Yes, Madam, anſwered ſhe, you are the Sun which he adores; and your beauty is it alone that ever yet could captivate his ſoul. How can that be, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> ſince he never ſaw me? Your Picture replyed <hi>Arlandria,</hi> hath wrought that miracle, nor could his paſſion be more, had you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all the charms of your unreſiſtable looks on him: On ſhipboard his eyes were perpetually fixt thereon, he kneeled, he ſpake to it, and as if it had been ſenſible of his ſufferings, he craved ſome aſſwageme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>This fair Princeſſe willingly hearkning to theſe diſcourſes, and pleaſing her ſelf with the thoughts of her new love, longed very much to ſee the effects anſwerable to the high commendations which this Damoſel had given him; but leſt her carriage ſhould diſcover her mind, ſhe kept on her former gravity; howbeit, deſiring to continue this talk, ſhe ſaid unto her. Verely, theſe ſpeeches of thine have bred a kind of deſire in me to ſee him; for it is ſcarce credible, that ſo many perfections ſhould concur in one man: But tell me, is he come hither? Nothing leſſe, Madam, anſwered ſhe, he is yet in the Port of Carican, and it may be now combatting with your Guards, for he is reſolved not to preſent himſelf before you, but as a worthy Knight ſhould do, that renders himſelf eſteemed by his vertue. I was never a friend to cruelty, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> and the ſhedding of humane blood was always abhorred by me, nevertheleſſe I would willingly ſee him fight, therby to judge impartially, whether his valour be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to thy prayſes.</p>
                     <p>Madam, anſwered this Mayd, you have the beſt oportunity that may be, I doubt not but he will make a quick riddance of all ſuch, as this day ſhall dare to incounter him, ſince the Prince of Argilles, who came far ſhort of him, hath been able to doe it, wherfore if you pleaſe, you may ſee him amongſt the Knights that guard your Ports, but for your better ſatisfaction, if you go forth to morrow into the fields, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

of walking will take the way he intends to come, you ſhall ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him make through your Troops, ſince he may not arrive at your preſence without forcing his paſſage, then ſhall you know that all I have ſaid comes farre ſhort of his valour and merit. Nay, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> I may doe far better, for it being too-great a cruelty to expoſe one only Knight to the fury of ſo many, Ile exempt him from that danger, and ſhall reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied if I may ſee him break five or ſix ſtaves, againſt a dozen of the ableſt of my Kingdom; and to this end I ſhall appoint them a rendi-vous under the great tree of the Fantoſmes, which is not much out of his way. By this way I ſhall both content my ſelf, and ſecure his life and honour: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid <hi>Arlandria,</hi> (who perceived this tenderneſſe to proceed from love) you ſhew yourſelf no leſſe wiſe then beautifull, for to ſpeak troth I have often wondred how you could be ſo cruell, as to admit no Knight to your preſence upon eaſier terms, then the price of his blood; keep you ſtill in this mind, and in the mean time adviſe with your ſelf what entertainment you will give him.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon in moſt humble manner withdrawing her ſelf ſhe left the Queen much troubled with the blow ſhe had given her, who calling to mind the ſpeeches of her Damoſel, which repreſented unto her thoughts, as well the valour, as the beauty of the Knight, remembring withall how he had behaved himſelf to and before her Picture, ſpake thus to her ſelf. If this Knight be ſuch as he is deſcribed unto me, I ſhall never be able to be Miſtris of my ſelf, ſince the bare fame of him hath begotten ſo earneſt a deſire in me to ſee him: But what a weakneſs doe I ſhew to be thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the firſt motions of a paſſion that aſſayles me? And what will the world ſay of me when it ſhall be knownthat I have ſo ſuddenly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both my mind and purpoſe? I ſhall be counted very fickle, and one that is not able to govern her affections. And yet not ſo, but in regard that vertue is always to be beloved, they will rather judge that I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to affect him, and that it is not poſſible for a woman to reſiſt ſuch powerfull charms: I will therefore ſhew him favour, and ſince I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none, but the gods for my actions, Ile put the Scepter of <hi>Corolandaya</hi> into his hand, if I find him worthy of that grace.</p>
                     <p>This Princeſſe yeelding up her ſelf in this ſort unto Loves Dominion, (from which no creature living is exempted) was inſenſibly enamoured, and this little ſpark grew ſuddenly into a flame, when as a Souldier diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her thoughts delivered in few words the wonders <hi>Griolanis</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at his firſt entry into that Kingdom.

Sirs, ſaid he, ſince we all have one Miſtris, it were unfit for me to harm thoſe whom ſhe protects, my chiefeſt ambition being to win her favour, and maintain her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty: And if I have taken up Armes againſt you, neceſſity hath infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me thereunto, ſince there is no other way to ſerve her, or to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into her preſence.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpeeches, wherein this fair Queen took marvellous delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as bellows to kindle the flame that began to ſcorch her, ſhe felt within her ſelf ſuch violent deſires, as made her wonder at this ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected change, but diſſembling her thoughts, ſhe began to extoll the proweſs and courteſie of our Warrior, whoſe fame and renown had ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Court, that moſt of the Knights reſolved to combat him. <hi>Adela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia</hi> then having ſpent the night in confuſed and reſtleſſe thoughts, in the morning a number of Knights were eſpyed upon the way of Garican, whereof the Queen having had notice, ſhe aroſe immediatly, but could not be ready time enough to ſee the beginning of the fight, nevertheleſſe word being brought her, that the ſtranger was in the midſt of her Knights, ſhe haſtned away, and arrived there juſt as <hi>Griolanis</hi> having diſmounted three of them, ſo terrified the reſt with the violence of his Incounter, as he put them all in diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Theſe redoubted, and yet courteous blows, ſince he ſtruck only with the flat, bred in her a wonderfull content, and no leſſe aſtoniſhment, when ſhe obſerved his manner of fighting, his Sword guided by judgement, lighted with violence, his motions were furious, and that which not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted her, was to ſee him keep firm in his ſaddle, in deſpight of ſo many Incounters, neither could ſhe ſufficiently admire to behold two and fifty Knights already layd on the earth, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon ſhe took him up into her Coach, and went towards the Citie, no leſs ſatisfied with his perſonage; then her Knights aſtoniſhed at the valour he had ſhewed in the Combat.</p>
                     <p>The fame of this warlike atchievement having ſpread over the whole Town, the Ladyes and Gentlemen ſtocked together in the ſtreets, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the admirable perfections of this Knight, gave him ſuch exceſſive praiſes, as he himſelf was much aſhamed of; on the contrary, <hi>Adelazia</hi> was exceedingly pleaſed therwith, eſteeming her ſelf incomparably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his company, ſo that ſhe reſolved to admit him for her Knight: howbeit to keep her ſelf within the bounds of modeſtie ſhe gave him to underſtand, that his ſole vertue was the cauſe of her reſpect to him, by no means diſcovering the love ſhe bare him: Having therfore entertained him with ordinary diſcourſe, ſhe brought him to her Palace, where having lodged him moſt ſtately, ſhe ſent him very rich and ſumptuous apparell, wherin he afterwards appeared ſo lovely, that all the Ladyes were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of him, and the common ſort amazed to behold ſo many accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments in one Knight.</p>
                     <p>A few dayes being ſpent in paſſions, reſtleſs thoughts, diſcourſes, and aſſurances, <hi>Adelazia</hi> not able to conceale her affection any longer, led him to a fair garden, where ſhe could not be over-heard by any body, and thus ſpake unto him. Knight, I know it is impoſſible for me to requite the pains you have taken in my behalf according to your merit, but deſire any thing within my Kingdome, and it ſhal be granted you as readily, as you can demand it. Madam, ſaid he, I was never covetous of gain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath been the only object of my enterprizes, and if you pleaſe to accept of my ſervice, I ſhall value that favour of yours far above all the Kingdomes of the world, but if you will deign to be ſo liberall, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow where you are no way obliged; then, Madam, look not upon my want of deſert, make me your Knight, and permit me under the favour of your beautie, to try all adventures whatſoever; you may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me of raſhneſs, but Madam, remember that our enterprizes are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious when they are high, and that it is far more honourable to fall with courage, then fail through cowardize. Knight, replyed ſhe, did I not prize your vertue above all worldly greatneſs, I could not but take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the freedome of your diſcourſe, in regard of the reſpect which is alwayes due to ſuch as reſemble me, howbeit loving your perfections, and flattering my ſelf with the conceit, that my beauty hath prevailed over you, I ſhall willingly pardon the paſſion that troubles you; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it proceeded only from a deſire to work your content: You are deſirous to be my Knight, I admit it, but conſider what obligation this draws upon you, you are no more at your own diſpoſing, your love muſt be faithfull and ſincere, and your will wholly ſubject unto mine.</p>

                     <p>Madam, ſaid he, (trembling with joy, that he had obtained his deſire) it is very meete I ſhould ſatisfie your demand. I am a Knight errant of the Kingdome of Macedon, neere unto Greece, who have no other fortune then that of my hopes, and ſword, and moſt unworthy to behold you as a lover, unleſs you will vouchſafe to ſtoop ſo far, as to weigh the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſervices and affections, with that of your beauty; My name is <hi>Griolanis,</hi> my Parents noble, and eminent, but Scepters, Madam, are wanting to their merit, which to my grief I fear, conſidering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our conditions, will be too juſt a motive for you, to reject the humble tender of my ſervice: As for any other Miſtreſs, beleeve me, Madam, and I ſwear it by the ſoveraign power of theſe your eyes, whoſe beauteous ſplendor I adore, that my ſoule was never ſenſible of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of any beautie that ever yet I ſaw. Your word ſufficeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſwearing, replyed ſhe, and I am exceeding glad to be the firſt object of your vowes, and ſo conſequently to bee free from competitors; For what concerns our conditions, that ſhall put no difference betwixt us, ſince fortune doth not alwayes confer Crowns upon ſuch as have beſt deſerved them, and ſeeing you are a Gentleman, both valiant and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, I ſhall eſteem better of you, then if you poſſeſſed whole Empyres without courage, or glory; This Kingdome is ſpacious enough to limit our ambitions, only carry your ſelf with reſpect untill time ſhall produce a happier change; And ſo parting equally ſatisfied, they went to ſupper; after which, having recreated themſelves with dauncing, each withdrew himſelf untill the morrow.</p>

                     <p>That which their merits may expect, replyed the beautifull Queen, they ſhall find hearty welcome, and if any indevour of mine may requite the honour they intend to doe me, it ſhall not be wanting unto them.

                     <p>This glorious Equipage having bred an extream deſire in moſt of the Nobility of Corolandaya, to incounter theſe ſtrangers, twelve Knights came forth on the ſudden, at the ſight whereof the Challengers getting to horſe, the Trumpets began to ſound, and the Knights to ſpur on ſo luſtily, that incountring each other in the midſt of the courſe the Defendants were diſmounted, without ſo much as ſtirring the Challengers, which at firſt did much increaſe the good opinion of their valour, but much more when they ſaw the other eight reduced to the ſame eſtate, ere they brake their firſt ſtaves.</p>

Ah! Madam, replyed he, my heart is over-charged, and wants words to eaſe itſelf: What would you have me ſay?

Thus loving each other intirely, their minds were at quiet, their affections without diſturbance, their viſits frequent, their diſcourſe wholly taken up with the mutuall aſſurances of their affections, and their whole life ſo incomparably pleaſant, as they might juſtly have boaſted their happineſs before any Lovers whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>But envious fortune, which takes delight in croſſing of our pleaſures, and bringing us in ſubjection, could no longer brook ſo happy, and ſo blisfull an eſtate; for <hi>Maxiana,</hi> the great Inchantreſs, Aunt of <hi>Silvion,</hi> Prince of Argilles, whom <hi>Griolanis</hi> flew in the quarrell of <hi>Adelazia's</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as is ſpecified in the ninth Chapter of our ſecond part, deſirous to know what ſtate her Nephew was in, took her books, and conjuring up her ſpirits, had notice of death, and of all that paſſed in Corolandaya; wherupon growing furious, ſhe prepared whatſoever charms her art could afford, and ſo tranſported her ſelf into Corolandaya, where ſhe arrived three dayes after the ſecret Mariage of theſe Lovers, and juſt at ſuch time as they were all in dauncing, and every one ſtanding by his Miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>This Sorcereſſe entring into the Hall with a burning Torch in her hand, followed by three Maids all diſchevelled, and carrying certain monſtrous, and hideous Serpents, came to the beautious Wife of <hi>Griola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> who ſtood quivering, and thus ſpake unto her; It is time thou ſhouldſt ſmart for the death of the Prince of Argilles, ſince thy crueltie occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and that he which ſlew him, ſhould ſhare with thee in the torment, His beautie made thee infringe a Law, which proved fatall to thet unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince; Undergoe therfore joyntly, a due and direfull vengeance for it. Saying ſo, ſhe threw her Torch on the floore, which preſently filled the Hall with as dreadfull a flame, as all the ſpectators aſtoniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, betook them to their heels, <hi>Griolanis</hi> only excepted, who with his fair Miſtreſſe, ſtanding faſt, and unmoved, by vertue of the Charmes, were forth with environed with a terrible fire, and ſix horrible Serpents, that ſeized on them, began to gnaw, and teare their faces and breaſts, with a crueltie no whit inferiour to that of the flames, which made them break forth into ſuch dolefull lamentations, and cryes, as was eaſily heard all over the Palace.</p>
                     <p>Ay me! ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> that ſuch varietie of delights, ſhould be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo great a torment, and that the glory I found in the fruition of ſuch valour, and beauty, as was in <hi>Griolanis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>With theſe words he layd hold on his Sword, and whileſt he thought to kill thoſe Serpents, he ran her thorow the body, and layd her groveling as if ſhe had been dead; But ſhe inſtantly getting up, and plucking the Sword out of her boſome, thruſt it into <hi>Griolanis</hi> breſt, being led by the ſame deſire, to rid him of ſuch troubleſome creatures, and preſerve him from being devoured, which rendred the ſpectacle moſt dolefull, and worthy of all compaſſion. But this divelliſh Witch took unſpeakable delight in it, and was ſo well pleaſed to ſee them two butcher each other in ſo cruell a manner, that having remained there above half an houre, ſhe quitted that hell, which ſhe named, THE MARTYRDOME OF GRIOLANIS AND ADELAZIA; and meeting <hi>Falimond, Criſander, Armorand,</hi> and <hi>Grinaldo,</hi> who moved with the Lovers dolefull cryes, were haſtening to their ſuccour, ſhe reſolved to make uſe of them in the execution of her deſignes.

The Sea, that many times brings ſtrange Veſſels into theſe coaſts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day landed two Knights not far from hence, they were incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by ſome of my men at Arms, who more inſolent then I would have had them, ſet upon them for to make them my priſoners, but being very valiant, they defended themſelves with ſuch courage, as they left thirtie or fortie of them, together with two Gyants dead in the place, and which is more, one of them retyred into a wood thereby, in deſpight of certain troups that came to ſuccour their friends, the other, who fought unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, remained behind ſo wounded, that he was fain to be carried to my Palace, where I committed him to my Chirurgions care, reſerving him for a ſacrifice to my gods, but I quickly fell from that reſolution, and ſet him at libertie in acknowledgement of the ſervice his companion did me two dayes after by killing a great and dredfull Monſter, which ſpoyled all the Countrey, and conſidering the exceeding valour he had ſhewed in the combat againſt my people, I began to affect him very much. In the mean time I cauſed the other Knight to be ſought after, that I might recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him for ſo great a benefit, howbeit he would never preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Arms, whether it were that he feared my diſpleaſure, or that he had ſome other deſign, as we have conjectured ſince, but diſguiſing himſelf in the habit of a woman, he cauſed himſelf to be brought hither as a ſlave, and to make ſhort, being indued with a moſt rarebeautie he appeared ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, as my Daughters could not to indure to be without his company, eſpecially <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> who was to ſucceed unto my Crown, had not her bad life given me juſt cauſe to diſ-inherit her; To tell you all that paſſed between them I am notable, but ſo it was, that miſtruſting no practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, I left themto ſo great a libertie, as <hi>Amplamira,</hi> the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the three that you behold, being made acquainted with the ſecrets of her eldeſt Siſter and her Slave, yeelded to the affection of that ſtrange Knight, unto whom I had given his life; and the third, which would ſhew no more obedience than the reſt, became paſſionately in love with the Knight whom you ſee there in the upper part of the Tower with her.</p>
                     <p>Nature that obligeth us to the care of our childrens well-doing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſwaded mee to beſtow them richly in mariage, I made choyce of the heir of the mightie King of Cabilla, the valorous Soldan of Arala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fia, and the King of Filzandria, to ſupport my Crown with their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but being upon the point of leading them to Church, this Slave with the firſt Knight comming armed at all parts, under colour of ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring two infortunate Lovers, which they ſaid were at the Court-gate in a Coach, they cauſed my Daughters to goe thither, who being intelligent with them, got ſuddenly into the Coach, and galloped away with that ſpeed, as they were inſtantly out of ſight, wherof being exceeding ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I commanded them to be purſued, when as this Slave lifting up the Viſier of his Helmet, told me, that he was not a woman as I had beleeved untill then, but a Knight named <hi>Amadis,</hi> Prince of Greece and Trebiſond. At theſe words ſome of my Knights advanced for to ſtay him, howbeit he layd him that firſt preſented himſelf, dead at my feet with a blow of his fiſt, and diſcharging his Sword on the Helmet of a very valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, called <hi>Meander,</hi> who arrived but that morning, he cleft him down to the ſhoulders, and ſo departed like lightning for to follow the Coach. To what end ſhould I relate all things in particular unto you? briefly they got

to the Sea-ſide after they had ſlain above ſix hundred Knights, and with the aſſiſtance of three or four Knights errant, that came thither by chance, they imbarqued themſelves in deſpite of a thouſand Knights, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to arreſt them.</p>
                     <p>Away they ſayled them, as they hoped with a proſperous wind, but the gods who never ſuffer ſo foule a crime to reſt unpuniſhed, drove them the very ſame day into this Iland, where having inveſted them with four thouſand Knights I had taken them in their beds, and executed ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible vengeance on them, if I had not been prevented by the arrivall of an old Sorcereſſe, who unexpectedly appeared with a flaming Torch in her hand, made certain circles, and muttered divers obſcure words, which were no ſooner uttered but there fell ſo cruel a ſtorm of huge Hayl-ſtones, as above five hundred of my Knights were knocked down therwith, and my ſelfe conſtrayned to fly for ſhelter to theſe houſes you ſee, from whence after the sky was cleared again, I beheld this Tower erected in the place of the houſe wherein they were; Now judge, Sir, whether this be not a ſtrange affliction unto me, and whether I have not reaſon to wiſh them in my power, for to waſh away the affront they have done me with their blood.</p>
                     <p>Mighty Prince, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> (who had been much delighted with this diſcourſe) the Heavens doe ſufficiently teſtifie by the care they have taken of theſe Knights, that they doe not approve of the revenge you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I could give you better counſell, if your Majeſty could be pleaſed to accept of it: Theſe Knights, of whom you ſpeak, are all Lords of a quality, nothing inferiour to yours, of whom the firſt according to report, is ſonne to the mighty <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece: the ſecond, whom I know very well, is Heir to the Soveraign Monarch of the Perſians, and the third is Nephew to the great King of France; ſeek not their ruin then for an offence they have done you, compelled thereunto by love, but receive them like a gentle and mercifull Father, and if you wiſh for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, let it be to rejoyce with them in their alliance, which ſhall ſo ſecure you, as all the Princes of Paganiſm ſhall not dare to look on you, but for your ſervice; If therefore you can carry a mind inclined to pardon, then I am ready to undertake the reſtoring of them unto the world, if not I wil never be the inſtrument of their deſtruction by putting them in your power.</p>
                     <p>You amaze me, ſaid the Emperor, in telling me that theſe three Knights are ſuch great Princes, in which regard I blame not my daughters ſo much as I have done, but my reſentment will not permit me ſo lightly to paſſe by ſuch enormous an offence.

                     <p>Being very glad at the defeat of theſe enemies, and the recovery of his Shield, he made head afreſh againſt the Centaurs, which ſo layd upon him, that he felt himſelfe bruiſed all over with their heavy ſtroaks, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he avoyded them as well as he could, and at the length found the means to faſten a blow with the flat of his ſword full upon the body of one of them, wherewith being overthrown ſhe reaſſumed her former ſhape, and ſo did the other not long after, who abandoning her horrible figure, took the form of <hi>Oreſtia</hi> again, at which our Warriour very much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing advanced to the Tower, and with the pummell of his ſword, he knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Chriſtall with ſuch force, as it brake into a thouſand peices, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo great and dreadfull a noyſe, that the Iland being covered over with a thick Fog, ſhaked for two hours together, at the end whereof the Sunne receiving its former light, neither the chriſtall Tower, the Lovers, nor the ſhip wherein <hi>Rozalmond</hi> came were to be ſeen, only a Pillar appeared in the midſt of the place, upon which <hi>Rozalmond</hi> read this inſcribed.</p>

                     <p>Without doubt, anſwered the Emperour, (and careſſing him as if he had been his Sonne) your reaſons are ſuch, as I am reſolved to yeeld unto them, but let me intreat you to ſtay, and refreſh your felfe here a while with me, and withall to let me know who you are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, replyed <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

I have ſuch important affairs, as I may not well ſojourn here above a day at the moſt, yet to obey you I will make it up two, and to teſtifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you how much I glory in the honour of your favour, I will tell you that, which for ſome particular reaſons I would otherwiſe conceale from all the world, and will freely confeſſe unto you, that I am <hi>Rozalmond</hi> of Greece, ſonne unto <hi>Spheramond,</hi> Emperour of Parthia, and very neer of kin to thoſe Princes, whom I deſire you to call your children.</p>
                     <p>Noble friend, ſaid the Emperour, embracing him a new, I am more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with this incounter of you, than with the acquiſition of a Monarchy, I am not ignorant of the glory your Fathers have gotten in the world, and yet I am perſwaded that you ſurpaſſe them far in valour, wherefore I ſhall make a dear account of the honour of your alliance, ſo that with all my heart I forgive my daughters, and will goe into Corolandaya, ſince they are to be there, in aſſurance whereof you ſhall ſee (during the two dayes, which you promiſe to abide here) what Bonfires I will cauſe to be made in Cardana for joy of their mariages, which at their return ſhall be renewed all over my Empire: Whereupon he returned to the Citie with <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who was entertayned there with a world of magnificenſe and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Amadis, Floridan</hi> and <hi>Lucibel</hi> were ſayling on the Sea, ſo infinitly ſatisfied with the free enjoying of their Miſtreſſes, as they paſt away eleven dayes inſenſibly; at the end whereof they arrived in Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landaya, where the marvellous inchantment of the Queen having arreſted them, they reſolved to prove the adventure, and accordingly <hi>Lucibel</hi> and <hi>Floridan</hi> having been after a long and dangerous combat vanquiſhed by <hi>Gorgophon</hi> (more by the advantage of an armour and ſhield, which <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> the Inchanter had given him, as to one that he held to be the firmeſt Pillar of Paganiſm.)</p>

                     <p>O Madam! ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> lighting preſently from his Horſe for to render her the greater reſpect, how luckie is this chance which hath brought me hither to make tryall of your valour ſo redoubted of all the world, I was going to ſeek you at Tarſipolis, for to obtaine a ſuit of you, but being aſſured that you will be as courteous here, as any where els, I will now make the ſame requeſt to you, which I intended to have done at your Palace, wherfore beautious Princeſſe, grant me one boon I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you.</p>
                     <p>Valiant Warriour, anſwered ſhe, diſcovering her face, the more civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive his ſubmiſſions, I am very glad that I have freed you from the pain of proceeding farther, demand what you pleaſe, it ſhall be eaſily granted you, for I will deny your merit nothing, wherfore get upon your horſe, and tell me what it is I muſt do for you.</p>
                     <p>Madam, replyed <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> (vaulting into his ſaddle, with much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at ſuch rare beautie,) conducted lately by a young Squire, to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a very dangerous enterprize, I met with a Magician of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who ſtopping me in the midſt of my way told me, that I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in vain, and that the end of this adventure would never be ſeen, till ſuch time as the moſt excellent Knight of the earth be accompanied with the ſtrongeſt and faireſt Lady of the world for the accompliſhing of it; I am not ſo vain to preſume, that the Deſtenies have made choyce of me for it, but withall not diſtruſting my own forces, and knowing that the earth beares not a more valourous and beautifull Princeſſe then your ſelf, I come moſt humbly to deſire you, that you will be pleaſed to aſſiſt my courage with yours, and undertake with me to ſurmount the difficulties of this enterprize, from whence if any glory redounds, it ſhall be wholly

                     <p>Let us go, let us go, anſwered ſhee, the danger ſhall be very great if we fall under it; ſo taking the way <hi>Rozalmond</hi> directed, they travelled five dayes without finding any adventure that might ſtay them, but at the end therof, they arrived at a terrible great rock, whoſe bottom was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Herewith <hi>Traſiclea</hi> forſaking her Horſe, drew out her ſword, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> that went formoſt, ſhe came to a Tree, at the foot wherof ſhe beheld an Armour covered over with ruſt. Behold, Madam, ſaid he, here it is where our firſt Combat muſt be, theſe arms you muſt vanquiſh before you can paſſe further. How, theſe arms, anſwered <hi>Traſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> have they any force in them lying in this ſort? Do but advance, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replyed <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and you will meet with greater difficulties then you think for. Wherupon <hi>Traſiclea</hi> imagining that it was ſome Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, approched ſo neere unto them, that ſhe could diſcern three Palmes in the middeſt of the ſhield, which ſo amazed her, as ſhe let her Sword drop out of her hand.</p>
                     <p>Madam, what ayles you, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond</hi> unto her, who well enough knew the cauſe of her diſtemper? Alas! anſwered ſhe with a languiſhing voyce, it was not without reaſon that you judged the danger of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to be great, take me from hence I beſeech you, for the ſight of theſe Arms in the ſtate they are in, will kill me with grieſe, they belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the beſt Knight of the world, whom my rigous without doubt hath layd in his grave, but I will not long ſurvive the loſſe of him, and this deſart which hides his bones, ſhall be ſtrewed with my aſhes.</p>
                     <p>Brave Palmes (continued ſhe throwing her Helmet on the ground, and unbuckling her Armour) brave Palmes, that never feared the tempeſt of blowes, ſuſtained by a Maſter ſo ſtrong, tell me if you can, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him? And thou excellent Sword, that foundſt no temper hard enough to reſiſt thy fury, declare unto me where that mighty arm is which made thee do ſuch wonders? Thou makeſt me remember him, but thou canſt not repreſent unto me the grace wherwithall he made thee deſcend upon his Enemies; he hath abandoned thee in theſe Deſarts, mine alſo will I leave with thee, and joyn my arms to thine: Saying ſo, ſhe layd her Armour by <hi>Alcidamants</hi> with ſo many tears and ſighes, as <hi>Rozalmond</hi> could not forbear weeping.</p>
                     <p>Madam, ſaid he unto her, you muſt hope better, let us ſearch the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, peradventure we may find this Knight alive. Ah! I fear it, anſwered ſhe, howſoever I will omit no means that may be uſed for to learn the truth therof; Wherupon riſing up with <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> help, ſhe went as far as the Grot, where beholding her Picture erected with ſuch honour, ſhee fell into new complaints. O! ſaid ſhe, how well doth this teſtifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of my anger? <hi>Alcidamant;</hi> thou wouldſt not have choſen ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Deſarts for thy dwelling, hadſt thou not been the loyalleſt of all Knights living: and had not my love been dearer to thee then all things els, thou wouldſt have been now amidſt <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Take courage, Madam, ſaid he unto her, and diſpair not thus without cauſe, the light which you ſee burning in this lamp, this picture ſo well preſerved, and this bread that lyes here, are mighty proofes for to perſwade you, that your <hi>Alcidamant</hi> lives, let us ſeek him out, I beſeech you, and ſtand no longer ſpending of tears in vain, we have time enough ſtill to afflict our ſelves, when we are ſure of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, therfore we ought not to anticipate our ſorrows before their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Your reaſons, anſwered ſhe, ſhall make me prolong my life yet a-while, go then whither you pleaſe, and I will follow you. Wherupon leaving the Grot, they walked towards the trees juſt at the time when as <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was returning to ſigh according to his cuſtome, before the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his Lady.</p>
                     <p>This poore Hermit, comming ſoftly along in regard of his weakneſſe, perceiving through the trees the gliſtering of <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> Arms, knew him ſtraight, but ſeeing a woman in his company, with her haire about her ears, he was ſo moved, that he began to tremble like the leaves of the boughs under which he was, nevertheleſſe recollecting himſelf, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced five or ſix paces, but having diſcovered the beautifull face of <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> his bloud inſtantly retyred into his veins, and all pale and wan, he tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a trance to the ground; <hi>Traſiclea</hi> ſeeing him fall, ran ſuddenly to ſuccour him, and kneeling down for to help him up, ſhe was ſo amazed to ſee him in that miſerable plight, as I think ſhe would have been in the like caſe, had not <hi>Rozalmond</hi> ſuddenly arrived, who ſaid unto her; Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is this the Knight you mean? Yes, yes, replyed ſhe, but ſo changed, as I can hardly know him, for he is now ſo unlike himſelf, that if love had not well engraven his image in my heart, I ſhould never beleeve that this were my <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> but what is that I ſay, my <hi>Alcidamant?</hi> Alas! I doubt I ſhall never ſee him alive again; <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> ſpeak to me, your <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiclea</hi> asketh you forgiveneſſe, open your eyes to her, that opens her heart to you: O comfort me with one word if you will have me to live for you; What, will you not ſpeak to me? Ay me! I am undone, his body is as cold as yce, there is no hope of life in him, one Tombe ſhall hold us both. Dear Sir, continued ſhe, turning her eyes to <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed I beſeech you, even for that pittie which you cannot chooſe but have of two ſuch unfortunate lovers. Saying ſo, ſhe laid her lips to <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damants,</hi> and overcome with exceſſe of grief, ſhe fell down by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pulſe or breath, wherat <hi>Rozalmond</hi> being exceedingly moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ran again to the brook, and with the water thereof, which was marvellous freſh, the brought them in little ſpace to themſelves again.</p>

                     <p>Well, Madam, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond</hi> then, (wonderfully well contented with that which he ſaw) did not I tell you true, that this adventure would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought to paſſe, till the braveſt Warriour of the earth, and the moſt valorous, and moſt beautifull Princeſſe of the world were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither, I brought you hither on purpoſe to behold the miſery of this Knight, little thinking that you were ſo well inclined to relieve him, but thanks be to heaven for the good ſucceſſe of my deſigne.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> and <hi>Ruſsians</hi> wounds were inhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, twelve dayes paſt inſenſibly away, at the end whereof the Veſſell of the Sun ſtaying cloſe to a rock, on whoſe top, a great ſmoak appeared, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant</hi> and <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> armed at all points, leapt on ſhore, and paſſing under certain trees, they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled above an houre without incountring any thing, but a very great ſilence over all, wherupon concluding that this was ſome Deſart, they turned towards the aſcent of the rock, and began to mount it with pain, in regard of the weight of their Arms, when as they perceived a huge fire from whence that ſmoak which they had ſeen proceeded; The curioſitie, that had made them leave the Ship, carrying them on, they ſaw a woman on her knees before the fire, who lifting up her hands to heaven, ſeemed to beg for ſomething with her prayers; they would fain have heard her complaints, before ſhe ſhould have diſcovered them, howbeit they could not approch to her ſo ſoftly; but that ſhe diſcryed them, wherupon riſing up, ſhe was going to run away, when as <hi>Alcidamant</hi> catching her by the arme, ſaid unto her; Gentlewoman, be not frighted with our preſence, for we are come hither rather to doe you ſervice, than any hurt. Knights, anſwered ſhe, having been a twelve moneth, or more, in this Deſart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing any body, truly I was affraid at the ſight of your Armes, but ſince you have ſo well confirmed me, let me know I pray you, what you would have with me, to the end I may give you ſatisfaction therin, if it lye in my power. That which we deſire, ſaid <hi>Traſiclea</hi> to her, is that you would tell us why you kneele thus before this flame, what is the cauſe of your complaints, and of your retreat into this Deſart place. That were to renew my ſorrows, anſwered ſhe, but I take ſuch delight in the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of my miſerie, that I ſhall be as ready to relate, as you are willing to heare it.</p>
                     <p>This fire, which but teſtifies the ſame, that hath long conſumed my heart, ſerues for a ſacrifice to the ghoſt of noble <hi>Clariſmon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> one of the lovelieſt Knights that was in all the Kingdome of Filamon, whoſe body is buried under the aſhes of this fire, that every day is renewed by me juſt at this hour; his death is as ſtrange, as the hiſtory of our loves, which not to abuſe your patience, I will recount unto you as briefly as I can. This Knight, a great friend to one named <hi>Martander,</hi> being taken with that little beautie, wherwith it pleaſed heaven to indue me, ſhewed himſelf ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be in all places, and companies, where I had occaſion to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that by his looks and cariage, I eaſily came to know he was in love with me, howbeit being then, I may well ſay, blind, becauſe I did not

conſider his merit, I could not by any means affect him, but contrarily carrying ſome particular good liking to <hi>Martander,</hi> that cared not for me, the ſight of him did very much diſpleaſe me; I found fault with all that he did, and the more he laboured to ſerve me, the more was I incenſed againſt him. His ſuit then being troubleſome unto me, I reſolved to let him underſtand, that he much diſ-obliged me, by ſoliciting me in that manner, and accordingly taking occaſion on a time, when he beſought me to carry a gentler mind, and to have ſome compaſſion of his ſuffering, I told him how my actions were the images of my thoughts, how I had ſhewed ſufficiently, that I did not love him, and how in vain he expected reliefe from me, for if I would give my ſelf to any one, <hi>Martander</hi> ſhould have more power over me, then all the Knights on the earth.</p>
                     <p>Hereat <hi>Martander,</hi> who was then preſent with <hi>Clariſmond,</hi> gave me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny humble thanks for the election I was willing to make of him; but, Madam, ſaid he, being <hi>Clariſmonds</hi> friend, I may not receive the honour of your favour, which would be better conferred where it is due, then on me. Some moneths paſſing away, <hi>Clariſmond</hi> obſtinate in his ſuit, I in my hate to him, and affection to <hi>Martander,</hi> theſe two friends plotted together how to deceive me. You may doe me a moſt friendly part, ſaid <hi>Clariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> one day to <hi>Martander: Parmolina,</hi> (ſo is this miſerable called that ſpeaks to you) loves you with paſſion, and when you pleaſe, you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with her to grant you any thing, ſerve me faithfully, I beſeech you; feigne as much love to her, as ſhe bears you, and labour to obtain of her that ſhe will ſpend one night with you, upon promiſe you may make her, of rendring her kiſſes legitimate; the dark keeps all things unknown, I wil goe to her in your ſtead, and ſo by this means you ſhal ſave my life, which otherwiſe cannot long continue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Martander,</hi> who to help his friend would have made no difficultie to have gone even into Hell, moſt willingly undertakes this affaire, comes to me, and craving my pardon for his ſo long neglect of my affection, in ſuch manner counterfeits the motions of a man tranſported with love and impatience, that I verely believed he was throughly taken; his ſighes very much grieved me, the vows that he made never to adore any but my ſelf, exceedingly contented me, I was ſenſible of his paſſions; what ſhould I ſay more? There was nought reſting to render us the happieſt Lovers in the world, but the fruition of our deſires, wherunto he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to arrive for the ſatisfaction of his friend; but finding dangerous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles therein, by reaſon I lay alwayes in my Mothers chamber, in a bed apart by my ſelf, I could not reſolve to run ſuch hazard; nevertheleſſe, what could not the tears of a Lover, or of one that ſeemed ſo, effect in the heart of an amorous Girle?</p>
                     <p>At length I paſt by all reſpects, and promiſing him to leave all our dores open, I ſent him away ſo contented, as he ſeemed not to envy any felicitie whatſoever: Midnight then being come, I received <hi>Clariſmond</hi> in mine arms, thinking it was <hi>Martander,</hi> and loſing my ſelf in his embraces, I little thought of this change of perſons, inſomuch, that the next day I ſpake to <hi>Martander,</hi> as thinking I had acted that with him, which I had done with <hi>Clariſmond,</hi> and as for him, he carryed the countenance of a man ſo infinitely pleaſed, as it was a fortnight before I knew by what cunning I was deceived, becauſe we durſt not ſpeak but very ſoftly, in regard of

my Mother; howbeit <hi>Clariſmond</hi> not induring to taſt his delight any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under the coverture of another, diſcovered himſelf one night, as we were in the middeſt of our pleaſure, and freely confeſt to me, that he was conſtrained to have recourſe unto wiles, ſince he could not other wayes prevaile: I will not tell you how much I was aſtoniſhed at this diſcourſe, nor what errour I was then about, to have run into by crying out, as though I had been raviſhed by force, but to proceed, I will aſſure you, how inſtantly changing my mind, with the conſideration that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was paſt remedy, I loved <hi>Clariſmond</hi> a thouſand times more than ever I had done <hi>Martander,</hi> and began to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e <hi>Martander</hi> far more, than ever I had done <hi>Clariſmond,</hi> unto whom, (excuſing my ſelf upon the weakneſſe of my judgement, which had not permitted me to chooſe the better par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,) I proteſted ſo much love, and gave him ſuch teſtimony therof by my moſt kind uſage of him, and careſſing of him anew, as he thought himſelf happy in diſcloſing this trick unto me.</p>
                     <p>But now ſee what ſport love makes with men, <hi>Martander</hi> hearing <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmond</hi> continually talk of the unſpeakable delight he enjoyed with me, began to love me moſt paſſionatly, and preferring his affection before his friendſhip, he began to vow and proteſt that truly unto me, which he had diſſembled before, hoping that the paſſion I had been in for him, was not yet quite extinct. I am not able to expreſſe what infinite content I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to behold him ſigh at my feet, and rejoyeing to ſee him languiſh through his own fault, I told him that my Mothers in-diſpoſition detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me from receiving him a-nights, as I was wont, but at length no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to abuſe him, I plainly ſaid unto him, how I very much wondered to heare him deſire a treaſure which belonged unto <hi>Clariſmond,</hi> and knowing well enough that he poſſeſt it, I could hardly beleeve he could be ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as to ſeek to bereave him of it; At this ſpeech he was ſo confounded, that he was ready to dye with griefe, and indeed he lay three weeks ſick upon it, at the end wherof being unable any longer to indure the yiolence of his deſires, it came into his head to crave the ſame favour of <hi>Clariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> which he had received from him; Laying before him then the peril of his life, the imbecilitie of men that forced him to violate the lawes of friendſhip, the power of that proud divinitie, which uſeth to triumph over thoſe hearts that goe about to reſiſt him, the merit of my beautie, and briefly all that he thought could ſerve for his enterprize; he put <hi>Clariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> into a ſtrange perplexitie, his love, and the reſolution he had taken to marry me, forbad him to yeeld unto the unjuſt requeſt of this friend, nevertheleſſe, chooſing rather to dye than be ingratefull, he concluded to deprive himſelf both of his life and happineſſe together Inſomuch, that having promiſed to give him ſatisfaction in the very ſame manner, as he had received it, he drew this Lover from his bed, and came a little after to ſee me, but without ſo much as ſpeaking a word of what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Knight, ſaid ſhe with tears of joy, and griefe, to ſee him ſo bloudy all over, let us not ſpeak, I pray you, of pardon, for I find my ſelfe ſo happy in meeting you thus, that I can never remember any miſerie paſt; come let us go and viſit your wounds, and know what we are to hope for of your recoverie. Madam, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> I feele they are dangerous, but yet not ſo much as to make you to fear, or keep me from rejoycing with my friends for the good ſucceſſe of mine enterprize; wherupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Amadis, Floridan,</hi> and <hi>Lucibel</hi> comming to him, togither with the Princeſſes of Martaria, to give him thanks for their deliverance out of the cryſtall Tower, he went and careſſed them withall the kindneſſe that might be, and ſo did <hi>Armazia, Traſiclea, Brandimanda,</hi> and the fair Infanta of <hi>Clariana,</hi> who were no leſſe amazed at the excellencie of their beauties, than they were to ſee them every way ſo accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Some time being ſpent in theſe ſalutations and compliments (and <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gophon</hi> freely ſuffered to be carried away by certain of his ſervants to his Ship, where a little after being fetched out of his ſwound, he was ſo mad, for that he had been vanquiſhed, as they had much adoe to keep him from killing of himſelf) <hi>Rozalmond</hi> hearing that <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was upon proving of the adventure, he went where he beheld him ingaged againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the Monſter.</p>
                     <p>This invincible Warriour ſeeing himſelf delivered from four of his firſt enemies, and looked upon by ſo many excellent perſons, moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly boorded thoſe two creatures, and deſiring to diſplay the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his forces, he diſcharged his Sword with ſuch violence upon the Serpents head, that though it could not pierce the hardneſſe of the ſcales, yet it made him ſtoup to the very ground, preſently wherupon being layd at by the Monſter, he dextrouſly declined the blow of his axe, which fell in vain upon the floore, The firſt fury of thoſe horrible beaſts being in this ſort avoyded, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> finding that the aſtoniſhment wherein the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was, gave him opportunitie to performe ſomething the mean while upon the Monſter, he took his ſword in both his hands, and ſlipping by the danger of a ſecond blow from him, hee let it deſcend with ſuch ſtrength, on his left arm, which was as big as a tree, that he cut it ſheere from his body.</p>
                     <p>This lucky ſtroak animating him to do better, he turned to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thinking to avoyd his fury as before, but he was ſo ſurprized, and incountred with ſuch force, as he was layd all along in the duſt, where this creature running on him, laboured to ſeize on his Helmet with his teeth, in which danger, ſtill retaining his judgement, he ran him up into the belly, that made him make a mighty skip into the ayre, by means wherof our Knight had leiſure to ariſe, but being ſcarce well upon his legs, he received ſo great a blow from the Monſter, as he was conſtrained to ſet both his knees to the ground, where ſhame and danger not ſuffering him to continue long, he got up again ſo full of rage, that caſting his ſhield on his ſhoulder, he diſcharged with ſuch fury on that monſtrous creature, as having incountred the handle of his axe, and cut it in two, his ſword fell with that tempeſt on his head, that it cleft him down to the waſt. O heaven! ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> what a dreadfull blow was this, and who can be able to reſiſt the thunder of ſuch a mighty arm? Queſtionleſs this Warriour is the nonparil of the earth, unto whom all the world hath reaſon to give place.</p>

This ſpeach, which <hi>Alcidamant</hi> heard, having rendred him infinitely couragious, he let fall an horrible ſtroak on the Serpent, that came leaping towards him, and watering the floore with the bloud that iſſued from the wound in his belly; never theleſe, having not ſo much as made any print on his ſcales, he was enforced to ſtep ſuddenly aſide for to give him way, and was ready with his ſword aloft to have ſmitten him on the tayl, when as he perceived a Knight all on fire, come out of the Hall, who preſently gave him ſo mightie a blow, that it made him ſtagger, and in that manner amazed, as he knew not in what world he was, howbeit inſtantly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his ſpirits he became ſo inraged, that beholding the Serpent rayſed on his two hinder feet for in fall upon him with all the weight of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he ran him with ſo mortall a thruſt into the flank, that he overturned him on his back, where leaving him amidſt the pangs of death, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch horrible cryes, as all the place ſhaked therwith, he turned to the inchanted Knight, and began to charge him with ſo much force and agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as though he had not fought all the day before, nevertheleſſe he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtrange paine, for the fire which covered the inchanted Knight ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that he thought he was conſumed in his arms; but what will not a valiant man ſuffer, that would dye a thouſand times, rather then forgoe the honour of a difficult enterprize?</p>
                     <p>He employed all his force, and delivering his blowes with no leſſe ſtrength, then when as he divided the body of a Gyant, he charged the inchanted Knight ſo terribly, that he forced him to mount up the ſtayrs again, which exceedingly incouraging our Warriour, he followed him, redoubling his horrible blowes, till he came up to the top of the ſtayres, where his enemy returned him ſuch a ſtroak on his Helmet, as made him fall on his knees, ready to tumble down all the ſteps, but ſtaying himſelf on his hands, he aroſe full of fury, and diſcharged his ſword with ſuch violence on the Knight, as it extended him on the earth, where <hi>Alcidamant</hi> going to unlace his Helmet for to take off his head in ſatisfaction of his anger, he perceived that they were empty Arms without a body in them, at which he would have very much marvelled, had he not been well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the power of Magicians, wherfore being very much moved with the lamentable complaints of <hi>Griolanis</hi> and <hi>Adelazia,</hi> he made no further ſtay, but burſt open the dore with the pummell of his ſword, and no whit regarding thoſe horrible flames, which appeared all over the room, he went directly to the two Lovers, hoping to carry them eaſily from thence; nevertheleſſe, he was fain to undertake a new combat, the Serpents which devoured them, flew upon him, and winding themſelves about his legs, they laboured to overthrow him to the ground.</p>
                     <p>This new difficultie, far more troubleſome than dangerous, having held him a good while without knowing how to free himſelf from theſe creatures, he let go his ſword, and cloſing his hand, hee knocked them down with his fiſt; that done, a phantoſme preſented it ſelf before him, which borrowing a thouſand figures one after another, laboured to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him; but he that could not be moved with any danger whatſoever, having cut the ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Rganda</hi> having cloſed up <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> wounds in a night, all thoſe Princes, which infinitly deſired the accompliſhment of their happineſſe, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, and reſolved to take one and the ſame day for the conſummation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but having no leſſe care of their Ladies ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then of their own ſatisfaction, they concluded in repreſenting their pains unto them to ſet before their eyes the vanity of their Idols in the greatneſs of that Almighty God, who vouchſafed to ſhed his moſt precious blood, for to reſtore us unto the way of grace, from which we were ſtrayed by the revolt of our firſt parents: Entring then all with this deſign into the room wher the Princeſſes were, they perſwaded them to go and walk into the Gardens, and there ſeparating themſelves into ſeverall walks, and each one taking his Miſtris by the arm, ſpake ſo paſſionately and effectually for himſelfe, as he eaſily prevayled with her, to reſolve upon the third day following, for the celebration of their Nuptials.</p>
                     <p>This firſt point being determined according to their deſires, they began to talke unto them of the excellency of the Chriſtian Religion, of the myſterie of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, Death, and Reſurrection of the Sonne of God, of the miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, of the Inſtitution of the Sacraments, and ſhewing them the Heavens and the Sunne, they drew them inſenſibly to the knowledge of the Creator of them, which could not be but farre more perfect and excellent, in ſo much that being aſſiſted with the love they bore them, they were ſoon induced to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and accordingly the ſame day <hi>Adelazia</hi> ſent for three Chriſtian Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, which ſhe had ſuffered to live in her Kingdom, by whom being yet better inſtructed in the chiefeſt Articles of the faith, the Temple of thoſe Idols, ſhe had formerly adored, was cleanſed of a number of ſeveral Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereof three or four being beaten to peices by our Knights, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them further in the beleefe that they were of no power.</p>
                     <p>Time and deſire then preſſing our Lovers, and making them haſten every thing. Theſe Princes received the firſt Character of Chriſtians, <hi>Armazia</hi> conducted by <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who was her Godfather, <hi>Traſiclea</hi> by <hi>Rozalmond, Palmirenna</hi> by <hi>Florisbel, Adelazia</hi> by <hi>Amaais, Amplamira</hi> by <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmond, Brandimanda</hi> by <hi>Floridan, Archeſidella</hi> by <hi>Seſtilian,</hi> and the fair <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> by <hi>Griolanis,</hi> which being performed they returned to the Palace, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe good fathers in the Church for to inſtruct the principal perſons of Corolandaya, who after the example of their Soveraign cheerfully embraced this new Law, beleeving by what was ſhewed them, that it was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17218:263"/>
much better than that which they had ſo long a time profeſſed.</p>
                     <p>Mean while our Lovers, thinking of nothing but the day, which was to place them in the ſupreme degree of their glory, prepared moſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent apparell, and eſpecially the Ladies, who deſiring to make a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of all their beauties, omitted nought that could add any thing to grace themſelves withall.</p>
                     <p>Nothing was heard but Violms, Haubois, conſorts of Inſtruments, and voyces, all the ſhops of the Citie were ſhut up, the people made bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, and preparations for Maſques, Playes, and Feaſting; from all parts of the Kingdom arrived Knights and Ladies, that came to celebrate the deliverance and nuptials of their Queen: Briefly, all things were diſpoſed to delight, and the third day ſeemed no leſſe tedious to the people, then to thoſe valiant Princes, who at length beholding it appear thorough their windows, were incontinently attyred moſt richly, and ſo entred all into the preſence, whither thoſe Princeſſes repayred not long after like ſo many Goddeſſes.</p>
                     <p>Many ſweet and amorous diſcourſes paſſing between them, <hi>Rozalmond</hi> in a ſuit and cloak of blew velvet, embroydered with gold and pearle, placed himſelfe on the right hand of <hi>Armazia,</hi> whoſe Gown was of the ſame colour, and <hi>Florisbel</hi> on the left: The brave <hi>Alcidamant</hi> followed him in a dublet of white ſattin, his hoſe and cloak of crimſon velvet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with an embroyderie of gold, pearle, and ſtones, being on the right ſide of the beautifull <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> attyred in the ſame colours, whom <hi>Don Seſtilian</hi> held by the left hand: <hi>Amadis</hi> was the third with his faireſt <hi>Palmitenna,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Beltamir,</hi> having his cloak and hoſe of black velvet, powdered over with ſilver oes, amongſt the which a number of ſparkling diamonds being aptly placed, gave a marvellous luſtre: <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſel</hi> of Gunidaya was the next in a dublet, hoſe, and cloak of green ſattin wrought al over with gold and ſilver, having the incomparable <hi>Miralinda,</hi> betwixt him and the Count of Pandelia, in a Gown of white ſattin, cut upon carnation taffea, and all ſet with great diamonds. After him went <hi>Floridan</hi> with his <hi>Amplamira,</hi> and the gentle Marquis of Cardana, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled both in purple ſattin moſt richly embroydered: <hi>Griolanis</hi> and the moſt beauteous <hi>Adelazia</hi> followed them, accompanied with the King of Bronzartes, neer kinſman to the Queen, ſo ſet with ſtones, as every one was amazed at the riches of their clothes: Then marched <hi>Lucibel,</hi> and the fair <hi>Infanta</hi> of Martaria, <hi>Grian</hi> and <hi>Brandimanda; Rusſian,</hi> and the delicate <hi>Agriclea,</hi> aſſiſted by the chiefeſt Princes of the Kingdom, and ſo ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly apparelled, as they had no cauſe to envy their companions.</p>
                     <p>This excellent troop at length arrived at the Church, where the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits having ſung Maſſe, they were married together with all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies requiſite in ſuch caſes: That done they returned to the Palace, and there dinner being prepared with all the ſtate and magnificence that might be, they ſate down attable in the ſame order as they went to Church.</p>
                     <p>Having been entertained then with all the moſt exquiſite and choyſeſt meats, that water, land, or ayr could yeld, they reſolved to make a turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein a thouſand ſelected Knigts ſhould be divided into two bands, one of them to be led by <hi>

                     <p>Now dinner being done, and a thouſand Knights ready within the Barriers, the Princes went and armed themſelves, and a little after appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the place like ſo many gods of Battail: The Marquis of Beltamir, and the Admirall of Corolandaya being placed, as the Iudges in their ſcaffolds, and the trumpets ſounding from all parts, thoſe two troops, wherein the glory of all the Knight-hood in the world was aſſembled, began to ſet forth, and thoſe two invincible Champions, <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> charging their Launces one againſt another, incountred with ſuch fury, that the earth even trembled under their horſes feet, their ſtaves were broken into a thouſand ſhivers, and yet they not ſo much as moved in their ſaddles, paſſed along like two Rocks ſtanding firm againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of an enraged floud; <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Grians</hi> courſe was performed with as much grace and force; <hi>Griolanis</hi> and <hi>Clariſel</hi> ran againſt each other with like fortune; equall was the honour between <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> and <hi>Floridan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Brandimanda</hi> and <hi>Lucibel;</hi> but <hi>Grinaldo</hi> was unhorſed by the gentle <hi>Rusſian</hi> of Media; <hi>Armorand</hi> and <hi>Seſtilian</hi> were both overthrown to the earth, ſo was <hi>Criſander</hi> by the valiant <hi>Florisbel,</hi> and <hi>Falemond</hi> diſmounted him againſt whom he addreſſed his Launce; In the meantime the two troops being incountred, above two hundred Knights were layd on the ground, who withdrawing aſide for fear of being trampled under the horſes feet, there began almoſt pleaſant bickering: <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and <hi>Rozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> put all in confuſion, their ſwords fell like thunderbolts wherſoever they lighted; <hi>Amadis</hi> overturned all that he met withall, <hi>Grian</hi> left not a Knight in his ſaddle; <hi>Clariſel</hi> flew about like lightning, <hi>Griolanis</hi> ſeemed a fury, <hi>Floridan, Lucibel, Rusſian,</hi> and <hi>Florisbel</hi> did wonders as they went, <hi>Traſiclea, Brandimanda, Armorand,</hi> and <hi>Grinaldo,</hi> who were horſed again, made no leſſe an havock; briefly, the victory hung equally ballanced every where, and upon the ſole force of the Chieftains depended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the turnament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rozalmond</hi> jealous of <hi>Alcidamants</hi> glory, <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Grians,</hi> and <hi>Clariſel</hi> envying the honour which <hi>Griolanis</hi> acquired, went and aſſayled them all at one time, and began one of the braveſt combats that ever were ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſix Knights, <hi>Rozalmonds,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alcidamants</hi> blows were tempeſts, thoſe of <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Grian</hi> had little leſſe fury; and when one delivered a terrible ſtroak, he was ſure to be preſently paid again in the ſame money; now was <hi>Alcidamant</hi> overturned on the crupper of his horſe, by and by <hi>Rozalmond</hi> was ſtrucken down to the pummell of the ſaddle; <hi>Amadus</hi> and <hi>Grian</hi> knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their chins againſt their breſts; <hi>Griolanis</hi> and <hi>Clariſel</hi> loſt their ſtirrops; <hi>Traſiclea, Brandimanda,</hi> and the Pagan Princes valiantly ſuſtayned the fury of <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> and his companions; and the Knights animated by the example of their Leaders, maintayned themſelves ſtill upon equall terms, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion this turnament wherein no blood was drawn, yeelded a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull ſpectacle: <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and <hi>Rozalmond</hi> wearied with one anothers horrible blows, <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Grian</hi> amazed at each others ſtrength, <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and <hi>Griolanis</hi> vext for that neither of them could prevayl, ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all at one inſtant, and began to fly in again amidſt the troops, when as they ſaw thirteen moſt dreadfull Gyants appear, mounted on ſuch great

Horſes, as their heads ſeemed to touch the very clouds.</p>
                     <p>The ſight of theſe Colloſſes poſſeſſing them with a new reſolution, the Troups rallyed together, whilſt thoſe eleven couragious Princes, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Traſiclea</hi> and <hi>Brandimanda,</hi> got ſuddenly ſharp Launces, and placed themſelves moſt oppoſite to thoſe thirteen Gyants, with whoſe deſormitie the Ladyes had been very much troubled, had not <hi>Urganda</hi> laughing, made them confident of the valour of their Knights.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Monſters then approaching, with each of them a great Maſt in his hand, all thoſe Princes ſet ſpurs to their Horſes, and diſlodging with fury, went to incounter them in the midſt of the race, with good hope to be revenged of the interruption they had brought to their ſports; but their ſtaves being broken as ſlightly, as if they had been Reeds, they were marvellouſly aſtoniſhed to behold thoſe horrible Gyants, changed in an inſtant into thirteen little Dwarfs, which marched before a Chariot, wherin <hi>Rozalmond</hi> knew <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> with the moſt beautifull <hi>Penamonda</hi> of Greece, his Siſter. O my deareſt friend I ſaid he addreſſing his ſpeach to <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> how much am I joyed with the ſight of you, but how comes it that you are thus accompanyed with my ſiſter? My Lord, anſwered ſhe, I doe not bring her without good cauſe, ſhe comes to congratulate with you, for your good fortune, and to go along with you about a ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night hence in an adventure of very great importance. Both you, and ſhe, are moſt heartily welcome, replyed <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and I am very glad that ſhe is here to keep my <hi>Armazia</hi> company.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Princes alighting from their horſes, went and ſaluted the young Princeſſe, who raviſhed them all with the wonder of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which no leſſe amazed the Ladyes, that came preſently down to her, than ſhe was carried with admiration at the ſight of ſo many graces as were aſſembled in them.</p>
                     <p>A good while being ſpent then in complements, theſe Lords and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes were ready to aſcend the Palace, leaving the ending of the turnament to another time, when as they deſcryed two hundred Knights richly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, following a triumphant Chariot, wherin ſate an old man on a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Throne, with an Imperiall Crown on his head, and a young Lady at his feet: This ſo ſtately an equipage drawing every one narrowly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, <hi>Palmirenna</hi> perceived that it was the Emperour her Father, and her couſin <hi>Agiliana,</hi> the King of Arbales Daughter, wherat both ſhe, with <hi>Amplamira,</hi> and the French Princes wife were ſo troubled, that they were ready to ſink down in the place, wheras contrarily <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> who knew his mind well, went ſtraight-way with <hi>Griolanis</hi> unto him, and bid him very welcome to that Court; The Emperour preſently knowing that valiant Prince, and underſtanding that <hi>Griolanis</hi> was King of Corolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daya, inſtantly deſcended from his Chario<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:17218:265"/>
One day as all this princely company were diſcourſing together, there entred into the Hall a young Gentlewoman with her eyes full of tears, and of ſo ſad a countenance, as moved all that were preſent to pitty, in one hand ſhe had a very rich ſword, and her left arm ſuſtained one of the goodlieſt Shields that ever was ſeen: Aſſoon as ſhe was advanced to the midſt of the Hall, ſhe for a good while obſerved all thoſe Lords and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, raviſhed as it were with the ſight of ſo rare an object, and finding that there was a generall ſilence over all, in expectation of that which ſhe would ſay, ſhe demanded for <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and the beautious Queen his Wife. Here we are ſaid they, making towards her, Gentlewoman, will you have anything with us?</p>
                     <p>Great King, anſwered ſhe, falling on her knees before him, it is not without reaſon that every one talks of you, as of the prime Knight of the world, and that the beauty of this incomparable Queen, whom the gods have given to your merit, is preferred before all other on the earth, for now I ſee more than heretofore I could beleeve; I am come hither to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one boon of you, and of this fair Princeſſe, refuſe me not, I beſeech you, nor let me be the only afflicted woman living that failes of ſuccour from you. Gentlewoman, anſwered <hi>Griolanis,</hi> if I am able to doe any thing for you, you may ſpeak freely, for I will moſt willingly grant whatſoever you ſhall deſire of me, and ſo I think will the queen my Wife. Yes verely, ſaid <hi>Adelazia,</hi> I will promiſe her any thing ſhe will aske.</p>
                     <p>I could expect no leſſe, replyd ſhe, wherfore Sir, be pleaſed to Arm your ſelf preſently, but you ſhall uſe no other Sword nor ſhield, then theſe moſt excellent ones which I have brought of purpoſe for you, and come both of you along with me, you to combat a Gyant that hath ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed me, and ſhe to deliver a ſervant of mine detained in the charmes of an old Sorcereſſe, which torments him for diſdaining her affections. It is no ſmall diſpleaſure, ſaid <hi>Griolanis,</hi> to leave ſuch good company, but ſince we are obliged by promiſe, we will follow you inſtantly, wherupon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Arms to be brought him, he took leave of all thoſe Princes, who were exceedingly grieved at their ſo ſudden departure, and finding in the Palace-yard the Gentlewomans coach with ſix luſtie Horſes, he and his Wife entred into it, and were carryed away with ſuch ſpeed, as they were inſtantly out of ſight.</p>
                     <p>The whole Court being very much troubled with this adventure, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſpake diverſly of it, and ſome of the Knights were already of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to follow after them, when as <hi>Urganda,</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> comming from making their Conjurations cryed out; To Arms, Knights, to arms, and ſuffer not <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and his Wife to be ſo wretchedly caſt away, they are betrayed by <hi>Leſtrigond,</hi> Neipce to that <hi>Maxiana,</hi> which the other day was cut in pieces, and if they be not reſcued before night, you ſhall never ſee them more.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words the Hall was preſently empty, the Knights ran all about thorow the Palace, and the aſtoniſhment was every where ſo great, that no body took care of comforting the Ladyes, which were mightily afflicted, whilſt all the Princes were arming themſelves, and their Squirs were making ready their horſes, whilſt the people were running to the Church to pray unto the new god, whom they adored, for the ſafetie of their Soveraignes.</p>

                        <hi>Griolanis</hi> and his Wife being ſwiftly carryed away, arrived at a Forreſt ſome three leagues from the Citie, where the Knight alighting out of the Coach at the ſight of two dreadfull Gyants, drew out the Damoſels rich Sword, and with greatfury diſcharged it upon one of them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to ſee him lye at his feet, but it broke into an hundred pieces as that very firſt blow, nothing remained in his hand but the bare hilt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he was very much amazed, but far more when as he beheld his Shield fall all to fitters, as it had been glaſſe, with the ſtroak of the other Gyant; for all this danger yet being no way diſmayed, albeit he thought he was betrayed, he caught up a great arm of a Tree to defend himſelfe, but thoſe two horrible Colloſſos delivering two terrible blows both at one inſtant on his Helmet, layd him all along on the earth, where with cords, which they had ready for the purpoſe, they bound him hand and foot, and ſo carrying him to the Coach, where <hi>Adelazia</hi> was, who tearing her hair fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ayre with her ſhrieks, they inſtantly galloped away as faſt as they could drive.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Rozalmond, Alcidamant,</hi> and <hi>Grian,</hi> being ſooner mounted then the reſt, rode away with ſuch ſpeed, as in leſſe than an houre they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Forreſt, where unluckily taking a wrong way, they rode up and down ſeeking in vain for <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and his Queen, who at length met with a big Knight, bearing two Bears in his ſhield, which moved with the cryes of the Lady, firſt of all cut aſunder the harneſs of the horſes that drew ſo rich a prey, and then ſheathing up his Sword, he charged his Launce ſo furiouſly againſt the Gyants, whom he ſaw making towards him, that he ran one of them thorow the ſhield, and arme, overthrowing him to the ground, but being ſcarce able to ſupport the violence of both their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters upon him at once, he had much adoe to keep himſelf in his ſaddle, nevertheleſſe he re-ſettled himſelf well again, by that time the other Gyant had finiſhed his courſe.</p>

                     <p>In the mean while the faireſt <hi>Traſiclea</hi> arrived, who having with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerved the valour of this invincible Warriour, to her altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and beholding <hi>Leſtrigond</hi> ſave her ſelfe by flight, ſhe unlooſes the two Lovers, which preſently went to the Knight of the Bears, and gave him all poſſible thanks for their deliverance. I have not done any thing, ſaid he, but what a good Knight is bound couragiouſly to undertake for the ſuccour of the afflicted; wherefore there is no thanks due unto me for it, but if you think yourſelves any way obliged unto me, acknowledge it by telling me who you are. Noble Sir, anſwered <hi>Griolanis,</hi> that was as much taken with the beauty of his face, as with the force of his arm, I am called <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and this fair Lady is the Queen of Corolandaya, wherin you now are, both of us this day moſt wretchedly betrayed, &amp; no queſtion had ſerved for the ſatisfaction of our enemies malice, without the aſſiſtance of your valour. Is the inchantment then, replyed the Knight, wherein you were retayned brought to an end? Truly I am very ſorry for it, not in that you are freed from the torment you ſuffered, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I arrived not time enough, to try whether the honour of that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for which I have made a long Journey hither, would have lighted on me.</p>
                     <p>Now who is that fortunate Knight, which hath acquired ſuch glory? The Husband of this excellent Princeſſe, anſwered <hi>Griolanis</hi> (poynting to <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> whoſe exquiſite beauty the ſtranger much admired) named the knight of the burning Rock, that formerly bore three palms on his ſhield. Verely, ſaid the ſtrange Knight, I doe not marvell at it now; for that brave Warriour, being incomparably the beſt Knight I have known, it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no other could be able to carry it from him. Ah Madam, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, kiſſing <hi>Traſicleas</hi> hands, how happy are you in the poſſeſſion of ſo renowned a Knight. It is the greateſt bliſſe I have in the world, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, but Sir, I could wiſh it were accompanied with the knowledge of you, for the brave act, which you lately performed, obligeth ſo many of us together, as I cannot be without this curioſity.

you to betake you to your arms, firſt for the honour of that great God, whom we adore, and then for the conſervation of thoſe Empires, which are under the obedience of your Parents; The care that I have alwayes had to maintayn them in greatneſſe, having made me the laſt night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the aſpect of the Stars, and the motions of the Moon, I diſcovered ſome preſages of a mighty misfortune towards, and all the ſigns which I obſerved were ſo many thunderbolts, ready to fall on Chriſtondome, whereupon turning over my books for to come to a more particular knowledge of the miſchiefe, that ſo I might prepare a remedy for it, I found that the ſtorm is rayſed by the inſtigation of <hi>Idalcan,</hi> Emperour of Melly, who being infinitely diſpleaſed, for that he was vanquiſhed by <hi>Silvan,</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> covered the fields of Greece with an innumerable multitude of ſouldiers, ſtirs up all Paganiſm, together with <hi>Falanzar,</hi> great Emperour and Caliph of Siconia, his neer kinſman, in revenge of that affront, taking a ſlight occaſion in the firſt place, to ruin the Empire of Ethiopia, (whereby he will commence his conqueſts) upon the alliance which <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> who poſſeſſeth it, hath made with the Princes of Greece, changing his Religion for to have <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Don Floriſel</hi> of Niquea.</p>

                     <p>Going then from the hall to her Chamber, ſhe left the company aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at ſuch unwelcome news, but the greatneſſe of theſe Champions courages not permitting them to fear any danger whatſoever, they turned them to the Emperour of Martaria, who deſiring to appear a Chriſtian, and to ſhew the Princes of Greece what eſteem he made of their alliance, told them that he was reſolved to return into Martaria, as ſoon as ever they were gone, and rayſe fiftie thouſand horſe, for to paſſe into Ethiopia, under the conduct of <hi>Perſides, Lucibel,</hi> and <hi>Seſtilian,</hi> who was very glad of this occaſion, that he might not be ſo ſoon ſeparated from the beautifull <hi>Agiliana,</hi> his Miſtris, who acknowledging the merits of this young Prince loved him very dearly.</p>

O my Lord! ſaid he unto him, how haypy

am I, that have found you out thus, when leaſt I hoped for it, do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to own me, I beſeech you, but grant me the honour, as formerly I have been, to continue ſtill to be your ſervant. That thou ſhalt, my dear <hi>Arnides,</hi> anſwered <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> for I will not turn thee away now, as I did whenI was anHermit, but how didſt thou know that I was here? My Lord, replyed he, when you commanded me to leave you to the libertie of your ſad thoughts, and return into France, I could not indure to quit you ſo, wherfore I retyred to a Village ſome three miles off, from whence I went once a-week to your Hermitage, but becauſe I would not diſpleaſe you with the ſight of me, I came into your Grot at ſuch times, as I knew you were making your accuſtomed complaints abroad under the trees, and judging by the continuance of the Lampes burning; that you were ſtill alive, I ſtole away again ſoftly, by which means at length finding you departed, I betook me to travell up and down, hoping that one day I ſhould meet with you; and hearing of the wonders which have happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Court of late, by good fortune I came hither. I commend thy affection aſmuch, as I am well pleaſed to ſee thee, ſaid <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> thou art come very ſeaſonably, wherefore prepare to be gone with me inſtantly.</p>
                     <p>This ſhort diſcourſe ended, the Dwarf approched to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſaid unto him; My Lord, do not you know me? No verely, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> for I do not remember that ever I ſaw thee before. Why thus it is, anſwered he, to doe ſervice unto ſuch as you are; can you call to mind the Grot in Martaria, whither I led you, when you had defeated the Monſter of the mountain of Bears? Ah! my little <hi>Baſtinel,</hi> ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi> unto him, I muſt now confeſſe my fault, thou art he indeed that healedſt me in a night. It is true, anſwered the Dwarf, that I am he who cured your wounds in leſſe time then you ſpeak of, but you never think of the recompence which you promiſed then to give me. Ask what thou wilt, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> and I will grant it thee. Why then, ſaid <hi>Baſtinel,</hi> I deſire nothing but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to be either yours, or the fair Princeſſe of Martaria your Wives Squire. Verely, ſaid <hi>Palmirenna,</hi> that for all her ſorrow, to part with her Father and Siſter, could not chooſe but laugh, I will entertain thee moſt willingly, and me thinks it were better for thee to be with me, then my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> for ſo thou ſhalt be ſure to leade a quieter and pleaſanter life. Be it ſo then, ſaid <hi>Baſtinel,</hi> but, Madam, it ſhall be upon condition that if I fall in love with any of your fair Maids, you ſhall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with it.</p>
                     <p>Hereat every one fell a laughing, eſpecially <hi>Maſcarin, Miralinda's</hi> little Lover, that preſſing thorow all the company, fell to careſſing of <hi>Baſtinel,</hi> and had much increaſed the mirth, if the ſage <hi>Urganda</hi> had not urged the departure of theſe Knights, who addreſſed themſelves to the Emperour for to receive his commandments. He having embraced them, left them to take their farewell of the reſt, which was not done without many tears ſhed by theſe Princeſſes, that were to accompany them, howbeit conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that this ſeparation was but for a further good, they went and ſeated themſelves in a magnificent Chariot, which with eight excellent Horſes <hi>Adelazia</hi> had prepared, and attended by theſe Princes mounted upon their Steeds, took their journey towards the great Kingdome of Martan.

at our deſires without ſome croſſes, for on a ſudden the Sea begins to ſwell, and waxeth ſo rough, that the Marriners foreſeeing a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, were forced to caſt Anchor at the edge of a rock which made the point of a little Iſland, where theſe two Knights diſ-imbarquing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to decline the trouble of the Seas, advanced into the Land, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Pilot to wait their returne.</p>
                     <p>The Iland ſeemed to be very delightfull, by reaſon of the abundance of Trees planted in a handſome order, upon the ſides of little pleaſant hills, and ſhadowing the cryſtall Rivolets, which environed the fruitfull Meadows: As they were diſcourſing of the wonders of God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of all thoſe things that preſented themſelves to their view, they eſpyed a beautifull young Lady comming towards them, who ever and anon tearing her hair, uttered theſe ſad and ſtrange complaints; Alas! ſaid ſhe, muſt the fire conſume ſo ſweet a face, and can a womans rage be the cauſe of ſo great a diſaſter! O ye gods! let this day produce ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and if ye will preſerve me alive, deliver this Knight from ſo cruell a death.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words diſpoſed the hearts of the two Princes to a ſenſibility of compaſſion, ſo that drawing neere to her, <hi>Fulgoran</hi> ſpake in this manner; Lady, may it lye in our power to doe you any ſervice in this ſo preſſing an affliction? Yes, without doubt, replyed ſhe, and the pains you take, will be moſt honourably employed, in ſaving from death a moſt deſerving Knight, one of the moſt amiable the eyes of man ever beheld; if you pleaſe to walk forward, I'le give you the whole relation, for I fear, if we ſhould make any ſtay here, we ſhould come too late to relieve him.</p>
                     <p>This Knight arrived three moneths ſince in this Iland, which is called the deceitfull Iland; It was his ill fortune to fall into the hands of <hi>Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racia,</hi> a Gianteſſe, none of the largeſt in the world, but the cruelleſt that ever was, for taking pleaſure in ſhedding of mans bloud, ſhe continually entertains a multitude of Ruffians in a Caſtle, who either by ſurpriſall, or force, ſeiz upon all the Knights that paſſe this way, and caſt them into priſon, from whence ſhe bringeth out ſom of them once a yeare to facri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to her Idols; This young Gentleman, I ſay, being arrived here, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred twelve of her Souldiers, which thinking preſently to lay hands on him, were charged with ſuch an undaunted valour, that ten of them being cut in pieces, the other two betook themſelves to their heeles; this Knight purſuing them with too much confidence, came at length before the Caſtle gates of this Gyanteſſe, who making uſe of me for the better accompliſhing of her treaſons, cauſed me to deſcend to appeaſe his anger, and to entreat him to take the benefit of the Caſtle to refreſh himfelf in, and to be aſſured that he ſhould not receive the leaſt wrong there.</p>
                     <p>His ill fortune enduced him to beleeve me, ſo that he preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me in, and unarming himſelf, he ſhewed me ſo rare a beauty, that to ſay the truth, I began a little to feele the power of love, which bred in me ſuch an extream ſorrow, that I had been the means to impriſon him within thoſe cruell Walls, as at the ſame inſtant, I had ſet him at liberty, by cauſing him to retyre, if <hi>Gargaracia</hi> had not then entred with a deſigne, rather to take from him his life, than to give him any courteous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; but the raviſhing charms of his looks overmaſtering this bloud-thirſty humour, ſhe forth-with became paſſionatly amorous,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17218:273"/>
reſolving to ſpare him for the ſatisfying of her filthy luſt, and ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embracing him, ſhe let him know, that her intent was to make him happy, by vouchſaſing him a part in her own bed.</p>
                     <p>At thoſe words the Knight taking a full view of her, and ſeeing her face furrowed with wrincles, her eyes ſunk into her hed, her griſly knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted haires, blobberd-lips, flat noſe, accompanied with all the marks of uglineſſe, could hardly forbear laughter, nevertheleſſe conſidering that there might be danger in provoking her, he made this reply, that his faith obliging him to be ever true to the affections of a certain Lady whom hee loved, he humbly beſought her not to take it ill, that he could not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the honour ſhe was pleaſed to offer him; How, ſaid ſhe, in a great rage, do you ſlight me thus, knowing that you are now in my power? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me you ſhal repent it at leiſure. Then laying hands on him, ſhe called twenty of her ſervants to her, by whoſe aſſiſtance having faſt bound him, ſhe caſt him (to my great grief) into a dark Dungeon, purpoſing to infflict daily upon him inſufferable torments; but her paſſion of love bearing a greater ſway than that of anger, ſhe called me to her at break of day, &amp; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that the nights reſt had not freed her from thoſe unquiet thoughts whereto the beauty of the young Knight had ſubjected her, ſhe deſired me to viſit him, and to adviſe him to live in her favour, otherwiſe he muſt expect no mercy.</p>
                     <p>This command ſuiting with my wiſhes, I preſently took a Torch in my hand, and went down to the place, where I found the Knight bound, who perceiving me comming towards him, demanded if I brought him the firſt news of his death,; to whom I anſwered, that my comming was not to afflict him, but to let him know, that in my opinion he could doe much better, to give way a little to my Ladies paſſion, then to ſubmit himſelfe to her cruelty; ſhe is preparing, ſaid I, horrible torments, avoyd them, I beſeech you, ſince you may, and be not ſo cruell to your ſelfe, as to become your own Murderer. How, replyed he, yeeld to the affection of ſuch a Monſter! Lady, if this be the end your diſcourſe ayms at, I muſt needs let you know you looſe your labour; ſhe thinks to affright me with the threats of puniſhment, and I am reſolved to endure them all even to death, than in the leaſt meaſure to ſatisfie her deſires. You are then ſaid I, either very faithfull, or elſe too wilfull in your opinion; Neither the one nor the other, anſwered he, for I cannot acknowledge my ſelfe guilty of any wilfulneſſe, in refuſing the imbraces of an old carkaſſe, the very ſight whereof is a terrour to me: neither doe I decline them to keep my affections entire to any Miſtris, my ſoule as yet being free from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any beauty whatſoever, and if I did to her uſe this diffimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was only in hope to eſcape by that means out of her hands, but ſince that and all other ſhifts faile me, let fortune diſpoſe of me as ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. You refuſe her then, ſaid I, becauſe ſhe is not beautifull. Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, for that only reaſon, but if I ſhould deſire to have any intereſt in her, I could wiſh for my own ſake to ſee her deformities changed into your perfections.</p>
                     <p>Vpon theſe words (to acknowledge the truth; and my own weakneſſe) thoſe firſt ſparkes of love, which his ſight onely had before kindled, did ſo inflame my heart, that laying aſide the conſideration of modeſty, which ought never to be ſeparated from a young Lady, I ran haſtily and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17218:274"/>
him, promiſing him withall, to deliver him upon any conditions, though never ſo dangerous: Then leaving him ſomewhat comforted with the hope of eſcaping, I went to ſeeke <hi>Gargaracia,</hi> to whom I reported that the Knight began to ſpeake a more pleaſing language, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, her courteous entertaynment would prevaile much more with him than her cruelty; wherewith ſhe being not a little ſatisfied, gave me commiſſion to conduct him into a Chamber, wherof ſhe her ſelfe kept the key, to whom notwithſtanding I had acceſſe twiſe a day, faining continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſome excuſe or other, by means whereof I enjoyed ſweetly the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of this young Knight, ſtill keeping <hi>Gargaracia</hi> in a firm opinion, that ſhe ſhould ere long have the full fruition of him, ſo that we led a life full of content and happineſſe, in the midſt of miſery.</p>
                     <p>But that improvident paſſion, which blinds the eyes of all Lovers, ruin'd us alſo, even then when we had invented a way, how to eſcape and ſave our ſelves: for I going this morning to viſit him, and forgetting to make faſt the doors, left a paſſage open, through which <hi>Gargaracia</hi> eſpied us, in the hight of ſuch amorous dalliance, as Love uſeth to ſuggeſt unto thoſe, whoſe hearts ſhe hath already united, which put her into ſuch a rage, that forthwith ſhe advanced towards us, intending with her ſtrong boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hands to bind us both, had ſhe not been prevented by the Knight, who with his firſt blow ſtruck her to the ground, with a reſolution to ſtrangle her, had ſhe not ſuddenly called for ſuccour; I ſaved my ſelfe among the Souldiers, who being ignorant of what had paſſed, ſought not at all to ſtay me, and ſo croſſing theſe fields, uſed the beſt diligence I could to fly from thence, to the end that I might not again fall into the hands of that pittileſſe woman, and to ſee if it might be my good fortune to meet with ſome charitable Knight, that would undertake the reſcue of this poor Gentleman, who queſtionleſſe by this time is very neer the flames, for the cruell Hag ſuppoſing fire to be the extremeſt of puniſhments, hath taken order that he ſhall be ſuddenly caſt into it.</p>
                     <p>Faire Lady, ſaid <hi>Fulgoran,</hi> comfort your ſelfe, and be aſſured of the Knights ſafety, if we can but arrive ſoon enough to find him living; then putting ſpurs to their horſes, they preſently came before the Gates of the Caſtle, where they ſaw thirty ſouldiers comming forth to lead this Knight to the fire; whom <hi>Fulgoran</hi> knowing to be <hi>Cilinder,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Dorigel,</hi> King of the fortunate Iland, of whom there had been no news heard ſince he received his order of Knighthood at Conſtantinople, he preſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with an incredible violence, and cleaving down to the girdle five or ſix of thoſe that incompaſſed him, put the reſt into ſuch a fright, that on a ſudden they all left him, which <hi>Fulgoran</hi> perceiving lighted from his horſe to unlooſe the cords wherewith he was bound, deeming the force of <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> alone, ſufficient enough to cut the reſt of the raſcals into a thouſand peeces; and indeed this noble Warriour made ſo great a maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre amongſt them, that in halfe an houre, he layd eighteen dead at his feet, which <hi>Gargaracia</hi> ſeeing to her great griefe, and hoping to fare no better than her Champions, caſt her ſelfe immediately into that fire, ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for <hi>Cilindor,</hi> who preſently knowing <hi>Fulgoran</hi> and <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> gave them a thouſand thanks for his deliverance.</p>

their number, divided their troups with an intent to environ them, and to charge them on every ſide, but thoſe valiant Knights not affording them the leiſure to put their Deſigne in practiſe, broke thorow them with ſuch a tempeſt, that the blood ran along the ground in little rivers, which put the incenſed Pagan <hi>Brufaldor</hi> into ſuch a fury, that turning his horſe upon <hi>Leonidas</hi> of Meſopotamia, he gave him ſo violent a ſtroke on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that his ſword notwithſtanding his Arms, made way to his very waſte, dividing his body into two parts; which ſo diſpleaſed <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> who ſaw the ſad effect of the blow, that claſping his ſword faſt in his hand, he returned the Pagan ſuch an exchange, as cutting his ſhield in two, he gave him a great gaſh on the arm, and ſo quiting him he flew upon <hi>Moranteon</hi> Soldan of Circaſſia, wounding him very dangerouſly on the ſhoulder, and perceiving <hi>Brizardan</hi> grapling with his friend <hi>Cilindor,</hi> whom he doubted might be too weak to fuſtain ſo ſtrong a charge, he made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with an intent to diſcharge full on <hi>Brizardans</hi> head, but <hi>Toriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> the valiant Pagan prevented his blow, by giving him ſuch a ſmart ſtroke on the arm, as made his ſword fall out of his hand, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other harme, ſave onely a ſlight hurt, which put him into ſuch a choler, as ſuddenly taking hold again on the handle of his ſword that was faſtned with a riband to his wriſt, he let it fly in ſuch ſort at his Adverſary, that he cut him almoſt in two pieces, ſending him dead to the ground.</p>
                     <p>In the middeſt of theſe hurliburlies, the brave <hi>Eſquilan</hi> entring on the other ſide of the Campe, ſtrook no leſſe aſtoniſhment into the minds of thoſe that encountred him, than the other had done before; no reſiſtance could withſtand the fury of his ſword. <hi>Brandimanda</hi> ſeconded him with equall heat and courage, and the gentle Amazon <hi>Alterea</hi> followed them both ſo cloſe, that ſhe ſeemed to threaten no leſſe a ruine than the former.</p>
                     <p>At this new alarum <hi>Falanzar, Idatcan</hi> Emperour of Melly; <hi>Armandor,</hi> King of Ruſſia, with <hi>Fieraſtron</hi> the proud Gyant of Balivan, advanced themſelves in the head of forty thouſand men; but the fear of thoſe that ran away, having put their ſouldiers which they led into diſorder, the Greeks charged them with ſuch fury, that more then ſix thouſand of them were beaten down; the greateſt part wherof were ſtifled under the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes feet. The unpleaſing ſight of this accident had driven <hi>Falanzar</hi> into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but that he earried too generous a mind, for to harbour ſo baſe a gueſt, wherfore meeting with <hi>Eſquilan,</hi> he diſcharged ſo terrible a blow on his Helmet, as he made him knock his chin againſt his breaſt, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much aſtoniſhed at the mighty ſtrength of this Pagan, but grinding his teeth together for anger, he advanced his ſword, and let it deſcend with ſuch a rage on this Caliph, that he overthrew him on the crupper of his horſe, caſting out great abundance of bloud at his mouth.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, <hi>Brandimanda</hi> and <hi>Fieraſtron, Iaalcan,</hi> and the gentle <hi>Alterea,</hi> charged one another home, and made a quick exchange of moſt fierceſtroaks. But <hi>Eſquilan</hi> who would not afford them any leiſure to rally their troups, and who judged that to be no fit ſeaſon for him to be a ſpectator of a ſingle combat, let fall on <hi>Idalcan</hi> Emperour of Melly ſo furious a blow, that he cut his arm ſheere from his body, and at the ſame inſtant with another which he layed on <hi>Fieraſtrons</hi> head-piece, he quite deprived him of his ſenſes; which being done, he put his men into good order, and following the example of <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> who took the way that led

                     <p>Their Troupes then being ranged, and every Captain having received order to charge his Company, with the carriage of a certain number of ſcaling-ladders, the Army was divided into three bands, each conſiſting of one hundred and fiftie thouſand men; <hi>Falanzar</hi> led the firſt, with the which was <hi>Brufaldor</hi> King of Gedroſia, the proud Knight <hi>Araſtron,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Alceus, Mariſgolf,</hi> that terrible and mighty Gyant, twenty Knights of the beſt repute in the whole Army, and threeſcore Gyants: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was commanded by <hi>Aſtrurion</hi> the great Sultan of Brutacan, the good Knight <hi>Armorand, Brizardon</hi> Soldan of Aralafia, fifty Gyants, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two other Knights, who had purchaſed a great renown by dangerous adventures: The third by <hi>Marmaran,</hi> Sophy of Bultara, with King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandor,</hi> of Ruſſia, of the Gyants race; <hi>Palamedes,</hi> King of Caſſandria, the redoubted <hi>Tipheus, Barcandor,</hi> fifty Gyants, three and twenty Knights, of no mean eſteem, and <hi>Broncaldion,</hi> King of the Arcofibrats, who had the leading of twelve hundred Elephants.</p>

                     <p>Great Monarch, replyed <hi>Marmaran,</hi> Sophy of Bultara, the propoſition you make, is ſo good, that there need no reaſons be urged for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing your opinion, and I dare aſſure you, that it agrees with the deſire of the whole Army, let us then if you pleaſe ſend to our enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a truce for eight dayes, that in the mean time time we may put every thing in good order, and to give the King of Grifala, and the reſt of our friends leiſure to recover their ſtrength, that they may be the better able to doe you ſervice: Hereupon <hi>Polidarchus</hi> King of Amazia, was intreated to take the charge of delivering this meſſage to the Chriſtian Princes,

                     <p>On the one ſide the Gyants made huge maſſacres; <hi>Eſquilan, Brandiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Grandimore,</hi> and the Chriſtian Princes, beſtird themſelves luſtily on the other, and their brave example made the courage of their men, ſupply what they wanted in number; ſo that above threeſcore thouſand Knights being ſlain both parts, the victory remained as yet doubtfull.</p>
                     <p>Wherupon the Pagans impatient of delay, cauſed their ſecond Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to advance, which being led by <hi>Marmaran,</hi> Sophy of Bultara, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thoſe incomparable Warriours, <hi>Bravorant,</hi> king of Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, <hi>Mariſgolfus</hi> and <hi>Gorgophon,</hi> Collonels of the Gyants, gave ſo fierce an aſſault upon the Chriſtians firſt Squadron, that they had cut them all in pieces, if the Emperour <hi>Spheramond</hi> had not opportunly oppoſed their furie.</p>
                     <p>By this time the ground was all covered with dead men, and the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo great, and crpes ſo loude, that a thouſand claps of thunder would not have been heard amongſt them: <hi>Bravorant, Gorgophon,</hi> and <hi>Mariſgolfus,</hi> having addreſſed their Launces againſt <hi>Galard</hi> King of the Barren Ilands, <hi>Alvida</hi> his Wife, and the Duke of Laiaret, they ran them quite thorow the body; and ſo did in like manner to five or ſix more, before they brake; but great was the ſlaughter they made, when as they hod drawn out their

                     <p>Nevertheleſſe being detayned by the only valour of <hi>Braverant, Gorgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and <hi>Mariſgolfus,</hi> and the brave <hi>Sophy</hi> of Bultara, who reſembled ſo many furies, they continued the fight ſo ſtoutly, that the blood made large Rivers through the midſt of the fields; the earth was covered with the bodies of thoſe that were already ſlain, and the ayr filled with the groans of thoſe that were then dying: <hi>Spheramond</hi> whereſoever he paſſed carried death on his ſword; <hi>Bravorant</hi> and <hi>Gorgophon</hi> ran up and down rayſing mountaines of dead bodies, <hi>Marmoran</hi> and <hi>Marifgolfus</hi> appeared like lightning: <hi>Alaſtraxerea, Melindus, Clidor, Caſsianus</hi> met with no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, unleſſe it were from the Gyants, who did often times as well as their fellows taſte the keeneſſe of the Chriſtian blades; In briefe it was a ſpectacle full of ſuch horrour, as the like hath ſeldome been beheld by the eye of man, and the ſlaughter ſo indifferent, that it was heard to ſay to which ſide the victory did moſt incline.</p>
                     <p>The Pagans who could not endure to be idle, whilſt their Companions were buſie in the purſuit of glory, marched up with their third ſqadron, conducted by the valiant <hi>Aſtrurion, Soldan</hi> of Brutacan, <hi>Antomedon</hi> the proud <hi>Caliph</hi> of Francapia, <hi>Brizardan, Soldan</hi> of Aralafia, and <hi>Mercelian,</hi> Emperour of Media: Theſe vaſt troops led by ſuch proud and mighty Commanders, fell on the Chriſtians with ſuch fury, as promiſed no leſſe then utter ruin at the very firſt onſet: But the Emperour of Perſia ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Lucendus, Dorogel, Silvian</hi> the faire Salvage, the noble <hi>Silverin</hi> of the Deſart, <hi>Gadard,</hi> King of Hungaria, <hi>Filadart</hi> of Polonia, <hi>Oriander</hi> and <hi>Oroncus</hi> charged them ſo fiercely, that made them quickly turn their faces to defend themſelves from the cruelty of their weapons.</p>
                     <p>This brave Prince encountring <hi>Antomedon</hi> with his Launce, ran him through the ſhield and arme; yet not without great danger to himſelfe, for from the Gyants Launce he received ſuch an encounter, as tumbled

cauſing ſuch meat to be ſet before them, as their Squires had provided, they began to feed as heartily, as if they had been feaſted at the tables of the Emperours of Gardacia, or Martaria, the Knights needed no lights, the place being illuminated by the faire eyes of their Miſtreſſes, and thoſe excellent Ladies did not a little comfort themſelves with the protection which their company gave them aſſurance of from all diſaſters that might occur.</p>

room, and would have gone further, if he had not there diſcovered the Centaure, who with a great club in his hand came to aſſault him; this fell object did rather rejoyce, than affright him that was uncapable of fear, ſo that he charged this Monſter with ſo fierce a blow, as he thought would have divided him in two, whereat he being little or nothing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, let fall his mercileſſe club with ſuch a might on <hi>Rozalmonds</hi> arme, as almoſt deprived him of the uſe therof.</p>

                     <p>This fortunate blow rendred him not a little contented, but he was forth-with marvellouſly aſtoniſhed, to ſee ſuch a multitude of Sepents ariſe from the bloud of this Monſter as covered all the roome, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with his ſword that never failed him, he cut half a dozen of them that were the forwardeſt to aſſault him in peeces; which begat a greater wonder, for theſe twelve peeces were transformed into twelve furious Lyons.</p>
                     <p>Then was this incomparable Warriour in no ſmall ſtreight, for (being environed and aſſaulted by all theſe Lyons, and feeling the Serpents twining about his legs, wherby he was ſo incumbred, as he had ſcarce any power to ſtir) he knew not from which to defend himſelf, nor upon whom to beſtow his blowes; he often lifting up his ſword above his head, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to let it fall againe with no leſſe force than would have cleft down a Gyant, but the Lyons being terrified with the glittering of his blade, inſtantly with their pawes ſeized on his arm, and ſo prevented the blow: In brief, he knew not what courſe to take, but was ſo full of rage, that he could almoſt have found in his heart to have converted his fury to his own ruine; nevertheleſſe, calling to mind his <hi>Armazia,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comforting himſelf with the remembrance of his wonted courage, and the happy ſucceſſe which he ever had in all difficult enterpriſes, he reſolved to quit his ſword, and clenching his fiſt let fall his Gantlet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of one of the Lyons with ſuch a force, as ſent him dead to the ground, which giving him hope of the like defeat upon the reſt, he layd

about him ſo furiouſly with both hands, that it was not long ere he ſent the reſt to keep company with the former.</p>
                     <p>Theſe dangerous enemies being diſpatched, he would willingly have taken a little breath, but the cruell war which the Serpents ſtill continued againſt him, offered him no leiſure, ſo that he laid his hand again on his ſword, and prepared for the ſlaughter of theſe troubleſome creatures; howbeit remembring that from their pieces had ſprung ſuch fierce and ravening creatures, he let it hang at his arm, and griping theſe Serpents in his hands, he ſtrangled them all one after another, but with ſo much pain and labour, that he was fain to fall upon his knees, not being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf any longer on his legs, this victory which had made him ſweat more than ever he had done in any Combat in all his life, giving him ſome hope of a lucky end, he ſat him down on the ground, where not ſtaying ſo long as to take breath, he ſuddenly aroſe, and going to a very fair Damoſell, which he ſaw come out of the cleft of a Wall, with an opinion that it was his deareſt <hi>Armazia,</hi> he ſaid unto her, ah Madam, what care and pains hath the loſſe of you coſt me, but I hold them all wel beſtowed, ſince they have been able to ſerve you, and that I find you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, after I had utterly deſpayred of your ſafetie.</p>

Madam, anſwered <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> (who began to ſuſpect her, and that knew well <hi>Armazia</hi> loved <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> better than to ſpeak ill of her) you may be confident that I will never prefer any thing on the earth before your contentment, but be pleaſed to conſider, that men are ſubject to a thouſand dangers, and that I ſhould not be in caſe to fight, if any new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould chance to arrive, whilſt my arms were in your hands, and what good will they doe you? Let me alone with them, I beſeech you, for to ſerve you; and to withdraw you out of this Cave with leſſe danger; It imports not you much to ſee me now, but much it concernes me to keep me as I am, wherfore you ſhall have that content, as ſoon as we ſhall be in any place where the Sun may aſſure me that I am in the world.

                     <p>This Champion deſiring to vanquiſh his enemy, who by no means would now come within the reach of his ſword, ſtruck at him a thouſand and a thouſand times in vain; where-with-all being very much wearied, and finding how that was not the way to prevaile, he held his ſword cloſe under his ſhield, and watching the Monſters next ſtooping to catch hold on it, he thruſt up his hand with ſuch fury, that he ran him quite thorow, and thorow, laying him dead hard by him.</p>
                     <p>This trouble ſome combat, which had laſted three houres, being glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly finiſhed, he ſate him down on the graſſe, where the remembrance of his Miſtris not permitting him to ſtay long, he aroſe and made towards the Grot, and in purſuit of his good fortune entring into it, he felt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrokes upon his ſhield and Helmet, that he had much adoe to keep himſelf on his legs; howbeit ſtanding ſtifly to it, and covering himſelf well with his ſhield, he laid about him with his ſword, though he ſaw no body upon whom he could faſten a ſtroke, yet feeling that he found reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that his blade did encounter Armour, now he gave a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right blow, then a thruſt, and beſtirring himſelf with marvellous fury, he ſtill made way; notwithſtanding, the more he advanced, the more was he preſt by his inviſible enemies, which ſo belaboured him, that to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance he never endured ſo much pain in all the combats he had fought before; his courage that never knew what danger meant, and that ſought for glory in the greateſt difficulties, made him redouble his blows, and goe on in deſpight of thoſe he did not ſee, till he ſaw himſelf freed from ſo furious a charge.</p>
                     <p>One would think now that our Knight had a great deale of reaſon to reſt himſelf, but the deſire he had to find out his Miſtreſſe, made him goe on without any ſtay, till he came to a great dore, againſt the which he ran ſo forceably with his foot, that it flew open, and gave him entrance into a very ſpacious roome, where at firſt ſight he was taken with much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for in the middeſt of it a cryſtall Coffer appeared, bordered about with twelve burning Torches, and twelve huge Pillars that ſupported the whole edifice, out of the which on a ſudden iſſued as many dreadfull Salvages, with each of them a mighty club in his hand, who ſtraight way aſſayled him on all ſides, but he received them in ſuch manner, that at the very firſt blow he layd one of them on the ground in caſe to doe him no harm any more, and flying in amongſt the reſt, he cut off three more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by the waſte; whereat the others being nothing diſmayed, layd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him like eight hammers upon an Anvill, wherewithall he was ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly battered, as his very bones ſeemed to be broken within his fleſh, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe hoping for no worſe ſucceſſe than he had found in his former dangers, he beſtirred himſelfe with ſuch fury amongſt them that he ran up one to the hilts, cleft another to the girdle, and the third had both his arms, togither with his club ſent to the ground.</p>
                     <p>This ſo ſudden an execution encouraging him to doe better, he valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17218:287"/>
purſued his good fortune, but comming to want breath, he went and leaned againſt one of the Pillars, that ſo he might have them all before him to fight withall, preſenting them his ſhield on the one ſide, and the poynt of his ſword on the other, he attended the approach of theſe furious and cruell creatures, which in ſtead of aſſaulting him, fell to make ſuch horrible cryes, that the very room ſhaked withall; by this means having opportunity to reſt himſelfe, hee continued about halfe an houre in that manner.</p>
                     <p>But preſſed with deſire to ſee the end of ſo many marvels, he advanced towards theſe Salvages, that with their clubs were ready to receive him, and reſolving either to dye, or vanquiſh, he caſt his ſhield behind his back, took his ſword in both his hands, and diſcharged it ſo dangerouſly upon one of them, as he divided his body in two, cleft another down to the ſhoulders, and ſo terrified the reſt, that they began to run all up and down the room, to avoyd the fury of his blade; nevertheleſſe being at laſt overtaken with incredible paines, two were overthrown dead upon the place; and the laſt threw himſelfe upon the great coffer of Chryſtall, where by ſignes he would have begged for life, but <hi>Alcidamant</hi> was in ſuch a rage, that without taking heed to what he did, he gave him ſo mighty a blow, as having cut him in two peeces, the poynt of his ſword fell ſo rudely on the coffer, that it broke it into a thouſand peices; whereupon there inſtantly enſued ſuch a terrible clap of thunder, that our Warriour fell down upon the floor quite voyd of judgement, where having lyen ſome two houres, as it were in a trance, he aroſe without ſo much as feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt wearineſſe of his paſſed labours, and beheld inſtead of the coffer, a guilt Cuirace enameled with red and green, and garniſhed in many places withgreat Diamonds, which rendred a marvellous luſtre, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and of ſo high a valew, as all the richeſt and braveſt Armes that ever he had ſeen were nothing in compariſon of this, hard by was a moſt ſtately Helmet of the ſame mettall and colour, as alſo a ſhield with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as was in his own; the deſire he had to poſſeſſe himſelfe of theſe Armes preſſed him ſo far that he was about to quit his own, for to put them on, but fearing ſome trick or inchantment, he began to conſider them with wonder, and to obſerve them ſo narrowly, as he perceived a ſcrole within the Cuirace, wherein this was written in the French tongue.</p>

                        <hi>Alcidamant</hi> make no difficulty to take theſe Armes, for they are due to thy merit, and above five hundred years before thy birth, they were made for theeby the moſt excellent Magicians of the earth.</q>
                     <p>Verely ſaid he then, I have no reaſon to make any further doubt, for my name that is here written, and the deviſe of the ſhield may well aſſure me; therewith doffing his own, he put on that excellent armour which he found ſo fit for him, that he was confident, it was made for his ſervice; whereupon being armed at all poynts, he looked round about him, and perceiving a large Alley, he entred into it, hoping to crown his deſignes with a happy concſiluon.</p>

                        </gap> is it poſſible that I ſhould behold her moſt inhumanely bound with cords, which might captivate all the world? Ah Madam, theſe villaines, ſhall not long continue the wrong they doe you, for I will puniſh them ſo cruelly, that if all the Gyants on the earth were aſſembled together, they ſhould learn what it were to lay hands on a creature of your merit; ſtay wicked wretches, and doe not thus tire ſo ineſtimable an excellence, ſtay I ſay, or elſe be ſure that I will cut you into a thouſand peeces; whilſt hee uttered theſe words, love and fury lending him wings, he ran with all his might, and made ſuch ſpeed, that within leſſe then halfe an houre he ſaw himſelfe upon the bank of a great pool, and ſo neer thoſe three Coloſſus, as he had the means to diſcharge a blow on the Helmet of him, that went hindmoſt, with ſuch fury that he cleft him down to the teeth.</p>
                     <p>At the noyſe of this terrible ſtroak, and the fall of that Gyant, the other two that were before drew forth their heavie Fauchions, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our valiant Warriour ſo rudely, as they made him reel very much aſtoniſhed three or foure ſteps back, but inſtantly calling to mind, that the ſafety of his Miſtris was in queſtion, for whom hee would have fought with all the world together, he inſtantly recovered himſelfe, and returning to his enemies, he began to ſhowre moſt horrible blows upon them, both one after another; nevertheleſſe they preſſed him in ſuch manner, and their ſtroaks were ſo heavy and thick, that if the armes he wore had not been framed by <hi>Vrganda,</hi> without doubt he had been in very great danger.</p>
                     <p>This Combat having continued two houres with ſtrange fury, the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were covered all over with bloud and wounds, and <hi>Clariſel</hi> began to grow feeble, by reaſon of the incredible travail which he had indured all the night long; but drawing new forces from the greatneſſe of his courage, and the hope he had of delivering his faireſt Miſtreſs, he took his ſword in both his hands, and with marvellous agilitie paſſing by two horrible blows, that deſcended upon him at one inſtant, he let his ſword fal with ſuch violence upon the ſhoulder of one of them, as he opened him to the very girdle, which poſſeſſing him that remained with more rage than fear, he diſcharged

                     <p>This dangerous wreſtling having continued an houre and better, to the exceeding diſcontent of <hi>Clariſel,</hi> who was vext to the heart, that he could not prevail, he became ſo furious, as making uſe of all his force, he thruſt the Gyant in ſuch ſort, that not able to make him let go his hold, they went both to the ground, where deſire of vanquiſhing animating them alike, they tumbled up and down ſo long together, till they fell both into the Poole, where being ſeparated he knew not how; our Warriour felt himſelf pulled by the feet, as if he ſhould be drawn into ſome precipice, and indeed he found himſelf in a Cave, where treading on the carkaſſes of men, he was marvellouſly aſtoniſhed, for that he perceived not the water to be any longer over his head, nor how he came there, for caſting his eye round about, and perceiving neither Window nor doore, he knew not what to think, nor ſay, at his being in ſo dark and hideous a place, from whence he had little hope to get out.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe, being uncapable of fear, he went groping by the walls ſome twenty or thirty paces, when as he chanced to hear moſt dreadfull hiſſings, whereat making a ſtop, he eſpied a furious Serpent of an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable greatneſſe, which ſcraping up the earth, ſtared upon him with two terrible fiery ſparkling eyes, able to terrifie any other leſſe confident than our Knight, who being lighted by thoſe two horrible torches, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented his ſhield to the clawes of the Monſter, and being guided by his good fortune, he thruſt him ſo juſt in one of his eyes, that his ſword entred three fingers deep into his head, which cauſed him to make ſuch ſtrange leapes and cryes, that all the place round about trembled again; and provoked by the ſmart of his wound, he flew with ſuch fury at <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> as overthrowing him to the earth, he ſet his teeth, and clawes to his ſhield, breaking it as eaſily in peeces as if it had been glaſſe, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therwith, he plucked ſo violently at his Helmet, as if he would have diſarmed him, for to devoure him, when as the Knight full of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and judgement in the middeſt of ſuch danger, gave him ſo ſore a hurt in the belly, that feeling himſelfe touched in this manner, he made a skip up to the very roofe of the Vault, and ſo ſuffered the Knight to ariſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, which was to good purpoſe for him, in regard that the dangerous creature lighting down preſently made at him with ſuch rage, as he could not poſſibly chooſe but have gone again to the ground, had he not wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declined him, wherfore retiring aſide with more agilitie than his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe ſeemed to permit, he let him paſſe by like lightning, and deſiring to make uſe of oportunitie, he diſcharged ſo mighty a blow full upon the body of him, as might well have divided an Anvile in ſunder, howbeit his ſword returned without effect, his ſcales being ſo hard, that it did not ſo much as make any dint in them, which at firſt ſomewhat amazed him.</p>

                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:17218:289"/>
Nevertheleſſe being ever moſt confident, where moſt difficulty appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he reſolved to ſtrike him no more in vain on the back, but to try his belly, and accordingly when this furious Serpent returned, he cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly attended him, and beholding him rayſed up on his tayle, he thruſt his ſword ſo ſtrongly at his breaſt, that he ran him up to the very hilts, yet could not that keep him from being overturned again to the earth by this terrible creature, which in the pangs of death ſo cruſhed him with his clawes, and the weight of his body, as he thought he ſhould have died before he could have cleared himſelfe, but the greatneſſe of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage would not ſuffer him to continue long in that manner, for quickly ridding himſelfe of ſo heavie a burthen, he withdrew into a corner of the Grot for to let the Serpent dye, which ſtormed ſo horribly, as the Cave ſeemed to fall into ruine.</p>
                     <p>Halfe an houre being paſt with this dreadfull noyſe, a generall ſilence ſucceeded, whereby <hi>Clariſel</hi> judging that the Monſter was dead, followed the wall as before, ſo long till he felt a doore, upon the which having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all his ſtrength, both with his feet, and the pomell of his ſword, he brake it open, and then entred through it into a ſpacious room, alongſt the which he perceived thirty very faire Damoſels comming who cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſaluting him, he was incouraged to ſay thus unto them; Ladies, the honour you doe me, doth very much oblige me, but you would adde much unto this favour of yours, if you would tell me any newes of an incomparable beauty, which was moſt unfortunatly ſtolne from me in a certain Forreſt here by. Wee will give you this content, anſwered one of them, but Knight, it muſt be upon condition that you promiſe us what we ſhall demand of you. If it be in my power, anſwered <hi>Clariſel,</hi> aſſure your ſelves, Ladies, you ſhall not be denied; That which we deſire is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, that you put off your Helmet and kiſſe us one after another in way of ſalutation as the manner is, and that alſo you will lye with each of us one whole night together. Your demand, anſwered <hi>Clariſel</hi> (exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended with this ſha meleſſe ſpeech) being repugnant to the faith which I have plighted to my Lady, be pleaſed to diſpence with me if I do not ſatisfie your requeſt, which in plain termes ſeemes not very honeſt unto me. How now, wicked wretch, ſaid the Damoſell, doe you reproach us to our faces, after you have violated your word to us? come ſirs, lee us make this inſolent Knight ſee that we are able to revenge our ſelves when we are wronged; Here with they all of them took out rods from under their coats, &amp; environing the Knight, began to whip him ſo cruelly, that their blowes which fel upon his Armour, were no leſſe weighty than the clubs of the ſtrongeſt Gyants of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Our Champion ſeeing himſelfe intreated after this manner, was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly abaſhed, for though he had his ſword in his hand, yet durſt he not uſe it againſt them, becauſe they were women; on the other ſide feeling all his body battered with multitude of ſtroaks, he was mightily vext, and could not tell what to doe; for as ſoon as he avoyded the hands of ſome of them, he found others preſently at his ſhoulders, and how to get from them he knew not, in regard they had planted themſelves ſo cloſe together, round about him, that they ſtood as ſtrong as a wall; in the mean time their battery continued, and the Knight found himſelfe in worſe caſe then he was, under the dreadfull blows of <hi>Zorobalan,</hi> and his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17218:289"/>
brother in great Britain, ſo that being conſtrayned to reſolve upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, he held his ſword over his head, and running with his ſhield againſt them in a ſtrange fury, he ſuddenly layd five or ſix of them on the ground, which making him way to advance forward, he laboured to gain a porch that he beheld on his left hand, but the reſt preſently overtaking him, he fell into his former ſuffering; whereupon doing as he did before, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby overthrown a dozen more of them, he got nine or ten paces forward, where feeling the violence of thoſe blows, to be far greater than at the beginning, he became ſo incenſed, that ruſhing forth with all his force, he paſſed to the entrance of the porch, in deſpight of them all; where thinking himſelfe ſafe, becauſe they were vaniſhed away, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Knight in black Armes make towards him, who without telling him wherefore, ſaluted him with ſo terrible a blow on his ſhield, as made him ſet one knee to the ground, which ſo inraged him, that taking his ſword in both his hands, he diſcharged it with ſuch a tempeſt on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as made him fall all along, beleeving that he had made an end of him; nevertheleſſe, he ſaw him riſe up inſtantly again, and make at him with a ſtrange fury, as if he would be throughly revenged, but viewing that dreadfull blade aloft in the ayr, he recoyled to the end of the porch, where <hi>Clariſel</hi> having ſtrucken him with all his ſtrength, he ſent him to the earth, which ſwallowed him up with a moſt fearefull noyſe, leaving our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour amazed at ſo many wonders, and exceedingly contented to behold a very ſtately Court, towards which he addreſſed himſelfe with an aſſured hope to ſee a ſucceſſefull iſſue of his Enterpriſe.</p>

                     <p>Then it was that he verely beleeved, that the end of his dayes was come, wherefore aſſuring himſelfe that the bottome of the Lake ſhould be his Sepulchre; he beſtowed his firſt thoughts in bewayling his eternal ſeparation from his Lady, and his laſt in repenting his ſins; but hee was marvellouſly aſtoniſhed to find himſelf in a round Hall very ſumptuouſly built, and ſuſtayned with twelve huge Arches, in the midſt whereof hee beheld a dozen of Monkies making ſuch ill-favoured faces, and playing ſuch gambals, as notwithſtanding the height of his diſpleaſure hee could not chuſe but laugh; howbeit this contentment laſted not long, for hee preſently perceived thoſe little creatures transformed on a ſudden into ſo many furious Buls, of a prodigious greatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>This unexpected metamorphoſis, counſelling him to draw his ſword, he began with it to ſtand upon his guard; when as they all ran together at him with ſuch rage, that inſtead of overthrowing him to the ground, they hurled him up into the ayr, and then ſo toſſed him with their hornes from one to another, that hee made ten or eleven turnes before ever he came to the ground; whereby, though his armour could not be pierced, his fleſh and his bones were mightily bruiſed: The Knight ſeeing himſelfe blanketed in this ſort, thought he was in no leſſe danger, then when he was on the water, and was exceedingly grieved for that hee could not make uſe of his ſtrength and valour; but the moſt couragious reſolutions are ordinarily found in the greateſt dangers, he took hold of one of theſe Buls horns, and ſetling himſelfe on his back, claſped his ſides faſt with his knees and legs, caught up his ſword that hung at his wriſt, and ſetting ſpurs to him, made him ſerve in lieu of an horſe to combat the reſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing his ſword then, he diſcharged it ſo dangerouſly upon one of them, that he divided him in two, and continuing ſuch horrible blows, layd four of them on the ground within leſſe then an houre, the reſt with dreadfull bellowings ſo butted him on the thighes and back, that he was in extream payn; nevertheleſſe chooſing rather to dye than not to vanquiſh, hee ſo beſtirred himſelfe amongſt them, that he extended the reſt of the eleven dead at his feet; and becauſe that, upon which he was, troubled him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely by not giving him leiſure to alight, hee took his ſword in both his hands, and let it deſcend with ſuch force on his head, that having cleft it

                     <p>This dangerous combat being finiſhed in this ſort, our Warriour ſate him down upon one of the dead Bulls to take a little breath, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream deſire he had to meet with ſome one that might tell him newes of what he ſought for, not permitting him to take much reſt; he got out tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a very little dore, and found himſelfe under a rock, from whence iſſued a very cleere Fountain, by the which having eſpied <hi>Palmirenna</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he made towards her with incredible joy, but ſhe perceiving him comming, roſe ſuddenly up and began to run away, as if the feare of ſome miſchiefe had made her fly from the Knight, who much amazed knew not what to ſay to it, but imagining that ſhe did not know him, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after her, crying as loude as he could,</p>

                     <p>This blow ſucceeding according to his deſire, he was going to ſet upon the reſt, but being firſt laid hold on by them, he was overthrown to the ground; where keeping him down under their cruell clawes, they began to ſet their teeth to his Armour, thinking to devour him very eaſily; but our Knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Knights, anſwered one of them, we could ſoon let you ſee them you aske for, if you were in this Garden; but the way to come hither is ſo difficult, that you ſhall not be able to obtayn that contentment, if you be not the prime Knights of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Gentlewomen, ſaid <hi>Grain,</hi> it were a vanity for us to be perſwaded that we were any of thoſe, the beſt in the world; but thus much we will promiſe that we wil with courage undertake, that which a Knight may performe; &amp; to come where you are, though we ſhould paſſe through hel to it; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire that you wil be pleaſed to ſhew us the way. I know not, ſaid the Damoſel, whether your actions will be anſwerable to your words; but to give you cauſe to adventure your ſelves, look here, ſaid ſhe (ſhewing <hi>Penamonda</hi> of Greece, and the gentle <hi>Adelazia</hi> at one of the cranies tyed with cords) theſe I think are thoſe you ſeek for, they ſhall continue in this eſtate, untill you free them from their bonds, and ſave them from greater puniſhment, which they are to ſuffer, if your valour be wanting to them at this preſent: What, ſaid the King of Corolandaya, equally ſeized with joy and griefe, ſhall we want courage in ſuch an Enterpriſe? Be aſſured, Gentle-woman, that we will be chopt into a thouſand peeces, rather then fayle in their need, onely doe but tell us where we may get in; Through a gate faid the Damoſel, which you ſhall find about an hundred paces from hence; the ſame ſhall ſhew you two wayes, let each of you take that

where into his fortune ſhall direct him, without returning for my conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration what ſoever.</p>
                     <p>Here upon theſe two valiant Champions advancing forward, met with the Gate the Damoſel ſpoke of, and couragiouſly entring into it they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed two little pathes, the right <hi>Griolanis</hi> took, and <hi>Grian</hi> the Salvage the left, which lead him to a cave, where a number of lighted torches hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the top of the roofe, plainly diſcovered the ground unto him, ſo covered with the poynts of ſwords, pikes, halbards, and partizans ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upright, that was impoſſible to make a ſtep without treading on the ſharpe ſteel, which ſomewhat troubled him at the firſt; nevertheleſſe being aſhamed to make a ſtop at any difficulty, having been ſo charged to the contrary by the Damoſel, he ſtoopſt down to pull them up, as the beſt meane to paſſe along; but juſt as hee took hold of an Halberd it ſprung out of the earth, and hit him with ſuch violence on the breſt, that it turned him over and over; where withall being much incenſed he aroſe, ſet his foot in the voyd place, where the halberd had ſtood, and feixing with each hand the poynt of a ſword, felt himſelfe hit as before, with ſo great force, that he had again been overthrown, had he not ſtood ſtifly to it.</p>
                     <p>Having then room enough to place both his feet, he was going on to doe as he had begun, when as a mighty noyſe ſuddenly riſing, he beheld all thoſe poynts to come out of the ground, the torches in an inſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringuiſhed, and without ſeeing any body, felt himſelfe charged with ſuch a tempeſt, as he was a long quarter of an hour on his knees, being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bow under an infirmity of heavie blows layd upon his ſhield, his ſhoulders, and his head; but chooſing death rather than to faile in his enterpriſe, he aroſe in a rage, began to cut thoſe pikes, partizans, halberds, and ſwords aſunder, and by little and little gayning ground, ſometimes flung his blade furiouſly about his head, then gave a down-right, and by and by a croſſe blow; briefly, he skirmiſhed in that manner, as if he had had a thouſand Knights in head againſt him. This dangerous combat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continued above two hours, with ſo much paine and labour, as a Knight leſſe ſtrong and valiant, could not have endured it; hee met with certain ſteps; upon the firſt whereof having but ſet his foot, this ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a charge ceaſed, which gave him leave to fit down on the ſecond ſtep, ſo much out of breath, that he was faine to lift up the viſier of his helmet to take in ayr.</p>
                     <p>This while <hi>Griolanis</hi> was no leſſe perplexed, for he likewiſe came to a cave full of lighted torches; but his adventure was far more pleaſing than <hi>Grians;</hi> for he found the ground covered with exceeding fair women, which lay ſtarke naked ſo cloſe one to another, that he was of neceſſity to tread upon their bellies if he would paſſe on, whereat he was no leſſe abaſhed, then his companion had been at the ſight of the pikes and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, ſo as he remayned a pretty while in ſuſpence, not knowing what to reſolve; and that which put him more into confuſion was to heare theſe women, who one after another ſaid thus unto him. Cruell Knight, what mean you to doe? will you adde unto our miſery, and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to behold us in a torment, far worſe than death, will you increaſe it by treading on our tender naked bodies? be moved with our tears, take another way we beſeech you, and performe your enterpriſe without our paine; could you be contented to remember another day, that you have

been the deſtruction of an hundred Gentlewomen which never offended you? The remorſe wherof queſtionleſſe would torture your conſcience, nor would you ever look upon a woman, but it would extreamly grieve you, to think that you had been wanting in pitty to them.</p>
                     <p>This ſpeech very much diſquieted <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and he was upon the point to have quit them, and undertaken his Companions way, had he not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mind that his Lady would then remain eternally in bonds, and that he had been adviſed to paſſe on notwithſtanding any conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, wherefore thinking that he might without hurting theſe women, paſſe along by lifting them up one after anotheer, he took the firſt by the arm, and ſet her on her feet, which was no ſooner done, but ſhe gave him ſo terrible a blow with her fiſt on his Helmet, that in his opinion a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt could not have hit him with more violence; How now Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ſaid he, is this the recompence of my good will? forbear I pray you, and let me deliver your fellows: wherwith not able to appeaſe her, that ſtill continued beating him, he reſolved to ſpend no more time in words, but took up the ſecond, by whom he was entreated as by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo proceeding to lift up thoſe that were next, he received ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blows on his head, breaſt, and back, that he had much adoe to keep himſelfe on his legs: nevertheleſs, what is not feazable for a valiant man, that deſires to draw his Miſtreſſe out of ſo grievous a captivitie, as that wherein he had ſeen his <hi>Adelazia?</hi> His courage augmented with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and though his fleſh and bones were all battered and bruiſed, yet he laboured ſo long, that he rendred the paſſage free, and had no ſooner ſet his foot on the firſt ſtep of a paire of ſtayres that he beheld before him, but immediatly theſe women vaniſhed, leaving him in reſt, wherof doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had as much need as <hi>Grian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two Warriours then having ſate awhile aroſe, and going up a matter of twenty ſteps entred juſt both together into a ſtately garden, and meeting at a Fountain, where they were about to have refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a little water, they perceived a kennell of hounds of divers colours, comming along behind two huntſmen, wherof one of them ſaid unto them in an arrogant manner; Wretched Knights, who brought you hither without my permiſſion, and how dare you be ſo bold, as to meddle with the water of my Fountain? be ſure that you ſhall pay for your preſumption; goe, ſaid he, ſpeaking to his Dogs, fall upon theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious fellows, and devoure them in ſatisfaction of their crime; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon theſe two valiant Warriours turning about to defend themſelves, ſaw no Dogs, but fifty or threeſcore Tygers, that having invironed them, flew upon them with ſtrange fury, ſome bit them by the legs, ſome ſeized on their ſhields, and ſome hung on their backs, briefly they were ſo cloſe preſſed by them, as at firſt they were not able to uſe their Swords, but breaking from them in a mighty rage, they began to deale ſuch deſperate blows, that in leſſe than an houre they had laid twenty at their feet, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the reſt becomming more cruell, aſſaulted them in ſuch manner, as if their arms had not been of the beſt in the world, theſe troubleſome beaſts had drawn blood from them, in an hundred places, but turning back to back, and renewing the fight with incredible courage, within two houres they made an end of the reſt; howbeit they were ſo weary, that they were conſtrained to fit down and reſt them, where with wonder they

obſerved how all about the Garden there were Statues of Marble placed, of ſeverall colours, ſo well done, as they wanted nought but ſpeech, and that the Fountain with moſt admirable art, ſent forth water on every ſide; the deſire they had to know wherfore all this coſt was beſtowed there not permitting them to reſt any time, they aroſe, looked round about them, and deſcrying no paſſage out, they reſolved to compaſſe the Wall till they met with one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Griolanis</hi> went one way, and <hi>Grian</hi> another, wherein being raviſhed with the marvellous things they encountred, they were an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could compaſſe it, at the end wherof, and at ſuch time as they were not far from one another, they met with two great Pillars, upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which, was a Table hanging, where in the Greek tongue was this written;</p>
                     <q>Knight, if thou wilt paſſe into the Caſtle of Treaſure, and find that which is loſt, cut down this Pillar, and be not diſmaid at the difficulties thou ſhalt meet with in the alley.</q>
                     <p>Theſe words having ſhewed the Knights how they ſhould bring their enterprize to paſſe, they with their Swords laid at theſe Pillars, which at the very firſt blow going to pieces with a moſt dreadfull noyſe, out came two Salvages upon <hi>Griolanis,</hi> and two furious Lyons on <hi>Grian,</hi> who ſeizing on him with their pawes, laboured to pull his ſhield from his arm, but our Warriour diſcharged ſuch a blow upon one of them, as he laid him dead at his feet, and a little after ran the other up to the hilts; in the mean while <hi>Griolanis</hi> more couragious than ever he had been in his life, out of hope which he was in, to find out his Miſtreſſe after this Combat, had cleft one of the Salvages down to the waſte, and cut off the other by the middle; that done, they entred into one of thoſe alleys, which ended in a large Court of a moſt Sately Caſtle built trianglewiſe, and going along they felt themſelves ſo terribly pelted with a ſhowre of ſtones pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down upon them from a number of great trees that were planted on each ſide, as notwithſtanding they warded themſelves well with their Shields, they had much adoe to get unto the threſhold of two Gates which gave entrance to the Palace, the walls wherof were all of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie, Jaſper, black Marble, and Cryſtall.</p>

                     <p>Hereupon theſe Princes having careſſed one another, and made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relations of the ſtrange adventures that had befallen each one in this Enterpriſe; they reſolved all to paſſe on, and beholding three great pair of ſtayrs, they were going to aſcend them two and two together, when they perceived an old man with a great deale of Majeſty preſent himſelf; his habit was black and long, his beard white, his hair confuſedly ſpread upon his ſhoulders, in one hand a book, and in the other a golden wand, every one obſerving him; <hi>Amadis</hi> knew him to be the Prince of al Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, the great <hi>Alcander,</hi> a ſpeciall friend to the houſe of Greece, whereat being wonderfully glad, he went immediately and embracing him, ſaid. Oh father, how happily have we met with you, for to free us of a care that mightily troubles us; we have loſt that which we moſt eſteemed in the world, ſo that if we be not relieved by you, we are like to be the wretchedſt Knights living.</p>
                     <p>Excellent Princes, ſaid this honourable old man, after he had ſaluted them with a great deale of reverence, you have reaſon to be pleaſed with this incounter of me, ſeeing I am more your ſervant, than all the men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the world; but it is I that have the greater cauſe to rejoyce at your arrivall, having attended you here an hundred years, ſince I firſt gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the inchantments of this great Caſtle; you have this day done ſuch wonders as no other Knights could perform, which will make your valour to be ſpoken of eternally, and the difficulties which you have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted are ſo great, as they will hardly be beleeved, but infinite will be the prayſe for ſo many brave actions, and the profit which wil redound thereby to all Chriſtendome, that could not ſubſiſt without the end of this adventure, will render you ſo recommendable, that you ſhall be the object of future ages marvell: You doe not know what good you have done; wherefore it is fit that I declare it, to the end that you may be

the more couragiouſly prepared for the labours you are yet to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall be the means of reviving the great King <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, the excellent <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, <hi>Don Silves de la Silva, Ageſilan,</hi> and thirty Princes more of their blood, withdrawn by me out of the number of the dead, at the great battle of Aleppo, and hitherto conſerved ſafe by my skill, as alſo the unparragoned Knight of the Sun, with <hi>Claridian, Poliphebo, Roſicler, Clarimant, Rozabel, Helen</hi> of Dace, <hi>Claridiana</hi> and <hi>Claribel,</hi> whoſe marvellous acts have filled the world with amazement; and moreover the invinſible <hi>Belianis</hi> of Greece, <hi>Belforan, Fortiman, Doliſter</hi> of Nubea, <hi>Poliſta de la Silva, Policertes, Don Clarinel, Aſtridea, Periana, Furibond</hi> the brave Gyant, <hi>Saliverna</hi> without feare, and <hi>Hermiliana,</hi> being all ſuch valiant, and accompliſhed Knights, that I have laboured by my inchantments to keep them alive, untill ſuch time as Chriſtendome by their aſſiſtance and yours, may triumph over the greateſt number of enemies, that ever yet aſſaulted it: Is not this greater good, than can be expreſſed in words? without doubt it is, and be aſſured that the fame which you ſhall acquire hereby, ſhall ever live in the memory of men.</p>
                     <p>Touching the trouble you are in, for the carrying away of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes your wives, clear your minds of it, for they have been al this while, as now they are, ſafe from any ſuch violence: the Centaurs, which you ſaw, being only fanto ſmes, that I cauſed to appeare unto you, knowing full well that you would never have precipitated your ſelves, the one into a dreadfull flood, amidſt the horrours of a fearefull darkneſſe, and the other into an horrible Furnace; and briefly, that you would never have undertaken ſuch almoſt impoſſible things as you have atchieved, had not the hope of recovering your Ladies, made you contemne ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dangers; and for that only conſideration did <hi>Vrganda</hi> cauſe them to come along with you, whom you ſhall meet with again, as ſoon as you have finiſhed the adventure, which now conſiſteth alone in forcing theſe Princes, that I have named unto you out of the rooms, where they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, but without imploying your ſwords on them, or drawing drop of blood from them, which will not be effected without very great pains, but I am ſure it would grieve you to leave ſo glorious an Enterpriſe in ſo faire a way.</p>
                     <p>Ah father, ſaid <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> how ſtrange and mervellous is this, that you have recounted unto us, we thought that all theſe excellent Princes had been converted into duſt long agoe; howbeit, ſeeing they live we will moſt gladly render them unto the world if it be in our power, you ſay it will not be done without much labour, why we are reſolved to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe any whatſoever; wherefore be pleaſed, but to ſhew us how we may get to theſe rooms. Then <hi>Alcandar</hi> having appointed <hi>Rozalmond,</hi> and <hi>Don Clariſel,</hi> for the deliverance of <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, and <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece; <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and <hi>Griolanis</hi> for the Knight of the Sun; <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Grian</hi> for <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> hee cauſed them to aſcend three ſeverall pair of ſtayrs, whilſt he himſelfe remayned walking below in the Court.</p>

Amidſt this their dangerous wraſtling, <hi>Don Silves, Amadis d'Aſtre, Ageſilan,</hi> and the reſt fell upon them, and with their ſwords ſhowred ſuch an infinity of blowes upon their ſhields, that it made them almoſt deſpaire of effecting their enterprize, howbeit calling to mind the great <hi>Alcanders</hi> words, they ſtood ſtifly to it, and thruſt thoſe two great Knights along with ſuch force, as at length they ſet them out of the room, whither they inſtantly returned to lay hold on <hi>Don Silves</hi> and <hi>Ageſilan,</hi> who troubled them no leſſe than the others; nevertheleſſe, they were likewiſe born forth, and after them all the reſt, but with ſo much pain and labour, as queſtionleſſe theſe two Warriours had never prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had they not been prepared therunto by <hi>Alcander.</hi>

                     <p>Excellent Princes, now am I in the height of my content, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you thus reſuſſitated, as it were from death, I am notable to expreſſe the greatneſſe of my joy.

will not goe about to make any excuſe for having reteyned you here ſo long, ſince it was for your preſervation, and for the glory of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that by your aſſiſtance ſhall triumph over her enemies, onely I would deſire you to be friends, and not to ſtand upon the poſſeſſion of Empires, which you had, that are to remain in the hands of thoſe that now hold them, for the Crown of China is reſerved for you, ſaid he, ſpeaking to the Knight of the Sun, and that of Mexico attends <hi>Belianis</hi> of Greece, which are Empires great and mightie enough to take away the memory of others, ſo as having no cauſe to be troubled at this change, you may all prepare your ſelves with courage for thoſe bloudy wars, whereby the honour of the Croſſe ſhall be maintained in its excellency, and the Altars of the Pagans overthrown.</p>
                     <p>But now it is fit that I ſhould let you know, who theſe ſix brave War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours are, unto whom you are obliged for your deliverance.

I would adviſe you then, ſaid he, to advance no farther forward, the fields are all covered over with an hundred thouſand men, which after the ſurpriſe of Zeidan, have layd ſiege to Goraxa, one of the ſtrongeſt Towns of this Empire, and all the riches of the world could not ranſome you out of their hands, ſhould they once lay hold on you, which were great pitty, for by your countenances you appear more than ordinary men.

they laboured to ſave themſelves by flight, but the Inhabitants of the Town rallying themſelves, and finding them in diſorder charged them ſo rudely on the other ſide, that their fear increaſing, they were all cut in peeces, foure hundred onely excepted, who betaking them to their heeles, fled to the groſſe of their Army, and there ſo publiſhed the wonders which theſe Knights had done, that they beleeved them to be Divels.</p>

                     <p>The King of Arginaria returning with this anſwer, all the Pagans were marvellouſly aſtoniſhed at the name of <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, whom they thought had been dead long before, and underſtanding that he was the chief of them that had made way thorow their Camp with ſo great a ſlaughter, they beleeved that ſo many Princes were reſuſſitated to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them eternally; nevertheleſſe, their own pride perſwading them that the earth could not contain men that could reſiſt them; <hi>Falanzar</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Liſt to be drawn up of thoſe that were to Combat, and never going about to give them reaſons, for to render them the more courageous, he ſent them away to their Tents, there to take order that their Horſes, and Armes, might be well fitted for this furious fight. Let us give them time to make their preparations, and recount the brave actions performed by the Martarians: You may remember that the Emperour of Martaria be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Chriſtian, departed from Corolandaya, with <hi>Perſides</hi> of Greece; <hi>Floridan</hi> of Perſia, <hi>Lucibel</hi> of France; his Sons-in-law, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Seſtilian</hi> of Spain, ſervant to the faireſt <hi>Agiliana,</hi> Princeſſe of Arbales, to carry ſuccours to the Princes of Greece.</p>
                     <p>This great Monarch deſiring to manifeſt his zeale to the glory of the new God which he adored, and the eſteem that he made of the Princes of Conſtantinoples allyance, being fortunately arrived in his own Empire, made forth Commiſſions, cauſed an hundred thouſand Horſe, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Foot to be levyed, beſtowed moſt part of the Infantrie in five or ſix Frontier Towns, and levying twenty thouſand Horſe, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand Foot, under the conduct of the King of Arbales his Couſin, to withſtand all attempts of his neighbours, if they ſhould chance to ſtir in his abſence, he reſolved in perſon to conduct an Army of fourſcore thouſand Horſe into Aethiopia.</p>
                     <p>Having then accodingly imbarqued them with his Sons-in-law, and himſelf, he was carryed with ſo proſperous a gale, that having run along by the coaſts of Guinea, Cephala, and Calicut, in ſeven and thirty dayes he arrived within three leagues of Zeiden, where informing himſelf of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17218:299"/>
the ſtate of the War, he underſtood that <hi>Artogant,</hi> the Soldan of Franca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, being ſeparated from the body of the Army, held Goraxa very ſtraightly beſieged with great likelihood of carrying it, in regard it could not be ſuccoured without much prejudice to the Chriſtian forces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon putting his men in battell array, he marched toward Goraxa with a reſolution to charge the enemies, and accordingly, finding them prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to receive him, for that <hi>Artogant</hi> had been advertiſed of their diſcent, he cauſed <hi>Lucibel</hi> and <hi>Seſtilian</hi> to advance with thirtie thouſand Horſe, who incountring ſix Gyants in the head of forty thouſand men, they charged their Launces ſo luckily, as two of the Gyants were run thorow, and thorow.</p>
                     <p>The incounter of theſe firſt troops was very furious, and ſo many Knights were overthrown, that within leſſe than halfe an hour, the ground was all covered with them; <hi>Lucibel</hi> and <hi>Seſtilian,</hi> having broken their ſtaves in the bodies of the two Gyants, began to diſorder the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and overturning all that came in their way, they filled every part with ſuch fear, as the ſouldiers flying from the tempeſts of their ſwords, declined them more than they would have done the peſtilence; On the other ſide the four Gyants enraged at the death of their companions, made ſo great a ſlaughter, as was moſt lamentable to behold: In this ſort the fight became moſt cruell and bloody; and every minute ſo many men fell, that in the field was nothing but heaps of dead bodyes. Two hours being ſpent in the heat of this firſt conflict, and the victorie as it were hanging in equall ballance, there arrived ſix Warriours from Zeidens ſide, who underſtanding by an hurt ſouldier of all that had paſt, they fell in amongſt the Pagan troups, and began to make ſuch a maſſacre of them, as they were no leſſe dreaded, than all the Army beſides; they cut off arms and heads, cleft men down to the waſte, divided Knights in two, and the fury wherwithall they fought was ſo great, that they alone ſeemed able to deſtroy all the Pagan hoſt.</p>
                     <p>The Gyants perceiving this diſorder, went and ran all foure together, with ſuch confidence againſt thoſe ſix incomparable Warriours, as if they would eaſily have layd them in the duſt, but they were ſo rudely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, that two of them had their arms, ſwords and all, ſent to the ground, and the other two were cleft down to the teeth. Then it was that the Pagans, beholding ſo ſudden a defeat of thoſe foure Coloſſes, in whom they had placed all their hope, betook them to flight, ready to be cut all in peeces, had not the Soldan of Francapa come in to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour with ten Gyants, and threeſcore thouſand Horſe; The arrivall of theſe new forces having reſtored their courages, they turned head againſt the Chriſtians, and began to lay about them with incredible valour, but the Emperour of Martaria approching with <hi>Perſides,</hi> and <hi>Floridan,</hi> the fight began to be ſo hot and violent, that the face of the whole field was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with ſlaughtered carkaſſes, and the ayr ſounded nothing but cryes and lamentations of dying men; The Gyants did wonders, they cut and hewed down all before them, and keeping themſelves ſtill cloſe together, they made ſuch a miſerable havock wherſoever they went, as it was a ſpectacle of incredible horrour.</p>
                     <p>The Martarian Emperour deſiring to ſhew that he was a Chriſtian, ran without fear into danger, being guarded by the thundring ſwords of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</hi>

                        <hi>Floridan, Lucibel,</hi> and <hi>Seſtilian,</hi> who alwayes accompanied him, and the ſlaughter was ſo great whereſoever they paſt, that the Gyants being unable to arreſt their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This while the three Princes were in much danger amidſt ſo many Gyants, and being oppreſſed on ſo many ſides, they had little hope of eſcaping with life, when as thoſe ſix Champions that came from Zeiden incountring upon that place, fell in with the Gyants, and diſcharged their ſwords all at one inſtant with ſuch a tempeſt, that ſix of them ſunk down dead at the feet of the three beſieged Princes, who knowing thoſe ſix incomparable Warriours to be <hi>Rozalmond, Alcidamant,</hi> and their companions, were ſo far incouraged, that claſping their ſwords faſt in their hands, they delivered three ſuch horrible blows, as three of thoſe Coloſſes fell downdead on their fellows.</p>
                     <p>The Pagans nevertheleſſe being nothing diſmayed, ſtood very ſtoutly it, after the example of the <hi>Soldan</hi> of Francapa, who that day rendred marvellous proof of his force and courage, in ſo much that the Pagan Army being reſolutely bent to fight it out, were within three hours cut al in peeces, ſix thouſand only excepted, which with <hi>Artogant</hi> ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a wood, leaving the Chriſtian Princes with the loſſe of thirty thouſand men, whereof they were not much ſenſible, the rather for that the Emperour and <hi>Seſtilian</hi> were well recovered of their hurts. Having continued then ſome time to bury their dead, during the which <hi>Rozalmond</hi> and his friends had recounted the deliverance of <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, and of ſo many inchanted Princes, with all that had paſt in that adventure; The Emperour rayſed his Camp, and marched on towards Saba, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perplexed with thinking how he ſhould get to the Citie, by reaſon of the enemies lying round about it, but having learned of certain Courri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who had been ſent to ſeek <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> and his fellows, for to be of the number of the Combattants, that there was a truce between the Pagans and them, he quietly advanced without any impeachment to the gates of the Citie, where all thoſe great Princes did the Emperour of Martaria ſo much honour, and ſo careſſed thoſe excellent Knights, that came along with him, as cannot well be expreſſed in words; wherefore I will paſſe it over, and relate the combat betwixt the Chriſtian Princes, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Kings, for the determination of their wars.</p>

                     <p>Firſt of all there marched in excellent order fifteen thouſand Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons richly armed, and mounted on Vnicorns, whoſe furniture was all guilt over; a little after, but at ſome diſtance, rode nine other Amazons with golden Crowns on the top of their helmets; then followed a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot, carried upon twelve great wheels of Ivorie, and drawn by twelve Vnicorns, as white as ſnow, which being faſtned together with golden chayns, were guided by twelve little Dwarfs, apparelled in cloth of gold; the Chariot was of a marvellous faſhion, the length of it was fifty foot, the bredth fifteen; a ſumptuous Pavilion enameled with red and greene, covered the top of it; the two ſides were two Arches, whoſe roofs were inriched with a world of precious ſtones; againſt the back of it was a throne all ſet with diamonds, which ſparkled round about in a wonderfull manner: Therein ſate <hi>Azamandra,</hi> armed all over ſave her head and hands, with ſuch a majeſticall beautie, as amazed all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her; thirty Trumpets invironed this Chariot, continually ſounding with an admirable conſort, nine Amazon Queens followed cloſe after, and a good way off marched fifteen thouſand Amazons in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the firſt.</p>
                     <p>This excellent Princeſſe was received with all the honour that poſſibly could be done her, eſpecially by <hi>Falanzar,</hi> who being ſtrucken in love at the ſight of ſo rare a creature, kiſſed her hands, and ſaid unto her. Madam, I muſt beleeve that the gods have inſpired you to come hither, for to comfort us with your preſence, after ſo many loſſes as we have received: Great Prince, anſwered ſhe, it very much grieves me, that I have been ſo ſlack in bringing you this ſuccour, which now proves altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, in regard of the accord that you have made with your enemies; but if there remains a room yet in the number of the hundred, which you have choſen for the combat, let me intreat you to give it me, that I may

teſtifie the deſire I have to ſerve our gods, and to make tryal of my ſelf againſt the Princes of Greece, who are every where ſo cryed up with incredible applauſe. Madam, replyed <hi>Falanzar,</hi> it were a grievous ſin me-thinks to expoſe ſo precious a Jewell, as your incomparable ſelf, to the hazard of Arms; nevertheleſſe, ſince you deſire it, we will by no means oppoſe your pleaſure, whereon we will all of us abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; You ſhall tomorrow then have the prime place, and ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as you behold here, ſhall but ſecond the greatneſſe of your courage.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid ſo, he with the moſt part of the Pagan Kings conducted her to her quarter, and leaving her there, to refreſh her ſelf, and pitch her Tents, he aſſembled all his Commanders to his Pavillion, where having briefly remonſtrated unto them of what importance the next dayes fight would be, he deſired them to permit him to diſpoſe of the order that was to be obſerved in ſo dangerous an affair: wherfore having choſen fiftie of the ſtrongeſt Gyants, that were ſtil remaining in the Army, he nominated fourteen of the beſt Knights Errant of all Paganiſme, whoſe names ſhall be delivered hereafter, thirtie two Kings, and foure Amazonian Queens, with <hi>Azmandra,</hi> for the Combat. On the other ſide <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, upon whoſe care the Chriſtians altogether relyed, intreated the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Martaria, ſeeing his age did exempt him from the exerciſe of Armes, that he would be pleaſed to be Judge of their Combat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he having condiſcended, he ordained that <hi>Gelodan, Atletta</hi> his Wife, <hi>Aſtibel</hi> and <hi>Timbres</hi> of Aegypt; <hi>Oriander,</hi> the King of Catay; the Queen <hi>Caſtora,</hi> and <hi>Parmenian</hi> of Cyprus, ſhould be for the guard of the Camp; as alſo to ſee their men might ſtill be in readineſs for all kind of accidents, then finding that the reſt of the Princes there aſſembled, amounted to the number of an hundred, he commanded them to be all prepared againſt the next morning, which at length appearing, to the equall contentment of both parts, our Chriſtians heard Maſſe, and diſpoſed of themſelves, as men fitted for another world, whilſt the Pagans to render their gods favourable, offered a thouſand ſacrifices unto them.</p>

                     <p>Knights, I imagine that if fortune had favoured your deſignes, and that we had been in your power, as now you are in ours, you would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pleaſure to have made us ſuffer unworthy things for the ſatisfaction of your revenge, but we will let you ſee, that the Princes of Greece are gentlier diſpoſed, that they love not ſlaughter, nor bloud, neither doe at any time ſhed it, but when as they are obliged therunto, either for the maintenance of the order of Knighthood, or to defend themſelves from ſuch as doe aſſail them: your deſpaire hath made you decline the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, which we would have given you for the healing of your wounds, you ſhall goe and ſeek them where you pleaſe, to which end we ſet you freely at liberty, wherby alſo we deſire you ſhould know, that we never did, nor will fear the greatneſſe of your armes; If you ſhall be ſenſible of our courteſies, and ſhall at your return contain your ſubjects in peace, we ſhall be very glad of it, if otherwiſe it ſhall not much trouble us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having formerly commanded a ſhip to be rigged and victualled, he cauſed them to be carried aboard without attending any anſwer, letting

them goe to <hi>Gorgophons</hi> Iſland wonderfully amazed to find ſuch courteſie from enemies, that had been ſo exceedingly outraged, howbeit all this could not worke upon their hardned hearts, for they reſolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged at any rate whatſoever, and once more to turn the world upſide down.</p>
                     <p>This affaire being then expedited, <hi>Amadis</hi> accompanied with ſeven or eight of the Grecian Princes, that kept not their beds, went to viſit the beautifull Empereſſe of the Amazons, and did her ſo much honour, as ſhe repented the employing of her Armes againſt them. Soveraigne Prince, ſaid ſhe after a moſt gentle manner, I would not beleeve, that you and yours were every where invincible; nor could think that the applauſe, which the world gave you, were juſtly due to you, but having ſeen incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible effects of your matchleſſe valour, and found a generoſity in you, not common to other men, I ſay the world doth you wrong, not to erect Altars unto you; wherefore I beſeech you to paſſe by that which I have done againſt you, and to honour me ſo far, as to place me in the number of the trueſt friends you have. Great Lady, anſwered that magnanimous King, and bowing himſelfe for to kiſſe her hands, I doe no longer lament the loſſe we have ſuſtayned, ſeeing we have gotten ſo fair a thing, as your moſt excellent ſelfe; your deſire doth very much oblige us, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your commandements, ſhall alwayes be our uttermoſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Hereupon having intreated her to take a lodging with them in the citie, ſhe and the Queens her followers were conducted by him and the Princes thither, and were brought to <hi>Traſicleas</hi> Chamber, where all the other Princes were aſſembled, by whom being infinitely careſſed, both ſides ſtood amazed at each others beauties.</p>
                     <p>Shortly whereupon it grew to be a very great court; for <hi>Caſſandra</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving from Corolandaya, with all thoſe excellent Ladies, of whom we have ſpoken heretofore, and all the brave Knights being recovered of their hurts made up ſuch a royall preſence, that it much aſtoniſhed this fair Empereſſe; but when as <hi>Rozalmond, Alcidamant, Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond, <hi>Clariſel,</hi> and <hi>Griolanis,</hi> preſented themſelves for to kiſſe her hands, ſhe was ſo raviſhed with the ſight of their goodly perſonages, and gallant demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as ſhe could not forbeare ſaying openly, that now ſhe had ſeen all that the world had of moſt rare, a prayſe that bluſhing made theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proteſt they would ſerve her eternally.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt all was thus in joy, and tryumph, and that the Princes were talking of their own departure, and diſmiſſing of the Chriſtian forces, two ancient Knights entred into the hall in mourning weeds, which looking round about, at length went and kneeled before <hi>Traſiclea,</hi> who preſently knowing them, demanded what news they had brought from Trama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond. Very bad, Madam anſwered one of them, for being to acquaint you with the deceaſe of our Emperour, we are aſſured that naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will make you rather lament his death, than rejoyce to ſee your ſelfe Miſtris of his Scepter, which now doth attend you, and your faithfull ſubjects wiſh for nothing ſo much, as your preſence to appeaſe certaine troubles, ariſing from the ambition of the great Lords, that ſtrive for the government of the Empire; wherefore we moſt humbly beſeech you, in tender compaſſion of your poor people to reſolve upon as ſpeedy a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thither, as convenience will permit.</p>

At this ſpeech <hi>Traſiclea</hi> diſſolved into tears, and ſo bewayled the loſſe of her Father, that it pittyed every one to behold her; but after they had for a while given way to her ſorrows, the Princes endeavored all they might to comfort her, eſpecially <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> who deſired her to conſider, that the condition of all men was infallibly to dye, ſo that by degrees having aſſwaged her griefe, the King of great Britain propounded the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of her and <hi>Alcidamant,</hi> which two days after was ſolemnized on a ſcaffold, erected for that purpoſe, where in their richeſt roabs, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and ſhe two dayes after preſented themſelves on their knees, before <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> the Emperour of Martaria, <hi>Belianis</hi> of Greece, and the Knight of the Sunne, who with many ceremonies ſet two Imperiall Crowns on their heads, and cauſed them to be placed on two Thrones, where all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were preſent went and kiſſed their hands, except the Emperour, <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, <hi>Floriſel</hi> of Niquea, <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> and <hi>Spheramond,</hi> which kiſſed them on the cheek.</p>
                     <p>All theſe ſolemnities being finiſhed, <hi>Alcidamant</hi> and his Lady deſcended from their Thrones, when as the Emperour of Martaria cauſing ſilence to be made, ſpake thus. My Lords, the age wherein I am, more proper for reſt, than for the cares that wayt upon Kings, adviſes me to lay them all upon the Princes, which it hath pleaſed heaven to beſtow on my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; wherefore ſaid he, taking <hi>Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond, and <hi>Palmirenna</hi> by the hands, let theſe be placed in thoſe Thrones, as Emperours of Martaria; as for <hi>Floridan</hi> he ſhall be King of Orgalia, and <hi>Lucibel</hi> of Cleogena, two ſtates that hold of my Empire, wherupon taking the Crown from off his own head, he delivered it unto <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, who with <hi>Floriſel</hi> of of Niquea, <hi>Don Rogel,</hi> and <hi>Spheramond,</hi> crowned <hi>Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond in the ſame manner, as they had done <hi>Alcidamant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This done, the two new Emperours marching formoſt with their Ladies were conducted to the Palace with more magnificence than can be well expreſt, and the feaſt was far more ſumptuous than at any time before, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the which, all the young Princes waited upon <hi>Alcidamant, Amadis</hi> of Trebiſond, and their wives. The reſt of that day, and eight dayes after, were ſpent amidſt incredible contentments; at the end wherof every one preparing himſelf for his departure, <hi>Florimond</hi> of Canabea (that at the ſuit of <hi>Rozalmond</hi> had been ſent Ambaſſadour to the Emperour of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia by <hi>Spheramond,</hi> for to advertiſe him of <hi>Armazia's</hi> deliverance, and to deſire him, that he would be pleaſed to beſtow her in mariage on his Son) returned with this report, that having been marvellouſly careſſed by that great Emperour, he had noly approved of the match, but had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and ſent his Crown to <hi>Rozalmond;</hi> wherupon the former Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were renewed, and that brave Knight was Crowned by the two new Emperours, <hi>Prigmaleon,</hi> and the renowned <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule; Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and tryumphs were likewiſe revived with as much, or more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence than before, to the unſpeakable joy of all theſe Princes, and eſpecially of <hi>Fortiman</hi> of Greece, <hi>Belianis</hi> grand-child, who unable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the excellent beautie of <hi>Penamonda, Rozalmonds</hi> Siſter, without ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her, began to breath forth a thouſand amorous paſſions, wherof we will ſpeak more at large in our fourth part.</p>
                     <p>Theſe delights continued fifteen dayes together, during the which, the Chriſtian Army had been diſmiſt, and ſent away, all theſe Princes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

themſelves with many tears; <hi>Amadis</hi> of Gaule, <hi>Amadis</hi> of Greece, <hi>Don Silves, Clariſel</hi> of Guindaya, the valiant <hi>Eſquilan</hi> of Poland, and the beautifull Empreſſe of the Amazons, who would needs accompany them, went with their Wives to Conſtantinople; <hi>Floriſel</hi> of Niquea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Trebiſond with <hi>Falanges, Alaſtraxerea, Ageſilan,</hi> and his faireſt <hi>Diana; Don Rogel</hi> with <hi>Perſides,</hi> and <hi>Fulgoran</hi> into Perſia; <hi>Amadis d' Aſtre</hi> to the Empire of the Parthians, where the faire Infanta <hi>Roſiliana,</hi> was ready to expire with joy at his arrivall; <hi>Fortunian</hi> into France with <hi>Floriſel; Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalmond, Ruſsian,</hi> and <hi>Silverin</hi> of the Deſart into Gardacia; <hi>Amadis</hi> of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſond; <hi>Floridan</hi> and <hi>Lucibel</hi> with their Father-in-law into Martaria; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidamant</hi> with <hi>Traſiclea, Grian</hi> and <hi>Brandimanda</hi> to Tramizond; <hi>Griolanis</hi> and his beautious <hi>Adelazia</hi> to Corolandaya; <hi>Prigmaleon</hi> remained in Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia, untill ſuch time as his Subjects were ſomewhat better aſſured; The Knight of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Belianis</hi> according to the great <hi>Alcanders</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſet forth with their kinſmen towards China, and the Empire of Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; And all the other Chriſtian Princes embarquing themſelves, ſet ſaile for their own Countreys, where we will leave them to enjoy all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of peace for to finiſh this third Volumne, in the ſequell whereof ſhall be ſeen the adventures of <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> and of the Knight of the Sun, together with a continuation of the marvellous acts of <hi>Alcidamant, Rozalmond, Clariſel, Perſides,</hi> and other young Knights of Greece.</p>
