         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true diſcourſe of things happened
in the armie for <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and in
the winning of the Caſtle of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, forbearing
ſo farre as his honor and the duety of a
Prince that loueth peace and the good of
his Countrey could affoorde, was at the
laſt to his great griefe, forced to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to all meanes conuenient to bring
the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> to good order. The
ſaid Duke hauing taken from the crowne of France, and vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the <hi>Marquizat</hi> of <hi>Saluces</hi> in time of peace, in the dayes of
the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, his Maieſties predeceſſor of
happy memory, hath not reſtored the ſaid <hi>Marquizate,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the treatie and concluſion of peace made at <hi>Veruins</hi> in
the yeare 1598. betwéene his Maieſtie <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſecond late
King of Spaine, and the ſaid Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> neither as he
promiſed by the laſt agréement betwéene his Maieſtie and the
ſaid Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> made at <hi>Paris</hi> in February laſt. A matter
that hath mooued his Maieſtie to alter his purpoſe: declaring
to thoſe to whome it may concerne, that hauing attended the
ſaid Dukes reſolution, he was laſtly enforced to recouer the
ſaid <hi>Marquizate</hi> by force of Armes.</p>
            <p>The King therefore willing by vallour and in diſcretion,
not onely to preſerue that which appertaineth to the Crowne,
but alſo to recouer that which aforetime hath béene alienated,
did therevpon redemaund the <hi>Marquizate</hi> of <hi>Saluces,</hi> which
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d béene alienated, as is aforeſaid. But the Duke finding it to
be one of the moſt precious flowers of his garland, referred off
<pb facs="tcp:2750:2"/>
the King dayly for the reſtitution of the ſame: Whereby his
Maieſtie hauing expected it a yeare and a halfe, did neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
liue in hope according to the ſaid Dukes promiſe, to haue
had the ſaid reſtitution performed by the firſt day of June laſt
paſſed. But the King perceiuing that his elemencie engendred
ſo great contempt, ſent his ſolemne declaration to the ſaide
Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> therein proteſting that himſelfe was no cauſe
of the warre or breache of peace, but that full ill againſt his
will he vndertooke this warre, as knowing verye well that it
could not redound but to the ſaid Dukes vtter ruine &amp; decay.</p>
            <p>The King therefore, conſidering the premiſſes, did to his
great griefe (albeit he came not out of <hi>Paris</hi> to that intent) bring
his armie into <hi>Breſſe</hi> and <hi>Sauoy,</hi> where it ſoone ſhewed it ſelfe
with ſo many troopes, as prooued, that the Kings iuſt title or
quarrell carried that which to him did appertaine. The townes
and Caſtles neuer ſtood out any or very ſmall force, but yéelded:
ſo as the King in a very ſhort time pierced through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
euen to <hi>Mont-millan,</hi> where vpon his arriuall, he ſeized on
the towne, as likewiſe he did ſooneafter of <hi>Chamtery, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonniers</hi>
and other places, euen to <hi>Morienne,</hi> which he brought
vnder his obedience, in which places himſelfe was preſent, to
the great perrill and danger of his life.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus taken the towne of <hi>Mont-millan,</hi> he cauſed the
Caſtle to be ſummoned to yéelde, vnleſſe that they had rather
endure the furie of the Cannon. Howbeit, ſith they grew ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
the King deuided his army to beate it on euery ſide, and
cauſed his men to raiſe Baſtions, Fortes, Hilles, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes
with wonderfull pollicie to beate the place.</p>
            <p>This doone, it ſéemed, that albeit mans induſtrie could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
no more, yet all this was but as a Butte for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the ſaid Caſtle to leuell at: the place being of all men
holden to be inpregnable and almoſt inacceſſible. But God,
who ruleth the hearts of Kings and Princes, peized the hearts
of theſe two Princes, whereby the one was found to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a iuſt quarrell, whereto he alſo ſhewed himſelfe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable,
as he promiſeth by his Prophets, when he findeth a
<pb facs="tcp:2750:3"/>
heart after his owne minde. So that whereas the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy,</hi>
purpoſed there to haue ſuffered the Frenchmen to haue
champed on their bittes, with the diſcommoditie of the winter
ſeaſon and tempeſts, the place happily fell into the kings hands,
to the great preiudice of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> who now fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe to be the prey of ſuch miſhap as he threatned to
others, therein reſembling the Thruſh, who pearched vpon a
twigge ſpreddeth her wings, and ſo is taken of her ſelfe: or the
Gyants that ſought to ſight with heauen: for ſurely this battle
of the Giants, doth repreſent and figure vnto no other but theſe
that will riſe againſt their betters, as they did againſt <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
according to the wordes of the Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Gyants men ſay, would enterprize,</l>
               <l>To ſeaze vpon heauen, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſurprize.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now will I bring vnto the French Theater, one of the
principall actes of this tragedie. The King conſidering how
difficult it was by aſſault to come néere this place, and fearing
the loſſe of the meaneſt of his Souldiers, ſought to winne thoſe
in the Caſtle by compoſition, wherevpon God reading in his
heart his good minde and affection, ſtrengthened him more and
more againſt his enemies. Many things they do report, that
miniſtred intelligence to the king: but I doe ground my ſelfe
vpon the moſt certaine, &amp; I doe beléeue that the kings iuſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
deliuered him this place, as the lawfull daughter of France
built and erected by our Kings: for, as ſay the auncient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers:
All things muſt returne to their head and foundation,
ſo that as well that, as the reſt, being of France, <hi>All ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end the Lord of <hi>Brandy</hi> Captaine of the ſaid Caſtle,
finding himſelfe vnable to reſiſt the French armie, much leſſe
the courage of ſo inuincible and magnanimious a king: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that he could not hould, as being ſurprized by the kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and foreſight, who reſembled an <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Iulius
Caeſar,</hi> who both enterpriſed and executed in manner at once:
ſought to growe to compoſition as himſelfe required: whereto
the King condiſcended, mittigating certaine articles that went
<pb facs="tcp:2750:3"/>
beyond the lawes of warre, which he would not paſſe.</p>
            <p>This compoſition did firſt containe a truce for one moneth:
ſo that incaſe the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> did not come to ſuccour the
beſieged and raiſe the ſiedge from before the place, the ſaid lord
<hi>Brandys</hi> promiſed euen with hoſtages, to deliuer the place into
the kings hands. The truce drawing to expiration, toward the
end thereof the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> meaning to appeare, was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
through the kings diſcréet foreſight, who ſent his armie to
the paſſages to ſtop the ſaid Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> from all acceſſe.
Thus he being repulſed, and vnable to bring any ſuccour, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to raiſe the ſiege from before the place, it was yéelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the moſt happy ſucceſſe of the moſt Chriſtian &amp; moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimious
King, according to the graunt that the Lorde of
<hi>Brandy</hi> had obteined from his Maieſty. Héervpon the king, the
16. of Nouemb. 1600. ſent in 500. French ſouldiers, vnder the
leading of the Lord of <hi>Crequy,</hi> who was to commaund in the
ſame. The Lord of <hi>Brandy,</hi> according to an article by the King
granted in forme of compoſition, departed: Namely with the
life of the ſaid Lord of <hi>Brandy</hi> and all his, the Souldiers with
the Drum ſtriking vp, the Ancient diſplaide, the Matche ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Bullet in the mouth, the Muſquets and Harquebuts
charged, with bag and baggage, ſo much as to them appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
without ſearch, viſitation or moleſtation whatſoeuer, and
furniſhed with ſo much warlicke prouiſion as they could well
carry with them: leauing to his Maieſties poſſeſſion, the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and ſtrongeſt place in all <hi>Sauoy,</hi> with 80. Canons great
and ſmall, 30000. Bullets, and 500. thouſand of Powder.
Thus much for the conqueſt and departure from the Caſtle of
<hi>Mont-millan,</hi> a houlde in ſome mens opinion vnpoſſible to be
gotten: yet poſſible to our great King, being armed with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and a iuſt quarrell.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, O yée French nation, yée are to lift vp your
hands to heauen in ſigne of ioye, and to importunate the ſame
with your petitions and prayers, and manifould repetition of
this worde with the Prophet, <hi>O Lord preſerue the King, and
be his protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2750:4"/>
Now therefore let him not be content onely to mainteine his
eſtate and people in peace: but alſo let him flouriſh, and as it
were ſhoote foorth againe the auncient Lawrell branches of his
aunceſters. Now I ſay is the time, that thou O France maiſt
boaſt, that thou haſt not onely a <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> an <hi>Alexander,</hi>
or a Caeſar, but euen all thrée comprized in the ſole courage of
this great <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Now is the time that the olde
prouerbe may be verified in him. <hi>That nothing is difficult to
a valiant minde:</hi> Likewiſe that he hath clambered to the rocke
of vertue: and that he hath purchaſed the tipe of perfection;
that he hath out faced the hazards, and for a long time caryed
away and houlden the title of a great King and Captaine,
whome all the worlde admireth and feareth, vnder his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
curteſie, valour and benignity. God graunt that France
may long enioy ſo fauourable a ſunne-ſhine, to beate away the
ſtormes that otherwiſe are likelie to fall therevpon:
likewiſe that his life, his goodneſſe, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
may in his vertue poſſeſſe the
greateſt worldly Empires.</p>

richer gift? yet it is alwayes to be conſidered, that Maieſties do limit
their contentment not after the valew or riches, which they need not,
but as things do delight them. Witneſſe the common example of the
king that accepted the country mans Radiſhes, who was well rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and the Gentleman who grounding himſelfe vpon the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
looked for a farre greater rewarde if he preſented a better thing,
and therevpon preſented his Maieſtie with a goodly horſe and of great
valew: to whom the king, very well conceauing his meaning, gaue in
reward the poore mans Radiſhes which he had deerly paide for. Thus
I beſeech GOD moſt excellent Princeſſe to keepe and preſerue you.

            <p>O moſt valiant king, inuincible Prince: you that haue ſo
many yeares moſt gloriouſly béene the burden both of Ciuill
and forraine warres, &amp; ſo fortunatly laboured and ſwet in your
armour: beholde, this is that fayre Nimph whome your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
poets, repleniſhed with diuine fury, haue of long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould
to be reſerued in heauen for you, as the recompence, of
your labours, trauailes and heroycall vertues: the ſame who
ſhall quiet your minde: the ſame that in whoſe diſcretions and
fidelitie, you ſhall repoſe your moſt inward and ſecret cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
who being your companion in your kingdome, ſhall alſo
accompany you in your fortunes, adding to your glory a new
luſtre or brightneſſe: who by her fruitfulneſſe ſhall cure the
auncient woundes of your flouriſhing kingdome This is that
beautifull and ritch crowne of felicitie and contentation, that
was to enuiron the royall head, which for a laſt ornament hath
iuſtly deſerued to bee ioyned and referred to both your royall
heads.</p>
            <p>Happye therefore is that ſoyle that hath brought foorth ſo
noble a plant: neither is it any meruaile that others doe enuy
her, ſithe her beauty and grace by vnuſuall meanes doe ſtriue
among them. Bleſſed was that moſt religious and moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Mother, that beautified the worlde with ſo worthye a
daughter: and had the heauens permitted her to ſée that which
at this day we doe beholde, ſhée would moſt willingly haue
departed this life.</p>
            <p>Alſo you the moſt inuincible <hi>Heros,</hi> or great Lordes of the
Imperiall blond of <hi>Auſtrich,</hi> that liue moſt happilye in the
<hi>Eliſian</hi> fields, behoulding the happy offſpring, the yong branch
of your moſt worthy line, who borne and brought vp in <hi>Italy,</hi> is
going to take poſſeſſion of the French Empire: Behold your
glorie ſhining more eminent then euer heretofore in thrée prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in theſe dayes diſcended out of the heauens, as new An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,

doe imbrace in manner the whole worlde; the moſt

vertuous <hi>Mary,</hi> the moſt religious <hi>Margaret,</hi> and the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créet
<hi>Iſabel,</hi> who raigneth in Flanders, as the other in Spaine.
You glorious &amp; magnimious father, whome the heauens haue
forbidden to ſée your daughter ſo well beloued and made much
off, at her comming to be mariageable, and ſo highly married:
looke downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where thy vertues haue placed thée,
and beholde this new Quéene, of thy glory and fulneſſe of thy

and in her actions, thy greatneſſe: ſo that by the iuſt
law of nature we do commonly of good ſéede looke to reape good
fruite. Now hath the worlde moſt vertuous Quéene, had ſo
much ſpéech of you, not onely in Italy and Germany, but alſo
in England &amp; Spaine, with equall praiſe and enuie, that your
ſelfe haue béene the continuall ſubiect of all diſcourſes holden
within theſe ten yeares in all Imperiall &amp; royall courts, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
they mentioned any great mariage: neither doth there
euen at this day, any one paſſe the Alpes, that part Italy and
France, but with great meruaile is inquiſitiue, euen among
the common ſort, ſaying: Is it I pray you true, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Mary</hi> is ſo fayre, as it is ſaide? Is ſhe ſo gracious as the
voice goeth? And is it true that ſhe ſhall be our Quéene? Oh
how happye for vs if this might come to paſſe: ſo ſhould we
thinke the loſſe of our goods and moſt precious things, befallen
vs in theſe our ciuill warres almoſt of fortye yeares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to be but ſmall, in regarde of the good that we are to hope
for in ſo beautifull, excellent, and reuerent a mariage? and this
only, not a woman, but a goddeſſe, ſhould ſuffice to recouer all
our calamities. This your honourable fame, and this generall
deſire of euery man, runneth ouer the Alpes, euen vnto the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
bounds of France: neither is there Painter or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Images, but with all induſtrie, as of their Quéene, doe
indeuour to draw your image and portraiture to the perfection
of his ſkill. There is not ſo meane a man, or howſoeuer poore,
but hath it in his houſe: and as in time paſſed the Image of
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> was worſhipped in priuate houſes, euen ſo it was at
this day. Truly it is a great matter that in the conceipts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
perſons, there ſhould be formed firſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Idea of ſome great
<pb facs="tcp:2750:7"/>
matter to come, from the which by like means the iſſue ſhould
be taken: alſo that they cannot poſſibly be drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this firſt
conceipt, vntill the occaſion be fulfilled, which afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to light, diſcouereth the trueth of the vniuerſall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The like hath hapned in you, moſt vertuous <hi>Mary,</hi> who
being diſcended from kings, grafted and allied to great kings,
and endued with royall conditions, after the troubleſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, were in the iudgement of all
men marryed to the valient <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> Such a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
albeit aſſeſſed by man, was notwithſtanding, the worke
of God &amp; fatall from heauen, who hauing cut off all &amp; ſo great
hinderances, which as the world knoweth, ſéemed inſuperable,
and croſſed your preſent mariage, haue now knit you in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble
knot, to the inuincible king of France. Theſe ſurely
are miracles, workes vnexpected: effects whoſe cauſes are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to vs, and teſtimonies that God hath alwayes a care
of kings and Princes. Well may you thinke that neither your
fathers treaſure, neither the nobility of your blood, neither your
great eſtates, which the king néedeth not: but the only fame of
your vertues, of your graces, of your Chriſtian pitty, &amp; of your
beauty, did induce this great king to aſke you in mariage, who
had no want of ſwéete and flattering Syrens, or ſtore of crafty
<hi>Cyrces,</hi> which in diuers ſorts raiſed loue warres againſt him,
and laid ſiege to ouercome him: yet he firme and conſtant, as a
rocke againſt the billowes and waues of the ſea, would neuer
change, neither will euer alter his minde: much leſſe now,
when hauing ſéene your preſence to ſurpaſſe and excéed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
he ſhalbe forced to reſt entangled in your gracious lookes:
&amp; his moſt generous agents, that ſo laboured you for his wife,
ſhall now reuerence you for the chiefeſt and greateſt Quéen in
Chriſtendome, as you are, and be content to ſurrender all their
deſires to your preſent glory. Thus haue the heauens alwaies,
and in time fit and conuenient, béen liberall of their fauours to
a vertuous and innocent Princeſſe. Yéeld therfore perpetuall
praiſe to God, and thanke the wiſdom, and more then fatherly
piety of your vnckle <hi>Don Ferdinando</hi> the great duke towards
you. Commend the goodneſſe and exemplary life of that great
<pb facs="tcp:2750:8"/>
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather in déed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> name, out of whoſe mariage yours
was deuided, as out of great things greater are formed. For
in theſe young yeares of your tender age, you were by them
ſo brought vp and trained in vertue &amp; Chriſtian piety, that the
moſt Chriſtian king, mooued and enflamed with the report of
your name, craued you in mariage. Oh happy couple, O moſt
glorious mariages, O memorable coniunction, &amp; moſt glorious
fruits which we expect from you? I do already behold, neither

their exerciſes. You ſhall miniſter occaſion of ſpéech both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

memory of mortall men, with the true titles of honor &amp; glorie,

You go into a realme, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magnanimous <hi>Katherin</hi> your
kinſwoman by the father, did ſo gloriouſly commaund almoſt
for the ſpace of forty years, that the name of your moſt famous
family, borne to ſway the greateſt Empires, is holden in very
great accompt. You go to a kingdome eſtabliſhed in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
&amp; at the ſame time in Chriſtianity, almoſt thirtéen hundred

moſt gallant warrior that euer drew ſword, who in a long &amp; ſet order
of his predeceſſors of the ſelfe nation &amp; line is the ſixtie &amp; fifth. What

all the ſhoares of <hi>Prouence</hi> couered with people of all ages &amp; kinds,

not omitting any token of perfect and inward mirthe &amp; ioy, for your

            <p>What ſhall we then do, that haue nurſſed and brought you vp?
ſhall we by our ſlackneſſe ſéeme to enuie <hi>Prouince,</hi> or rather all
France in their ioy? ſhall we diſlike your contentment &amp; glory? oh!
God forbid. Nay rather as in the beginning of my ſpéech I aduiſed
you, moſt vertuous <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> to haue your recourſe to ſighes &amp; ſobs,
and ſorrowfull lamentations for her departure, ſo now, being come
againe to my ſelfe, &amp; hauing ouercome ſorrow, I thinke it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that we reioyce with her, to whome Italy being but a ſmall
matter, the king of heauen hath giuen the faireſt kingdom, togither
with the mighteſt king Chriſtian to be her ſpouſe &amp; huſband, becauſe
her glory is our glory. Feare not that her far iourney ſhall euer blot
out of her minde the loue that ſhe beareth vs, or ſuppreſſe the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the ſacrifice of our harrs, which we haue already ſo long ſince
offered vnto her. For ſuch a heauenly ſubſtance as ſhe is, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to times or alterations, as other mortall creatures are: but being
far diſtant from her countrie, ſhe will reſemble the Sunne, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſh
more by reflection and reuerberation, then by the direct beames
therof. And you alſo, moſt noble and beautifull Gentlewomen, ſithe
your ſexe is by this rather deuine then humaine <hi>Marye,</hi> at this time
mounted ſo high, giue yée thankes vnto God, and ſounding foorth
his glorious name, ſhewe ſome token of your inwarde ioye, and
where your wordes cannot, let it bee ſupplyed by your affections,
mindes, and a reuerend ſilence. Print in your hearts her liuelye
Image; ſéeke to imitate her in her vertues and manners: for in ſo
dooing, you ſhall ſhewe no leſſe ſigne of reuerence and loue towards
her, then if you ſhould continually celebrate her with Hymnes and

            <p>Purpoſely O holy Father <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, haue I forborne to

In a few words you did both begin &amp; end the important war
