            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is almoſt as eaſie to find faults, as to make them. Perhaps the Time had bin as well ſpent in toſsing of his Beades: How happie a man am I that ſhall ſee all my ouerſights? My comfort is, that if my Tree were fruitleſſe, there would be no ſtone throwne at it. In the meane while, how well doth the title of a Detector become him that hides himſelfe? If he be not afraid or aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his cauſe, let his name be known that his victories may be recorded. It is an iniurious and baſe aduantage to ſtrike and hide; and after a pitch't Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to gall a fixed Aduerſary out of loop-holes. If his perſon bee vpon ſome
<pb facs="tcp:19627:8"/>
treaſonable act obnoxius, it is hard if ſome of his names be not free: But if I muſt needs bee matcht with the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Libeller, I will ſo take him, as he deciphers himſelfe: <hi>C. E. Cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Egregius;</hi> and vnder this true ſtile of his, am readie to incounter him, and doe here bid Defiance to an inſolent, and vniust Aduerſary: And firſt let mee tell my Cauiller, this order is prepoſterous. If all my errours be at the mouth of the Preſſe, how is it that two or three of them are thus ſuffered to out-runne their fellowes? Was his malice ſo bigge with theſe, that it could not ſtay the time of the common deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie? Needs must they be notorious falſhoods, that are thus ſingled out from the rest. Let them appeare in their owne ſhapes, vgly, (doubtleſſe) and prodigious.<note place="margin">

That there are in them ſo many vntruths I eaſily grant; for in Contradictions one part muſt needs be falſe; and Truth is but ſingle: They are vntruths then, (lyes are too broad a word) but their owne.

Let him take them as they are, I aggrauate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; It is but only in ſuch light chaffe, as this; In the number and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Bookes Canonicall, wherein <hi>DRIEDO, ERASMVS, GENEBRARD, CAIETAN, SIXTVS SENENSIS</hi> are acknowledged to oppoſe the reſt; In

Theſe and ſuch other are the ſlight Trifles (ſince all cannot bee weightie) impertinent to faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors varie.</p>
            <p>Neither doth my aſſertion of their diſcord gall him more, then of our V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: O the fore-head of Heretikes!

            <p>This boldneſſe, together with my eminent ignorance, makes him admire the ſcarcitie of learned men in our Countrey, that could finde no better Doctors to ſend to <hi>Dort</hi>-Conference then Master <hi>HALL.</hi> To your griefe, Sir, it was a Synode, and that noble and celebrious; Neither was it out of want that your ſilly Aduerſarie was ſent thither.

            <p>But that ſecond lye of mine is ſo loud, that all my Brethren of <hi>Dort</hi> muſt heare it, and they which were lately the Witneſſes of my ſinceritie (gracing me with the deare Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their approofe) are now made the Iudges of my impudencie.

<pb facs="tcp:19627:10"/>
               <hi>for an auoucher of theſe Coozenages, who dares auerre that his fellow</hi> Xauier, <hi>not only healed the Deafe, Dumbe, and Blinde, but rayſed the Dead, to which I adde (whiles his Brother</hi> Acoſta, <hi>after many yeeres ſpent in thoſe parts, can pull him by the ſleeue, and tell him in his eare, ſo loud that all the World may heare,</hi> Prodigia nulla producimus.) This is my Indictment; Let me come to my Tryall: Caſt mee, if yee can, yee reuerend heads; I craue no fauour. Where lyes this ſo lewd lye, and malicious abuſe? That <hi>BELLAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINE</hi> ſayes thus of the Ieſuite <hi>XA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIER</hi> is not denyed; That <hi>ACOSTA</hi> ſayes thus of himſelfe, and his fellow Ieſuites, is granted; The firſt lye yet is, <hi>ACOSTA</hi> was neuer in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> at all, nor <hi>XAVIER</hi> in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and how then could <hi>ACOSTA</hi> ſpend many yeeres in thoſe parts? A perilous Plea! Who euer, I beſeech you, mentioned either <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt?</hi> I ſpake of the <hi>Indies</hi> in common; ſo did his <hi>BELLARMINE,</hi> from whom I

Yet this is one lye (he ſaith) and that ſo long a one, as that it reacheth as far as it is from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> from the <hi>Artick</hi> to the <hi>Antarctick Pole;</hi> wherein I doubt not but your reuerences will eaſily marke the skill of this learned Coſmographer. Some parts of thoſe inſtanced <hi>Indies</hi> differ not ſo farre; not to ſpeake of the ſmall ſtrait of <hi>Anian;</hi> the mentioned Region of <hi>Mexico</hi> is not aboue foure-ſcore degrees from <hi>Iapan:</hi> Either your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction must fauour him, or elſe this muſt goe into the Booke of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights.</p>
            <p>The ſecond lye is, that <hi>ACOSTA</hi> pulled <hi>BELLARMINE</hi> by the ſleeue in this aſſertion, as if hee denyed thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:19627:11"/>
               <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Miracles, which hee elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confeſſeth. Indeed, this ſauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were dangerous. The red Hat (you ſay) is fellow to a Crowne. But ſhall I confeſſe where I erred? My dull head could not conceive that God ſhould bee the God of the Mountaynes; and not of the Valleys; Of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> not of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and yet be the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites God in both: Eſpecially,<note place="margin">Ioſ.

               </note> ſince the reaſon that <hi>IOSEPH ACOSTA</hi> fetches from the perſons (which ſhould be the ſubject of thoſe Wonders) holds as equally for both <hi>Indies,</hi> as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack made for the Meridian of one Citie, ſerueth the Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Hitherto then the Prologue of my infamous falſhoods, ſuch, as if all my Writings could haue afforded any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually haynous, theſe had neuer beene choſen out to grace the front of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; There muſt needes bee much terrour in the ſequell.</p>
            <p>The rest of this ſtorme falls vpon our learned Profeſſor, Doctor <hi>COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINS;</hi> one of the prime ornaments of our <hi>Cambridge;</hi> the partnerſhip of

And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it were not worſe if more Priests had wiues, for many would be ſaued in a married Priesthood, which now in a ſingle Priesthood are damned</hi>; hee ſaith directly, <hi>Damnantur, They are damned,</hi> not, They ſeeme to bee damned. And therefore to preuent this reall damnation, Marriage is really to bee reſtored to them, not that it ſhould onely ſeeme to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. To conclude, take <hi>Videri,</hi> for bare Seeming, ſurely, it muſt be conſtrued, <hi>Videtur mihi; I Pope</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:19627:78"/>

               <p>And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Iohn Freûnd, Credimus te non inſulſo vti conſilio; I thinke it is no ill counſell for thee (ſince thou canſt not contayne) to ſeeke for a Wife; although that ſhould haue beene thought of, before thou didst enter into holy Orders; but we are not all Gods, that wee can fore-ſee future things; ſince it is comne to this, that thou canst not reſist the Law of thy Fleſh, it is better for thee to marry, then to burne.</hi> Thus he. For which aduice, doubtleſſe, hee found good cauſe in his owne experience; who hauing beene imployed formerly in this Iland of ours, left two Baſtards behind him, the one, begotten of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman, the other, of a <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19627:79"/>
The one wherof he commends to his Father <hi>Syluius,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Syenna</hi>; the other he confeſſes to his friend <hi>P. de Noxeto:</hi> But this indeed was before his Prieſthood; After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,<note place="margin">Whiles he was Cardinall, he had his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine; to whom at laſt he gaue three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Florens for her Dowry, <hi>Epist.</hi> 361.</note> it is ſtrange what he confeſſes of himſelfe in his 92.

            <p>I Would faine know who it was that firſt ordayned, that Chriſtian Prieſts might not marry, GOD, or Man? For, if it were GOD, ſurely, his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be held and obſerued with all veneration and reuerence; But, if it were Man, and not GOD; and this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition came out of the heart of Man, not out of the Mouth of GOD, then neither is ſaluation got by it, if it be obſerued; nor loſt, if it bee not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: For it doth not belong to Man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſaue or deſtroy any man for his merits, but it is proper only vnto GOD. That GOD hath ordayned this, it is neither found written in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in the Goſpell, nor in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of the Apoſtles, in all which is ſet downe whatſoeuer GOD hath inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto men. It is therefore a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, and not an inſtitution of GOD, nor of his Apoſtles: As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb facs="tcp:19627:182"/>
inſtituted <hi>(rather)</hi> that a Biſhop ſhould bee the Husband of one Wife; which he would neuer haue appointed, if it had beene adulterie for a biſhop to haue at once a Wife, and a Church, as it were two Wiues, like as ſome affirme: Now, that which hath not authoritie from the holy Scriptures, is with the ſame facilitie contemned, that it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: For, the holy Church is not the Wife, not the Spouſe of the Prieſt, but of Chriſt, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that hath the Bride, hee is the Bridegroome.</hi> Of this Bridegroome, I ſay, is the Church the Spouſe; and yet it is lawfull euen for this Spouſe in part, to marry, by Apoſtolique Tradition; For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks thus to the <hi>Corinthians, Becauſe of fornications, let euery man haue his owne wife.</hi> And I would that all men were as I am, but euery man hath his proper gift of GOD, one thus, another otherwiſe. For, all men haue not one gift, namely, of Virginitie, and Continency: But ſome are Virgins, and contayne; others contayne not; to whom he granteth marriage, leſt Satan tempt them through their incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and they ſhould miſcarry in the ruine of their vncleanneſſe. So alſo of Prieſts, ſome are continent, others are
<pb facs="tcp:19627:182"/>
incontinent; and thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, haue receiued the gift of their continence from GOD, without whoſe Gift and Grace, they cannot be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. But thoſe which are incontinent, haue not receiued this gift of grace, but, whether by the intemperance of their humour, or the weakneſſe of their mind run out into fleſhly deſires; which they would in no wiſe doe, if they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from GOD the Grace and Vertue of Continence. For they alſo which are deliuered by the grace of GOD from the body of this death, feele an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Law in their members rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the Law of their minde, and captiuating them to the Law of ſinne, and compelling them to doe that which they would not.

<pb facs="tcp:19627:183"/>
contayne not, to marry, not to burne. <hi>For marriage is good,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaks in his Booke <hi>(ſuper Geneſin ad Literam)</hi> in it is commended the good of nature, whereby the prauitie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence is ruled, and the fruitfulnes of Nature graced; For the weakneſſe of either Sexe declining towards the ruine of filthineſſe, is well relieued by the honeſty of marriage, ſo as the ſame thing, which may bee the office of the ſound, is alſo the remedie vnto the ſick: Neither yet, becauſe Incontinence is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is therefore Marriage (euen that wherewith the Incontinent are ioyned) to be reputed not good; yea rather not for that euill, is the good faultie, but for this good, is that euill pardonable, ſince that good which marriage hath, yea which marriage is, can neuer bee ſinne.

<pb facs="tcp:19627:183"/>
as it were the Rule of Marriage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fruitfulneſſe of Nature is graced, or the prauitie of Incontinence ruled. And this Rule of Marriage, and this three-fold good, the eternal Truth hath appointed in the order of his Decree, and that eternall Law of his, againſt which whatſoeuer is done, ſpoken, or willed, is ſinne; which <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Booke againſt <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Sinne is either Deed, Word, or Deſire againſt the Law Eternal.</hi> This Eternall Law is the diuine Will or Decree, forbidding the diſturbance, and commanding the preſeruation of due naturall order; whatſoeuer therefore commands naturall Order to be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, forbids it to be conſerued, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits men to vſe Marriage, and to attaine to the threefold good thereof, Fidelitie, Iſſue, Sacrament; and commands them to breake that Rule of Eternall Truth, whereby the fruitfulneſſe of Nature is graced, or the prauitie of Incontinency ruled, commands men to abhorre thoſe things whereby naturall Order is held and maintayned. This Commandement, I ſay, forbids naturall Order to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, commands it to be diſturbed, and therefore is againſt the Law of GOD, and by conſequence, is ſinne:
<pb facs="tcp:19627:184"/>
For, they ſinne that ordayne ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by which naturall Order is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Theſe men doe not (it ſeemes) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that of the children of Prieſts, GOD takes for the building of his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aboue, and for the reſtoring of the number of Angels: For, if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, they would neuer ordayne ſuch a Mandate, becauſe they ſhould wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and ouer-raſhly goe about to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the ſupernall City ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be perfited, and the number of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels neuer repayred. For if the ſupernall City be to be perfited euen of the ſons of Prieſts, and if the number of Angels be of them to be repayred, thoſe that indeuour to procure that they ſhould not be, doe (what in them lyes) deſtroy the ſupernall City, and labour that the number of Angels may not be perfited; Then which, what can be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely done? For this is done againſt the wil and predeſtination of him which hath done thoſe things, which ſhall be; for hee hath done in his predeſtination thoſe things which ſhall bee in effect; whoſoeuer therefore goes about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that GOD may not in effect doe thoſe things, which he hath done in his predeſtination, goes about to make
<pb facs="tcp:19627:184"/>
void the very predeſtination of GOD. If then GOD haue already in his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination decreed, that the ſons of Prieſts ſhall once bee in effect, hee that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to procure that they may not bee in effect, indeuours to deſtroy the worke of GOD, becauſe he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done it in predeſtination; and ſo ſtriues to ouerthrow GODS predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to gainſtand that Wil of GOD which is Eternall: For GOD would from Eternitie, and before all Worlds, create all men in the World, in that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Order wherein he pre-conceiued, and predeſtinated, to create them; Hee doth nothing diſorderly, Hee createth nothing in the World which Hee hath not fore-ordayned, by diſpoſing it in the Predeſtination of His minde that went before all Worlds. Whatſoeuer therefore is by Him created in this world, doth neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rily follow the Predeſtination of His minde prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and preordayning all things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible that ſhould not be done, which GOD from Eternitie hath willed and fore-ordayned to bee done; It is therefore neceſſary that all men ſhould bee created in that very Order, wherein He willed, and from Eternitie fore-ordayned; Or elſe, all men are not
<pb facs="tcp:19627:185"/>
created as GOD would haue them, nor as he fore-ordayned them; But becauſe this is inconuenient, it muſt needs bee that they are created as He willed from Eternitie, and fore-thought, and fore-ordayned; becauſe Hee hath done all things that He would, and neuer did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which Hee willed not from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, and hath fore-conceiued in His certayne and vnchangeable Decree. For neither can his Will bee fruſtrated, nor his fore-thought deceiued, nor His fore-ordinations altered: Which, ſince it is ſo; need muſt it be, that as Laicks, ſo Prieſts alſo, of whom men are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould yeeld their ſeruice to the diuine Will and Preordination to the creating of them. For Parents are not the Authors of the Creation of their Children, but the ſeruants; who if they ſhould not yeeld their ſeruice, they ſhould (if it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re poſſible) make void the fore-thought of GOD, and reſiſt his Ordination; which if they ſhould wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly do, they ſhould offend the more, if ignorantly, the leſſe; not only againſt GOD the Father, but alſo againſt the Heauenly Ieruſalem, the Mother of all Saints, becauſe (what in them were) they ſhould not ſuffer thoſe to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of whom it is to bee builded, and
<pb facs="tcp:19627:185"/>
thoſe things to bee prepared, whereby that Celeſtiall Countrey is beſtowed. But from this offence their impotence frees them, becauſe they cannot reſiſt the Will of GOD, and croſſe his Preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. For the Will and Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD is that eternall Law, in which the courſe of al things is decreed, and the patterne wherein the forme of all Ages is ſet forth, which can by no meanes be defaced; Not to yeeld our ſeruice then hereunto, is euill, becauſe to yeeld it, is good, and eſpecially if it bee done with a good intent; which is then done, when as Parents meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a deſire of propagation of iſſue, not in an appetite of exerciſing their luſt. Of propagation, I ſay, that both the preſent Church may be multiplyed, and the Celeſtiall City built, and the number of the Elect made vp, none of which could be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugall meeting. For if the firſt Parents of the Saints had continued all either Continent, or Virgins, no Saint had beene borne of them in the World, none of them had beene crowned with glory and honour in Heauen, none of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed into the number of Angels. But ſince it is an ineſtimable good, that Saints are borne in the World, that
<pb facs="tcp:19627:186"/>
they are crowned with glory and honor in heauen, and that they are aſcribed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of Angels: thereupon the fruitfulneſſe of Parents is more bleſſed, and their meeting holyer. So then it is better for them to haue begotten ſuch Children, then not to haue begotten them, and to haue brought forth ſuch fruit of marriage, then to haue beene continent, or Virgins, without fruit. Although it is good for ſome to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or Virgins, namely, for them whom GOD eternally willed and pre-ordayned to be ſo created in the world, that they ſhould remaine either in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, or Virginitie: For as hee hath eternally willed and fore-ordained that ſome ſhould be ſo created in the world, as that they ſhould yeeld the fruit of Marriage, and beget Children, ſo alſo hath he willed, and from eternitie fore-ordayned, ſome to bee ſo created, that they ſhould continue in Continency or Virginitie: And as thoſe other yeeld their ſeruice to the Will and Preordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of GOD, in the creation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo theſe alſo ſerue the Will and Preordination of GOD in conſeruing their Continence, and Virginitie; and hereupon is both the fruitfulneſſe of the one, and the Virginitie of the other
<pb facs="tcp:19627:186"/>
good, and laudable; which if it did not yeeld ſeruice to the Will and Preordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of GOD, would be neither good nor laudable: For whatſoeuer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will and Preordination of GOD, is neither good, nor laudable. If therefore GOD willed and predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome to bee Virgins, others to yeeld the fruit of Marriage (for if all were Virgins, no Saint that now is, or ſhall be borne, ſhould either be now or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter borne in the World, neither ſhould thoſe Virgins bee at all, becauſe they ſhould not be born; for of the fruitfulnes of the one ariſes the others Virginitie) therefore is fruitfulneſſe a great Good, from which holy Virginity hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Now that there ſhould bee ſome Virgins, and others that ſhould beare the fruits of Marriage, the Word which GOD ſoweth in their hearts, teacheth vs. For in the hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
