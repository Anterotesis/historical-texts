            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the State of the Question: Whether Bishops be de jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,
of divine Authority?</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F <hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Episkopoi,</hi> Episcopi, so called, so
commended in Scripture, we doubt not, but
they are <hi>de jure divino.</hi> But what are those
<hi>Bishops?</hi> Not <hi>Diocesan Lord Bishops,</hi> so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called. For of such we no where read
of in Scripture; as we shall fully prove anon.
But those, whom the Scripture calleth <hi>Episcopos,</hi> are <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
or <hi>Ministers of the Word,</hi> lawfully Called, and set over their
severall Congregations respectively. Such onely are <hi>Bishops
jure divino.</hi> But as for such, as are <hi>Katagrestikoes,</hi> abusively sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Bishops,</hi> to wit, <hi>Diocesan</hi> or <hi>Lord Bishops,</hi> there is not so much
as any one footstep of them in the Scripture. And therfore as
these have not the true Nature and Calling of a <hi>Scripture-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:</hi>
So neither ought they to usurpe the Name and Title of
<hi>Bishop.</hi> But as they are of <hi>humane invention</hi> and <hi>institution</hi> onely,
yea of <hi>humane presumption</hi> (as old Father <hi>Hierome</hi> saith) and not
of <hi>divine Institution:</hi> So let them be known by such Titles
<pb facs="tcp:15739:4"/>
onely, as man hath given them, as namely <hi>Prelates</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prelati,</hi>
or <hi>Prelates</hi> are so called, because they are <hi>preferred,</hi> or rather
preferre them selves before and above others, that are GODS
Ministers. And thus they participate of the <hi>Prelacie</hi> of the
<hi>Great Antichrist,</hi> who is that<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>supereiromenos</hi> (as the Apostle
styles him) <hi>he that exalts himselfe, above all that is called God.</hi> He
is also called in the same place <hi>'o a'ntike√≠menos,</hi> that <hi>Adversary,</hi>
called by <hi>Iohn,</hi> 'o <hi>Ant√≠kristos,</hi> that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to wit, that <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
against <hi>Christ.</hi> And agreeable hereunto is that other Title
<hi>of Prelates,</hi> namely <hi>Antistes</hi> in the Latine, which they interpret
<hi>a witnesse:</hi> but it may rather be derived from the Greek; <hi>Anti</hi>
is not a Latine Preposition, but Greeke, and signifies <hi>against.</hi>
So as <hi>Antistes,</hi> is one that stands against; and it may answere to
<hi>Antistasiast√®s,</hi> one of the adverse Faction, or on the <hi>contrary side,</hi> as all <hi>Prelates</hi> are <hi>Antistasiastai, adversaries against Christ,</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,</hi>
which you will; as will further appeare. But we will
content our selves with the Title of <hi>Prelate</hi> in this our whole
insuing discourse, as being none of the <hi>Scripture-Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning <hi>Prelates,</hi> the learned <hi>Papists</hi> themselves are
not, cannot be resolved, that they are <hi>jure divino,</hi> of <hi>divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
immediately, but onely at the most mediately, deriving
their Prelacie from the Pope, as all his Canonized Saints doe
their Saint-ship; saying, that the Pope hath his Supremacie
<hi>jure divino,</hi> both as <hi>Christs</hi> Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> Successor: but all
<hi>Prelates</hi> derive their Prelacie from no further a Fountaine, then
the Pope, as from the well-head, or the Head of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
body, which gives them their lively motion, as the
Head to the naturall members. This very point of Prelaticall
Jurisdiction was canvased and controverted in the Councel of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and held by some learned there, to be but <hi>jure Pontificio,</hi>
by Pontifician Authority resident in the Pope:<note place="margin">Histor. Concilii Trident.</note> whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they call <hi>Patrem Patrum,</hi> the Father of Fathers, as being
the Father of the whole Paternity of <hi>Prelates.</hi> And our <hi>Prelates</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> may remember, that till <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cast the Pope out of
<hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> held all their Jurisdiction from the
Pope, and their Authority was but translated from the Pope,
to the King, So as passing from one man to another, it was

               <hi>Bishops</hi> in their severall Dioces, as there

<pb facs="tcp:15739:4"/>
upon Canon and Positive Law in their severall Quarters.</hi> Where
by <hi>effectuall subjection</hi> he meanes <hi>subjection of the Prelates</hi> in every

that <hi>Archiprelaticall Iurisdiction</hi> is grounded upon <hi>Canon</hi> and
<hi>Positive Law,</hi> and so consequently not upon the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as being <hi>jure divino.</hi> And thus much he confessed in open
Court at the <hi>High Commission</hi> at Doctor BASTVVICKS
Censure, <hi>that no one of the Apostles had Iurisdiction one over another;</hi>
and so consequently not an <hi>Arch-Prelate</hi> over other <hi>Prelates,
jure divino,</hi> but onely <hi>jure Canonico, &amp; Positivo,</hi> by <hi>Canon</hi> and
<hi>Positive Law. Arch-Prelates</hi> therfore have no <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

every <hi>Diocese</hi> to their <hi>Prelates respectively,</hi> that this also is <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> upon <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Positive Law:</hi> though so he should say truly,
yet in so saying, he should contradict himselfe, as where he
saith elsewhere, <hi>That Christ thought it fitter to governe the Church</hi>
(universall) <hi>Aristocratically by diverse, rather then by one Vice-Roy.</hi>
As much to say, rather <hi>by many Popes,</hi> then by <hi>one.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confe. pag. 200.</note> 
               <hi>And this</hi> (saith
he <hi>I beleeve to be true.</hi> So as he makes it an <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi>
That <hi>Prelates</hi> are <hi>jure divino.</hi> Yet but a little before in the same
page, <hi>it is not certaine that the whole Militant Church is a Kingdome:
for there are no meane ones</hi> (saith he) <hi>which thinke our Saviour Christ
left the Church Militant in the hands of the Apostles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
in an Aristocraticall, or rather mixt government,</hi> &amp;c. So as
what others, and those <hi>no meane ones Thinke,</hi> the <hi>Prelate beleeves.</hi>
And the <hi>Government,</hi> which some <hi>thinke,</hi> and he <hi>beleeves</hi> to be
<hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> he understands to be <hi>Prelaticall,</hi> which (saith he)
is <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> or rather a <hi>mixt Government.</hi> What meanes he
by a <hi>mixt Government?</hi> Namely, partly <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> and partly
<hi>Monarchicall,</hi> for of those two he there speaketh. His meaning
then is, that a <hi>Prelate</hi> is in part in <hi>Monarch.</hi> But where doe we
find that <hi>Christ thought it fittest to Governe his Church by Prelats,</hi>
that the <hi>Prelate</hi> is so confident to <hi>beleeve</hi> it? It seems he is one
of <hi>Christs</hi> Cabinet Counsellors, that he is so intimately privie
to his <hi>thoughts.</hi> For surely <hi>Christ</hi> hath no where left the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the <hi>Prelate</hi> doth but <hi>presume</hi> so, or charitably <hi>beleeve Christ
thought</hi> so. Me thinks he should not so <hi>beleeve</hi> it, as to <hi>write</hi>
upon it, <hi>I beleeve this is true.</hi> But thus (I say) this <hi>faith</hi> of his
overthrows the credit of his former Saying, <hi>That Prelates with
their effectuall Subjection, are grounded upon Canon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confer. pag.</note>

and so have no Authority from</hi> Christ (as the <hi>Prelate</hi> a little before

the Pope he saith, <hi>Nay out of all doubt, 't is not the least reason, why</hi>

he speakes there of the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there must be <hi>one</hi> Ordine Primus <hi>to avoyd confusion</hi> in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church Militant</hi> (which elswhere he makes to be <hi>visible,</hi>
and <hi>Hierarchicall,</hi> or <hi>Prelaticall</hi>) then did not <hi>Christ</hi> leave so much
exprest in writing, but to <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Positive Law?</hi> But perhaps
<hi>Christ thought it best:</hi> and the <hi>Prelate</hi> so <hi>beleeves.</hi> Thus we see

(as themselves affirme) are <hi>jure divino?</hi> Certainly, if they be
<hi>jure divino,</hi> they must shew good proofe for it in the written
<hi>word of God.</hi> And to this Rule we must hold them, and to this
onely. For it were to tread an endlesse maze, to goe about to

find it, well and good: but if there it be not, but the contrary:
then all <hi>humane writings</hi> are in this point to be rejected, as of no

so descending of the blood Royall. And in hope the better to
speed, they get their Mother to speake, who with <hi>Christ</hi> was
not a little gratious. But besides the absurdity of this their
<pb facs="tcp:15739:6"/>
suit (for <hi>Christ</hi> told them, <hi>ye know not what ye aske</hi>) they come in
as unfit a season, and upon as unsutable an occasion for such a
suit, as possibly could be. For in the very next words going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Christ</hi> had but newly told them of his Death at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
saying, <hi>Behold we goe up to Ierusalem, and the Son of man shalbe
betrayed unto the Chiefe Priests and Scribes, and they shall condemn
him to death: and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to Mocke, and to
Scourge, and to Crucifie him,</hi> &amp;c. And in the next words they
come to make their suit. Nor onely here, but in other places
of the Euangelists this is constantly noted of the Disciples, that
when <hi>Christ</hi> was telling them of his <hi>suffering,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> they
were still harping upon this string, <hi>which of them should be the
greatest.</hi> As we may read, <hi>Mark 9. ver.</hi> 30. to 34. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.
<hi>ver.</hi> 43. to 46. Yea (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.) when they were at the Last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and <hi>Christ</hi> had newly told them, <hi>that one of them should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him,</hi> they were instantly againe at their <hi>philoneik√≠a,</hi> a hotly
contending about <hi>Prelacy:</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 21. to 24. As if they would
contend, which of them should <hi>betray</hi> him. So as still they
took as bad a Season for their suit, as might be. But in <hi>Mathew</hi>
(Chap. 20. 19.) <hi>Christ</hi> told them also of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi>
which might give him a faire hint for their suit. But alas,
poore Soules; they as yet<note n="*" place="margin">Mark 9. 32. Luke 9. 45.</note> understood nothing at all, either of
his <hi>Crucif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ing,</hi> or of his <hi>Rising againe.</hi> And againe it is to be
noted, that after the <hi>Lord</hi> was risen againe, and they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Ghost, they never made any such suit, or had
any such <hi>contention,</hi> or <hi>ambition</hi> among themselves. Then they
were become other men, never so much as thinking of any
such <hi>vanity,</hi> as a <hi>Prelacy;</hi> they now saw, that <hi>Christs Kindome</hi> in
its military condition admitted not of <hi>Prelaticall Chaires</hi> to <hi>sit</hi>
at their ease, and to injoy their pomp, pleasure, and riches of
the world. Their <hi>contention</hi> was then, which should be the
greatest in paines taking in his Ministry, and in undergoing
greatest afflictions for <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Gospell, and in winning
most Soules to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the like. But (I say) before <hi>Christ</hi>
was risen againe, they were carnall, carnally minded, they
dreamed of a temporall, and worldly Kingdome, wherein they
would be chiefe. And such a Kingdome indeed is that, which
hath <hi>Chaires</hi> of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and Preeminence, such as they blindly
aymed at. And yet as blind as they were, their<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 9. 33, 34.</note> Conscience
made them ashamed to confesse to <hi>Christ</hi> what it was, that they
reasoned of by the way; for they had been at it, <hi>which of them
should be the greatest.</hi>

               <hi>Well, we have heard of their suit: now for</hi> Christs <hi>Answere</hi>
Ye know not (<hi>saith he</hi>) what ye aske. You know not the nature of that
Kingdome of mine, which in this world is not a Kingdome of externall
pompe, glory, and greatnesse, but a Kingdome of grace, humility, patience,
and wholly Spirituall, a Kingdome not of ease and pleasure, as to sit in
Chaires of State, but of paines-taking, of labour and travell in your
Ministry, of contempt of the world, and of suffering manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and even death it selfe, for my Names sake. <hi>And therefore</hi> Christ
<hi>addeth here:</hi> Are ye able to drinke of the Cup, that I drinke of? &amp;c.
<hi>And they answering:</hi> We are: <hi>he addes;</hi> Ye shall indeed drinke of
the Cup, and be baptised with the Baptisme, that I am baptised with:
<hi>that is,</hi> you must thinke of other matters, when you come into my
Kingdome, then of any such worldly greatnesse as you dreame of; you
must prepare your feet for the fetters, your backs for the whip, your
bellies for hunger and thirst, your bodies for nakednesse, your stomacks
to drinke and digest the bitter Cup of death, and to be dipped over head
and eares in floods and Seas of afflictions. Are ye able to doe this?
<hi>Alas, poore Soules, as yet they were</hi> novices <hi>in</hi> Christs <hi>Schoole,
they would be of the highest forme, before they had learned
the very first</hi> Principles <hi>of the</hi> Catechisme, <hi>or the</hi> A, B, C. <hi>of the

            <p>
               <hi>But, saith</hi> Christ, Ye shall drinke of my Cup, &amp;c. <hi>that is,</hi> after ye
have fullfilled your Ministeriall Course, and suffered afflictions, and
drunke deaths Cup, and therewith have been baptised, then a place
shalbe proved for you in my Kingdome of glory, such as my Father hath
appointed for you, and for all my Disciples, so as in whom the greater

whose right hand there are pleasures for evermore. But for any such
thing as you aske, it is not mine to give, I have no such Commission
from my Father to bestow upon you any such thing, as worldly Prelacy;
that's no part of my Kingdome, nor of the administration thereof. But
all that are found faithfull in the Kingdome of Grace, shall in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Glory sit with me at my Fathers right hand for evermore.
Whereas on the contrary, such as turne my Kingdome of Grace into a
Kingdome of Pleasure, pride and ease, as they due which hunt after, and
injoy the preferments of the world, to those I say,<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Luk. 6. 24, 25, 26.</note> Woe to you that

it thus: <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over
them, and they that exercise authoritie upon them, are called Benefactors.
But ye shall not be so.</hi> All is to one effect. Which is, <hi>Christ</hi> here
forbids his <hi>Disciples</hi> to exercise any such <hi>Dominion,</hi> or <hi>Auhortity,</hi>
or <hi>Lordship,</hi> either over one another, or upon his Church, as
Heathen Princes doe use over their People. And this he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to their <hi>ambition</hi> of <hi>Prelacie,</hi> which <hi>Prelacie</hi> he samples and
parallells with the <hi>Dominion, Authority,</hi> and <hi>Lordship,</hi> which
Heathen Princes exercise over their people. These words of
<hi>Christ</hi> are so expresse and full, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath no other
Shift to ward off the blow, but to say, that <hi>Christ</hi> here forbids
his Disciples the <hi>exercise</hi> of all <hi>Temporall Authority</hi> and <hi>juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:8"/>
such as Heathen Princes used, but not of <hi>spirituall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>
and <hi>Lordship, Authority,</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction</hi> over the Church.
But it is more cleare then the Sun, that <hi>Christ</hi> forbids here to
his Disciples all manner of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Lordship</hi> either over
one another, or over the Church of <hi>God,</hi> as over <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers
and People. First, for <hi>Lordship</hi> over one another, the said <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate
of Canterbury</hi> confesseth <hi>Christ</hi> gave them none. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
for <hi>Lordship</hi> over <hi>Gods heritage,</hi> the Apostles themselves
afterwards both disclaimed in themselves, and condemned in
others; as we shall see hereafter. And by the way, by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
own confession, all Temporall Lordship, or Government
is condemned in <hi>Prelates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now for our <hi>Prelates: Quo jure</hi> doe they <hi>de facto</hi> exercise
such Authority and Dominion, such Lordship and Jurisdiction
over <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers and People, as differeth nothing at all
from the State of Heathen Princes? This <hi>Christ</hi> expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
to his Disciples: and therefore such as doe it, are none of
his Disciples, nor yet any of their Successors. But they will
say, <hi>They are Spirituall Lords,</hi> and exercise a <hi>Spirituall Lordship</hi>
over the Church. But this bare Title of <hi>Spirituall,</hi> is too short
a cloake to cover the nakednesse of so poore a shift. They call
themselves <hi>Spirituall,</hi> when they are the most carnall men in
the world. Thus did those <hi>false</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Apostles, deceitfull workers,
transforme themselves into the Apostles of Christ.</hi> Thus <hi>Antichrist</hi>
himselfe, whom the Scripture intitles<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the Man of sinne,</hi> and

home to our <hi>Prelates,</hi> those <hi>Spirituall Lords:</hi> wherein doth their
<hi>Spirituall Dominion</hi> and <hi>Lordship</hi> differ from that of Heathen
Princes? For first, they assume the Title of Prince to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as the Arch-prelate in High Commission most bravely
and boldly alledged <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 16. for which he borrows <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi>

<hi>Spirituall.</hi> Nay by their Lordships favour, they are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Lords; For how els come they to sit in <hi>Parliament</hi> cheek

they not in all points beare the Image, and represent Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Princes in their State and Dominion? Have they not
their Stately Palaces, as they? Have they not their Attendants

<pb facs="tcp:15739:8"/>
Officers, their Tipstaves, Lictors, and Prisons, as they? And
doe they not exercise their Authority without subjection to
any humane Law, and in their own Names, as absolute, and
independent Lords, as those Heathen Princes did? Thus
have they not with the Beast (their Syre) in the<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 13. 14.</note>

            <p>Yea these <hi>Spirituall Lords</hi> do not only exercise all the power
of the <hi>first Beast,</hi> as of Heathen <hi>Princes</hi> over the <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>goods</hi>

Thus we see, that the <hi>Prelates,</hi> exercising the like, yea

            </p>
            <p>Againe for the words in <hi>Luke, The Kings of the Gentiles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them,
<pb facs="tcp:15739:9"/>
are called Benefactors. But ye shall not be so. Ye shall not be called</hi>
e'uerg√©tai, <hi>Benefactors,</hi> or <hi>Gracious Lords,</hi> as some Translations
render it. In which word or Title <hi>Christ</hi> forbids all such Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to be assumed by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> as are Heathenish, or such as
did, set forth the magnificence, pompe and State of Heathen
Princes, or such Titles, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not give to <hi>Gods</hi>
Ministers. Now it was not unusuall with the Heathen to call
their Kings, who were the greatest <hi>tyrants,</hi> and <hi>oppressors</hi> of the
People,<note n="*" place="margin">Euerg√©tal, Horat.</note> 
               <hi>Benefactors,</hi> or the like, in <hi>flattery</hi> of them. Thus they
did <hi>incrustare vitia,</hi> parget, or roughcast their vices; as the Poet
speakes. And it seems the Popes learned of the Heathen this
fashion of changing of their Names: as, if he were deformed,
to call him, <hi>Formosus:</hi> if cruel, <hi>Clemens,</hi> &amp;c. But for <hi>Prelates,</hi>
are they not called Euergetae, <hi>Benefactors,</hi> your <hi>Grace,</hi> your
<hi>Honour, Right reverend, most Reverend Father in God, My Lord, My
Reverend Discesan, My Patron</hi> and <hi>Benefactor, Our Metropolitan,
Primate, My Ordinary,</hi> and many such like devised Titles, no
where to be found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but serving to bolster out their
Pontificiall pride? All such Titles <hi>Christ</hi> forbids to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
here; as elswhere also,<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Mat. 23. 8. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye not called Rabbi: for one is

your Father which is in heaven. Neither be ye called Masters: for

            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Prelates</hi> will say, <hi>Distingue tempora,</hi> Distinguish the
times: <hi>the Apostles were poore, the Church was then but in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
Swadling clouts might serve the Turne: but now we that are
the Successors of the Apostles, are men grown, and know how to use
the honours, pleasures and preferments of the world, being cast upon
us; and being now promoted to be Princes, those titles, riches, and honours
that we have, are but sutable to our dignity, and serviceable to our
Principality: Then was then: and now is now.</hi> These things some
great Pontificians and Popes themselves have alledged.<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Bernard. De Consider. ad Eugen. 4. lib. 4. c. 2.</note> But
<hi>Bernard,</hi> who was one of their owne, writing to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
and telling him plainly and freely of all his Pontificiall Pomp,
and how unlike therein he was to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles:
saith, <hi>Scilicet sic factitabat</hi> Petrus? <hi>sic</hi> paulus <hi>ludebat?</hi> Did <hi>Peter</hi>
I pray you doe thus? Did <hi>Paul</hi> play such play? <hi>Si anderem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
Daemonum magis, quam ovium pascua haec:</hi> If I durst speake it,
these are the pastrues of Devils, rather then of the Sheep.
<hi>Honori totum datum datur, Sanctitati nihil aut parum:</hi> All is given
to honour, but little, or nothing to holinesse. But he puts their
<pb facs="tcp:15739:10"/>
allegation as I sayd before) <hi>Absit; inquiunt, tempori non convenit:</hi>
What should holinesse doe, say they? It is not sutable for our
times. Thus <hi>Bernard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we need goe no further, then to the <hi>Painter,</hi> whom the
Pope set a worke in his Gallery to draw the pictures of <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Paul:</hi> who having painted their faces blushing redde, and
the Pope coming in to see his worke, and asking him, If <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> had such <hi>redde faces,</hi> because he had so painted them:
<hi>No,</hi> puoth he, <hi>but if they were here now, and did behold what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
rich and magnificent Successor they have, they would blush as
redde, as now you see their pictures doe.</hi> And his Holinesse was very
well pleased with the <hi>Painters</hi> Conceit, to see himselfe a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man, then ever poore <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were, whose Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
notwithstanding he boasts himselfe to be. For what els,
but a Sweet Fable, doth the Pope make of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
said? And surely we cannot thinke, that <hi>Prelates,</hi> who are
the limbs of this great Beast, are of any other Spirit, then <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isticall,</hi>
such as the Head himselfe is of, and which he hath
derived to his Members.</p>
            <p>Well, hitherto we have heard <hi>Christs</hi> Sentence concerning
<hi>Prelacy</hi> in the Church, and that <hi>negatively,</hi> denyed to his <hi>Apostles,</hi>
as a thing <hi>heathenish</hi> and <hi>carnall;</hi> and so which turnes <hi>Christs</hi>
Spirituall Kingdome into a meere <hi>carnall</hi> and <hi>temporall,</hi> yea <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>heathenish Kingdome. But it shall not be so among you.</hi>
Ergo <hi>Prelates</hi> (as before is noted) <hi>are none of Christs Disciples, and
their Prelacie, or Hierarchy none of his Institution or Ordinance, but
flatly forbidden and condemned by hm.</hi> Now a word of the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part of his Answere, wherein the shews what manner of
men his true <hi>Disciples</hi> must be.</p>
            <p>Verse 27. &amp;c. <hi>But whosoever wilbe great among you, let him be
your Minister: and whosever wilbe chiefe among you, let him be your
Servant:</hi> The Summe is: <hi>Christs Apostles and Disciples must be
humble men,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to their <hi>brethren,</hi> not <hi>Lords over them.</hi>
For these two are opposed one to the other: <hi>Prelacy</hi> is for
<hi>proud men: humility</hi> for <hi>Christs Disciples. Christs Disciples</hi> then,
and <hi>Prelates</hi> cannot stand together. And <hi>pride</hi> is not the way to
come to <hi>sit</hi> the next to <hi>Christs right hand,</hi> but <hi>humility.</hi> He that
is <hi>most humble,</hi> shalbe exalted to the <hi>greatest honour.</hi> As
<hi>Christ</hi>
saith here, <hi>whosoever wilbe chiefe among you, let him be your Minister,</hi>
or <hi>Servant.</hi> That's the way to be the <hi>chiefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, in the next words, <hi>Christ</hi> sets himselfe for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>Even as,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Son of man came not be ministred unto, but
<pb facs="tcp:15739:10"/>
to minister, and to give his life a ransome for many.</hi> And <hi>the Servant
is not above his Lord.</hi> And as <hi>Christ humbled himselfe</hi> below all
men: So <hi>for that cause God hath highly exalted him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1.</note> 
               <hi>and given him
a Name, above every Name, that in the Name of Iesus every knee should
bow,</hi> &amp;c. that is <hi>as Christ made himselfe the Servant of all, So God
hath made him now the Lord of all:</hi> this is that <hi>Name above every
Name:</hi> So as In this Name to <hi>bow,</hi> is not an <hi>hypocriticall</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
bowing</hi> of the <hi>knee</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> when ever the bare
Name <hi>Iesus</hi> is named, when the Name <hi>Christ</hi> is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
but it is an acknowledgement that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Iudge of all, to the glory of God the Father;</hi> as there the
Apostle speakes. So as he there saith,<note n="*" place="margin">ver. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Let the same mind be in
you, which was in Christ Iesus.</hi> Thus true <hi>humility</hi> is the way to
<hi>honour</hi> in <hi>Christs Kingdome:</hi> he that <hi>fits lowest</hi> at <hi>Christs footstoole</hi>
here, shall <hi>sit highest</hi> at his <hi>right hand</hi> in <hi>heaven.</hi> So as this is not
such an <hi>humility,</hi> as was in the Monke, that alwayes went hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down his head, untill at length he came to be Prior, and
then being asked, why now he held up his head: he answered,
<hi>I have now found the Keys of the Covent.</hi> Nor as of another, that
being a Frier, would cover his Table with a piece of an old
Fisher-net, in token of his <hi>humility:</hi> but coming to be Abbat,
he cast away his Net; and being asked why, he said, <hi>I have now
taken the Fish.</hi> Neither are <hi>Christs</hi> words so to be taken, as the
Pope stiles himselfe, <hi>Servus Servorum Dei,</hi> Servant of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God: under which Title he hath made himselfe <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Dominantium,</hi> Lord of Lords. Nor because Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
was the first, that styled himselfe <hi>Servus Servorum Dei,</hi> and his
next Successor but one, <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. got the Title of <hi>Vniversalis
Episcopus,</hi> universall Bishop: therfore <hi>Christ</hi> requires such an
<hi>humility;</hi> as aymes at <hi>temporall promotion.</hi> But he is truly <hi>humble,</hi>
that <hi>denyes himselfe;</hi> and tramples on the worlds preferments,
<hi>preferring Christs rebukes before the treasures of Egypt,</hi> and to <hi>suffer
afflictions with the people of God, rather then to injoy the pleasures of
sinne for a season.</hi> This is that <hi>humility,</hi> which brings us to that
<hi>Recompence of Reward,</hi> to sit at <hi>Christs right hand.</hi> And thus much
of <hi>Christs words,</hi> wherein he declares his <hi>mind</hi> touching <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
so as he never <hi>thought it fittest to governe his Church by Prelates,</hi> as
the said <hi>Archprelate</hi> is not ashamed to bely <hi>him,</hi> and so to <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
him.</hi> Therfore the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is no <hi>Institution of Christ,</hi> and

               <hi>If there be a jealousie or doubt of the Sense of the
Scripture, we must repaire to the Exposition of the Primitive Church,
and submit to that: or call, and submit to a Generall Councel,</hi> &amp;c.
Now, if he shall quarrell this <hi>Scripture,</hi> and those words of
<hi>Christ</hi> forementioned, as being either <hi>jealous</hi> or <hi>doubtfull</hi> of the
sense thereof: and so send me to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> or call
me to a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> for the determination of this point:
what shall we say? For in no case can he yeeld the <hi>Scripture</hi> the
<hi>honour</hi> to be sole Judge of <hi>controversies</hi> in <hi>faith.</hi> And for the
<hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which he meanes, namely that which came
after <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that (he will say) had <hi>Bishops,</hi> or
<hi>Prelates.</hi> And for a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> that by his own verdict,
must consist of <hi>Prelates,</hi> and so then shalbe Judges in their own
cause. Therefore herein I must tell him plainly: that, first, for
the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which was that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> never any
one of them was a <hi>Prelate</hi> or <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> as we shall see
more anon. Secondly, the next ages of the <hi>Church</hi> succeeding
that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> knew no such <hi>Lord Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Prelates,</hi> as
are now adayes, with their Traines and Courts. And when
they began to get <hi>Prelacies,</hi> old <hi>Hierome</hi> reprooved them; and
so did others. Thirdly, never any <hi>Generall Councel</hi> yet conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that <hi>Prelates</hi> were <hi>jure divino.</hi> Fourthly, For a <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi>
now to be called for the determining of this <hi>controversie,</hi>
which must consist onely of <hi>Prelates:</hi> I deny them to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudges</hi> in this Case. For by the <hi>Prelates</hi> own Confession

               <hi>No man ought to be both party and Iudge in his own Cause.</hi> And
again, the<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">pag. 220. 226.</note> 
               <hi>Prelate</hi> is too strict and Canonicall, in tying all men
to the decision of a <hi>Generall Councel,</hi> and to <hi>yeeld obedience</hi> unto
it, yea <hi>although it determine a matter erronious in the Faith.</hi> Now
then if a <hi>Generall Councel</hi> of <hi>Prelates</hi> should determine, that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
are <hi>jure divino,</hi> although it be <hi>erronious,</hi> yet according to the
<hi>Prelates Rule,</hi> all must <hi>yeeld obedience,</hi> and <hi>submit thereunto.</hi> And
then we are gone, if we commit this matter to a <hi>Generall

               </gap> that the <hi>Prelaticall Church of England</hi> is of the saine
<hi>beliefe</hi> with her learned <hi>Champion,</hi> and great <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> But
the <hi>faith</hi> both of the <hi>Prelate</hi> and his Church, in this point, is
notoriously <hi>erronious,</hi> as both is proved before, and which the
<pb facs="tcp:15739:12"/>
               <hi>Prelates</hi> own words here will sufficiently convince of fashood.
For first, <hi>Christ</hi> left none (when he went into heaven) but his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Apostles and Disciples,</hi> such as he inspired with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi>
and <hi>governe his Church.</hi> But the <hi>Prelate</hi> a<note n="*" place="margin">lbid.</note> little after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that one of these <hi>visible Iudges, Arch-bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi>
are <hi>infallible.</hi> Therfore <hi>Christ</hi> left no such <hi>Iudges;</hi> and when he
went into <hi>heaven,</hi> there were no <hi>Prelats</hi> extant, nor yet hatched;
and therfore <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be so much as <hi>thought;</hi> much lesse
<hi>beleeved,</hi> to have left any such <hi>visible Iudges,</hi> as the <hi>Prelate</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth.
Secondly, it cannot be <hi>safe</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
any such to be <hi>visible Iudges</hi> in matters of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> who
are in their <hi>judgement</hi> not onely <hi>erronious,</hi> but in their <hi>affections
malicious</hi> against <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>word,</hi> and his <hi>trile Church.</hi> For the
universall and constant practise of <hi>Prelates</hi> (and especially ever
since <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath been exalted in his Throne) in <hi>persecuting</hi>
the Professors of the Gospell, doth proclaime them to be of
the <hi>malignant</hi> Church, and of<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> the <hi>bendwoman,</hi> that <hi>where of

               </gap>eed doth <hi>persecute</hi> the <hi>true</hi> Church and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>God:</hi> and therefore <hi>Christ</hi> would never appoint such to
be <hi>visible Iudges</hi> in matters of Faith and Religion in his <hi>Church.</hi>
Thirdly, the <hi>Prelate</hi> in making such <hi>visible Iudges besides Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Law-booke,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> (as he saith) <hi>doth hereby deny and exclude
the Scripture from being the Sole Iudge in all matters of Faith and
Religion.</hi> And the Church of <hi>England</hi> formerly before this her
<hi>Metropolitan</hi> started up) was of this <hi>beliefe,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi>
was the <hi>Sole Iudge</hi> and <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and admitted of no other
<hi>Iudges</hi> to sit on the same Bench with it. This the many learned
works of our English Divines, yet extant, can abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie.
Therfore except the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath lost her
<hi>wits,</hi> and hath no more <hi>grace</hi> left her, then the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>faith</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> she cannot be so madde as to beleeve <hi>Christ left</hi>
any such <hi>visible Iudges,</hi> as her <hi>Prelate</hi> speakes of. Fourthly, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
can never be <hi>beleeved</hi> of any sensible man, much lesse of any
even common Christian, that <hi>Christ</hi> would leave notorious
<hi>hypocrites</hi> to be <hi>Iudges</hi> in <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> who under a faire
pretence of <hi>Truth and Peace,</hi> doe labour utterly to destroy both
<hi>Truth and Peace</hi> in his Church. As here, the <hi>Prelate</hi> names
<hi>Truth and Peace,</hi> as the end of his <hi>Hierarchicall Government:</hi> but
his practises doe prove him to be the greatest <hi>enemy</hi> both of
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> that ever Sate in the Chaire of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
For first, for <hi>Truth</hi> (as the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> layd
down in the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:13"/>
not in the <hi>Declaracion</hi> before those 39 <hi>Articles</hi> (but set forth in
the <hi>Kings Name:</hi> for all must be, <hi>under a gracious King</hi>) baffled
it, making the <hi>Articles</hi> to speake nonsense, or in the language
of the <hi>Delphick Oracle,</hi> ambiguous, that may be taken either
way, as favouring the <hi>Arminian,</hi> aswell as the <hi>Orthodox;</hi> so as by
this meanes, his <hi>Arminian</hi> Crew may prove their <hi>Heresies</hi> out
of those <hi>Articles,</hi> aswell as the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> can the <hi>Truth.</hi> Is this
<hi>visible Iudge</hi> then for <hi>Truth?</hi> Againe, how doth he suppresse all
preaching of the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> by terrifying <hi>Ministers</hi> in all
the <hi>Visitations</hi> of these <hi>visible Iudges?</hi> So cleare it is, that he
governes for <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, for <hi>Peace.</hi> What <hi>Peace,</hi> I pray you, hath either the
<hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State of England</hi> had, since this Polypragmatick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to stirre and stickle both in <hi>Church and State?</hi> Nay what
<hi>Peace</hi> hath the Neighbour-Kingdome had, since his Arme hath
been imped out, to put his hot coale under the Eves of that
Church also. So as now, when <hi>Scotland burneth,</hi> is't not time
for <hi>England</hi> to <hi>looke out,</hi> and to cast <hi>on water,</hi> and <hi>to quench the fire,</hi>
not with more fire, to consume all, but by quenching the coale,
that both first <hi>kindled,</hi> and still fomenteth the flame? Thus we
see what a <hi>Governour</hi> here is <hi>under a Gratious King, For Truth and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Peace.</hi> But, fiftly, he addeth, <hi>According to the Scripture.</hi> This
is something. And yet as good as nothing: for he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annexeth, <hi>And her own Canons and Constitutions Canons,</hi> enough
to <hi>batter</hi> the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> to <hi>undermine</hi> and <hi>blow</hi> it
up. For what <hi>Scripture</hi> can stand in any <hi>force,</hi> where his <hi>Canons</hi>
come? And much more, where these <hi>Canons</hi> of his <hi>Church of
England</hi> are seconded by his <hi>Catholike Church:</hi> Wherein his
<hi>Church of England,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> are become (according to
his<note n="*" place="margin">Confe. Epist. Dedicatory, &amp; pag. 376.</note> own words) <hi>one and the Same Church,</hi> of <hi>one and the Same
Faith and Religion.</hi> And thus indeed, the <hi>Church of England</hi> may
enter Common with <hi>Rome</hi> in her <hi>Canons,</hi> as namely in her <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law,</hi> and so make <hi>Corpus Cononicum</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> whereby to
governe this new <hi>Corporation</hi> of the Two Churches now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one againe. So as let but the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be seconded with those of her <hi>Prelates Catholicke Church,</hi>
and then all <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>gone in Common Law.</hi> So vaine is it, that
with <hi>Scripture</hi> he names and yoakes his <hi>Canons of England</hi> and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> by which his Figures of value, he <hi>conjures</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi>
within the circle of a meere Cypher But, Sixtly, he concludes
with this qualification: <hi>which crosse not the Scripture, and the just
Laws of the Realme.</hi> But first, for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> who shalbe Judge
<pb facs="tcp:15739:13"/>
whether the <hi>Canons</hi> doe crosse it? Who but the <hi>Canon-makers,</hi>
and <hi>Canon-masters,</hi> the <hi>Prelates?</hi> And will they trow you <hi>turne
the mouth</hi> of their own <hi>Canons</hi> against themselves? Nay their
<hi>Canons,</hi> though never so crosse to <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet are like to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
his Decree, which though against the <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet rather
then it shalbe broken, <hi>Daniel</hi> must to the <hi>Lions denne,</hi> to try
whether the Lions, or the Kings Decree be more cruell. So
the <hi>Prelates Church Catholick Canons</hi> are like the Laws of the
<hi>Medes and Persians,</hi> all the <hi>Daniels</hi> in the world shall rather to
the <hi>Lions denne,</hi> then the <hi>Canons be reversed.</hi> To give but one
instance for many: That <hi>Canon De Haeretibus comburendis,</hi> Of
Burning the Hereticks (which is one of those speciall <hi>Canons</hi>
of his <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and a most damnable <hi>Canon,</hi> as any in
all the <hi>packe,</hi> and such, as if <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles were now
upon the earth, and did Preach as once they did, they should
by vertue of that <hi>Canon</hi> be brought to the Stake, as <hi>Christ</hi> was

               </note> Law to his Crosse) that <hi>Canon</hi> (I say)
though it crosse the <hi>Scripture</hi> (as being against all true Chisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whom this <hi>Canon</hi> calls <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and burnes for the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>-sake)
yet shall it not be for ever in force, so long as there
is one <hi>Hereticke</hi> remaining upon the face of the <hi>earth,</hi> and one
Pope, or <hi>Prelate</hi> to discharge the <hi>Canon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Prelate</hi> addes, <hi>And the just Laws of the Realme:</hi> If the
said <hi>Canons crosse not the just Laws of the Realme.</hi> This is as good,
as the former, and no better. For what <hi>Laws of the Realme</hi> doth
he account <hi>just?</hi> Those, that crosse any <hi>Prelaticall</hi> practises, and
<hi>Antichristian</hi> lawlesse courses of his <hi>Spirituall Courts?</hi> Surely
those are not to be ranked among the <hi>just Laws of the Realme</hi>
those must needs be <hi>unjust Laws,</hi> which are made to restraine;
the Infolencie and Lawlesse proceedings of <hi>Prelaticall Courts.</hi>
Which is the reason, that now of late, under this <hi>Archprelate,
Prohibitions</hi> out of the <hi>Kings bench</hi> to the <hi>High-Commission</hi> are so
gueason, so well Schooled are both Lawyers to move, and
Judges to grant any such thing. Thus the <hi>Prelates</hi> practises
are a sufficient Commentary of his owne <hi>words.</hi> So as the
Summe of this his whole passage is, <hi>That his Church of England
must submit her beliefe to her Arch Bishops and Bishops, as visible
Iudges left by Christ to governe, and to determine all matters of
difference in point of Faith and Religion, and that according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
too, so farre as they crosse not her own Canons, and those of the
Catholicke Church, wherein</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>are one and the
Same, one Church, of one Faith, of one Religion.</hi> And all this (if we
<pb facs="tcp:15739:14"/>
may beleeve her <hi>Metropolitan</hi>) the <hi>Church of England</hi> beleeves.

            <p>IN his<note n="*" place="margin">pag 15.</note> Epistle Dedicatory he hath these words: <hi>She</hi>
the <hi>Church of England) practises Church-Government, as it
hath been in use in all Ages, and all Places, where the Church of
Christ hath taken any rooting, both in, and ever since the Apostles
times; and yet the Seperatist condemnes her for Antichristianisme in
her Discipline.</hi> So he. A bold Speech, and the more bold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most false, and hath nothing but his bare <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> his
naked affirmation, as Authority sufficient. Whence I note sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> particulars. First that he calleth the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Government</hi> therof, the <hi>Church of England.</hi> A thing fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with <hi>Prelates</hi> to make themselves the Church. And such a
Church as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope and his Priests, or <hi>Prelates,</hi>
are the Church, as themselves affirme. Whereas indeed (as

into the Body, as overspreading it like a Leprosie, it
assumes the denomination of the Body. And such are <hi>Prelates,</hi>
who in the <hi>Church of England</hi> are <hi>Strumae</hi> great <hi>swellings</hi> like the
Kings Evill, which are commonly next the Head, or about the
necke, in the most principall parts of the Body. Onely in this
they will not be called the Kings Evill, because they claime
their Originall from <hi>Christ</hi> (as before is noted) and therfore

deforme the Body, but greatly in danger the <hi>life</hi> thereof, yet
the name of <hi>Church</hi> they challenge in peculiar to themselves.

is as good as his word, which he openly spake at Dr. <hi>Bastwicks</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, where he saith, that his <hi>Church-Government hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
been in use in all Ages, and in all Places, where the Church of Christ
hath taken any rooting, both In, and ever since the Apostles times:</hi>
although this be most <hi>false,</hi> yet were it <hi>true,</hi> it would not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
follow, that this his <hi>Church-Government</hi> is either <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,</hi>
or <hi>jure divino,</hi> or from <hi>Christ.</hi> For first, every thing that<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>
hath been in use in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and in the <hi>true Church of
Christ,</hi> is not therfore <hi>Apostolicke,</hi> or such, as the <hi>true Church of
Christ</hi> alloweth of. For we read, that the <hi>Mistery of Iniquity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to <hi>worke in the Apostles times,</hi> and even then there were
<note n="¬ß" place="margin">2 Thess. 2.</note> many <hi>Antichrists,</hi> and that in the very midst of the Church in

difference between those poore ancient <hi>Bishops,</hi> both in their

manner of <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> and the moderne <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes,</hi>
since <hi>Antichrist</hi> mounted aloft in his Pontificalibus: as the
<note n="*" place="margin">Ovid. Meta.</note> Poet makes between the <hi>Silver Age,</hi> and the <hi>Iron Age:</hi> or as
the<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> Prophet shews between the <hi>brazen brest</hi> of the <hi>Image of
the Babylonish Empire,</hi> and the <hi>feet mixt of iron and clay.</hi> And that
Image may well resemble the State of the <hi>Spirituall Babylon,</hi> or
<hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which had its rise of simple and small beginnings,
but by degrees Successively, it grew and got strength, and both
height and bredth, and so became at length of a blind Brooke,
a goodly navigable River, so as the <hi>Church</hi> turned a <hi>City of
Traffique</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> in all worldly pleasures and riches (as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
is described <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.) and so the more worldly it grew,
the more <hi>wicked, proud, tyrannicall, lordly,</hi> and <hi>imperious,</hi> and of a
<hi>Militant Church</hi> turned <hi>Triumphant</hi> as the <hi>Prelate</hi> himselfe saith
of <hi>Rome</hi> so as now the <hi>Church Government</hi> of the <hi>Prelates</hi> in
regard of their great <hi>Courts,</hi> and <hi>Consistories,</hi> and doing all things
without the <hi>Presbytery<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> is as much unlike that ancient <hi>Church-Government</hi>
of those <hi>Bishops</hi> of old, as our moderne <hi>Prelates</hi>
themselves are unlike them in manner of <hi>life;</hi> for these are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> those were <hi>persecuted,</hi> and suffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome
for <hi>Christ.</hi> Thus it is false, that he saith, <hi>that the
Church-Government now in England was in us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> in the Primitive
Church.</hi> For to instance in one thing: In those ancient Times
<hi>Excommunication</hi> was not used for every trifle, nor done in a
<hi>blind Court,</hi> nor denounced by a <hi>dumb Priest.</hi> But enough of
this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas he saith: <hi>And yet the Seperatist condemnes
her for Antichristianisme in her Discipline.</hi> First, as for the <hi>Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
(as he calls him) I thinke the <hi>Prelate</hi> with this his Book,
and other his <hi>Prelaticall practises</hi> hath made more <hi>Separatists</hi>
from his <hi>Prelaticall Church of England,</hi> then ever any that hath
sit in the Chaire of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ever since his Predecessor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
first sate in it. Nor doe I see, how any Christian living
in <hi>England</hi> can with a safe Conscience have <hi>communion</hi> with
that <hi>Church,</hi> which professeth (as the <hi>Prelate</hi> doth in her Name)
to be <hi>one and the Same Church with Rome,</hi> of <hi>one and the Same
Faith and Religion.</hi> Yea were it no more, but that the <hi>Church of
England</hi> professeth to be a <hi>Hierarchicall</hi> or <hi>Prelaticall Church,</hi>
which in that very respect is no <hi>true Church of Christ,</hi> it were
argument and cause sufficient to Seperate from her. And that
because,</p>
            <p>Secondly, he that is a true <hi>Seperatist</hi> from her, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:15739:15"/>
respects, may justly condemne her for <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> in
her <hi>Discipline,</hi> For first, She exerciseth, She professeth no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
other <hi>Discipline,</hi> but that which <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
whole <hi>Antichristian Romish Church</hi> exerciseth and professeth,
and that in all points Cap a pied, from top to toe. And this
her <hi>Discipline</hi> is <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as being of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and so <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ,</hi> and exercised in the maintenance of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
For instance: The <hi>Prelaticall Church of England</hi> hath lately
found out a <hi>Discipline,</hi> to <hi>censure, punish, imprison, fine, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
degrade deprive,</hi> and all these together, him that shall dare
to deny the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> to be <hi>jure divino.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bastwicke</hi>
did thus: and so the <hi>High-Commission</hi> served him, as aforesaid.
What <hi>Discipline</hi> then in the world can be more <hi>Antichirstian,</hi> or
more forcible to drive Christians from having any more <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with that <hi>Church;</hi> which exercising such an <hi>Antichristian
Discipline,</hi> how can She shift off the just <hi>condemnation</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme,</hi>
which they shall cast upon her? Againe, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the whole <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it is the
<hi>Discipline,</hi> which <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his Church exerciseth, and
therfore <hi>Antichristian:</hi> So it is that, which hath no footing, but
is expresly forbidden in the <hi>word of God,</hi> as <hi>Antichristian</hi> and
<hi>Tyrannicall.</hi> For the <hi>Church of Englands Discipline</hi> stands most
upon the <hi>imposition</hi> of sundry <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>humane invention,</hi> and
<hi>Antichristian observation,</hi> which She presseth upon all mens
Consciences, and for default of <hi>Conformity,</hi> layes grievous Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
upon them, as <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and the like. Now all
such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> so imposed, both <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe condemneth,
<note n="*" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>t. 15. 9.</note>
               <hi>In vaine they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men:</hi> and the Apostle also throughout that whole
Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Collossians</hi> doth charge Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
not to put their necks under any such yoake, as whereby
they are deprived of the benefit of <hi>Christs death,</hi> and <hi>beguiled of
their reward,</hi> and <hi>spoyled</hi> of their <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and the like.
Againe, the <hi>Prelates</hi> in imposing their Ceremonies are <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi>
because in so doing, they usurpe <hi>Christs throne,</hi> and
therein <hi>fitting,</hi> doe exercise a Tyranny over mens Consciences,
intolerable to be borne; which if men will not yeeld unto,
they doe in as much as in them lyeth, make them <hi>Anathemaes,</hi>
shut them out of the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> &amp;c. And
lastly, their <hi>Excommunication,</hi> not onely in regard of the <hi>matter</hi>
and <hi>cause,</hi> for which it is, namely, because men will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>Christs service,</hi> to take the Tyrannicall yoake of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:16"/>
Ceremonies upon the shoulders of their Consciences,
but for the very manner of it, as it is used in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is a <hi>Discipline Antichristian,</hi> as being against that form of
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> which is prescribed in the <hi>word of God,</hi> and
was practised in the Apostolicall Churches. It was <hi>Christs rule,
Tell it to the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Congregation;</hi> and if the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will not heare the <hi>Congregation,</hi> he is <hi>Excommunicate</hi> by and
out of the <hi>Congregation.</hi> And the Apostles rule is, for such
Offenders as deserve <hi>Excommunication:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>I verily</hi> (saith he) <hi>as
absent in body, but present in Spirit, have judged already, as though I
were present, concerning him, that hath so done this deed: In the Name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit,
with the power of our Lord Iesus Christ, to deliver such a one unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the
day of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Whence I note, that <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is a Solemne businesse, not to be inflicted for every <hi>trifling
matter,</hi> much lesse as the Pharisees did, who <hi>excommunicated</hi> all
those, that confessed <hi>Christ;</hi> nor to be done in a blind Court,
and by a single soled Priest, nor the Offender to be released for
the payment of his <hi>fees,</hi> or by way of <hi>committing,</hi> or the like: all
which are practised in the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
But <hi>Excommunication</hi> must not be, but for a great <hi>offence;</hi> nor
done, but by the <hi>whole Congregation,</hi> nor released, but upon the
publique <hi>repentance, confession,</hi> and <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>reformation</hi> before
the said <hi>Congregation,</hi> where the <hi>offence</hi> was given, and by whom
the <hi>penalty</hi> is taken off. Therfore the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of
England</hi> in this case is wholly <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, forasmuch as <hi>Prelates</hi> doe necessarily draw after them
a Traine of Ceremonies, as a Chaine of so many links, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they <hi>captivate, ensnare,</hi> and <hi>enslave</hi> the Consciences of men
(as their Motto is, <hi>No Ceremonie, no Bishop:</hi> for they goe inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably
together, like <hi>Tobie,</hi> and his Dogge) and the <hi>Church of
England</hi> in her <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Church-Service,</hi> is wholly capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by the Masters of such Ceremonies, the <hi>Prelates:</hi> and
some Ceremonies are such, as even doe deny the <hi>Lord that
bought them,</hi> as namely, <hi>Altars,</hi> and their <hi>Service:</hi> and all the
Ceremonies imposed upon the Conscience, deny <hi>Christ</hi> to be
the onely <hi>King of his Church:</hi> all these taken together, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and between their Ceremonies, the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> and her <hi>Discipline</hi> is become <hi>Antichristian;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no marvail, if for this cause, good Christians, that have

with any such Church.</p>

because</hi> De Jure <hi>they have no Power given.</hi> According to

               <hi>Behold</hi> (saith the <hi>Lord</hi>) <hi>I am against the
Prophets, that steale my word every one from his Neighbour. Behold I
am against the Prophets, saith the Lord, that use their tongues, and
say, He Saith. Behold I am against them that prophecie false dreames,
saith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their
lyes, and by their lightnesse, yet I sent them not, nor commanded them
therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.</hi> And this:
is the very case of the <hi>Prelates;</hi> they are <hi>faise Prophets, they steale
Gods word from the people of God,</hi> and instead thereof use their
<hi>own word, prophecying false dreames,</hi> saying, <hi>The Lord saith, the Lord
hath sent us, we have our Calling and Authority from God over all
Ministers,</hi> we are <hi>the sole living visible Iudges in matters of Faith
and Religion, so as all must rest in our Iudgement,</hi> according to our

            <p>But Secondly, the <hi>Prelate</hi> saith, that his <hi>Prelaticall Iurisdiction
over the inferiour Clergie, was a thing of known use and benefit for
preservation of unity and Peace in the</hi> Church. Now first, for his
<hi>Inferiour Clergie. Clergie</hi> being appropriated to the <hi>Ministry</hi> is
an abusive Monopoly, and <hi>usurpation;</hi> for all <hi>Gods</hi> people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed

                  </gap>nheritance,</hi> whereof
the word <hi>Clergie</hi> is derived. As <hi>Peter</hi> saith, writing to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>

<hi>Inferiour Clergie:</hi> he meanes his <hi>Priests,</hi> and the rest, as <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,</hi> and so forth, to the number of 7 Orders, as they call
them. A rabble of Orders not unsutable to the Subjects of a

holy Orders <hi>Christ</hi> hath left in his Church, we shall see anon.
Thirdly, <hi>this was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a thing of known use and benefit.</hi> Of
the <hi>known use</hi> we have formerly spoken. But now, what's the
<hi>benefit?</hi> Namely, for the <hi>preservation of unity and peace in the
Church.</hi> How proves he this? From S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who said, <hi>That
one was chosen over the rest</hi> in Sckismatis remedium, <hi>to remedy
<pb facs="tcp:15739:17"/>
Schisme in the Church.</hi> But by the way, these very words of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
doe argue, that <hi>Prelates</hi> were of <hi>humane Institution:</hi> for

more expresly, which the <hi>Prelate</hi> wisely passeth over dry foot,
where he saith, <hi>that Prelacy was set up</hi> humana praesumptione,

               </hi> Tell me, if thou thy selfe wert a Lion, what manner
of man wouldst thou be? So the <hi>Prelate</hi> imagines, that if any
of those, that speake against the Authority <hi>of Prelates,</hi> were
themselves <hi>Lions</hi> that is, <hi>Lord Prelates,</hi> they would be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind, they would then say, <hi>We Prelates have Authority over
all Inferiour Priests,</hi> Jure Divino; <hi>we are the Sole visible living Iudges
<pb facs="tcp:15739:18"/>
to determine and resolve all doubts in matters of Faith and Religion;
we are the Sole Masters of Ceremonies, to bind all men to Canonicall
obedience to all our Canons and Constitutions:</hi> we enjoy <hi>honours,
pleasures, riches, ease, delights</hi> of the world, <hi>favours</hi> in Court, and
what not? Thus the <hi>Prelate</hi> thinks all men would be of his
mind, were they in his Place. And I thinke so too, thus farre,
that they who take upon them the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they no sooner sit
in that Chaire, but it proves a Chaire of Pestilence unto them,
infecting and corrupting mans very <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi> so
farre, as to make him beleeve all is gold that glistereth. Onely
few come to that Chaire, but such as are <hi>selfe-infected</hi> with
their own imbred Plagues, as <hi>pride, Ambition, Covetousnesse,</hi> and
that in a high Degree. So as King <hi>Iames</hi> being once asked, why
he had made so many <hi>Bishops,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not one <hi>honest man</hi>
amongst them all: he replyed, saying, <hi>By his Saule there was never
an Honest Man wad tack a Bishopricke.</hi> And Histories tell us of
many <hi>holy men,</hi> that utterly refused <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> And there is
never a true <hi>Reformed Protestant Minister,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid Espencae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Tim.</note> but hates a <hi>Bishoprick,</hi>

That I must now contradict. For first (as before is shewed)
<hi>Christ</hi> forbad it upon the first motion of it. Secondly, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of which we shall speake by and by) mightily <hi>contradicted</hi>
it, and cryed it down, as being that monstrous <hi>mystery of Iniquity.</hi>
And thirdly, it was <hi>contradicted</hi> by sundry; as by <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But you
will presently say, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ranks him (even for that very
opinion only, that he held <hi>Prelates</hi> not to be <hi>de jure divino,</hi> or
that the Degree of a <hi>Bishop</hi> was no greater, then that of a
Priest) in the Catalogue of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And so am I also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
upon the same termes, to be by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> counted for
an <hi>Hereticke.</hi> But Secondly, himselfe confesseth S. <hi>Ierome</hi> to
have <hi>contradicted</hi> their <hi>Authority;</hi> as we noted before; saying,
<hi>that their Institution was meerly of humane Presumption.</hi> Yea and
thirdly <hi>Augustine</hi> (that Famous <hi>light</hi>) was of the same mind

it was, and had been, and that by many, and some of them (as
<hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles) of <hi>Divine and Infallible Authority.</hi> So as
without all Controversie, <hi>Prelaticall Authority</hi> over other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
is no Calling <hi>of God</hi> at all; which we now come more

words it is manifest, First, <hi>that Presbyters and Bishops are all one
and the same Order, Calling and Office.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that in the Church
of</hi> Ephesus <hi>there were many Bishops, or Presbyters.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that
they had their Calling from the Holy Ghost.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>that their

are those <hi>Episcopi?</hi> What more contrary to their <hi>Canons,</hi> and
practise: For First, they doe not allow, that every <hi>Presbyter</hi> be
called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor to be of the same Order, Calling, and Office.
For they say, that the Order, Calling, and Office of a <hi>Bishop</hi> or
<hi>Prelate</hi> is distinct and different from that of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the <hi>Prelates</hi> have an old <hi>Canon,</hi> that there must be but
one <hi>Bishop</hi> in one City, or Diocese. But here we see the
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that one City had many <hi>Bishops</hi> in it, even
as many as there were <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Thirdly, our <hi>Prelates</hi> can
never prove their Authority and Office to be from the Holy
Ghost either from any <hi>inward calling,</hi> or <hi>outward.</hi> Not from an
<hi>inward calling,</hi> because, first, it is not any <hi>zeale of Gods glory,</hi> or
desire to win soules to <hi>God,</hi> but it is the strong bias of <hi>ambition</hi>
and <hi>covetousnesse, pride,</hi> and <hi>vaine glory,</hi> and <hi>love of the world,</hi> that
draws them to a <hi>Bishopricke.</hi> Nor Secondly, is it an <hi>outward
calling</hi> from men. For as in respect of <hi>God,</hi> they have <hi>run; afore
they be sent:</hi> So in respect of Man, they <hi>come before they be called.</hi>
Yea they provide and prepare a long time before for such a
Purchase. For they heap up by hook or crock 3 or 4 Fat Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they seldome Preach at any of them, nor keep <hi>Residence,</hi>
or <hi>Hospitality,</hi> but hoord up full Bagges, Sculke at the Court,

               </gap>gratiate themselves with those in greatest Grace, and when
the Chaire is voyd, they bring out their Bagges, and so they ar
the onely qualified men for such a Dignity. They are well
known to be no <hi>Puritans.</hi> So as neither according to their own
ancient Canons (which were framed according to the practise
held in the Apostles dayes, when the People had a voyce in
the <hi>election</hi> of their <hi>Pastors</hi>) have the <hi>Prelates</hi> an <hi>outward calling</hi> to
their <hi>dignities.</hi> For instance; when Mr. <hi>Moutague</hi> was to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled
(or I wot not what they call it) in <hi>Bow Church,</hi> and the
<hi>Tipstaffe</hi> (according to the Ancient custome in that Case) with
his Mace proclaimes open <hi>liberty</hi> for any, that can come and
except against the <hi>worthinesse</hi> of that Man; one stood forth, and
<pb facs="tcp:15739:19"/>
made his <hi>exception;</hi> which though it was both legall, and very
<hi>materiall,</hi> yet he was borne down, and the <hi>matter</hi> never came to
<hi>tryall,</hi> but was carryed with a strong hand for the new <hi>Prelate.</hi>

the <hi>Prelates</hi> are the most egregious <hi>Non-residents,</hi> of

but <hi>Prelates</hi> call themselves <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> having so many

all <hi>Ministers to feed their Flocke</hi> at all in the Afternoone on

doores, 2. <hi>Dives</hi> suffered his <hi>dogs</hi> to shew so much compassion,

<hi>dogs</hi> at the true <hi>Lazarusses,</hi> to teare them in pieces; 3. <hi>Lazarus</hi>
brought his <hi>sores</hi> with him, <hi>Dives</hi> did not cause them: but our
<hi>Lord Prelates</hi> doe fill <hi>Gods Lazarusses</hi> full of <hi>wounds,</hi> which they
carry away with them, not scaping from their Gates with a
whole Skin; 4. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was willingly layd at <hi>Dives</hi> his gates:
but <hi>Gods Lazarusses</hi> never come to the <hi>Lord-Bishops</hi> Gates, but
with an ill will, when they are hayld and pull'd; 5. <hi>Dives</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
his Crummes, to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> because they were of his bread
to <hi>feed</hi> his <hi>dogs:</hi> but the <hi>Prelates</hi> doe not onely deny any one
Crumme of <hi>mercy,</hi> when they are offended, or to doe <hi>right</hi>
when the <hi>Lazarusses</hi> are <hi>injured:</hi> but they doe also rob, pill and

            <p>FOr the more cleare demonstration hereof, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Practise of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in a twofold notion:
1. the Practise of their <hi>Ministry:</hi> 2. the Practise of their

<pb facs="tcp:15739:23"/>
Of these being to speake, we will first consider the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
two wayes: 1. as they were <hi>Apostles:</hi> and 2. as they were
<hi>Ministers.</hi> First, as they were <hi>Apostles,</hi> to speake in a strict and
proper sence, they left no Successors behind them. For as
<hi>Apostles,</hi> 1. they had their immediate Calling from <hi>Christ:</hi>
2. they did<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 1.</note> see <hi>Christ</hi> with their bodily eyes: 3. they were
inspired immediately from <hi>Christ</hi> with Apostolicall Gifts and
Graces of the Holy Ghost,<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Iohn 16. 13.</note> which <hi>led them into all truth,</hi> so
as their <hi>judgement</hi> was <hi>infallible,</hi> they could not erre: 4. they
were made the Pen-men of the Scripture: 5. They had a
power given them to appoint Euangelists to attend their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship
in the Gospell, to settle and <hi>water,</hi> where the <hi>Apostles</hi>
had <hi>planted,</hi> and where they appointed them: 6. They had<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Act. 8. 26. &amp; 16. 6.</note>

               <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did more particularly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of them to severall Countries. Now in all these respects
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>Apostles</hi> left no Successors behind them. For
after the decease of <hi>Apostles,</hi> and so also of the <hi>Euangelists</hi> (some
whereof writ the Gospell, and some preached the Gospell,
and did other things at the <hi>Apostles</hi> appointment; whereof we
shall have occasion to speake more anon) their Office of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
and Euangelists, ceased. So as, never since they lived, have
there beene any <hi>Apostles</hi> or Euangelists, properly so called.
Though in a generall notion all true Preachers of the Gospell,
in asmuch as they have a Calling from <hi>God,</hi> being sent of him,
though mediately by the Church, may be called <hi>Apostoli,</hi> that
is, sent, (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> called <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>

               <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Messengers:</hi> and they may be

Preachers of the Gospell. But I say, strictly and properly the
<hi>Apostles</hi> onely were called <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the Euangelists Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
for the reasons aforesaid. So as after their decease, the
ordinary Ministers of the Word which <hi>God</hi> appointed to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them in their Ministry, were called <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi>
as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. and somtimes <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Overseers,</hi>

as aforesaid) and somtimes<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">An. 26. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:15739:24"/>
So as in the Second place we come to speake of the practise
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as they were <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
all <hi>true Ministers</hi> imitating, are said to be their <hi>true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi>
But before we speake thereof, one Objection crosseth
us in our way, which is this. We noted before, that one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

               </hi> properly so called, was,
that he had the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> immediately inspired into him by
<hi>Christ,</hi> so as it <hi>led him into all truth,</hi> that he could not erre in his
preaching, or writing of the <hi>word of God.</hi> Now it is Objected,
<hi>that the promise of</hi>

               <hi>Christs Spirituall presence, and so of the Holy

all their true Successors to the end of the world.</hi> Upon which
<hi>promise</hi>

            <p>For Answere<note place="margin">Answer.</note> hereunto briefly. First, neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor
any <hi>Prelate,</hi> have any thing to doe with this <hi>promise.</hi> For they

remaines yet further to be cleared Secondly, concerning this
<hi>promise</hi> made immediately by <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that he <hi>would
be with them to the end of the world,</hi> and that the <hi>Holy Ghost should
lead them into all truth:</hi> we must distinguish between the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all Succeeding <hi>true Ministers.</hi> First, this <hi>promise</hi> was

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ly fullfilled to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> so as they neither erred in
their <hi>preaching,</hi> nor in their <hi>writing of the word of God;</hi> and the
substance of all their <hi>preaching</hi> (so farre as it is necessary for the
<hi>salvation of Gods Chruch to the end of the world</hi>) is by them left in
<hi>writing</hi> to be a rule of our <hi>faith,</hi> and the ground of all <hi>holy</hi> and

<hi>Apostles</hi> in all ages, and also all <hi>true Beleevers,</hi> though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receive the <hi>Holy Ghost inmiediately</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>

e'x o`p√©r e`isi: All things are nourished by selfe same Substance,
whereof they are begotten,</hi> or <hi>have their beginning</hi> or <hi>beeing:</hi> So in
a sort it may truly be said, <hi>that as we begin Spiritually to live by the
Holy Ghost through Faith by the Preaching of the word of God: So this
Holy Ghost in the severall graces and operations there of is preserved, and
as it were nourished in us by the continuall ministration of the food of
the same word in our Soules:</hi> Or in a word, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath no
<hi>operation</hi> in us, either for <hi>instruction,</hi> or <hi>illumination,</hi> or <hi>consolation,</hi>
or <hi>corroboration</hi> of any Grace in our Soules, but in and by, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>word of God.</hi> So as besides <hi>Gods written word,</hi>
there are no <hi>revelations</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be expected in <hi>Gods true
Church.</hi> Secondly therefore, the <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to
<hi>Christs true Church</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> succeeding the <hi>Apostles</hi> even to
the end of the world, is made good to all and every particular
member of <hi>Christs</hi> Mysticall body, whether Ministers or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
so as in the matter of their <hi>faith,</hi> and whatsoever appertains
to their <hi>salvation,</hi> they are by <hi>Christs Spirit guided into all truth,</hi>
being led by the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Gods word,</hi> which to those that

            <p>Come we now to prosecute the remainder of the former
particulars propounded: the second generall whereof is, the
Practise of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as they were Ministers of the Gospell,
whose example all <hi>true Ministers</hi> imitating, are said to be their
true Successors. And first of this Practise in regard of <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
to wit, in their <hi>Ministy of the Word,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> First for their
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> it was sound and sincere, the very <hi>word of God,</hi> which
they preached with all diligence, and good Conscience; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
other <hi>Ministers</hi> also to the like <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
in preaching: as 2 <hi>Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God, and the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Preach the word, be instant, in

thus? First, do they preach <hi>diligently?</hi> Are their Sermons,
any more, then 2 or 3 Festivalls in the yeare? And doe they
preach sound Doctrine? Nay as the <hi>Apostle</hi> there saith, <hi>They
will not indure sound doctrine;</hi> they neither preach it themselves,
nor permit others. And instead of <hi>exhorting Ministers</hi> to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi>
in <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> the <hi>people,</hi> they flatly forbid them
to preach so of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en, as twice on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or to expound the
<hi>Catechisine,</hi> for instructing the People. Thus they are enemies
of <hi>Gods word,</hi> and so of the <hi>salvation of Gods people.</hi> Are these
men then <hi>Successors of the Apostles?</hi> Againe, for the <hi>two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> administred them duly according to<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23</note>

Now doth the <hi>Prelaticall Catholicke Church,</hi> (wherein that of
<hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Rome are both one and the same, and doe professe one
and the same faith and Religion,</hi> as our great <hi>Prelate</hi> saith; noted
before) thus? Now <hi>Romes detractions</hi> and <hi>additions,</hi> we all know.
But what hath the <hi>Prelaticall Church of England</hi> done in this

from the <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> while they set dumb <hi>Priests,</hi>

administer that, neere the Belfrey, or Church-door, the lowest
part of the Church, as they estimate it: and this at the end of
the Chancel, their highest part of the Church? Secondly, do
they not alter <hi>Christs institution</hi> by adding to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of

which is to be administred as a <hi>supper,</hi> on a <hi>Table,</hi> not as a

of <hi>kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eling</hi> at the receiving of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> whereby they
overthrow the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Supper.</hi> To omit their necessity of

bed:</hi> would they not also of<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">
                  <hi>As in Dr.</hi> Coosins <hi>Booke</hi> of Private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, <hi>or</hi> Canonicall, Houres.</note> late yeares have brought againe

be unlike in their <hi>practise,</hi> as they are not in <hi>profession,</hi> as
our said <hi>Prelate</hi> saith: Thus are our <hi>Prelates</hi> herein Successors
of the <hi>Apostles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Apostles practise</hi> in point of <hi>Discipline.</hi> And
this is either in <hi>Ordination of Ministers,</hi> or <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of manners,</hi> or <hi>imposition of Ceremonies.</hi> For the first, <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Ministers,</hi> we read, of <hi>Timothies ordination</hi> no lesse by
the <hi>imposition of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> then of <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe.
<hi>Titus</hi> indeed was appointed by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>ordaine Elders in every
City</hi> in <hi>Creet</hi> (as was noted before) but if he did this alone,
<pb facs="tcp:15739:26"/>
without the <hi>Presbytery, 2 necessity</hi> must needs be supposed, which
is neither Rule nor Law in ordinary Cases. And by the way,
whether <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>thy</hi> were <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> as the <hi>Prelates</hi>
pretend, we shall see in a more fit place. And for <hi>Ordination</hi>
this we are sure of, that whoever have the charge of it, <hi>Prelates</hi>
have nothing at all to doe with it, because (as is already
proved) they are no <hi>lawfull Ministers of Christ,</hi> much lesse Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Againe, whom did the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
ordaine <hi>Ministers of the word,</hi> but such, as were every way
qualified with <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> for <hi>preaching,</hi> and the like; as we
see prescribed in 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1? They were not like to <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams

               <hi>dumb dogs</hi> (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> calls them) <hi>blind

never satisfied</hi> with heaping up Living upon Living, <hi>they fill
themselves with strong drinke, and are good Fellows,</hi> not good <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</hi>
Yea such as are truly qualified, either <hi>Prelates</hi> doe not
<hi>ordaine</hi> them: or they doe <hi>afterwards,</hi> seeing how they prove
painfull in their <hi>Ministry,</hi> put them to <hi>silence,</hi> or <hi>suspend</hi> and
<hi>persecute</hi> them, as before is noted. And againe Thirdly, The
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> in their time, <hi>Ordayned</hi> none for money;
for offering whereof<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Act. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was accursed; but our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
Ordaine</hi> tag and rag for money, so as the ordinary Fees
come to 3, 4, 5, or 6 pounds. So as in point of <hi>Ordination</hi> how
doe our <hi>Prelates</hi> prove themselves to be Successors of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi>
And lastly, the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>lawfull successors Ordained</hi>
none, but lawfull <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospell: but our <hi>Prelates</hi> do
<hi>ordaine</hi> a new Order of <hi>Priests,</hi> bringing in, and setting up a new
<hi>Priesthood,</hi> which is <hi>Antichristian,</hi> not having any <hi>foundation</hi> in
the <hi>Sccripture. Prelates</hi> therefore in <hi>Ordrnation</hi> are no Successors
of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for matter of <hi>Censure,</hi> or for <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Manners,</hi> as for instance, in the <hi>Censure of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> though as <hi>Apostles,</hi> they might doe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet as <hi>Ministers</hi> they did it not, but with the whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi>
or else the <hi>Congregation</hi> with the <hi>Presbyters;</hi> as we see
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 3. 4. 5. Insomuch, as even <hi>Prelates</hi> themselves, after
they first had taken <hi>footing,</hi> as being the time of <hi>their Innocency</hi>
(as I may say) observed this Order. So as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived
about 250. yeares after <hi>Christs nativity,</hi> would doe nothing in
this kind, without the consent both of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>people.</hi>
This lasted during the 10. <hi>Persecutions:</hi> but <hi>Peace and Prosperity</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:26"/>
Succeding, it <hi>degenerated</hi> into that height of <hi>Tyranny</hi> by degrees<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
to which we see it arrived at this day. Secondly, <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
was for weighty Causes, as in the same place; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 20. The <hi>Apostles</hi> had no <hi>Prelates Courts,</hi> or <hi>Consistories,</hi> where
they did <hi>Privately</hi> by themselves, or by a <hi>dumb Priest Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatt</hi>
for every <hi>trifle,</hi> and especially for the least breach of a
<hi>Canon,</hi> and the like (as we noted before) but the <hi>Consistory</hi> was
the whole <hi>Congregation</hi> solemnly assembled, where no <hi>Censure</hi>
was imposed, but for <hi>great offences,</hi> and those breaches of <hi>Gods</hi>
Laws, and of <hi>Christs</hi> Ordinance. Nor were those <hi>Censures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi>
but in and by the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> after publick <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
given by the <hi>offender</hi> to the <hi>offended.</hi> Whereas our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
in all, doe quite contrary, <hi>absolving</hi> also <hi>great offenders</hi> for
a <hi>fee,</hi> without any signes of <hi>Repentance,</hi> much lesse fruits of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and <hi>satisfaction</hi> made to the <hi>Congregation offended.</hi>
Whereas the <hi>Apostles absolved</hi> none, before the <hi>Congregation</hi> was
first <hi>satisfied by,</hi> and so <hi>pacified towards</hi> the <hi>offender;</hi> as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
10. Do our <hi>Prelates</hi> thus? No such thing. Therfore no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, for <hi>Imposition of Ceremonies</hi> in the <hi>worship of God,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> were so farre from laying any <hi>such yoake,</hi> upon <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
necks,</hi> or any such snares for their <hi>feet,</hi> as they did utterly
condemne all <hi>humane Rites</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> whatsoever in <hi>Gods
service,</hi> laying also a speciall charge upon <hi>Christians</hi> not to put
their <hi>necks</hi> under such <hi>yoakes,</hi> unlesse thereby they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

of God,</hi> so as he shews it to be a very Apostacy from <hi>Christ,</hi>
of such as <hi>hold not the Head:</hi> with what face can our <hi>Lord Prelates</hi>
(the <hi>great Masters</hi> of all manner of <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi>
both <hi>Iewish,</hi> and <hi>Heathenish, Romish</hi> and <hi>Antichristian Ceremonies</hi>)
beare themselves to be the Successors of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> while not
onely they erect such <hi>Superstitions,</hi> but with all rigour impose
them upon mens Consciences as a most insupportable <hi>burthen,</hi>
and <hi>intolerable bondage,</hi> and with all <hi>severity</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> inflict
terrible <hi>punishments</hi> upon those, that refuse to performe the
<hi>Tasks</hi> of such <hi>Egyptian Taskmasters?</hi> Or how dare they affirme,
that they have such their <hi>Iurisdiction from Christ,</hi> while in so
doing, usurping such a Power over mens Consciences, they
thrust <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> out of his <hi>Throne?</hi> But we shall have occasion
to speake more of this hereafter. Thus we see in the meane
time what kind of <hi>Vice-Roys of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Successors of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
the <hi>Prelates</hi> prove themselves to be, in Lording over the
Consciences of <hi>Gods people</hi> by their <hi>Superstitious Ceremonies,</hi> and
<hi>Romish Rites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps they will object the <hi>Apostles determination</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi>
15.) concerning the <hi>Gentiles</hi> newly <hi>converted</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> that
they should <hi>abstaine from eating of blood,</hi> and <hi>things strangled,
which was a Mosaicall Rite.</hi> To which I answere: First, that the
<hi>Apostles</hi> in the<note n="¬ß" place="margin">v. 10.</note> same place do shew, that that <hi>burthen</hi> of <hi>Legall
Ceremonies</hi> was removed by the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> and buried in
his Grave. Secondly, they did this, in regard of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
which dwelt among those <hi>Christians,</hi> for the time being for
peace-sake, untill the<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">v. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Christian Iews</hi> were better confirmed in
the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>knowledge of Christ.</hi> Thirdly, they did it by the
speciall direction of the<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">v. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for the reason alledged.
So as that example being <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and for the time of the
Infancie of the Gospell, it is no rule for us to follow now,
after so long a shining forth of the Gospell. And I might
adde this moreover, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not this alone, but
with the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>

all their <hi>prudence</hi> in <hi>taking up that,</hi> which belongs not unto
them, they shew themselves very <hi>unfaithfull,</hi> while they follow
not the <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in determining alone, and not

he puts his <hi>Devotion,</hi> and his <hi>Devotion</hi> stands in his <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> which he saith must not be <hi>too few,</hi> for <hi>then they leave his Service

<pb facs="tcp:15739:28"/>
               <hi>Antiquity</hi> was the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity;</hi> if that will doe them any
pleasure. This we generally touched before in the Third
Chapter.</p>
            <p>But for the Second, <hi>That the Prelacie is this Mystery of Iniquity,</hi>
let us a little examine what is meant by this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi>
This <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> is opposed to the <hi>Mystery of Godlinesse,</hi>
of which the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Iniquity</hi> is opposit to
<hi>Godlinesse:</hi> but both <hi>Godlinesse</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi> are called a <hi>Mystery.</hi>
Yet in a different respect. The <hi>Mystery of Godlinesse</hi> is so called,
because of its deepnesse, and difficulty to be understood, but
by <hi>Gods</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit</hi> reuealing the same: but the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi>
is so called, because <hi>Iniquity</hi> is vailed under a pretence and
shew of <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> by which<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Rev. 13. 8. 2 Thes. 2. 10.</note> many are deceived,<note n="¬ß" place="margin">Mat. 24. 5.</note> 
               <hi>whose
names are not written in the booke of life.</hi> As <hi>Christ</hi> saith,‚Ä† <hi>Many
shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.</hi>
And thus doe all <hi>Prelates</hi> come in <hi>Christs Name,</hi> while they
pretend <hi>Christs Authority,</hi> and usurpe <hi>Christs throne</hi> over his
People. And the great <hi>Antichrist</hi> is so called, because though
he be <hi>against Christ,</hi> yet he saith, he is <hi>for Christ,</hi> as being <hi>Christs
Vicar;</hi> even as <hi>Antichristus</hi> in the Greeke is a compound word,
the Preposition <hi>Anti</hi> signifying both <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>instead,</hi> and <hi>against.</hi>
And so is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in <hi>pretence for Christ,</hi> but in <hi>practise against
Christ:</hi> and so are all our <hi>Prelates;</hi> as shall yet further appeare.
And this is truly and properly the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi> In which
respect the <hi>Turke,</hi> and other profest Enemies of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> cannot come within the compasse of this
<hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> and so cannot be <hi>full Antichrists,</hi> because they
doe <hi>gumme kephale,</hi> openly, without any <hi>vaile,</hi> professe this <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> of being <hi>Adversaries to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the further <hi>application</hi> of this <hi>Mysterie of Iniquity</hi> to
the <hi>Prelates,</hi> we come to the <hi>third Proposition:</hi> That, <hi>What is
spoken of the great Antichrist himselfe, is spoken of all Prelates, as
members of the same Head, or as so many inferiour antichrists, though
in themselves great enough.</hi> Let us therefore see the <hi>properties</hi> of
<hi>Antichrist</hi> here described by the <hi>Apostle.</hi> First he is called, <hi>That
man of Sinne:</hi> And this is <hi>Antichrist</hi> in two respects: 1. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of himselfe, as being <hi>carnall, proud, covetous, ambitious, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,</hi>
and a most <hi>malicious hater,</hi> and most <hi>cruel persecuter</hi> of
the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Servants of Christ,</hi> a proper Sinne of <hi>Antichrist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
These Sinnes and Lusts are the proper Sinnes of a <hi>Prelate,</hi> and
common to every <hi>Prelate,</hi> and especially those of the latter
Stamp, since <hi>Antichrist</hi> mounted aloft, now for above 600.
<pb facs="tcp:15739:28"/>
yeares, yea a 1000. yeares from <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. Secondly, <hi>Antichrist</hi>
is <hi>that man of Sin,</hi> in respect of others, as being a prime instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of causing others to Sin: as by giving <hi>Indulgence, Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi>
and <hi>Liberty</hi> to men to Sin, and by suppressing the means
whereby they should be kept from Sin. The <hi>Pope</hi> is notorious
for this. And our <hi>Prelates</hi> come not farre behind him. For
they allow <hi>profane sports</hi> on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> by which the 4th <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi>
is broken: and that to Servants and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ldren so as
their Parents and Masters may not restraine them; which is a
manifest breach of the Fift <hi>Commandement:</hi> so as by this means
many other <hi>Commandements</hi> are broken in committing many
Sinnes. Thus they both<note n="*" place="margin">Math<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> breake the <hi>greatest Commandements,</hi>
and teach men so. Againe instead of <hi>suppessing</hi> of <hi>sports,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
and Suppresse the Preaching of <hi>Gods word,</hi> whereby men
should be kept from Sinne, and learne to <hi>live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world, denying all ungodlinesse and worldly
lusts.</hi> Thus <hi>Antichrist is that man of Sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Antichrist</hi> is called the <hi>Son of Perdition</hi> For as he
is <hi>that man of Sinne:</hi> so by consequence he is <hi>that Son of Perdition'</hi>
and that in both the foresaid respects, as of Sinning, so of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing:
for as <hi>he both Sins himselfe,</hi> and <hi>causes others to Sin:</hi> so he
both <hi>perisheth</hi> himselfe, and causeth others to <hi>perish,</hi> as 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
2. 10. And this is proper to the <hi>Pope</hi> in the first place, whose
necessity of perishing is such, that himselfe confesseth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of amendment. As is noted of <hi>Adrian</hi> 6. who said,
<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Concil. Trid. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That the condition of Popes was miserable, seeing it was evident,
that they could not doe good, though they desired and indeavoured it
never so much.</hi> And Pope<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">In Platina, of the lives of the Popes.</note> 
               <hi>Marcell</hi> flapping his hand on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
said, <hi>It was impossible, that any one Sitting in that Chaire could
be Saved.</hi> And his own <hi>Decretalls</hi> say, <hi>That if the Pope carry with
him millions of Soules to be tormented with the great Devil, no man
may reprove him.</hi> So incorrigible he is. And this is according
to <hi>Christs</hi> saying,<note n="¬ß" place="margin">Mat. 19. 24.</note> 
               <hi>That it is easier for a Camel to goe through the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ye of a needle, then for a Rich man to goe into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>
And are <hi>Prelates</hi> in any better condition? Is there any more
hope of them, then of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that ever they can or will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</hi>
If they will <hi>repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> indeed, that they may not be the Sons
of <hi>perdition,</hi> either in themselves, or also in others, they must
get them out of the <hi>Chaire of Pestilence,</hi> they must in one word,
abandon their <hi>Prelacie,</hi> and <hi>Prelaticall practises.</hi> Will they doe
this, and so cease both to Sinne themselves, and to cause others
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>o Sin? This were happy for them. And this were the onely
<pb facs="tcp:15739:29"/>
way to free them from being the <hi>Sons of Perdition,</hi> namely by
ceaseing to be those men of <hi>Sin.</hi> But if <hi>Chrysostome</hi> said of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
in his dayes, <hi>that he wondred, if any of them could be saved:</hi>
then what would he have said of the <hi>Prelates</hi> in our dayes?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Antichrist</hi> is called <hi>o `antike√≠menos,</hi> that <hi>Adversary.</hi>
But <hi>still</hi> under <hi>a pretext</hi> of being a friend; as before is noted.
Thus <hi>Antichrist</hi> is the grand Adversary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a'ntike√≠menos,</hi> opposit,
or set against. But against whom? Against <hi>Christ,</hi> against his
<hi>word,</hi> against his <hi>Ministers,</hi> against his <hi>people,</hi> even all true <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi>
of the Gospell, against all <hi>true Religion.</hi> Such is the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and such are the <hi>Prelates,</hi> as their practises doe plainly prove,
and openly proclaime them to be.</p>
            <p>And Fourthly, here is added by a Copulative, <hi>ka√¨ u`prairo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos,</hi>
and He that <hi>exalts himselfe</hi> (as our English renders it)
Over whom? <hi>Over all that is called God, or that is worshiped. Ep√¨<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant√†,
Over all, or against all</hi> (as some Translation hath it) <hi>that is
called God.</hi> For the Preposition <hi>e'p√¨</hi> may signifie both. But for
<hi>Against</hi> we have <hi>a'ntike√≠menos,</hi> opposite, and so this we may take
for <hi>lifting himselfe up over all that is called God, or that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped;</hi>
which we may understand two wayes, either over <hi>all
Religion</hi> (as before we noted) or over <hi>all Policy,</hi> and <hi>Civill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
over <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who are<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 82.</note> 
               <hi>called
Gods,</hi> and over the <hi>Emperour</hi> himselfe, who is called <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is <hi>venerable,</hi> or <hi>worshipfull;</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Caesar</hi> which
is called <hi>s√®basma</hi> (as in the Text) over which this <hi>Antichrist ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts
himselfe.</hi> Now that this is verified of the <hi>Pope,</hi> it needs no
proofe, as being as cleare as the Sun at noone day, and which
Impudencie it selfe hath not the face to deny. But now for our
<hi>Prelates,</hi> how is this verified of them? For they would seem
to be friends to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> insomuch as they are by
<hi>Princes</hi> themselves openly proclaimed to be a <hi>holy Order</hi> most
<hi>Christian</hi> in it selfe, most <hi>peaceable in Civil States,</hi> and most <hi>conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Minarchie,</hi> or the like. For answere whereunto: First,
if the Pope their Sire be such an <hi>Adversary,</hi> and so <hi>exalted,</hi> how
can the <hi>Prelates</hi> be excused, seeing they are of the same <hi>Spirit,</hi>
as the members actuated by the Head? Secondly, if <hi>Prelates</hi> be
(as their ordinary practises doe shew) <hi>Adversaries</hi> and <hi>opposits to
Christ,</hi> and to his <hi>word,</hi> aswell as the Pope is (as before is noted)
how can their <hi>Hierarchie</hi> be said to be either most <hi>Christian in
itselfe,</hi> or most <hi>peaceable to Civil States,</hi> or most <hi>consonant to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie?</hi> Can such an <hi>Hierarchie</hi> be most <hi>Christian,</hi> which is most
<hi>Antichristian?</hi> Or can it be <hi>peaceable</hi> for a <hi>Civil State,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<pb facs="tcp:15739:29"/>
               <hi>Christianity,</hi> yea and the <hi>true Religion,</hi> to uphold and
maintaine such as are most <hi>notorious Adversaries</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to
the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Or can that be most <hi>Copsonant</hi> to a <hi>Monarchy</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
to be under <hi>Christ</hi> the onely <hi>Monarch,</hi> on whom all
others depend, and to be governed by good and just Lawes,
and not by a Lawlesse <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which it selfe is an <hi>Hierarchicall
Tyranny,</hi> and such as Tyranniseth over <hi>soules, bodies,</hi> and <hi>estates?</hi>
Or can <hi>Prelates</hi> be true Friends to <hi>Princes,</hi> who under a false
vizard of Friendship labour to corrupt them by their <hi>flattery,</hi>
to make them forget they are men, to make them disaffected
with their <hi>good Subjects,</hi> to make them the <hi>Authors of Innovation</hi>
in <hi>Religion,</hi> by suppressing the <hi>Truth</hi> by their publicke Edicts,
which tends to fill the People with <hi>discontents,</hi> and to stirre up
<hi>Sedition,</hi> and the like? Can this be safe for <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or <hi>peaceable</hi>
for the <hi>Civil State,</hi> or a thing in it selfe most <hi>Christian?</hi> Nor is
it so onely with our present <hi>Prelates.</hi> Revolve all Histories
since <hi>Antichrists exaltation,</hi> and ye shall find that never any <hi>great
Treasons</hi> have been, either against the <hi>persons of Princes,</hi> or their
<hi>Civil States</hi> (if they were but suspected of disaffection to the
<hi>Papacy,</hi> or <hi>Romish Religion</hi>) but either a <hi>Prelate,</hi> or some of his
<hi>faction</hi> had his finger in it. But there it may suffice, that our eyes
have been <hi>witnesses</hi> of the effects of <hi>Prelaticall pranks</hi> and <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
in being so busie and bold to bring in againe the <hi>Romish
Religion,</hi> and after the <hi>Gospel</hi> had taken such deep rooting. So as
if our <hi>Kings wisdome</hi> had not been the greater in composing
things in a <hi>peaceable way</hi> (as foreseeing the dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that might have ensued, in case he should have by a
strong hand gone about to have reduced that <hi>Antic bristian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
into that Kingdome, which it had now cast out) <hi>God</hi>
knows what wofull <hi>calamities</hi> such a Warre might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
But blessed be <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>preventing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Againe. As the Pope lifts up himselfe above and against all
<hi>Emperious Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes;</hi> yea setting his <hi>feet</hi> on their necks,
causing them to hold his stirrop, to lead his <hi>palfrey,</hi> and doe

their <hi>Lawlesse Kingdome.</hi> Yea, and when they list, they have a

their lust find not scope enough. Secondly, (as is noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
they not onely can dispense with <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but dare and
doe annihilate it, and make it of no <hi>authority.</hi> For they doe
<hi>unmoralize</hi> the <hi>4th Commandement,</hi> as concerning the <hi>Sabbath
day for Christians:</hi> they allow <hi>profane Sports</hi> thereon, which <hi>Gods
Law</hi> hath altogether forbidden: they forbid <hi>preaching on</hi> that
<hi>day,</hi> which <hi>Gods word commandeth to be both in season, and out of

those, that shalbe brought before them, for exercising
their lawfull <hi>authority</hi> over those under their charge. And we
all know, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> had the chiefe hand, not onely in
penning, but in publishing that <hi>Booke for Sports on the Lords day,</hi>
which is an open proclaiming of Warre against <hi>God,</hi> against
<hi>Christ,</hi> against his holy <hi>Laws,</hi> against all <hi>holinesse,</hi> against our

Lawlesse men (onely excepting the Grand <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the

            <p>Further, two wayes more doe the <hi>Prelates</hi> prove themselves

made subject to <hi>Episcopall Power,</hi> and so consequently the
<hi>Law of God</hi> contained therein, shall not be <hi>Divine,</hi> unlesse it
please their good Lordships to give their good word for it,
and to make it of so much <hi>credit,</hi> by the vote of their <hi>Authority</hi>
and <hi>Tradition,</hi> as that men may beleeve it to be <hi>Gods Law.</hi> And
upon this ground it is, that if the <hi>Prelates</hi> shall pronounce the

how come men to take upon them to be <hi>Iudges?</hi> But that
the <hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe should be <hi>Iudge,</hi> the <hi>Prelate</hi> in no case, in no

<hi>that the Scripture is a</hi>

               <hi>Iudge,</hi> but without <hi>light Sufficient: visible,</hi>

Thus our <hi>Prelates</hi> (if they will allow their <hi>Primate</hi> to speake

by <hi>Antichrists sitting</hi> is understood his <hi>raingning,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi>
doth often use this Terme: as <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 1. 3. 15. and 18. 7.
And so in other places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> by <hi>sitting,</hi> is understood
<hi>raigning,</hi> as <hi>Heb. 1. 13. 1. Rev.</hi> 1. 13. Now that the Pope doth
thus set up his <hi>throne,</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> and <hi>raigne</hi> in the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men,
who are the Subjects and vassalls of his <hi>Spirituall Kingdome,</hi>
himselfe cannot, will not deny. And he <hi>sits,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> that is, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
and exercises that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> over the <hi>Conscience,</hi>
which appertaines to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> alone. And thus he makes
shew, that he is <hi>God,</hi> as to whom <hi>God</hi> hath committed all his
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> unto. As the Pope calls himselfe <hi>Vice-God,
Christs Vicar,</hi> and the like, usurping whatsoever Titles of <hi>Power
<pb facs="tcp:15739:34"/>
Christ</hi> hath in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> as we read of <hi>Leo</hi> 10, in the <hi>Councel
of Lateran,</hi> calling himselfe <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah,</hi> and the
like. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> blusheth not to say, and therein to Blas-Pheme,
<hi>that what soever is attributed to Christ in the Scripture, is
communicated to his Vicar, the Pope.</hi> And thus is fullfilled that,
which <hi>Christ,</hi> foretold,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 24. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Many shall come in my Name, saying, I
am, or I am Christ, and shall deceive many.</hi> Thus <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Pope, that
man of Sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that Sonne of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

               </hi>
Now for our <hi>Prelates,</hi> are they not herein also, as in all the rest,
at least <hi>petty Gods Sitting in the Temple of God,</hi> shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
to be so many <hi>Gods?</hi> As for their <hi>materiall Princely Thrones</hi>
in <hi>materiall Temples,</hi> they have them set up in great <hi>State.</hi> But
this is nothing to that <hi>Throne,</hi> which they have set up,
and wherein they <hi>sit</hi> and <hi>raigne,</hi> over the <hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Soules</hi>
of <hi>Gods people;</hi> their multitude of <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> being
so many <hi>Laws</hi> by which they rule over them, and so many
bonds or Chaines, whereby they hold them in <hi>Spirituall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
And thus they <hi>sit</hi> also <hi>as God, in the Timple of God,</hi> shewing
themselves to be <hi>God,</hi> in saying they are <hi>Christs Vice-Roys,</hi> and
the <hi>Apostles Successors,</hi> having <hi>Authority from Christ to exercise
that their Iurisdiction and Power over Gods People,</hi> who are the
<hi>living Temples of the living God.</hi> Thus we see all along, how
this <hi>Army of Priests</hi> (as <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The last thing we propounded here to speake of, is, <hi>That
Apostacie must goe before to strow the way, to the full revealation of
the Mystery of Iniquity, and so of Antichrist, which Apostacie was
partly and primarily the Prelacie.</hi> I say, <hi>partly and primarily.</hi> For
<hi>partly</hi> the removall of the <hi>Imperiall Seat,</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> the <hi>defection</hi> of sundry <hi>Kingdomes</hi> from the
<hi>Empire,</hi> made way for <hi>Antichrists</hi> greatnesse, to which he grew
not but by degrees, and that through many <hi>Ages.</hi> Yet the prime
<hi>foundation</hi> of his <hi>Babylonian Tower</hi> was layd in the <hi>Apostles</hi> own
times, they labouring to hinder it all they could, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
herein, they preached and writ against it, and so fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
<hi>Gods people</hi> to beware of it. And this <hi>foundation</hi> so long
agoe begun to be layd, was the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> or rather the Spirit
<hi>of Prelacie,</hi> which had a time of <hi>working</hi> even while the <hi>Apostles</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:34"/>
lived, and became to be as it were an <hi>Embrio</hi> or little <hi>Masse,</hi>
but did not receice the <hi>forme of a body,</hi> till afterwards, and was
long a <hi>growing</hi> up, untill it came to the full <hi>stature.</hi> Now (I
say) the <hi>spirit of Prelacie</hi> was the very beginning of the <hi>Apostacie,</hi>
which was <hi>Antichrists</hi> way-maker.</p>
            <p>But how doth it appeare, that this <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prelacie</hi> began
to <hi>worke</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes? And then secondly, how will it
appeare, that this <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prelacy</hi> was and is an <hi>Apostacie?</hi>
For answere: First, that the <hi>Prelacie</hi> began to get life in the
<hi>Aposiles</hi> time, it is manifest by sundry places of <hi>Scripture.</hi> As
2. <hi>Cor. 11. 20. Ye suffer</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) <hi>if
a man bring you into bondage, if a man devoure you, if a man take of
you, if a man exalt himselfe, if a man smite you on the face.</hi> Now the
<hi>Apostle</hi> meanes here of those immediately mentioned before,
to wit, <hi>false Ministers,</hi> whom he calls <hi>false Apostles, deceitfull
work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs</hi> is <hi>transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ,</hi> v. 13. 15.
These (as young <hi>Prelates</hi>) would be <hi>Apostolic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

have the <hi>qualities</hi> of <hi>Prelates,</hi> they <hi>Captivate Gods people</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
they <hi>devoure, take, exalt themselves, smite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> just <hi>Prelate</hi>-like.
And for brevity (to omit sundry other places) we find one
pretty briske <hi>Prelaticall man</hi> in 3. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. 10. his Name was <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes,</hi>
and he did beare himselfe according to his Name, as
one of <hi>Iupiters</hi> nurslings: his <hi>qualities</hi> are these: 1. He <hi>loveth to
have the preeminence.</hi> 2. he <hi>receiveth not the Apostles, and brethren:
3. he prateth against them with malicious words: 4. he neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would:</hi> 5. he <hi>casteth them
out of the Church.</hi> Loe here a pretty well grown <hi>Prelaticall</hi> Child,
a pregnant Sparke to make a <hi>Lord Prelate</hi> of. For all his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
are proper to a <hi>Prelate:</hi> for a <hi>Prelate,</hi> first, <hi>loves the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence:</hi>
2. though he <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>Succeed the Apostles,</hi> yet his
deeds shew, that he <hi>hates</hi> both their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Example, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting</hi>
them in their <hi>true Successors:</hi> 3. he <hi>receiveth not the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi>
yea 4. he so hates the very name of <hi>holy brethren,</hi> that he
<hi>forbids all men to receive them:</hi> and 5. he <hi>casteth them out of the
Church, he playes fy gib with his thunderbolt of Excommunication.</hi> I
might insist more, and inlarge all these particulars: but this
may suffice to shew, that the <hi>Spirit of the Prelacie</hi> was stirring
in the <hi>wombe of the Church,</hi> even while the <hi>Apostles lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Second, it is no lesse <hi>true,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
the <hi>Prelacy</hi> was and is an <hi>Apostacy</hi> from <hi>Christ.</hi> This first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the <hi>Apostles</hi> former words of <hi>falling away first,</hi> which
made way for <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And this began in the <hi>Prelacie:</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:15739:35"/>
the <hi>Prelacy</hi> is the setting up of a <hi>new Church,</hi> a <hi>new Kingdome,</hi>
turning <hi>Christs heavenly Kingdome</hi> into an <hi>earthly,</hi> and the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi>
into a <hi>carnall,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of Grace, into a Kingdome of
terrene glory,</hi> and the <hi>Church militant</hi> into a <hi>Church malignant</hi> and
<hi>triumphant</hi> (as before is noted) and the <hi>true Catholicke Church</hi>
which we beleeve to consist of all the <hi>Elect</hi> onely, <hi>Christs living
members</hi>) into a new <hi>Catholicke visible Church</hi> of all <hi>nominall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
tagge and ragge, <hi>Papists</hi> and others: and in a word, the
<hi>Church of Christ</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Synogogue</hi> of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Is
not here then a fearefull <hi>Apostacie,</hi> and falling from <hi>Christ?</hi>
Time calls me off, and therefore I must be very briefe. I will
adde therefore but one place more for the proofe of this, <hi>That
Prelacy is Apostacy from Christ.</hi> It is in 1 Io. 2. 18. <hi>Little children,
it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even
now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last
time. They went out from us; but they were not of us: for if they had
been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went
out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi>
Loe, here is an <hi>Apostacie,</hi> and it is of certaine <hi>Antichrists,</hi> that
were then sprung up, even <hi>many Antichrists.</hi> But how doth this
concerne our <hi>Prelates?</hi> Let us looke but a little lower, and as
before we found them wrapped in the Swadling Clouts of
the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity:</hi> So here we shall behold them in the
very robes of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> For v. 22. <hi>Who is a lyar, but he that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that Iesus is the Christ: He is Antichrist,</hi> &amp;c. Now what is it
to <hi>deny Iesus to be the Christ?</hi> Surely we must so take these words,
as we hold the <hi>Analogie of faith,</hi> and so, as they crosse not <hi>the
Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> which we shewed before to be a denying of
<hi>Christ,</hi> under a colour of confessing him. Now then there is a
twofold <hi>denyall of Christ:</hi> one in <hi>words,</hi> another in <hi>works.</hi> So the
<hi>Apostle</hi> saith of such,<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>They porfesse that they know God, but in works
they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good
worke reprobate.</hi> So as there is a <hi>denyall of Christ</hi> in <hi>deeds.</hi> But
what it is to <hi>deny, that Iesus is the Christ?</hi> This is a point indeed
very considerable. To <hi>deny that Iesus is the Christ,</hi> is to <hi>deny,
that Iesus is the Auointed King Priest and Prophet;</hi> So, as never any
were <hi>anointed,</hi> to all these 3 Offices. And therefore <hi>Christ</hi> was
said to be<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> 
               <hi>anointed above his fellows.</hi> And for that cause he is
called here, <hi>o' Krist√≤s,</hi> The <hi>Anointed.</hi> Now then to <hi>deny that
Iesus is the Christ,</hi> is to <hi>deny, that Iesus is the onely King, the onely
High Priest,</hi> aud <hi>the onely Prophet of his Church.</hi> But ( to apply
this) doth the <hi>Pope,</hi> and so our <hi>Prelates, deny</hi> that <hi>Iesus</hi> is thus <hi>the
<pb facs="tcp:15739:35"/>
Chirst?</hi> Yes, they do. First, for the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is manifest, that he
<hi>denyes Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>only King of his Church:</hi> because himselfe
takes upon him to be <hi>King</hi> over the <hi>Church, sitting as God in the
Temple of God, shewing himselfe, that he is God;</hi> as before is shewed.
Secondly, he not onely sets up other <hi>High-Priests</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> as
whom he makes <hi>Mediators of Interc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ssion:</hi> and so he <hi>denyes Christs
High priesthood in heaven,</hi> whose Office alone it is to make <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
within the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ile,</hi> as was typed by the <hi>High Priest,</hi> Heb. 9.
but the <hi>Pope</hi> also makes himselfe the <hi>High Priest</hi> on Earth, in
forgiving of Sins, and in Sacrificing and offering up a Breaden
<hi>Christ</hi> for a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> wherein also every <hi>Masse-Priest</hi>
usurps <hi>Christs Priesthood</hi> on the Crosse. And Thirdly, he <hi>denyeth
Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>onely Prophet</hi> to teach his <hi>Church,</hi> taking upon him
to be the Sole <hi>Oracle,</hi> and unerring <hi>Iudge in matters of Faith.</hi>
These might be inlarged, but I hasten. And a word in things
so cleare, is sufficient. Now for our <hi>Prelates:</hi> Do not they too
<hi>deny,</hi> that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ?</hi> Doe not they <hi>deny</hi> him to be the
<hi>only King</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> by their usurping of his <hi>throne</hi> and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>
over the Consciences of <hi>Gods people</hi> in matters of <hi>faith</hi>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> by imposing their manifold Canons, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as before is shewed? And Secondly, do they not <hi>deny,</hi>
that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>onely High Priest,</hi> while themselves with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and their false <hi>Priesthood,</hi> take upon them to forgive Sins?
Yea and doe they not labour to come home to <hi>Rome,</hi> in setting
up their <hi>Altars,</hi> with their <hi>Priests,</hi> which must needs have a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> some <hi>Host:</hi> so as thereby <hi>Christ</hi> is denyed to be
the <hi>onely High Priest,</hi> who offered up himselfe on the Crosse
once for all? Thirdly, and Lastly, doe they not <hi>deny Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>onely Prophet</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> while themselves usurpe the
Office of being <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ripture,</hi> and of the <hi>Controversies
of Faith,</hi> making their <hi>Dictates</hi> to be received for <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and
their <hi>determinations</hi> (though in things erronious in the <hi>Faith</hi>)
<hi>to bind all men to peace and obedience?</hi> Which being so: the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is, that as the <hi>Pope</hi> is the grand <hi>Antichrist,</hi> so <hi>Prelates</hi>
are so many <hi>Antichrists.</hi> For (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>) <hi>Who is a lyer, but
he that denyeth, that Iesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist.</hi> And thus
we see, how these <hi>hypocrites,</hi> who are so Superstitiously and
Idolatrously devout in their worshiping of the Name JESUS,
prove themselves notorions. <hi>Antichrists,</hi> in <hi>denying Iesus to be the
Christ,</hi> to be the <hi>only King, Priest and Prophet of his Church.</hi>

(as hath been shewed) as were sufficient to confound them,

one, <hi>Timothy</hi> is said to be <hi>first Bishop of Ephesus:</hi> and in the other,
<hi>Titus first Bishop of the Church of the Cretians.</hi> These (say they)
were <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> ordained by the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And here (say

               </hi> To both which places, I answere: First, That
those two <hi>Postscripts</hi> are no part of <hi>Canonicall Scripture,</hi> or of the
<hi>holy Text.</hi> For (as the learned <hi>Beza</hi> hath well observed) they
were not found in the most ancient Greek Copies: nor yet in
the vulgar <hi>Latin Translation,</hi> no not to this day. These were
additions of some Monks, that were made some hundred
yeares after the <hi>Apostles.</hi> So as in <hi>Ieromes</hi> time they were not

which hath no such <hi>Postscrips.</hi> Secondy, our former and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter

yet they are put in a small <hi>character,</hi> different from that of the
<hi>Text,</hi> that all men may take notice they are no part of the <hi>Text.</hi>
Although our All-<hi>Innovating Prelates</hi> of late, have in the newer
<hi>Impressions</hi> inlarged their <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> in putting those <hi>Postscripts</hi>
in the same full <hi>character</hi> with that of the <hi>Text,</hi> that the Simple

               <pb facs="tcp:15739:36"/>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> are no where in <hi>Scripture</hi> called <hi>Bishops.</hi> Fourthly,
Suppose they were such <hi>Bishops,</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> approve of,
as before is shewed: doth it therefore follow, that they were
<hi>Diocesan Bishops, Lording over the Presbyters,</hi> as our <hi>Lord Prelates</hi>
doe? Let them shew us that. But fiftly, it is cleare by <hi>Scripture,</hi>
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were neither <hi>Dioce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Bishops</hi> of a <hi>particular Congregation,</hi> such as the <hi>Scripture</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

no <hi>distribution of Diocese;</hi> that came in afterward. And secondly,
they were not tyed to any <hi>Residence</hi> either <hi>Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>Parochiall.</hi>

sundry other places. So as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and other <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi>
their Office was to <hi>water</hi> those <hi>Churches,</hi> which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
had <hi>planted,</hi> to <hi>comfort, confirme, establish</hi> the <hi>hearts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
newly converted</hi> to the <hi>faith of Christ.</hi> So as if <hi>Timothy</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> had been <hi>Bishops,</hi> either <hi>Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>Parochiall,</hi> then the
<hi>Apostle</hi> in sending them to this and that <hi>Countrey,</hi> to this and
that <hi>Church</hi> in farre distant <hi>Countries,</hi> should have been an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Non-residence,</hi> a thing much controverted in the<note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Hist. Concil.</note> 
               <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of Trent,</hi> and the best learned did maintaine, that <hi>Residence</hi> of
<hi>Bishops</hi> was <hi>de jure divino.</hi> They were no <hi>Bishops</hi> therefore, but
<hi>Euangelists.</hi> And thus the <hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe shews plainly, that
those foresaid <hi>Postscripts</hi> are meere forgeries, and counterfeit
stuffe; though our <hi>Prelates</hi> are glad of any shred to patch up
their Pyde Motley Coat withall.</p>
            <p>But they alledge againe for themselves, that <hi>Titus was left in
Creet to ordaine Bishops in every City.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Ordination of Ministers
belongs properly and solely to Bishops.</hi> For Answere: Is this a good
<hi>Argument: Titus Ordained Ministers in Creet:</hi> Ergo <hi>Ordination
of Ministers pertaines to the Office of every Diocesan Bishop?</hi> But
they must bring better proofe, that <hi>Titus</hi> was a <hi>Diocesan Bishop:</hi>
otherwise, I deny their <hi>Argument.</hi> Secondly, Suppose, that <hi>Titus</hi>
did alone <hi>ordaine:</hi> yet this being a case of <hi>necessity,</hi> and in the
<hi>infancy</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is it therfore to be made a <hi>Generall Rule?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:37"/>
Thirdly, if they were <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> whom <hi>Titus</hi> ordained in
every City in <hi>Creta,</hi> then <hi>Titus</hi> was an <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> at least, and
no small one neither, for there being an hundred Cities in
<hi>Creet,</hi> called therefore <hi>e kat√≥mpolis,</hi> the hundred-City-Ile. But
for <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> our <hi>Arch-prelate</hi> confesseth they are not <hi>Iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.</hi>
Or els, for <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine such <hi>Bishops,</hi> as the <hi>Prelate</hi>
meaneth he could according to ancient <hi>Canons of Councels,</hi> have
had 2 or 3 other <hi>Bishops</hi> joyned with him. But if they had been
<hi>Bishops,</hi> whom he is sayd to Ordaine, the word should rather
have been <hi>teleiosai,</hi> or so to <hi>Consecrate,</hi> then <hi>katastesai,</hi> to <hi>ordaine:</hi>
because a <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> is not <hi>ordained,</hi> but <hi>consecrated,</hi> as they call it; so as such a <hi>Bishop</hi> is not an <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Calling,</hi> as before is shewed. But to shut up this: <hi>Titus</hi> was no <hi>Bishop,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Prelates Argument</hi> from <hi>Titus</hi> his Ordaining of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
is too weake a <hi>foundation,</hi> to build their high Towring
<hi>Hierarchie</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>Againe, they alledge the power that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had
to Censure <hi>delinquents: Ergo Prelates Courts</hi> are <hi>Iure Divino.</hi>
This <hi>Argument</hi> is like the former, and concluds nothing for
them. Nor had <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> their <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Consistories,</hi>
their <hi>Apparitors,</hi> and <hi>Pursuivants,</hi> their <hi>dumb Priests</hi> to sit in
<hi>Court</hi> to <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> and the like. Nor were their <hi>Censures</hi>
like to those of our <hi>Prelates;</hi> as before we have shewed about
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> either for the <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Titus</hi> had a Commission <hi>t√† le√≠ponta, epidiorthosai,</hi> to <hi>set in
order the things that are wanting.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo it is an Office
of Prelates to set the Church in Order, by adding such Ceremenies or
Canons, as are wanting.</hi> As the <hi>Prelate</hi> saith in his said Booke,
that he had<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. Dedi. pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>taken all that paines for an Orderly Settlement in the
Church.</hi> But besides the reasons aforesaid, that <hi>Titus</hi> was no
<hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> for our <hi>Prelates</hi> to make their <hi>pattern</hi> by: they
must consider, that the full <hi>latitude</hi> of the sense of <hi>epidiorthosa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
(which our English turnes, <hi>to set in Order,</hi>) is, to set those things
in Order, or in <hi>integrum restituere,</hi> to restore and reduce them to
their former estate, wherein at the first they were ordered.
Now <hi>Titus</hi> had received his <hi>rule</hi> from the <hi>Apostle</hi> for whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he was to set in Order, which <hi>rule</hi> comprehended such
things as were wanting. The <hi>Apostle</hi> left it not to <hi>Titus</hi> to doe

Thus nothing will frame well, the <hi>Scripture</hi> will not speak one
good word for our <hi>Prelates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they take their wings, and flie to the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:15739:37"/>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> are called <hi>Angels,</hi> as <hi>Rev. 1. 20.</hi> and 2. 1, &amp;c. <hi>The
Angel of the Church of Ephesus</hi> (say they) <hi>was the Bishop,</hi> to wit,
the <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi> But first they must prove that <hi>Ephesus</hi> had
a <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi> before they can conclude he was that <hi>Angel.</hi>
For every <hi>Angel</hi> is not a <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi> For then All <hi>Ministers</hi>
being called <hi>Angels,</hi> because <hi>Gods Messengers,</hi> should be <hi>Diocesan
Bishops,</hi> which our <hi>Prelates</hi> cry out against: but if they be <hi>false

they will have him some <hi>Angel dropt from the Clowds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note>
And (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>) <hi>if an Angel from heaven preach otherwise,
then what the Scripture teacheth, let him be accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they imagine this <hi>Angel</hi> is the <hi>Diocesan Lord Bishop,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he stands single, and alone, <hi>To the Angel of the Church of

               </gap> know, that
it is familiar with the <hi>Scripture</hi> to use the singular number for
the plural? Doth not every one of the <hi>ten Commandements</hi>
run thus, <hi>Thou shalt not,</hi> &amp;c. when every Mothers Sonne is
meant? And why not so here? Nay it is so here: for though
he write as to one, v. 1. yet v. 7. he concludes the <hi>Epistle</hi> thus,
<hi>He that hath an eare, let him heare what the Spirit saith to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
And such is the <hi>style</hi> and manner of every one of those 7.
<hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>seven Churches:</hi> so as under one is meant every
one, yea all the <hi>Churches.</hi> Now will our <hi>Prelates</hi> hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that because an <hi>Angel</hi> herd is named, and that which is
<hi>written particularly</hi> to one, concerneth all the <hi>Churches:</hi> that
therefore this <hi>Angel</hi> was the <hi>Diocesan Bishop?</hi> Surely then, he
must be an <hi>Arch-bishop,</hi> as comprehending all the <hi>Churches.</hi>
And so also must every one of the other <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Churches:</hi>
which would make a <hi>confusion.</hi> But if the <hi>Prelates</hi> were not
selfe-blinded, they might discerne the reason, why the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>
puts an <hi>Angel</hi> for many. For thus it holds <hi>proportion</hi> with
the Vision shewed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 1. 12. 20. This Vision of
the <hi>Seven Starres,</hi> and <hi>Seven Candlesticks,</hi> and <hi>Seven Angels,</hi> and
<hi>Seven Churches,</hi> is called a <hi>Mystery.</hi> And a <hi>Mystery</hi> is a <hi>Secret,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:38"/>
which comprehends more, then is <hi>expressed.</hi> And so here, when
one <hi>Angel</hi> is named, we are to understand all the <hi>Angels</hi> of that
<hi>Church,</hi> to whom, in the name of one, the <hi>Epistle is written:</hi>
nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>onely to all the <hi>Angels,</hi> but to the <hi>Churches,</hi> under the
name of one <hi>Angel.</hi> So as in one are comprehended many, for
it is a <hi>Mystery:</hi> yet one is mentioned (Chap. 2. 1.) because (I say)
it holds proportion with the vision. Againe, if by the <hi>Angel</hi>
here, they would have to be understood a <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> then
they must prove, that this <hi>Diocesan</hi> hath a lawfull Calling, as
<hi>Sent of God.</hi> Otherwise he is no <hi>Angel,</hi> that is, no <hi>Messenger,</hi> no
<hi>Angel sent of God.</hi> Or if they say, This <hi>Angel</hi> was <hi>sent of God,</hi> let
them prove him to be a <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi> And thus they are
brought into a Circle, and cannot find the way out.</p>
            <p>But they alledge againe, That <hi>one</hi> here notes <hi>unity,</hi> which
cannot be without a <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi> And therefore a <hi>Diocesan
Bishop</hi> was set up for that end, to be a <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>unity,</hi> for the
conservation of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> in <hi>Schismatis remedium,</hi> for a
remedy of Schisme. Insomuch as our <hi>Arch-prelate</hi> (as is before
noted) holds a necessity of one <hi>Ordine Primus,</hi> for the <hi>unity and
peace of his Catholicke Church.</hi> Now for answere briefly (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partly touched before) true it is, that <hi>one</hi> here is a mysticall
note of <hi>unity,</hi> so as in the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> is
comprehended the whole <hi>Church of Ephesus,</hi> both <hi>Ministers</hi> and
<hi>People.</hi> But <hi>one</hi> here doth not signifie <hi>one Diocesan Bishop.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is <hi>one Diocesan Bishop</hi> in a <hi>Diocese,</hi> nor one <hi>Metropolitan in a
Province</hi> or <hi>Kingdome,</hi> nor one <hi>Ordine Primus</hi> in the whole <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Church,</hi> of necessity to preserve <hi>unity</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> 'Tis
true indeed, that the <hi>Prelates new Catholicke-Church,</hi> which is
<hi>Prelaticall,</hi> may need such a <hi>Head as one Ordine Primus,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it in <hi>unity and peace:</hi> this being also very usefull for the
inlarging of the <hi>Tower of Babel,</hi> for which the <hi>Prelate</hi> hath so
<hi>laboured for Peace in the Church of England</hi> under the <hi>Headship</hi> of
his <hi>Primacy:</hi> so as had he none to oppose or contradict his
wicked practises, for the setting up of <hi>Popery,</hi> but all did qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly

<pb facs="tcp:15739:38"/>
is knit to the whole, in and under that one <hi>Head</hi>
And so this <hi>Body</hi> groweth, and this building goeth up, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the mouths of <hi>contradiction,</hi> and of malicious

his <hi>word,</hi> breathed by one poore <hi>Minister,</hi> is able to blast the

as <hi>troublers of the State,</hi> and <hi>movers of Sedition.</hi> And they cannot
be in quiet, nor their <hi>building</hi> goe up, untill such make-bates
be silenced, or made our of the way. And therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Socrat. Hist. Eccl. lib. 1. c. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Athanasius</hi>
was the onely man, that refused to hold Communion with a
sort of <hi>Arian Bishops;</hi> which caused a great gappe in that <hi>unity
and peace in the Church,</hi> which <hi>Constantine</hi> so much desired.
Well, what's the remedy? He thereupon was easily moved to
send <hi>Athanasius away into banishment,</hi> and then he thought all
would be <hi>quiet</hi> and in <hi>peace.</hi> But by the way, <hi>Truth must be looked
unto in the first place:</hi> otherwise what <hi>peace?</hi> For that a false <hi>peace,</hi>
and the moeher of farther discord, for the which <hi>truth</hi> is lost.
And even our <hi>Prelate</hi> himselfe in his said Booke doth often
harpe upon these two strings together, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> a good
harmony, were they rightly <hi>meant,</hi> and that his <hi>Truth</hi> were not
made of a <hi>Wolfes gut,</hi> which will never agree with a string made
of a <hi>Sheeps gut,</hi> as he pretends his <hi>Peace</hi> to be. But this by the
way. And whereas they alledge the <hi>Prelacie</hi> to be a <hi>remedy of
Schisme (Heare √¥ heavens, and hearken √¥ earth</hi>) is not the <hi>Prelacy</hi>
the <hi>grand Schismaticke?</hi> I mean, not onely in being the most
busie and usuall make-bate in all <hi>Civil States,</hi> dividing <hi>Prince</hi>
and <hi>People,</hi> but in setting up a new and <hi>false Catholicke Church,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
seperate from, and holding no <hi>communion</hi> with, yea
excluding all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> not <hi>Prelaticall,</hi> as no members
of the <hi>Catholicke</hi> (as indeed they be not of the <hi>false Catholicke</hi>)
all <hi>Prelacie</hi> drawing to one <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and that by a
<hi>necessity of one Ordine Primus;</hi> as before is noted.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> The last <hi>Allegation</hi> which I note
they make, is, that S. <hi>Marke</hi> was <hi>Bishop of Alexandria.</hi> Ergo <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
Iurisdiction,</hi> is an <hi>Apostolicall Tradition,</hi> and so <hi>jure divino.</hi>
And for this they alledge the <hi>Testimony of Ierome</hi> where he saith,<note place="margin">Confer pa. 176.</note>
               <hi>At Alexandria from Marke the Evangelist, the Presbyters alwayes
chusing one from among them, and placing him in a more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
called him Bishop.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Prelate</hi> thus inferres. <hi>So
even according to S.</hi> Jerome, <hi>Bishops had a very ancient and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:15739:39"/>
Discent in the Church from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Marke the Euangelist: and this</hi>

for <hi>Ierome,</hi> we noted his words before of such <hi>Bishops,</hi> saying,
<hi>They were set up by humane presumption, and not by divine Institution,

to make that <hi>Apostolicke Tradition.</hi> And for S. <hi>Marke,</hi>

               <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Story</hi> tells us, that <hi>Marke</hi> was the first, that preached
the <hi>Gospell</hi> (which also he writ) <hi>at Alexandria.</hi> But the <hi>Story</hi>
saith not, <hi>that Marke was Bishop of Alexandria.</hi> And the <hi>Prelate</hi>
must marke, that he was an <hi>Euangelist</hi> (as also <hi>Iereme</hi> saith) for
he wrote the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And the History saith, <hi>he was</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Ibid, c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>a follower of
Peter the Apostle.</hi> Which if true, it makes it more probable, that
it was that <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whence <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his <hi>Epistle,</hi>
where he saith, <hi>The Church that is at Babylon saluteth you, and so
doth Marcus my Son: then that Peter was then at Rome,</hi> which the
<hi>Papists</hi> (to make <hi>Peter</hi> to have been at <hi>Rome</hi>) are content should
be that <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whence he writ. And if they will needs
have it so, let them have it, with the <hi>whore of Babylon</hi> to boot.
But this by the way. But be it, that <hi>Marke</hi> was at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he
was there onely as an <hi>Euangelist,</hi> and to doe the <hi>Office of an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelist,</hi>
of which we have Spoken before: <hi>Bishop</hi> he was not,
as the <hi>Prelates</hi> would have him; for that we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be in their sense condemned both by <hi>Christ,</hi> and by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and therfore is neither an <hi>Institution of Christ, nor a
Tradition Apostolicke.</hi> And therefore what ever the <hi>Presbyters</hi> at
<hi>Alexandria</hi> began to practise after <hi>Marke the Euangelist,</hi> in <hi>chusing
and exalting one over them, whom they called a Bishop,</hi> whence our
<hi>Prelates</hi> derive their <hi>Ancieut and Honourable descent:</hi> sure we are,
they can never prove, that ever either any <hi>Apostle</hi> delivered this
to <hi>Marke,</hi> or <hi>Marke from the Apostles</hi> to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to make it
a <hi>Tradition Apostolicke.</hi> Yea this is a sure and infallible <hi>Rule in
Divinity, That whatever the Apostles expresly set down in their Sacred
writing, they never delivered the contrary by word of mouth.</hi> As the
<hi>Apostle</hi> writes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> saying<note n="‚Ä°" place="marg1">Ibid, c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>As God is true, our word

proved before) the <hi>Apostles, as Christ</hi> their Masters forbad them)
forbid <hi>Prelacy</hi> to others, they exercised it not themselves, they

Heare, √¥ <hi>England,</hi> examine thy selfe. I know the <hi>Councel of thy
heart</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith <hi>is as</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="margin">Pro. 20. 5.</note>

               </gap> not discover who is
thy <hi>Counsellour,</hi> certainly thy intended <hi>actions</hi> will bewray and
publish to the world.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the Second place, consider the Cause of
thy Warre, that it be <hi>just.</hi> I do not meane made seemingly <hi>just</hi>
by <hi>false colours,</hi> and <hi>pretences,</hi> but that it be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly just</hi>
before <hi>God</hi> an Men, Otherwise, thou hast two grand Causes of
<hi>feare,</hi> that the issue shall not be prosperous; to wit, not takiug
<hi>Councel</hi> first of <hi>God</hi> for thy Warre: secondly, not undertaking it
upon a <hi>just Cause</hi> or <hi>quarrell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to come a little nearer home to the point) is the <hi>Cause</hi>
such, as it will beare any <hi>Consultation,</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15739:40"/>
So as thou mayst with a good <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> seek unto
<hi>God,</hi> to maintaine thy Cause? And for what ever Cause thou
indendest thy Warre, or against whom, surely the Cause being
publicke, and so concerning the whole Land, such a seeking of
<hi>God</hi> is required, as is solemne, publicke, and universall. And
we are sure, that as yet, √¥ <hi>England,</hi> thou hast not sought <hi>God,</hi>
for the good Speed of this thy great and warlike <hi>preparation</hi>
And then, what good issue canst thou expect for?</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say, how shall I seeke <hi>Counsel</hi> and helpe of
<hi>God?</hi> For this, I will propound but one example. The whole
Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> stood up in maintenance of a most wicked
and prodigious fact, as that towards the <hi>Levites</hi> Wife. He sent
her being dead in 12 pieces to all the Tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> who
abhorring such a Fact, first sent to their Brethren the <hi>Benjamites</hi>
to punish the Malefactors. They refused. Whereupon all the
Tribes assembled. And first they aske <hi>Counsel</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>
which of the Tribes, shall goe up first against <hi>Benjamin.</hi> He
Answers, <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And though the Cause was <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>God coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled</hi>
them, yet they were expulsed with the losse of 22 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men. They <hi>consult God</hi> the Second time; and that with
<hi>weeping</hi> before the <hi>Lord</hi> untill even: the <hi>Lord</hi> answers them,
<hi>Goe up,</hi> yet this time also they were <hi>beaten</hi> and lost 18 thousand
men. Strange? Well they inquire of the <hi>Lord</hi> the third time,
but in a better manner then before: for all the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
assemble to the House of <hi>God, weeping</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> the whole
day untill <hi>even,</hi> and offered <hi>burnt offerings,</hi> and <hi>peace offerings
before the Lord;</hi> and then asking the <hi>Lord, shall I yet againe goe to
battaile against Benjamin, or shall I cease.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> answers them
the third time, <hi>Goe up, for to morrow I will deliver them into thy
hand.</hi> Whence it is to be noted, that till this Third time, that
they make their <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>God</hi> by <hi>burnt-offerings,</hi> and <hi>peace-offerings,
God</hi> doth not give them an answere of <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
successe.</hi> Hence then, √¥ <hi>England;</hi> take thy <hi>patterne</hi> of <hi>seeking
God,</hi> and asking <hi>Counsel</hi> of Him. First, doe not first resolve with
thy selfe to <hi>fight,</hi> and then goe aske of <hi>God,</hi> not, whether thou
shalt <hi>fight,</hi> or no, but onely, <hi>who shall goe up first.</hi> For then thou
mayst speed, as they did. Secondly, thinke it not sufficient to
powre forth <hi>teares</hi> of <hi>worldly sorrow</hi> for thy <hi>discomfiture,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
resolve to renew the <hi>battaile,</hi> for which also, though they
had an Answere of <hi>God</hi> for it, yet it was without any Promise
of good Successe. But Thirdly, a Generall Fast must be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
over the Land, and a Solemne Day must be <hi>kept</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:15739:41"/>
offering up the <hi>burnt offerings</hi> of an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>contrite heart,</hi> and
<hi>peace offerings</hi> of <hi>reconciliation</hi> with <hi>God</hi> through <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi>
joyned with a <hi>thorow Reformation</hi> of thy <hi>notorious Sins</hi> and <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi>
wherewith the whole Land is <hi>burthened</hi> and <hi>defiled.</hi>
Then, then (I say) and not before (alwayes provided the Cause
of Warre be known to be <hi>just,</hi> as that of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was against
the <hi>Benjamites</hi> their Brethren) mayst thou with a good <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and
sure <hi>confidence in God</hi> make thy Warre.</p>
            <p>But what Sins are those, which thou must <hi>reforme?</hi> In brief,
thou must (√¥ <hi>England</hi>) call in those <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ungodly Bookes,
Orders, Edicts, Declarations,</hi> whereby the <hi>Doctrines of Grace</hi> have
been <hi>suppressed,</hi> the <hi>Sanctification of the Sabbath cryed down, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
persecuted,</hi> and put out of their <hi>places,</hi> much <hi>innocent blood</hi>
hath been shed, especially of those 3 <hi>banished Close Prisoners;</hi>
and to Summe up all in one head-Sinne, to cast out those, who
are the maine <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>movers</hi> of all these and other <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages</hi>
in the Land, to wit, the <hi>Prelates,</hi> who (as the limbs of

            <p>But it will be alledged that thy Reverend <hi>Prelats</hi> hate a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

as aforesaid, as being all <hi>Puritanicall:</hi> that their Order
is most <hi>Christian,</hi> and consonant to <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and most

thou art bound to defend them, yea though it be by making

that thou caust not long stand: seeing thy so <hi>maintaining of that

of thy <hi>warlike preparations,</hi> be sure thou shalt not <hi>prosper</hi> in why

               <hi>A Kingdome divided

            <p>But it wilbe <hi>pretended,</hi> they are Rebells whom thou wilt

those <hi>Antichristian usurpers</hi> the <hi>Prelates?</hi> Indeed thus thou
didst deale with those 3 above said, as <hi>Seditious Persons,</hi> because
they convinced the <hi>Prelates</hi> of their <hi>usurped title of Iurisdiction
from Christ,</hi> wherein they did not in the <hi>least point transgresse,</hi> or
yet so much as <hi>trench</hi> upon any of thy Laws, but defended them
against the <hi>Prelates.</hi> And if in so doing any shalbe accounted of
thee to be Rebells, certainly they which doe it not, are neither
good Christians, nor good Subjects. But if indeed thou wilt
Warre against any such, as Rebells, let the Case first be tryed in
a faire and Judiciall way, a better then which cannot be, then
the present <hi>Parliament.</hi> And because the <hi>Prelates</hi> are <hi>Parties,</hi> let

For no Reason, that <hi>Parties</hi> should sit as Judges, as the <hi>Prelates</hi>
did in the Censuring of those former <hi>three,</hi> though they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

faire <hi>tryall</hi> any shalbe found judicially to be Rebells against
their King, then make Warre against them, and spare not, and
I could wish to be the foremost in the <hi>fight.</hi> But if they onely
stand to defend their <hi>ancient Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> and those good

if it be found so by you, let the Civil Sword of Justice
be drawn, and not the bloody Sword of Warre, by which the

Laws of the Kingdome are overthrowne, and so vindicate the Honour
both of the King, and of this noble Kingdome, that it may not be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

which have in such wise declared their opinions for intollerable Taxes

God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the

Diabolicall Instigation (as by no other it can be, except by the

in it) to goe against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and if the cause shalbe found to be no
other, but that they have abandoned, and Remaunded to <hi>Rome</hi> all their
<hi>Prelates,</hi> as the grand Enemies of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Kingdome, and of
the peaceable and prosperous estate of the Realme, and consequently of
the <hi>Kings</hi> Crown and Dignity; and that they stand for the maintenance
of their just Laws and Liberties, the continuance whereof is the <hi>Kings</hi>
honour, and the establishment of his throne: If (I say) no other cause can
justly be alledged, and yet they shalbe invaded, as Rebells: Protest
against all ayd and assistance of such an Invasion, as being against the
Law of <hi>God,</hi> of Nature, and of Nations, and as being a Warre directly
against <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in the maintenance of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Hierarchy; and so such, as must needs recoyle, and that in
divine fury upon <hi>England</hi> it selfe, which having burned her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
house, exposeth her owne to the flames. Yea for <hi>England</hi> to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<hi>Scotland</hi> for no other cause in truth, then before mentioned,
namely, for their maintaining of the true Faith and Religion of Christ,
and their just Lawes and Liberties, which all true Christians, and
Civil States ought to lay down their very lives for; (as the light of
Nature taught the very Heathen, <hi>Pugnare pro Aris ac focis;</hi> and
that Grecian could say, <hi>A'iresomai teleutan mallon, '√® a'neleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theros
sun:</hi> I choose rather to dye, a Free-man, then to live a Slave.
And the Monarchicall estate, governed by good Laws, was ever prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and opposed to Tyranny) were to renounce and give up her own
<pb facs="tcp:15739:44"/>
ancient Liberties, and to betray, and persecute, and destroy the true
Faith and Religion of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so set up and professe the Infidelity
and Idolatry of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and so with him and his cursed Crue, to
goe into <hi>perdition.</hi> The Primitive Christians under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata,
served him in the Warres against his Enemies: but when he
Commanded them to goe against Christians, who refused to worship, or
offer Incense to his Idols, they cast down their Weapons, acknowledging
the Emperour of heaven. And when <hi>Saul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note> commanded his Servants
to fall upon the <hi>Lords</hi> Priests, none of them would doe it. And I read
of a Secretary to an Empresse, who being commanded by her to draw an
Edict againg the Christians, he still found delayes: but at length she
growing instant upon him for it, so as he could no longer delay it, he
tooke off his Military girdle (the Ensigne of his service) and cast it at
her feet, and so discharged himselfe from her Court.</p>
            <p>Thus, if you make, and leave these <hi>Christian, zealous,</hi> and <hi>just
Protestations</hi> among the Recods of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in case it shalbe
by the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>inchantments</hi> of the <hi>Prelates</hi> unhappily dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
before you can produce them into a full Act, and establish
them for a Law: though otherwise ye cannot effect a reall <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
of all the mischiefes and maladies, which the <hi>Prelates</hi>
in speciall have filled the Land withall: yet forasmuch as you
have thus publickly, both for your own persons, and as the
Body representative of the whole State of the Land, solemnly
protested against all these things: there is no question to be
made, but that <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> will accept of your
<hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed</hi> it selfe, and will still preserve both you and
your posterity, and the whole Land from <hi>destruction,</hi> and will
find out some other way for the rooting out of the <hi>Hierarchy;</hi>
according to those Prophesies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the full filling
of which cannot be farre off.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> guide and govern the Kings heart
to the <hi>love of God,</hi> and of his <hi>truth,</hi> and let him clearely see how

the manifold and horrible abuses, which the <hi>Prelates,</hi> to the
