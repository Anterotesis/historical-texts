            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Soveraignty, which by his Word and ſpirit, he exerciſeth over the

(for to her and her ſeed, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to <hi>David</hi> and

to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and all his Children by faith, Jewes, and afterwards
Gentiles, but this is not generall over all the world, and reſpecting
this, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>His Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> and <hi>that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God is not by obſervation,</hi> that is, after a worldly pomp and
honour; and of this he ſtill ſpeakes, when he ſaith, <hi>The Kingdome
of God is at hand; is within you, &amp;c.</hi> And this ſtate of his Kingdome
was more narrow and obſcure till Chriſts comming in the fleſh, and
the preaching the Goſpell to every creature (that is, to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
where ever there was opportunitie) without reſtraint to the
Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it was before, and many worthy ones have
thought, and many doe to this day thinke, that this is the onely
ſtate of Chriſts Kingdome; and therefore doe appropriate and apply
all that is ſaid of his Kingdome in Scripture, to this ſtate of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in many things belonging to Chriſts Monarchy, there is a
ſpirituall ſence alſo, and they may not untruly be applyed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually;

not ſo in ſome ſenſe; for in ſome ſence, they are as abſolute, and

them by one King, namely, <hi>Saul,</hi> he gave them a King alſo for a
type and ſhaddow of that which he himſelfe did before, but in a

World, whom in a morall way God will bring to be a People to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> (among which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as a firſt borne ſhall be cheife:)
So Chriſts government of that Nation, from the time they were

thereby what they all did deſerve, and rewarding the Saints,
how is that? by raiſing them from the dead; for as he ſpeakes of

dead, and not onely of ſuch as were martyred; and this Reſurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41326:10"/>
is not at the Worlds end, for after this he ſhewed many things
were done in the World, <hi>as the Temple opened, &amp;c.</hi> and it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Chriſts Kingdome, as we have ſhewed before; this alſo
is cleare by that ſignification that Chriſt put on their receiving the
Lords Supper, in a Table geſture, where they ſate as it were at his
Table, and he ſerved them; for as they ſate at Table, eating the
Paſſeover, he inſtituted and adminiſtred the Lords Supper, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
14. <hi>He ſate downe,</hi> that is, in a Table geſture, at the Paſſeover, and
<hi>verſ.</hi> 19. 20. at that meale he inſtituted the Lords Supper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they ſate in the Table geſture, for it was as they were eating
at Table. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. which was <hi>ſitting, Mark</hi> 14. 18. Now I ſay
having thus Adminiſtred to them the Lords Supper as they ſate, he
in that being as one that ſerved them, becauſe he gave the bread and
wine; whereas in the Paſſeover, they eate it with him, without his
Adminiſtring it to them. He inferres hence two things.</p>
            <p>One was, that which met with the preſent corruption of pride,
that then brake forth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. to 48. Since he had ſet them downe,
and ſerved them, they ſhould not ſtrive who ſhould be greateſt.</p>
            <p>Another was, a conſolation for the future, which was ſignified
and ſealed up to them, in that Sacrament of the Lords Supper, <hi>verſ.</hi>
28. 29. 30. that by his admitting them to ſit and eate of that his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Table, he did ſhew and ſeale to them the fellowſhip which
they ſhould have in his Kingdome: That they ſhould ſit as Kings,
and rule the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which cannot be meant of Heaven;
for that is the Fathers Kingdome, and Chriſts Kingdom ends when
this world ends. Therefore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, not
onely ſeales up and ſignifies, ſpirituall and eternall Priviledges, but
alſo the Kingdom of Chriſt, which ſhall be enjoyed in this world:
and therefore it is to ceaſe at his comming, to ſet up this Kingdom:
for <hi>it is to ſhew forth his death till he come, &amp;c. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 26. and then
to ceaſe. And this is not onely ſignified and ſealed to the Apoſtles,
but as in them he gave the Sacrament to all Beleevers, ſo in them he
taught all Beleevers (members of his Church) that as ſitting at his
Table, aſſured them that they ſhould rule with him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
ſo that the geſture of a Table is neceſſary at the receiving of
the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Sitting at the Sacrament.</note> or elſe, a maine uſe and comfort of the Sacrament is
loſt, which is the ſignification of our Raigning with Chriſt in his
Kingdome, in this World. And whereas it is inferred upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
being with Chriſt in his Temptations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 28. It is not
meant onely of his Perſonall Temptations, but of his myſticall, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41326:11"/>
is, all the Temptations which in his Name and Members doe befall
him; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He filled up the ſufferings of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1.
24. and ſo agrees to every Saint. Now if all Communicants at the
Lords Supper, who are Saints, have ſignified and ſealed to them, by
ſitting at that Table, in a fellow-like geſture, or rather they ſitting,
and Chriſt ſerving them, aſſures them that they ſhall have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and rule in this world with Chriſt, then ſurely being dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Kingdome, they muſt all as well as the dead Apoſtles be
raiſed up, when Chriſt comes to begin this Kingdom. So <hi>Act.</hi> 3.

            <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle puts a difference betweene Heaven and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
in two ſeverall places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. 4. and therefore cals it viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and revelations, in the plurall number, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is
ſaid to be the Kingdome of Chriſt, that ſhall be in this world, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. 14. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 17. Becauſe that which made this
Paradiſe, is by Chriſt brought into this world; and into this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
went Chriſts Soule, and the Theeves, which was not Heaven,
for it is called Chriſts Kingdome, which is only in this world, <hi>Luk.</hi>
23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42, 43. and its moſt probable, that Chriſts Soule, never went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the higheſt Heavens, till his body went alſo; for his going into
the higheſt Heavens, is a going unto his Father, which when he
doth, declares his righteouſneſſe, that is, that he is juſtified from
all guilt imputed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 16. which he is not till he roſe from the
dead, and ſo aſcended in body and ſoule.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> None but the high Prieſt, went into the <hi>holy of holyeſt,</hi>
which taught us that none but Chriſt, and ſo none before Chriſt,
ever entered the higheſt Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. 8. the way to Heaven
was never opened till Chriſt the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> was entered Body and
Soule,<note place="margin">The way to the higheſt Heavens never opened till <hi>Chriſt</hi> went.</note> (for ſo onely he is the <hi>High Prieſt</hi>) and whereas it might be
thought,, none entered in their own name before Chriſt, but they
might in his name doe it before him. That is not poſſible, for the
<hi>High Prieſt</hi> could not ſend any in his name, into the holyeſt, but
muſt onely goe in his owne perſon, and ſo muſt Chriſt into heaven,
for this the Apoſtle tells us, the Holy Ghoſt taught us by that, and
ſo Chriſt hath the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> dignity, that no man but he ever
yet came into the higheſt Heavens: as the holyeſt in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
never had but one man in it, namely, the <hi>High Prieſt;</hi> ſo the
higheſt Heavens never had but one man in them, namely, Chriſt,
nor ſhall have, till the Worlds end: and till Chriſt came and went
in thither, it was ſhut up and never opened to any, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be ſaid,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that the Soules of Saints may goe
into the higheſt Heavens, though their bodyes be not.</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> That the bodyes of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were taken up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Soules,<note place="margin">The bodies of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> taken up with their Soules.</note> for they did not dye, but were tranſlated
and changed, and ſo left not their bodies behind them, wherefore
if their Soules were in the higheſt Heavens, their bodies alſo were;
which is abſurd to thinke that any bodies were there before Chriſts;
wherefore there is a place, and not the higheſt Heavens, in which
the Soules of dead Saints are kept, from whence was fetched the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41326:14"/>
ſoule of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and other Saints, who dyed and were raiſed up
at Chriſts death, whence they ſhall come, and being raiſed ſhall be
joyned to their dead bodies, and rule Chriſts Kingdome on earth,
Chriſt himſelfe as a man comming viſibly with them.</p>
            <p>And if you aske, where this place of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Where Parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is.</note> It muſt be below the third or higheſt Heavens, therefore
ſurely it is in the Region or Element of fire, where the Sunne and
Starres are, or in the higheſt Region of ayre, which is called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Scripture, for <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is Chriſts Kingdom, begun and ſhall
be its perfection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Therefore as Chriſts Kingdome is in this
world, and the Fathers in the Heaven, ſo is <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Nor doth this
countenance the <hi>Papiſts Purgatory,</hi> for that is a place of <hi>Penance</hi>
and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but this is a place of perfect joy and neere comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

the reſurrection of their bodyes; a condition much better then
that on earth; though ſhort of the higheſt Heavens, which <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
is not, but a Priſon. Now theſe Saints fetched from this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi>

               <hi>but Chriſt tooke it up and upheld it, becauſe he meant to have a Kingdome
in it:</hi> which had; and reſigned, then ſhall the world turne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and become that <hi>Chaos</hi> or earth made at firſt, <hi>and ſo the place
of ſinning ſhall be the everlaſting hell, and men of earthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> minds ſhall
have an ever laſting earth,</hi> (as it is called <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. but not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable

            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">How long Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome laſts.</note> conſider we the time of its continuance, how long it

            <p>
               <hi>Now to find out its time of expiring, and ſhew how long it is to laſt, it

Chriſts Kingdome, and is that of which we are now ſpeaking, <hi>and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41326:21"/>
the duration of it is expreſly determined by the Scripture,</hi> which ſaith,
<hi>it ſhall be a thouſand years,</hi> or ten generations: <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 4. it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that in all other propheſies, times were obſcured, by ſpeaking
generally (as <hi>a time, times, &amp;c.</hi>) or at plaineſt, putting <hi>dayes for yeares,</hi>
as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. but here is plainly ſaid, <hi>a thouſand years,</hi> ſo that it
is not to be queſtioned, or interpreted as a dark ſaying, for ſo wee

            <p>I know, the taking this in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> of <hi>a thouſand years</hi> lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,

men taking up that opinion as they laid it, never examined it, to
find the gold and ſeparate it from the droſſe, as it was done alſo
(and is to this day with divers other opinions by Popery abuſed)
and ſo they found not out a ſpirituall ſenſe of every Scripture,
which contained any thing about this Kingdome of Chriſts; and
carrying it ſpiritually, they rejected all literall ſenſe in it: and they
were not wholly miſtaken, for there is a ſpirituall ſenſe in moſt of

ſinner is to be ſilenced in his reaſonings, or convinced, that he ſaid and
thought amiſſe, <hi>Iud.</hi> 14, 15. Now this muſt require much time.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>This is the time in which Ieſus Chriſt is to triumph, and Lord
it over all reaſonable creatures, to be worſhipped and acknowledged by every
one in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, Phil.</hi> 2. 10, 11. which is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to this time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. For during the other part of Chriſt
his Kingly Raigne in the thouſand yeares,<note place="margin">2. Its the time of Chriſts triumph.</note> he is not alwayes viſible;
but if he were, yet they under the Earth, the dead Reprobates from

up, but they do not bow to him: But at this time ſhall Chriſt ſit
on the Throne of his Glory, <hi>and every knee ſhall bow to him, and every
tongue ſhall confeſſe him Lord;</hi> therefore ſurely it ſhall be no ſhort time.
In all the time he is to have when he reſigns, the Kingdome and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are divided according to Election and Reprobation: wherefore
this being all the time, ſurely it will be a long time: <hi>This is the reward
of his great ſuffering, a Reward having reſpect to all Creatures</hi> (though in
reſpect of the Elect he hath another reward) <hi>Phil. 2. 10, 11. Therefore
God hath given him this Name:</hi> Of this, God hath much ſpoken of to
him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. 1. and to his enemies and people, and Chriſt hath ſitten

and will he ſtraiten Chriſt in this his time? when workes in which
God is glorified but by accident, have a long day; ſhall not Chriſts
day be long, in which God is ſo directly glorified? <hi>Phil. 2. 11. There
can be no worke, beſides Heavens glory, ſo pleaſing to God and all Saints, and
ſo comely in it ſelfe, as this, for Chriſt to ſit on the Throne, and all knees bow
to him.</hi> Therefore as we do with workes, comely and very pleaſing
God will draw it out, and lengthen its time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Elſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of it, were to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> Becauſe the ſolemnity of it were to little purpoſe, if it
were not to laſt long (<hi>as we deride great preparations and pompe for a

Rom. 8. 19, 22. For this place as was before ſhewed, is neceſſarily
meant of this laſt and generall Judgement, and onely of it, <hi>every

Gods curſe hath loaded it withall, and ſhall have its primitive glory which
it waits for,</hi> and it ſhall laſt but till this day of Judgement laſts. Now
to what purpoſe were that <hi>omnipotent reſtitution of all things,</hi> and that
large expence of rich Majeſty and Bounty, to cloath all Creatures
with glory, if it were to be but for a little ſeaſon; ſurely this is all
the time in which <hi>Sinners and Saints, good and bad Angels, ſhall be in one
place,</hi> and in which mankind ſhall behold the glory of this viſible
world made for them, and ſubjected to them in the Creation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

more and greater than Mankind, becauſe they have ever wrought ſince

ſhall be revealed to us all, yea the ends, intents &amp; counſels of mens hearts
ſhall be made manifeſt, not onely to the mans ſelfe, but to every one.</p>
            <p>In a word, every act of reaſonable Creatures, being immortall
Creatures (though the body once die) is immortall, the thoughts,
words, acts, and ſhall not onely abide for ever in hell or heaven, but
ſhall be revived and brought forth before all the world in this great
day, in as much as every thing was in Gods ſight, it ſhall be openly
ſhewed before all the world,<note place="margin">Every thing ſhall be made manifeſt.</note> this is taught when it is ſaid, <hi>Every thing

            <p>
               <hi>And all thoſe workes from Adam to the laſt of mankind, ſhall be orderly
and clearly proceeded in by bookes, Rev.</hi> 20. 12. as in a Court of Juſtice,
wherefore wee need not run hazard to know what is done in other
places, for we ſhall ſee and heare all one day, and this may well take
up much time though by an infinite power God will do it, yet it ſhal
be done by Chriſt as man, and before men, and therefore leaſurely.</p>
            <p>Now when this worke is diſpatched,<note place="margin">Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes his Kingdome.</note> and the finall ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. It ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by any other.</note> becauſe this Kingdome ſhall never be ſwallowed up by

            <p>Fourthly, becauſe though his Kingdome be reſigned, <hi>yet it is but a

            <p>
               <hi>The eſtate alſo of the Church ſhall never decay in grace or peace;
though once it ſhall be aſſaulted,</hi> and the Saints, after this Kingdome ſhall
never dye, they who lived and dyed before it began, were raiſed up and died no
more, they who lived in the 1000. years of it died, but together with the Saints
found alive at Chriſts laſt comming, they are raiſed up and changed, and are
all with Chriſt during the laſt Judgement, and when it is done, they with him
go into heaven, and are ever with the Lord, 1 Theſſ. 4. <hi>therefore in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards

Now by the <hi>ten Hornes, are meant ten Kingdomes, which roſe out
of the Weſterne Roman Monarchy, and by the little Horne ſo blaſphemous, is
meant the Papacie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The little horne is the Papacie.</note> which roſe up among, or together with their <hi>Ten

in <hi>Europe</hi> began to be ſet up, and to become ſeverall diſtinct
Kingdomes; but by the <hi>little horne,</hi> is meant the Papacie, as appeares,
becauſe of its baſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7, 8. 21, 25. and its continuing for a

<hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. and is the ſame time named in the ſame phraſe, and the

10. 5, 6. and therefore he ſaith, <hi>time ſhall be no longer,</hi> expreſſing the end
of the Papacies prevailing by the generall phraſe of the time, becauſe
it was propheſied of in <hi>Daniel</hi> in thoſe dark phraſes, of <hi>time, times, and

<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. the Beaſt or Papacie is ſaid to be <hi>one horne with the Ten, to be
ruinated, v.</hi> 16. whereas this roots up <hi>three of the ten Kingdomes or horns;</hi>
I thinke in <hi>Daniel</hi> is meant, the whole Kingdome, or the Papacy, but
he inſtanceth in the laſt edition of it, in which ſomewhat of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhall be ruined, but yet ſhall be Papall &amp; Antichriſtian (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the faction of Jeſuits) but this going immediately before Chriſts
Kingdome, and laſting to it as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. declares, it muſt be meant of the
ten Kingdomes with the Papacy, becauſe the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſhewe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that

this part of the Roman Empire, which fell into <hi>ten Kingdomes,</hi> &amp; the
Papacy ſhall endure, <hi>for their end is the beginning of Chriſts Kingdome.</hi>

the ſeventh <hi>Viall,</hi> or Woe of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14, 15.

of Chriſt will be ſudden, as a Theefe he will ſteale in on the world,
<hi>Revel. 16. 15. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10. Which ſhewes that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of this
comming of Chriſt, and not of the worlds end. Therefore of 45.
yeares after 656. Chriſt ſpeakes to <hi>Daniel, Chap. 12. 1. He ſhall then
ſtand in the lot,</hi> that is, <hi>he with the reſt of the dead Prophets and Saints ſhall
be raiſed up from the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe the dead wil be about 1700.</note> So that it is likely, that Chriſts comming
from heaven, and raiſing the dead, and beginning his Kingdome, and
the thouſand yeares will be about the yeare of our Lord, 1700. for it
is to be about 45. yeares after 1650. or 1656.</p>
            <p>But yet I conceive that there may be ſome conception or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
beginning of Chriſts Kingdome ſooner, even preſently upon
the end of the ſixt Trumpet, which brings in the reſurrection of the
Witneſſes, and <hi>fall of the tenth part of the City,</hi> and that by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſeventh Trumpet, which followeth preſently upon it,
about the yeare 1666. For it is ſaid, upon the blaſt of the <hi>ſeventh
Trumpet, that the Temple was opened, &amp;c. Revel.</hi> 11. 15. 19. and ſo <hi>Revel.</hi>
1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41326:27"/>
               <hi>opening of the Temple</hi> is the Revelation of Gods truth and worſhip
more clearly then was before, and ſo a ſtate of greater light and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of worſhip then was before, which ſeemes neceſſary to follow
upon the reſurrection of their Witneſſes, and their aſcenſion or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up to God, and yet this is made the worke of the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.
Therefore I thinke, that the Seventh Trumpet may begin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after the ruine of <hi>Rome, Anno Domini</hi> 1666. and bring in a pure
ſtate of Churches, and yet Chriſt not to come and begin the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeares,</hi> till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1700. for ſurely, in the <hi>thouſand yeares</hi> there
ſhall be no <hi>Temple,</hi> as was ſhewed before. If therefore the <hi>thouſand
yeares</hi> began at the firſt entrance of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> when and
where ſhould the <hi>Temple be opened, which was meaſured, Revel.</hi> 11. 1. to
be preſerved and uſed, and goeth before the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the
<hi>thouſand yeares, Rev.</hi> 3. 11, 12. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>the myſtery ſhould
be furniſhed ſo ſoone as the ſeventh Trumpet ſounded, Revel. 10. 7. and that
the Kingdomes were Chriſts, Rev.</hi> 11. 15. I ſuppoſe it may be truly
ſaid, ſince ſo great a Reformation ſhall be preſently therewith, and
within ſo few yeares after, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome thirty foure yeares, the full ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Now having found out when Chriſts Kingdome,<note place="margin">Having found out when the 1000 years begin, its ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to know the end of the world.</note> or the <hi>thouſand

knew not when the time was of the <hi>ceaſing of the Sacrifice,</hi> nor how
long Chriſts Kingdome ſhould laſt, at whoſe ending the day of

and Aſcenſion, all the Fathers ſecrets were opened to him, for he
was worthy of it, and he reveales them to the Churches by <hi>John,</hi>
he opens the meaning of <hi>Daniels time, times, and halfe a time</hi> (which
no creature could expound) to be 42. moneths, or 1260. dayes;

               <hi>Argument</hi> 1. Firſt, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12, 13. it is ſpoken of a double
giving up of the <hi>Ten Kingdomes</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> to the <hi>Papacie,</hi> and againe
<hi>verſ.</hi> 7. which may ſeeme both one; yet it will be found of him
who ponders them, that two diverſe and ſeverall times: For in the
former it is onely ſaid, <hi>They had one mind to give their power to the beaſt,</hi>
(that is, to the <hi>Papacie</hi>) at that time they were all alike ignorant,
and ſuperſtitious, and ſo the <hi>Papacie</hi> eaſily devoured them; but in
the latter place it is ſaid, <hi>God put it into their minds to agree and doe it,</hi>
that is, at this time they were not all alike: ſome of the Kingdomes
had Light and Reformation, and had with-drawne from <hi>Rome:</hi>
yet by ſome ſpeciall over-ruling Providence (in reſpect of which, it
is ſaid, <hi>God put it into their hearts</hi>) they who had departed from <hi>Popery</hi>
ſhall revolt,<note place="margin">Kings ſhall agree to give up their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the Pope.</note> and by ſome Agreement or Covenant with the reſt, all
joyntly ſhall againe give up themſelves to Papall power: ſo that it
differs much from the former Act, and ſeemes to be a ſecond Act of
the <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> that is, of ſo many as were revolted from the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi>
and it alſo appeares to be ſo, becauſe it is made the fore-runner
and immediate fore-goer of the ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is here meant
by the <hi>Whore, verſ.</hi> 16. as is explained <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. This Act of the Kings,
is the meanes by the which God will fulfill his Word; of <hi>Romes</hi>
ruine by fire; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall burne her with fire,
for they ſhall agree to give up their power to her, till the words be fulfilled:</hi>
But the former giving up their power to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Papacie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This the fore-running of Romes ruine.</note> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. So that it ſeemes by the generall
Vaſſallage of all Kingdomes in <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Popery</hi> againe, God will
bring about the ruine of <hi>Rome:</hi> for the revolted Kingdomes eyes
ſhall be opened, to ſee how <hi>Rome</hi> hath abuſed them, to bring them
backe againe to her ſlavery, and to ſlay all their <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and then they ſhall <hi>hate her, and ruine her;</hi> and this may be by ſome
one of the <hi>Ten Kingdomes</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> reformed, and yet revolted, and
at laſt fell off from <hi>Rome againe:</hi> For though it is ſaid, <hi>The Ten ſhould
ruine the Whore,</hi> it cannot be meant of them all, for ſome of them
<hi>lamented her ruine, Revel.</hi> 18. 19. But if any of them do it, it is truly
ſaid the <hi>Ten did it</hi> (as it is ſaid, <hi>the Theeves reviled Chriſt, Mark.</hi> 15. 32.)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41326:28"/>
when as it was but one of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 39. and by this revolting
of Reformed Kingdomes to <hi>Popery</hi> againe in <hi>Europe,</hi> comes it, that
the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (that is, the <hi>Orthodox Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi>) are ſlaine
by the Papacie, which alſo is a ſecond Argument, for that is meant
by the <hi>Beaſt, Revel.</hi> 11. 7. and that their <hi>Bodies lie dead in the ſtreets
of Rome,</hi> for that is meant by the <hi>great City;</hi> for it was <hi>Romes</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
which crucified Chriſt; therefore he is ſaid to be there cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
<hi>Pilate</hi> by Roman <hi>Authority</hi> did it. Now it cannot be the City
of <hi>Rome</hi> in which all witneſſes lie dead, for there be none or few
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> but moſt <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are in Reformed Kingdomes,
and muſt there be ſlaine and lie dead, therefore by the ſtreetes muſt
be meant the Ten Kingdomes in <hi>Europe</hi> come under <hi>Romes</hi> Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
every Kingdome being under <hi>Romes</hi> power in <hi>Europe,</hi> is at a
ſtreet to the City, and by <hi>Romes</hi> power, and in her name ſlayes the
<hi>Witneſſes;</hi> therefore Papall power muſt be over <hi>Europe</hi> before the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
be ſlaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 2.<note place="margin">2. Arg. To prove Kings reſigne to Rome.</note> A ſecond Argument is, becauſe when <hi>Rome</hi> is ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſhe is moſt ſecure, no Widow, no Sorrow, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 7. that is,
none of her Kingdones ſhall be rent from her, which ſhe had at any
time under her Juriſdiction, but is in her full ſtrength; therefore it is
ſaid, <hi>Strong is the Lord, verſ.</hi> 8. that is, ſhe being in perfect ſtrength,
God ſhewes his ſtrength in her ruine.</p>
            <p>Thus betweene this, and 1666. is like to be a revolt of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Kingdomes to <hi>Popery,</hi> and by Papall power a ſuppreſſing of
Orthodoxe Chriſtians and publike perſons in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe full
ſuppreſſing will be compleat within a few yeares of 1666. And this is
the ſad time of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Beleevers, which will be ſweetned with the
glorious worke of the Converſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the middeſt of
it, about 1656. but that will yeeld no preſent reliefe to us <hi>Gentiles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but he ſhall goe on to ſlay the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and finiſh it.
Which having done, before he can triumph <hi>foure yeares,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi>
ſhall be raiſed up, and one of the <hi>Ten Kingdomes</hi> fall off from him,
and ruine the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and this will be a generall good to
<hi>Europe:</hi> But yet the <hi>Papacie</hi> ſhall breath, and by degrees get head,
and joyne with <hi>Turke, Tartar,</hi> and the Chriſtians in <hi>Europe:</hi> But
from this danger will Chriſt ſave all Chriſtians, by his comming
and ſetting up his Kingdome. And as there ſhall be trouble in
regard of Religion,<note place="margin">Trouble both in regard of religion and juſtice.</note> before this comming of Chriſt, ſo there ſhall
be (it is to be feared) in regard of Juſtice, and that all Princes ſhall
fall by degrees to tyranny and oppreſſion, and enſlaving their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41326:28"/>
that ſo Chriſts comming and Kingdome may be more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the world. Which is therefore celebrated, chiefly by the
joy it brings through doing of Juſtice; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 1. to 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 10.
to the end, and relieving the oppreſſed: For, Chriſt having a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſwallow up all Kingly power,<note place="margin">When Chriſt will ſwallow up all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power.</note> he will weary the world of
it, by letting it vexe and ſpoyle the earth; and when all the World
groanes under tyranny and oppreſſion of Kings, then will he come
and throw downe all their Thrones, and erect his owne only, who
alone is fit to rule the World Monarchically, being infinitely, full of
Wiſedome, Juſtice and Meekneſſe. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what Uſe ſhould we make of all this Doctrine about Chriſts
Kingdome? Even this alſo the Scripture teacheth us; namely,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. We muſt looke for this Kingdome of Chriſt.</note> to looke for it (therefore wee ſhould know it, for there
can be no expectation of things unknowne) and to long for it, and
ſo to haſten to it in our deſires and fervent affections, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10.
For, though we cannot haſten its time, to come to us, yet wee may
haſten to it, by our longing for its comming: And there is no loſſe
by ſuch love of Chriſts appearing; <hi>For to them that love it, he will give,
when he comes, a Crowne of Righteouſneſſe, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And ſurely, they
who moſt love and long for it, ſhall ſpeed beſt at it; and therefore
it is pitty, that this Doctrine of Chriſts Kingdome is no more
ſtudied.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. We muſt hate evill, be holy.</note> This Doctrine of Chriſts Kingdome teacheth us, who
will love him, to <hi>hate evill, Pſal.</hi> 97. 10. That is inferred from the
Propheſie of his Kingdome: For, <hi>if he will ruine the workes of evill,</hi>
becauſe he hates them, it becomes them who love him, to hate evill.
<hi>God ſaves the Saints from the wicked,</hi> therefore let the Saints keepe
themſelves from wickedneſſe; yea they muſt be extraordinary <hi>in all
holy converſation and godlineſſe,</hi> as 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or ſo much that phraſe
(<hi>What manner of perſons ought yee to be</hi>) ſeemes to imply: In Chriſts
Kingdome, all ſuch things as now draw to unholineſſe ſhall be done
away, and nothing but godlineſſe ſhall beare ſway. Therefore, they
who expect that Kingdome, <hi>ſhould be every way holy,</hi> and give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to be found of him, at his comming in peace <hi>without ſpot,
and blameleſſe, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 14. For though hee will not ruine, yet hee
will ſhame the Saints, whom hee findes looſe walkers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he deferres his comming not becauſe he is ſlacke to it (for it is
his glory) but becauſe he would have encreaſe of Knowledge, and
Grace ſo worke with his Saints, that they might repent and
amend what is amiſſe in them, that it may goe well with them at his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41326:29"/>
comming, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9, 15. for he ſpeakes onely of Saints, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith, is <hi>long ſuffering to us word.</hi> This is the reaſon of Chriſts
deferring his coming ſo long.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. We ſhould joy in the hope of it.</note> this Doctrine of Chriſts Kingdome teacheth us that be
righteous, to joy greatly in the hopes of it, and to give thankes at
the memory of it, though it be but preſent in promiſe and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 97. 11, 12. And therefore to meditate of it as it were in

made of this Kingdome, though it be to come, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 96, 98, 99.
Saints neither could nor ſhould feare Chriſts comming, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Kingdome of Chriſt, and makes for us ſuch wholſome uſes, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as that it is a ſpeciall and practicall Truth, and was a chiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
