            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The First INVENTION, AND ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS OF NAVIGATION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>There having been much written concerning this Subject, which lies dispers'd in the pages of several Authors, and finding that none have as yet attempted to compile and amass those scattered Notions into one heap, I did believe it a task not unworthy the expence of Time, or my Labour, to contract those divided Discourses into some few sheets: And having brought them into shape and order, to offer them up to Publick View; which is the subject matter of this ensuing Treatise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, it is indisputably true from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Sacred Records, the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Arke ow'd, and entituled its original contexture to the industrious precaution of <hi>Noah,</hi> who by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate designation of God himself, brought that wooden Island into shape and order, to rescue some part of Mankind, from the angry Baptisme of a publique Deluge.</p>
            <p>And it is probable, that the posterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> having plantations which were contiguous to Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> where the Arke rested; and there viewing its skeleton, might according to that original, form and build such
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61953:4"/>
Ships and others Vessels, (the Art of Navigation being not yet arriv'd to its Solstice) as might make Rivers and more spacious waters obvious to a passage, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a necessary intercourse, as might improve a commerce between Nation and Nation.</p>
            <p>The Heathen Records, and Monuments of Pagan Antiquitie, which were ignorant of the structure of the Arke, according to the variety of Tradition, assign the Invention of Navigation to several persons. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> attributes it to <hi>Neptune,</hi> who from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Appellation of God of the Sea. <hi>Strabo,</hi> to <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete.</hi> And lastly, <hi>Tibullus</hi> consecrates it to the Fame and Memory of the City of <hi>Tyre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thucid.</hi> p. 4, 5, 6.</note>
               <hi>Minos</hi> indeed expelled Malefactors out of the Islands, and in most of them planted Colonies of his own, by which means, they who inhabited the Sea-coasts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more addicted to riches, grew more constant to their dwellings; of whom, some grown now rich, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscrib'd and incompass'd their Cities with Walls, and others by the influence of <hi>Minos</hi> built a Navy, and by an active and noble diligence so secur'd commerce, that they render'd Navigation free.</p>
            <p>But it is most probable, that <hi>Tyre</hi> being in elder times, a City as eminent for its Wealth and Traffick, as it was for its strength, and magnificence, and enjoying with its bordering neighbours the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> a large extensive Sea coast, and many capacious Havens, which had an aspect on the <hi>Mediterranean-sea,</hi> found out at first the institution of Shipping. From the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Tyrians,</hi> it was conducted down to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by whose industry and ingenuity much was annexed to the advantage and perfection of it: For whereas the first Vessels were fram'd out of the trunke of some large Tree, made hollow by Art, or else of divers Boards, compacted into the fashion of a Boat, and cover'd with the skins of Beasts, the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> moulded them into a more elegant and convenient form, and secur'd them with greater additions of strength, whilst the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61953:4"/>
added to the former structure the supplement of Decks. From the <hi>Egyptians</hi> this Art was transported to the <hi>Graecians</hi>; for when <hi>Danaus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to decline the fury of his Brother <hi>Rameses,</hi> made his approaches to <hi>Grece,</hi> he first instructed its Inhabitants to sail in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd Vessels, call'd <hi>Naves,</hi> who before perfected their Voyages over those narrow Seas, on Beams and Rafters fast'ned together, to whom they gave the Appellation of <hi>Rates.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Graecians,</hi> those of <hi>Crete</hi> had the highest repute for the manage of Navigation, which causeth <hi>Strabo</hi> to ascribe the Invention of Ships to <hi>Minos.</hi> In times subsequent to these, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from <hi>Tyre,</hi> grew most considerable in Shiping, by the supply of which, they often disorder'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed the affairs of the <hi>Romans</hi>: But the fury of a Tempest having separated a <hi>Quinqueremis,</hi> or Gally of five Banks of Oares, from the residue of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Navy, cast it on the Coast of <hi>Italy</hi>; by a curious inspection into which, the <hi>Romans</hi> obtain'd the Art of Shiping, and not long after, atchiev'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea. That the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> transmitted the knowledge of Navigation to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> is without controversie, since <hi>Gades</hi> in the first was a Colony of the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> and <hi>Marsilles</hi> in the last a plantation of the <hi>Phoceans.</hi> As for <hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> they were in Ages of an elder inscription very barren and indigent in Shiping; for <hi>Caesar,</hi> when he made his eruption on the last, found the <hi>Circumambient Seas</hi> so ill furnish'd, that he was forc'd with the industrious assistance of his soldiery to build and equip a Navy of six hundred and two and thirty Vessels to transport his Army into <hi>Albion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Phaenicians</hi> having, as is above recited, invented open Vessels, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Ships with Decks, the last of these inforc'd the Art of Navigation, by adding to it the invention of Gallies, with two Banks of Oares upon a side; which sort of Vessels in procedure of time, did swell into that voluminous bulk, that <hi>Ptolomy Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61953:5"/>
is said to have fram'd a Gally of 50. Banks. Ships of burden styl'd <hi>Ciraera,</hi> entitle their invention to the <hi>Cypriots</hi> Cock boats or Skiffs, <hi>(Scaphae)</hi> owe their first structure to the <hi>Illirians</hi> or <hi>Liburnians, Brigantines (Celoces)</hi> confess theirs to have been the artifice of the <hi>Rhodians</hi>; Frigots or light Barks <hi>(Lembi)</hi> acknowledge their original unto the industry of the <hi>Cyrenians</hi>; the <hi>Phaselus</hi> and <hi>Pamphyli,</hi> ships instructed for war, were the invention of the <hi>Pamphilians,</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Phaselis</hi> a Town of <hi>Lycia</hi> in <hi>Asia minor.</hi> Vessels for transporting of Horse styl'd <hi>Hippagines,</hi> are indebted for their first institution to the <hi>Salaminians.</hi> Grapling-hooks, for theirs to <hi>Anacharsis.</hi> Anchors, confess their first knowledge to have been from the <hi>Tuscans.</hi> The Rudder-helme, and Art of Steering, is ascrib'd to <hi>Typhis,</hi> principal Pilot in <hi>Jason</hi>'s eminent Ship, call'd the <hi>Argoe,</hi> who having observed that a Kite when she divided the Aire, steer'd her whole body and flight with her tail, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that in the designs of Art, which he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to have been effected by instinct in the works of Nature. If we please to trace out the first Inventors of Tackle, we shall discover that the primitive institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oare is attributed to the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and the original discovery and use of Masts and Sails ennoble the memory of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Icarus</hi>; the last of which confiding too much in the dexterity of this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giving too large and spreading a Sail to the Bark he was ingaged in, over-set the Vessel, and perish'd, and adopted the Sea, in which he miscarried, into his own Name.</p>
            <p>But though the supplement and addition of Decks of Ships, intitles it self to the original Artifice of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as is before recited; yet had they other of a more narrow dimension, both for use and transportation; for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> anciently, (says <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi>) us'd to make Boats of Reeds and Bulrushes; which assertion he again justifies in another place, <hi>Pap'r aceis navibus</hi> (says he) <hi>armam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Britains</hi> had anciently their <hi>Naves vitiles</hi> in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s style, the Natives of <hi>Ireland</hi> call them <hi>Corraghs,</hi> and some <hi>Corracles,</hi> they were little Vessels cover'd with Leather, in their dimension scarse exceeding the bulk of a Basket; and these kind of Boats or Baskets were used by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> to transport his Army over the river <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coris</hi> against <hi>Petreius,</hi> and other rivers elsewhere; and he had learn'd the making of them it seems from the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> when he was in this Island, as himself attests in his first Book <hi>De Bello Civili.

to these British ones, (according to the patern disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us by <hi>Herodotus</hi>) that a man would judge, that either the <hi>Britains</hi> extracted the description of these Vessels from the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or the <hi>Babylonians</hi> from them. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Clio,</hi> that is, the first Book of his History, affirms, that they had Boats made of Osier or Willows, of an orbicular form, and in the fashion of a Buckler, without Prow or Poop, and cover'd over on the outside with the Hide of a Bullock tann'd. In these, besides their Native Commodities, they used to convey Palm-wines in Tons, to be sold or vended at <hi>Babylon,</hi> two men with an Oare a piece in their Hands conducting and managing the Vessel.</p>
            <p>These Vessels were so portable, that the Owners were accustom'd to transport them on their Backs to and from the Water; the Master would carry his Boat by Land, and the Boat would waft the Master on the Water: As the <hi>Arabian</hi> Fisherman uses to do with his Tortoise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell, which is his Shallop by Sea, and his House on the Land, under which he sleeps, and in which he sails.</p>
            <p>Proportionate in their Dimension to these, are those which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> use at this day upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> which they take upon their Backs, when they approach the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts and steeper falls of that river.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boterius</hi> calls them <hi>Naves plicatiles,</hi> and which they employ in some places of the <hi>West Indies.</hi> For in the year 1509. we read that there were brought to <hi>Roan</hi> Seven Indians confin'd to one small Vessel or Boat, which was so portable that one man could raise it up with his Hand; as the same <hi>Boterus</hi> in his Relations seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>

and on these <hi>Balsa's</hi> they are accustom'd to carry those Cords and Nets they employ in Fishing. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> likewise have long Boats call'd <hi>Canoa's,</hi> made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and artificially fram'd out of one Tree. In <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Fisher mens Boats are compos'd into the Shape of <hi>Weavers</hi> Shuttles, cover'd outwardly with Skins of Seals, and inwardly fashion'd and fortified with the Bones of the same Fishes; which being sewed together with many doubles and Sutures, are so secure, that in foul and stormy Weather, they will shut themselves up in the same, being rescued by the Aid of these, from the Fury and imminent prejudices of Rocks, Winds, and Tempests; These are about Twenty Foot in length, and two Foot and an half in their Breadth, and so swift that no Ship is able to outvie them in speed; and so light of Portage, that one Man may support many; and they are furnish'd but with one <hi>Oare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I wind up this Discourse I shall winnowe and discusse that Question, whether or not Antiquity had any discovery or Notice of the Compasse which in this Latter Age hath contributed so much to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Navigation,</hi> those who do assert that it had some imperfect Glimmering, or rather some gloomy Cognisance of it, do establish their opinion on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Plautus,</hi> where they find mention of the <hi>Versoria</hi>; and secondly, because the Loadstone, which sways and manages the compass, was anciently by the <hi>Greeks</hi> styl'd, <hi>Magnes,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Heraclius,</hi> both which Names remain instated upon it until this day. But to the first it is answered, that the <hi>Versoria</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> is no other, then that piece of Tackle, which in the Modern Dialect of our Mariners, falls under the appellation of a <hi>Bolin,</hi> by which they us'd to turn their Sails, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion them to the changable vicissitude of every wind. And so much is manifest from <hi>Plantus</hi> himself, in the Comedy which he styles <hi>Mercator,</hi> saying, <hi>Hinc ventus nunc s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if we will traverse and peruse records of a Modern aspect, we shall find that the invention of the <hi>Pixis Nautica</hi> or Compass, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ascrib'd to <hi>John Goia,</hi> or <hi>Flavio Goia,</hi> as others style him, of <hi>Amalphi</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi>; But all rare and curious Artifices are in their first productions like the designs of Chymistry, much in projection, but little in perfection; for his discovery reach'd but to eight Winds onely, which made up his Compass, that is, the four principal, and four collateral, and left the improvement of this invention to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by posterity, which indeed did adde shape and just perfection to this ingenuous design: For in some few
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61953:7"/>
Ages subsequent to this, the people of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> completed this invention, by annexing to the Compass 24. other subordinate Winds or Points. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this invention, Pilots were directed in their right Voiages, by certain Stars they took notice of, especially the <hi>Pleiades</hi> or <hi>Charles his Wain</hi> and the two Stars in the Tail of the Beare, call'd <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Cynosura,</hi> which are therefore call'd Load-stars, or Leading Stars; as Travailers in the Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and those of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> were always guided by some fixed Stars in the Night Time, to Steer their courses in those pathless, disorder'd, and inhospitable ways; so Seamen were directed by the like heavenly guides, in the untractable wilderness of waters, before this excellent Artifice was found out: But if the Skie happen'd to be sullied with Mists, and the Stars to be muffel'd with Clouds, then the most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Pilot was at a loss, and was oblig'd by dropping an Anchor, presently to take up his rest.</p>
            <p>But the ingenious <hi>Amalphitan,</hi> hath secured posterity by a noble remedy, against this grand inconvenience, and discover'd a method, by which men might Steer a certain and infallible course, in the most gloomy Nights, and most tumultuous Seas, and this by the guide and conduct of a little stone, stil'd from its use and influence, the Load-stone. This Load-stone, is now our Load-star, and the Mariners directory.</p>
            <p>This Stone treasures up two strange properties in its dusky entrails, the one of Attraction, the other of Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; this property of Direction (which chiefly hath an aspect on our present business) is, that being set in a Dish, and left to float freely upon the Water, it will with one end point directly to the North, and with the other to the South, and will dispense this faculty or property, to a Needle that is rubb'd or touched with it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pixis Nautica,</hi> or Mariners Card, which carries a Needle touch'd with the Load-stone in the middle of it, with two and thirty Rumbs or Lines drawn round about it, according to the Number of the Cardinal and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61953:8"/>
Collateral Winds, is no less useful by Land, then it is by Sea, so that they who are engaged to travail through De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, as the <hi>Caravans</hi> do to <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> and other places do now make good use of this Artifice, whereas in former Ages, a Star was their best Pilot by Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lud. Bartema</hi> relates, that they who travail over the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Deserts, which are fac'd and cover'd with a filme of light and shifting sand, so that no track can ever be discover'd, do frame certain Boxes of wood, which they place on Camels backs, and shutting themselves up in the said Boxes, to rescue themselves from the Sand, by the help of the Load-stone, like the Mariners Compass, they Steer their course over the vast, uncouth, and untractable Deserts. Some do entitle the Invention of the Compass, to the people of <hi>China.</hi> Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi> in his Book <hi>de Magnete,</hi> asserts that <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> transported it first into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the year 1260. having learn'd it from the <hi>Chinese,</hi> and <hi>Lud. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomannus</hi> affirms, that when he was in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> about the years 1500. (above an Hundred and Sixty years since) he saw the Pilot of his Ship direct his course by a Compass, fashion'd and fram'd according to the Figure and proportion of those we use at this instant, when he was sailing towards <hi>Java.</hi> If you will consult <hi>Pliny,</hi> he will tell you, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Taprobana,</hi> (now call'd <hi>Sumatra</hi>) because they could not behold the Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star to sail by, carried with them certain Birds to Sea, which they did often let flie; and as these Birds by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural instinct applied their flight always to the Land, so the Mariners directed their course after them. The Mariners Compass is not arriv'd yet to that perfection, but that it requires some improvement and amendment; for the Magnetique Needle does not exactly point to the North in all Meridians, but varies and distorts it self (in some places more, in some less) from the direct posture, configuration, and aspect of the North and South, which multiplies and inforces the Sea-mans distractions, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61953:8"/>
enwraps him oftentimes in difficult and dangerous errors. <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> an eminent Paracelsian of <hi>Flanders,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses an expedite way to regulate this grand inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, namely, how to make a Needle that should never vary or alter from the right point, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by a vigorous imagination, as he affirms thus; If a man in framing the Needle, shall stand with his Back plac'd to the North, and place one point of the Needle (which he intends for the North) directly towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Needle so made, shall always point regularly and infallibly toward the North without variation. I wish that some person of an exalted imagination, would compose some Needles for experiment after <hi>Helmont</hi>'s direction, since it is an affair of noble and active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, to the publique interest of every Nation, to have this invention of the Compass, either improv'd or rectified.</p>
            <p>But this Artifice of <hi>Helmont</hi> is infirme and crazy in the whole frame and contexture of it, if the variation of the Needle, from its Meridional Polarity, proceed from the attractive vigour and magnetical alliciency of the Earth, which by irrefragable demonstrations may be evinc'd to be one continued Magnet. Now a magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body is stil'd, not onely that which hath a power at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, but that which being situated in a convenient medium, by an intrinsique natural propension, disposes it self to one invariable and fixed residence, so that if it were violently removed, yet would it not abandon its primitive points, nor fix in the East and West, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto its polary situation again. And such a magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical virtue is diffus'd through the whole Body of the Earth, whereby as unto its natural Points, and proper Terms, it still makes its addresses unto the Poles, being so constituted in its whole frame, order and aspect, unto these Points, that those parts which are now at the Poles, would not naturally reside under the Equator, nor <hi>Nova Zemla</hi> continue in the place of <hi>Java</hi> or <hi>Borne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Nor is the attractive vigour of this great Body the Earth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61953:9"/>
cloister'd up within its own inward cells and recesses, or circumscrib'd within the circumference of its own sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but shed at indeterminate distances, through the Aire, Water, and all other circumjacent Bodies; exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and transplanting its magnetical virtue into all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, either within its surface, or without it; and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in an abstruse and indiscernable way, what we visibly behold perform'd by the Loadstone. For these effluviums penetrate all Bodies, and being ever ready in the medium, attaque all objects proportionate, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of their vigorous and active excitation: And this is manifest from steel wires thrust thorough little Spheres, or Globes of Cork floating on the Water, or in naked Needles gently drop'd thereon; for so dispos'd they will not rest, untill they have trac'd out the Meridian, and as neer as possibly they may, lye parallel to the Axis of the Earth. Now this Direction does not originally result from themselves, but is derivative and contracted from the magnetical efflux of the Earth. And these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations may be improv'd by the observation of some subsequent experiments; as first, from a Needled Sphere of Cork, equally contiguous unto the surface of the Water; for if the Needle be not seated in an exact equilibration, that end which is too light, if touched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes even; that Needle also, which will but just swim under Water, if forcibly touched, will sink deeper, and sometimes unto the bottome, which proceeds from an union of those magnetical effluxions which estreat from the Earth, with those magnetique Atomes which flow from the Body of the Loadstone, and make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on the Needle.</p>
            <p>Now those, first being of a congenerous nature with the last, but more numerous and powerful, by this their mutual entwining and complication, drag away the Needle as their Captive, and sink it into the above recited position.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from a Wire or Needle which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded and devested of that meridionall projection the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61953:9"/>
magnetique impression of the Loadstone had formerly enstated and imprinted upon it, by its great adversary the Fire, by being sometime enter'd in the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes new impregnated with the virtue of that great and vigorous Magnet, and again contracts such a pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or meridional situation, as though it had never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd under the persecution of its flaming enemy. Now whether these above mention'd effluviums of the Earth, do fly by estreated Atoms, or winding particles, as some assert, or glide by streams attracted from either Pole or Hemisphere of the Earth, unto the Equator, as others affirme; it signifies nothing to the Diminution of the Magnetique virtue of the Earth, but rather more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly sets down the gests and progressive motion of its attractive alliciency, and excitation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if a Loadstone be made red hot, it loseth the Magnetical Vigour it had before in it self, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires another from the Earth in its Refrigeration; for that part which cooleth towards the Earth, will obtain the Respect of the North, and attract the Southern point or <hi>Cuspis</hi> of the Needle: And the reason hereof is, that though the attractive virtue of the Loadstone, be in this fiery Agony much empair'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted and diminish'd, yet is it not totally extinguished, so that when its sickly and impoverish'd vigour is re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd and recruited, by a supply or accession of Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums from the Earth, by an union or combination with this newstock of Magnetical Atoms, it does not onely revive, but is improv'd to its former Attraction and Verticity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is observ'd, that both Bricks and Irons, contract a verticity, by long and continued position; that is, not onely being plac'd from North and South, and lying in the Meridian, but respecting the Zenith and Perpendicular, unto the Center of the Earth; as is evident in Bars of Windows, Casements, Hinges, and the like. The same condition also do Bricks contract, by being long time plac'd in one continued situation in a Wall; for if the Needle be presented unto their lower
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61953:10"/>
extreams, it wheeleth about, and turns its Southern point unto them. And the Reason of this is, that that Film or Scurse, in which they lay originally wrap'd up, and which did obstruct the Magnetical Impressions of the Earth, being worn off by Decursion of Time, and the perpetual Assaults of the Elements, the Magnetical Atoms of the Earth do with more vigour invade them, and by frequent onsets having implanted their virtue in them, engage them to that verticity.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Iron in a particular sympathy moves to the Loadstone, but yet, if it exceed a certain quantity, it abandons and quits those affections and interests; and like an affectionate Citizen, or faithful Patriot, moves to the Earth, which is the Region and Country of its Connaturals.</p>
            <p>From what hath thus been remarkably discovered, it is easy to unfold, from a foundation not onely of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but almost of necessity, whence proceeds the cause of the variation of the Compass, that is, an Arch of the Horizon, intercepted between the true and Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Meridian. The true Meridian is a greater Circle, passing through the Poles of the World, and the Zenith or Vertex of any place, exactly dividing the East from the West. Now on this Line, the Needle exactly lyeth not, but diverts and varies its point, that is, the North point on this side the Equator, the South on the other, sometimes unto the East, sometimes unto the West, and in some places varies not at all. Now the cause of this variation, may be the inequality of the Earth, variously dispos'd, and differently mixed with the Sea; with all the different emission of its strength and Magnetical vigor, from the more eminent and Gibbous or Knobby parts thereof; for the Needle naturally endeavours to conform unto the Meridian, but being distracted, is driven and distorted that way, where the greater and more powerful parts of the Earth are situated.</p>
            <p>Now whereas on this side the Meridian, or the Isles of <hi>Azores,</hi> where the first Meridian is placed, the Needle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61953:10"/>
varies Eastward, it may be occasion'd by that vast Track of Earth, that is, of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> seated towards the East, and disposing the Needle that way; on the other side, some parts of the <hi>Azores,</hi> or Islands of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> which have a middle situation between these Continents, and that vast Tract of <hi>America,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most proportionate and answerable to these in its spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Bulk and Dimension, it seems equally distracted by both, and diverting unto neither, doth parallel and place it self upon the true Meridian. But sayling farther, it veers its Lilly towards the West, and regards that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein the Land is nearer or greater; and in the same Latitude, as it approaches its Shore, augments its variation. Now because where the greater Continents are United and Combin'd, the action and efflux of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall Atoms is also greater, therefore those Needles do suffer the greatest variation, which are in Countries which do most feel that Magnetique Impression. And therefore hath <hi>Rome</hi> far less variation then <hi>London.</hi> For on the West-side of <hi>Rome,</hi> are seated the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which seem to retrench the exuberant effluvium's, and poise the vigour of the Eastern parts. But unto <hi>England</hi> there is almost no Earth West, for the whole extent of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> lyeth Eastward, and therefore at <hi>London</hi> it varies eleven Degrees, that is, almost one <hi>Rhomb.</hi> Thus also by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great Continent of <hi>Brasile, Peru,</hi> and <hi>Chili,</hi> the Needle declines towards the Land twelve Degrees: But at the <hi>Straights</hi> of <hi>Magellan,</hi> where the Land is contracted into a narrow Volume, and the Sea on the other side of a vast diffusion and extent, it varies but five or six. And so likewise because the <hi>Cape de las Agullas</hi> hath Sea on both sides near it, and other Land remote, and as it were of an equal distance from it, therefore at that point the Needle conforms unto the true Meridian, being not distracted with the attraction resulting from the Vicinity of an adjacent Continent. To this may be added, that this variation proceedeth not onely from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61953:11"/>
some eminent terrestrial knobs or excrescencies, which appear like so many wens upon the Face of the World; as also many Magnetical Veins of the Earth, collaterally respecting the Needle, but the different Accumulation of the Earth, disposed unto the Poles, lying under the Sea and Waters; which affect the Needle with greater or lesser variation, according to the vigour or impotency of these subterraneous Lines, or the intire or broken Body of the Magnetical Fabrick under it. As it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from several Loadstones, plac'd at the bottome of any Water; for a Loadstone or Needle, upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, will variously conform it self, according to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour or imbecillity of the Loadstones under it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, from what hath been premis'd, a Reason may be alledged for the Variation of the Variation, and why according to observation, the variation of the Needle hath after some years been found to vary, either more, where it was discover'd to vary but little before, or but little, where formerly it had a greater deflection or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation. For this may proceed from the Mutation of the Earth, as it is dislocated or supplanted by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, wasted and empair'd by sulphurous, or other subterraneous fires; or else, as its Magnetique virtue is arrested in its emanation, by being astonish'd and stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Mineral Spirits, or those Fumes and Exhalations that have any Mercurial or Arsenical Atoms implanted in them; all which by a reiterated impression may so alter the constitution of the Magnetical parts of the Earth, either by Substraction or Addition, that in decursion of time, they may vary the Variation over the place.</p>
            <p>Having thus discover'd those, to whom not onely Ships, but likewise the Art of managing them did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title its original invention, I shall adde something by way of supplement, touching the derivation of the Name of that eminent Officer, to whom both in elderand more modern Times, the care of publick Navies hath been committed, vulgarly stil'd the Admiral; and if we shall disjoynt or dissect the Name, we shall find it confess it

only to the Command of the Sea, yet in Times of an elder aspect, it was of a more confused, or promiscuous signification; and was not alone confin'd to Maritime Authority, but was likewise attributed to those eminent <hi>Saracenical</hi> Souldiers and Governours, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a Command by Land, which was proportionate, and answerab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in its Latitude and Extent, to that which was exercis'd by the ancient Tribunes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia; and this I can easily collect from the Authority and Testimony of very ancient Authors. And first, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebert</hi> the Monk, in his Chronicle relates, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> or <hi>Muhammad,</hi> so he calls him, about the year 630. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted four Governours in the <hi>Saracenical</hi> Kingdome, which were called Admirals. And <hi>Theophanes,</hi> in his Chronicle cited by <hi>Meursius,</hi> tells us, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> being about to die, design'd four Admirals, who were to subdue those who being of <hi>Arabick</hi> extraction, did yet assert the Christian Religion. And a nameless Author, quoted by <hi>Bedwell,</hi> seconds this Relation, by informing us, that a certain <hi>Caliph</hi> constituted four Tribunes of his Souldiery, vulgarly call'd Admirals, (<hi>Admirantes</hi> they are call'd in his stile, though in the phrase of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> above cited, they are stil'd <hi>Amiraei</hi>) to every one of which, he gave the Command of many subordinate Officers and Captains, and which Commanders he call'd the sharp Swords of God. And <hi>Junius</hi> out of the Notes of <hi>Cedrenus</hi> upon <hi>Curopalates,</hi> discovers to us, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> upon his Decease, appointed four Admirals, whom he enjoyn'd to crush and extirpate, all those <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> who had embrac'd the Christian Religion. And farther relates, that they to perfect his Commands, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced against <hi>Theodorus,</hi> Chamberlain and General to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, between whom and themselves, a fatal Field was commenc'd; in which, three of these Admirals, and a numerous heap of other Souldiers pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61953:12"/>
Author in his Chronicle, asserts twelve Admirals of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> to have been slain at the Siege of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And <hi>Rupert</hi> the Monck, in the fourth Book of his <hi>Saraceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> History, affirms, that the Son of <hi>Cassian,</hi> the Great King of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and twelve Admirals, which the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> (King he calls him) had employ'd with succours to the King above mention'd, all perish'd at the Seige of <hi>Antioch</hi>; and these twelve which had the Appellation of Admirals annex'd to them, he makes to be Rulers of twelve distinct Territories or Provinces: And the same Author, in the beginning of his fifth Book, relates, that the Embassadors of the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the <hi>French</hi> Chieftains, stile that Monarch, the Admiral of <hi>Babylon. Dominus noster Admiraldus Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniae, mandat vobis Francorum Principibus salutem</hi>; so in his phrase runs their Application. <hi>Monstrelet,</hi> an Anthour of good estimate, mentions <hi>Arcubalistarum Admirallum,</hi> an Admiral of the <hi>Arcubalists,</hi> or of those persons who were arm'd with Crosse-bows; and lastly, <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> in his life of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> tell us, of one <hi>Corbaran,</hi> who after he had Marshall'd his Army, and brought his squadrons into Form and Order, put those Troops under the Command of 29. Kings and Admirals.</p>
            <p>But as this eminent Maritime Officer in these latter Times, hath by prescription constantly assum'd the Name of Admiral; so in the Times of an elder Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he was not always stil'd <hi>Admirallus,</hi> but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Magnus Drungarius Classis,</hi> or the great <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> of the Navy, an Office of eminency and high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate under the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours; yet this Title was not so confin'd to the Sea, but that it was attributed likewise to those noble persons, who manag'd the Command of the Land Militia; and therefore the learned <hi>Meursius</hi> notes, that there was <hi>Magnus Drungarius Biglae,</hi> that is, <hi>Vigiliae seu Excubiarum Praefectus,</hi> the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Praefect, to whose inspection, the care of the Watch was solely entrusted; the Ensign or Monument
<pb facs="tcp:61953:13"/>
of whose Authority, as the same <hi>Meursius</hi> intimates, was a Scepter, or Truncheon of a Purple Colour, richly guilded and adorn'd at the bottome. Now the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of this word <hi>Drungarius,</hi> as <hi>Leunclevius</hi> asserts, is deriv'd from the Modern Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and signifies the same with them, as <hi>Agla</hi> does with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and may be interpreted to be that Scepter or Truncheon, which is the symbol of their Office and Authority; hence the <hi>Drungarii</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Aglarii</hi> amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> are equivolent to our Colonels in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But the more proper and genuine Etymology of the word, as it is us'd by <hi>Vop'scus</hi> and <hi>Vegetius,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from <hi>Drungus</hi> or <hi>Druncus,</hi> which in their sense imports as much as <hi>Globus Militum,</hi> and may without distorting the Phrase, be interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I should now wind up this Discourse, but finding so many eminent persons of the English Nation, to have been invested and dignified with the Title of Admiral, I thought it a labour not unworthy consideration, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to the publique view a just Scale or Series of those worthy Heroes, who have been in their several Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, by the Favour of the Prince advanc'd to this Office, whose Catalogue is exactly Register'd in the learned and elaborate Pages of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Glossary.</p>

After his <hi>Exit,</hi> the Office of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral being held of too vast concernment to be managed and weilded by one person, there were three Admirals created, in the 22<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> One had the care of the parts towards the North, which was committed to <hi>John de Botetort</hi>; A second, had the charge of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast South-ward, which was entrusted to <hi>William de Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi>; And a third, had the custody of the Western shore, which was delegated to the inspection of an <hi>Irish</hi> Knight.
