         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou that trade in that Weed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Herba Exotica, Herba Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana,
Petum,</hi> but commonly
called <hi>TOBACCO,</hi> and by your
Profeſſion are called <hi>Smoakers,</hi>
or <hi>Tobacconiſts;</hi> give me leave
to addreſs my ſelf unto you,
and make my Grievances
known; foraſmuch as I underſtand, that the very
ſame thing which offends me, is alſo very offenſive
unto you: and I ſhall gladly aſſiſt you to the preſent
Power, for a redreſs of thoſe our Grievances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118560:2"/>
But take it not ill at my hands, that I ſhould offer
to aſſociate my ſelf with you: for I ſhall prove my
Place and Calling to be far before and beyond
yours, for
<list>
                  <item>1. Antiquity,</item>
                  <item>2. Dignity,</item>
                  <item>3. Integrity,</item>
                  <item>4. Innocency,</item>
                  <item>5. Utility,</item>
                  <item>6. Neceſsity,</item>
                  <item>7. Piety,</item>
                  <item>8. Civility.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Antiquity;</hi> I ſhall be able to prove, that
there was a Hangman in <hi>Glouceſter</hi>-ſhire, before there
was any Smoaker or Tobacconiſt in <hi>London:</hi> and I
doubt not but I ſhall produce a Coat of Arms, not
from <hi>William</hi> the Norman Conqueror, Dane or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon;
but from <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> 1600 yeers ſince, who
brought the Romanes firſt into this Nation: and
with them came in this death which I inflict upon
offenders.</p>
            <p>2. For <hi>Dignity,</hi> My place is above the Judges;
and if above the Judges, much more above yours.
That it is above the Judges, I'll prove it: for although
the Felon or Murderer be apprehended, by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of Peace committed, by perſons concerned
proſecuted, by the Clerk of the Aſſizes arraigned,
by the Jury convicted, by the Judge condemned;
yet Execution (which is the life of the Law) lies in
my hands. <hi>Finis coronat opus:</hi> in all Trades, he that
finiſheth the work, is commonly reputed the better
workman. And this I can ſpeak with confidence,
to the comfort of my ſoul, I am as much honoured
in the hearts of the people, as any Sequeſtrator or
Exciſe-man in the Commonwealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118560:2"/>
3. For <hi>Integrity,</hi> My place is far before you: ye
uſe mixture and compoſition, compounding <hi>Engliſh</hi>
with <hi>Virginia, Virginia</hi> with <hi>Spaniſh:</hi> I deal in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
plain ſimple Hemp; and never promiſe a man
a good turn, but commonly I make good my word.
And indeed, I work above-board, &amp; above ground,
candidly and clearly, by vertue of no <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi>
at all, or uſing fraud or deceit, cheating the State,
whoſe ſervant I am. And to ſpeak truth, it behoves
me ſo to carry my ſelf; for the eyes of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
are more fixed upon me and my actions, then
they are upon the Preacher in the publike Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:
neither do they ſleep in my Congregation,
although they ſit up all night, or although it be at a
Summer-Size. There is one Calling which indeed
ſeems to aſpire neer my Calling; that's the Taylor;
but that hath not been originally ſo: for anciently
the Taylor ſate upon the ground at work, until a
great Sow came into the Room, and caught a little
Taylor up in his mouth, and ran away with him;
ſince which time, the Taylor got upon the board
to work; and the rumout thereof, ſtruck ſuch a
terror and amazement to the Taylors in <hi>London,</hi>
that ever ſince they work in Garrets on the top of
the houſes.</p>
            <p>4. For <hi>Innocency,</hi> Likewiſe I am before you: ye
conſume either Wax, Tallow, Waſte-paper, or
Fire; I conſume neither, for I do my work by day-light:
I go to work after the Sun is up, and leave
work before the Sun is down.</p>
            <p>4. For <hi>Utility,</hi> I am more profitable then you: I
take off ill members, as the Poet long ſince ſaid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118560:3"/>
               <hi>Sed immedicabile vulnus fune recidendum eſt, ne pars ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera
trabatur:</hi> and herein I go beyond your Barber-Surgeons;
Barber-Surgeons take off corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from the natural body, but withal, dull the
edge of the inſtrument, and put the body to the
ſence of pain; but I am ſo much an Artiſt, I never
dull the edge of the inſtrument, or put the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
to any ſence of pain at all. I go beyond
Phyſitians too; Phyſitians, ſome, are good at one
diſeaſe; ſome, at other diſeaſes: but I make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
cure of all diſeaſes in my Patients at once, and
that with one Medicine.</p>
            <p>6. For <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> Likewiſe I am far before you:
There is a neceſſity of my Calling, there's none of
yours; neither you nor any man elſe could proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call any thing his own, that now he doth enjoy,
were it not for my Trade; nay, ye might look to
have your throats cut in your beds.</p>
            <p>7. And for <hi>Piety,</hi> which is the principal thing, I
exceedingly ſurpaſs you. It may be ſaid of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
as ſometime <hi>Tarlton</hi> ſaid of Oyſters, That
<hi>they were ungrateful meat, becauſe they were alwayes eaten
before grace;</hi> and ſo it may be ſaid of you, and of
your Cuſtomers or Friends, when you take Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
you uſe no devotion at all; but now when I go
to work, there is a great deal of devotion uſed; many
times ſinging of Pſalms, ſaying of Prayers, ſtrong
Ejaculations, and liftings up of the heart; and I
think my Congregation is the freeſt Congregation
in England from Hypocriſie: and to tell you the
truth, I am a Preacher too, although my voyce be
low, that it cannot be heard; yet I preach by my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118560:3"/>
works and actions, but all legal Sermons, threatning
nothing but death and mortality to the creature,
judgement without mercy; yet ſome crums of ſmall
comfort I afford them, for I cheer them up by the
chin, and make them ſee the heavens through a hole
in a three-penny halter, not opening a wider gap, or
proclaiming more liberty then anciently hath been,
thereby deſtroying Fundamentals, becauſe indeed
I took the Covenant or proteſtation, wherein I did
proteſt againſt all innovations, and I ſtand to my
firſt principles; howſoever ſome flexible tender
ſpirits can take Proteſtations and Engagements e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
week, and every Engagement blowing in the
face of each other; nay, although they be as long
as the Creſt in my Coat of Arms, I mean, the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
beam: and I much have ſcorned the baſeneſs
of thoſe Parſons that have taken the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would get other mens livings, &amp; took the
Engagement becauſe they would keep them. And
indeed ye might call my Sermons Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
if you pleaſe, but that I ſcorn to daub and
flatter, and ſend men to heaven in halters, as ſome
Preachers do in coffins, for ten or twenty ſhillings, a
mourning gown or cloak; and I might have the
upmoſt place at the Funeral-Table, but that when
<hi>I</hi> come to make application of the point, <hi>I</hi> cannot
ſpeak a word of commendation concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deceaſing, or a word of conſolation to any of
their friends, who are ſpectators, and my hearers. <hi>I</hi>
am above Preachers too: Preachers preach, that
a man cannot attain unto happineſs by natural will;
<hi>I</hi> ſhew, and am able to teach, how men may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118560:4"/>
brought unto thoſe high attainments under my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
by the freedom of a natural will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grace ſupernatural or reſtringent, (onely in a
ſtring;) and yet many that live above themſelves,
come up to me and die above-ground, and many
that live below Ordinances are brought up to be
acted under my adminiſtrations, and turn Quakers
before they die.</p>
            <p>8. For <hi>Civility, I</hi> am to be preferred much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you: yea if a Cuſtomer or Friend come to you,
ye ſay, Sir, will ye be pleaſed to take or taſte a pipe
of good Tobacco? here's that which is good, come,
here's a ſort <hi>I</hi> can commend unto you, <hi>London</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
not a better ſort, then <hi>I</hi> can ſhew you; come,
take one pipe more, 'tis but ſuch a hour of the day,
or ſuch an hour of the night; and thus ye idle out
your precious time: but now, as deareſt friends
muſt part, ſo do we, but alwayes in due time; and
<hi>I</hi> have a priviledge before any Calling in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of <hi>England, I</hi> have the remiſſion of
the greateſt action of unkindeneſs, that one man
can poſſibly expreſs to another, before it's commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for <hi>I</hi> take him by the hand that comes to be
acted by me, and ſay unto him, Wilt forgive me?
Yea, ſaith he, with all my heart; and as ſoon as he
hath ſaid thus, <hi>I</hi> turn aſide the ladder and take away
his life. And yet the greateſt gallant that ever
fought a Duel upon <hi>Callice-ſands,</hi> never comes off
with ſo much honour and credit as <hi>I</hi> do; for he,
if he kill his adverſary, as he beſmears his ſword
with blood, ſo he beſmuts his ſoul for ever with
the guilt thereof, unleſs wip'd off by a more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118560:4"/>
and it muſt be murther or manſlaughter at
the beſt; but <hi>I</hi> do my work ſo artificially, <hi>I</hi> never
ſhed one drop of blood, 'tis neither murther, nor
manſlaughter, but an act of juſtice; and herein <hi>I</hi>
come off more a Gentleman, then the beſt of them.</p>
            <p>By this time, Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> hope you will admit
of my Society, and accept of my aſſiſtance in the
proſecution of the deſigne for the remedy of thoſe
our grievances.</p>
            <p>And now, Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> cannot but tell you, it
hath been a ſad thing to my ſpirit, to ſee ſome of
you written Eſquires, moſt or all of you called Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and <hi>I</hi> all this while but plain <hi>Harry Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, Gentlemen, the very planting of
Tobacco hath proved the decay of my Trade: for
ſince it hath been planted in <hi>Glouceſter</hi>-ſhire, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at <hi>Winchcomb,</hi> my trade hath proved nothing
worth. It's well known, that for ſeveral Aſſizes
at <hi>Glouceſter I</hi> have had but three ſuits of clothes at
a Size, and at ſome Aſſizes no ſuit of cloathes at all;
onely by great luck and good fortune, <hi>I</hi> had four
this yeer. Is it not a ſad thing, when a mans wife
ſhall meet him coming from work, and ſhall ask, <hi>O
husband, what trade at Glouceſter to yeer?</hi> and when <hi>I</hi>
have told her, <hi>But onely three ſuits of clothes, and very
little money;</hi> ſhe hath ſaid to me, <hi>Husband, if this
trade hold, we may go hang our ſelves; and were it not
but onely for the credit of being a States officer, you ſhould
never follow the trade more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's well known, that heretofore <hi>I</hi> was uſed to
keep <hi>Deerhurſt</hi>-Fayre, a place in <hi>Glouceſter</hi>-ſhire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118560:5"/>
for three things; old Clothes, Lice, and ſhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Stiles.</p>
            <p>1. For old Clothes, becauſe the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
wanted money to buy new.</p>
            <p>2. For Lice, they have been ſo proper, goodly,
fat and tall, that a Louſe from that Fayre, according
to his proportion and ſtature, hath carried as much
Tallow as an Ox that comes within Smithfield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars;
and, that he hath marched about the Table
carrying a half crown upon his ſhoulders, onely for
his recreation ſake, they that have ſeen it can ſpeak
it by experience.</p>
            <p>3. Famous for ſhitten Stiles, and that's conceived
to be done out of State-policy, to preſerve the place
from any infection, or contagion that might be left
there, by means of cloaths coming from diſeaſed
parts and places; for take a freſh ſtoole from a ſweet
proper beautiful Lady or Gentlewoman, aged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeers, being wrap'd up in a ſweet, clean linen
Handkerchief, and applied unto the Noſe, it is an
excellent Antidote againſt the Plague; the juyce

This <hi>Deerhurſt</hi>-Fayre I have kept many yeers, at
both Fayrs, and with eight, ten, twelve ſuits of
Cloaths at a Fayr, and ſome of the ſame Cloaths
that I ſold there, at one Fayr, were brought to me
at the next Aſſizes; then Trading was ſomething
worth, then 'twas a merry World with me: for
indeed before Tobacco was there planted, there
being no kinde of Trade to employ men, and very
ſmall Tillage, neceſſity compelled poor men to
ſtand my Friends, by ſtealing of ſheep, and other
Cattel, breaking of Hedges, robbing of Orchards,
and what not? inſomuch, that the place became
famous for Rognes, as 'twas taken up in a Proverb
by many that ſtood on the top of <hi>Breedon</hi>-hill view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Country, would ſay, <hi>Yonder is rich</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
<hi>brave</hi> Glouceſter, <hi>proud</hi> Tewksbury, <hi>begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Eveſham, <hi>drunken</hi> Perſhore, <hi>and roguiſh</hi> Winch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.
And Bridewel was erected there, to be a
terrour to idle perſons; but ſince Tobacco was
planted there, Bridewel marched away in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> thinking to finde ſome idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
among the Souldiers; but when it came there,
it found none of the Souldiers idle, ſome ſlept on
their Beds, others ſlept on the Guard; ſome playing
at Ball, others playing at Skittles: thereupon the
Countrey having beſtowed ſix hundred pounds to
put a ſuit of Cloaths on Bridewel's back, they had
none to put into it, but the Keeper and his Wife; I
dare not ſay, The Country were cheated of one
half of the money; and if there be no toleration
given to them, they muſt either beg, famiſh or ſteal;
they have lived handſomely by their labour, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118560:6"/>
now they are loath to go a begging: famiſh they
will not, for hunger will break ſtone walls, that's
burglary; and if they go to ſteal in the fields, they
will be quickly brought over to me. Gentlemen,
we may be inſtrumental to do each other good;
you may ſerve me, and I ſhall be glad to ſerve you
in any office that falls within the power of your

thought it had been nothing but paper, becauſe I was wont
to ſee men hold papers before their eyes, and ſay, <hi>Liberty of
Subject, and priviledges of Parliament:</hi> and truely I
thought, that the ſame accident had befallen it, as befel the
Engagement which the poor man went to <hi>Eveſhome</hi> to
take, and bringing it home in his pocket with ſome crums
of bread and cheeſe, laying it upon a ſtool by the fire-ſide,
the hungry dog, that prophane car, eat both crums of bread
and cheeſe and Engagement together; inſomuch, that the
poor man and his wife could willingly have hanged the dog,
but onely for fear of bringing themſelves into trouble, for
hanging the dog and the Engagement together.</p>

of the Subject and the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were; they were two Ceremonies ſetting
forth theſe things: 1. The liberty of the Subject
was a type and figure of that licentiouſneſs that
ſome men ſhould aſſume unto themſelves in theſe
dayes of reformation, to live as they liſt, and others
to do what they pleaſe. 2. By priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
were lively and notably ſhaddowed forth,
thoſe many excellent, good and precious things
which ſome men have attained unto in theſe times,
by ſeeking themſelves; and now the ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118560:7"/>
come, the Ceremonies muſt needs be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, Husband, I might have gone to Church
long enough to a Preacher, before I ſhould have heard any
ſuch matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Husb.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſo too, for Preachers are not the
beſt Interpreters of theſe things; old Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Officers of the State give the plaineſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of this truth; and we ſee it by experience,
and experimental knowledge is the beſt: and 'tis
as cleer to me, as the Gallows at Summer Sizes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>But, Husband, what is all this to us? you had
been better have been ruled by me, and followed my counſel.
Did not I perſwade you to leave your Calling, when Trading
grew dead, and turn Exciſe-man? though it were a Place
below you, there were ſome honeſt men of the Trade; and
at the beginning when it was firſt ſet up, you might have
got the grace of forgetfulneſs, and kept money in your
hands, and you could have but paid for it at last, if it had
been called for. O no, not you, that would be a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto your reputation.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>2. I perſwaded you to turn Sequeſtrator: O no, not you
forſooth, you were the man to whom the Judges were ſo
much beholding, for turning their promiſes into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
(they indeed, as you then could tell me, could
ſay) Thou ſhalt go to the place from whence thou cameſt,
and thence to the place of execution; but without you, what
ſhould he do there? and thus your ambition and confidence
in the Judges favour, could more take with you, then any
perſwaſion of mine.</p>
            <p>Had you turned Sequeſtrator, you might have informed
againſt a man, or procured others to have informed: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118560:7"/>
alwayes, it had been ſuch a man that had ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
eſtate, and then you could not ordinarily have wanted
witneſſes upon ſome conſiderations to prove his malignancy:
then beſides the ſalary, having ſeized his goods, you might
have prized it at a low rate, compounding with him upon
condition he ſhould give you ten or twenty pounds, according
to the proportion of his goods and ſtock; and if he would not
rent his Land himſelf, you might have ſet it to his loving
neighbours, and then you might have terrified other Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
and Yeomen in the Country, telling them, That they
ſent Money, Horſe, Arms, Plate into the King's Quarters,
or you were raiſing money at ſuch a time and place, and then
rather then they would be brought upon the ſtage, they would
have given you ten or twenty pounds to hold your peace: not
you, your honour lay in the way. Ah, hang this honour!</p>
            <p>Then I perſwaded you to obtain friends to be a Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Country. Oh not you! though you had not the
ſame regard, yet you had the ſame guard as the Judges had.
I gave you all the encouragement I could, and told you what
good opinion the Country had of you, which was, that you had
as good a face and as honeſt a face as ſome of them: then you
might have ſet Delinquents eſtates worth two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds a yeer, for two or three hundred: ſix hundred for
one hundred and fifty pounds, and got money of the owners of
the lands, to ſet them good bargains, and ſo cheated on both
ſides.</p>
            <p>And when you had received four or five hundred pounds
into your hands, you might have paid it to the Captains and
Lieutenants the one half, upon condition you ſhould keep the
other.</p>
            <p>I perſwaded you to ſtand up for a Captain's place: not you,
your valour had been ſo great, that you had ſhowen your face
where the beſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be aſhamed to ſhew theirs. Then
you might have made falſe muſters, when falſe muſters were
in faſhion; you might have muſter'd ten, ſixteen, twenty, thirty
men in a day more then you had, or by making one man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to two or three names, and then bought your Souldiers
Debenters, at 3<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the pound, or thereabouts; and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118560:8"/>
to <hi>Gurney-houſe, Worceſter-houſe,</hi> and got Biſhoys, Deans
and Chapters lands, Kings lands, Kings rents, and the like:
and then to that you pleaded tenderneſs, forſooth, 'twas againſt
the hair, and it would bring a curſe upon what was well got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
O that you had been at <hi>Hereford,</hi> when that City was
plundered, when the Country and City in a ſhort time ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the loſs of 300000 l. had you had a command then, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Horſe; and likewiſe at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> when that was
taken, how bravely did that ſet up many Souldiers and other
Tradeſmen, who had brave bargains to encreaſe their ſtocks?</p>
            <p>And then I perſwaded you to turn Gullector for the years
44 and 45. for Britiſh mony as 'twas then kirſned, when its
thought there was a general cheat over the whole Nation:
an inſtance may very well be given by our County, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the City, when the tax laid upon them for two yeers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
unto thirteen thouſand nine hundred ſeventy pound,
or thereabout, and not 40 <hi>l.</hi> left in arrear, and but 8000 <hi>l.</hi>
brought into the treaſury, as acknowledged by the Treaſurer;
and your Secretary can ſpeak ſomething to that buſineſs, who
was part of the time imployed in the ſervice, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>

and ſaw you execute two poor men, one for picking of a pocket

are many, and ſome of them great ones too, that have pick'd
the pockets of thouſands <hi>cum privilegio,</hi> with a face of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

               <p>Sir, what my Miſtreſs hath ſaid, is true; and this I can
ſay, That I went thrice to <hi>London</hi> to make a diſcovery of the
ſame, not ſo much for conſcience, as for that I had an old publick
ſpirit, and was willing to do good to my ſelf, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
too, hoping to have ſomething for the diſcovery; but
purſe and patience being ſpent, I returned as wiſe as I went.</p>

               <speaker>Husb.</speaker>
               <p>But prethee, Wife, tell me, with what face could I
gather contribution from others, when I my ſelf pay none? our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118560:8"/>
Calling being freed from it: And it's upon this account, becauſe
there is an Ordinance which exempts Hoſpitals and Schools; and
upon the matter, I am a School-maſter, for I read moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
&amp; teach men good manners, as it is written in the Primer,
To keep their hands from picking and ſtealing: and when my
Scholars will not receive admonition, then all the correction I
give, is to tie them to the good behaviour.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell ye what courſe you ſhall take; go and ſollicite
cauſes for Miniſters before the Commiſſioners for approbation;
there is a friend and a neighbour of ours hath got a great deal of
mony there, who hath been able to paſs and repaſs men; yea, able
to detain men from Augmentations and Parſonages, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
able men, and help very able Dunces to paſs by; and his
word hath been taken, before a Certificate ſigned by the Maior
and Aldermen of our City: which hath cauſed the Commiſſioners
to be as much admired for their ſimplicity, as approved of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for their known integrity.</p>

Hebrew, Greek, Latine, Italian, Syriack, Arabick, Chaldee,
and all other Tongues and Languages expreſt in <hi>Weem</hi>'s book of
Antiquities, the names of the Tongues and Languages taking up
a leaf in quarto: and all theſe he can read as well as Engliſh,
which is the main thing that brings him in that great eſteem with
the Commiſſioners.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>That's but a jeſt put upon him, becauſe he cannot read

               <p>No matter for that, a little Religion will ſerve turn;
get but a form of words, that will do; learn the language of the
honeſt Officers of the Army, and ingratiate your ſelf with the
Gentlemen in private, and tell them, Such a man is a gadly man,
deriving the word from <hi>Gad,</hi> the brother of <hi>Many-aſſes,</hi> as ſome

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118560:9"/>
but be ſure to arm your ſelf with confidence, and a good porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Marſton</hi> ſhould print you for a Bribe-taker, Broker, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

fear him ſoundly with a hot-iron, and then he will never trouble
you until the hour of death; and when you finde your ſelf
begin to be ſick, then hang your ſelf. But further, there are a

that when it goes out of one body. it enters into another: get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

and then, when the Soul departs out of this body of yours, it
enters into another, and there let it ſhift for it ſelf as well as it can,
