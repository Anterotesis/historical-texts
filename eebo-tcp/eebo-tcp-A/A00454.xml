            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Female was let gone (for, loth a Gods name he was, that <hi>P.

But as he had choyse to keepe which he woulde, so was he bound by no necessitie to let go anye. Why then kept

And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the heathens againe, in whose workes although manie things be found vntrue, supersticious and lewde, yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe them, as meanes, we haue attained the ryght entrie into Artes, the readye way how to vnderstand liberall sciences, and the playne path into the pleasaunt park of al laudable studies. And amongst all such benefits, which we thus at their handes haue receyued, no one seemeth more excellent, so profitable, and so to be accepted, as is the Arte of reasoning, which onelie (as the Prince of Orators <note place="margin">

thorowly seeing and adiudging, what both is, and ought to be in euery matter. Yea, and that man, as sayeth the diuine Philosopher <hi>Plato,</hi> which vtterly in thys Arte is ignorant, seeth nothing else, were he otherwise neuer so rich and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the verie shadowes, and hollow bare images of things. Therefore haue I thought it (my singular good Lorde) worth the labor, if wee in our tongue, as the Latines haue done in theirs, shoulde some briefly, &amp; some at large, so set forth this Art (which I may worthily term the verie treasure house of sciences, the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Iewels, the ground of all good stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the very nurse of right perfect knowledge) as it maye at the length ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that like as the Latine is nothing inferiour vnto the Greke, so our tongue may in time, either be comparable with both, or at the least (somewhat to graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) not much inferior vnto the second. Which my smal labour howsoeuer done, although in value little aboue the apple giuen by the poore man, vnto <hi>Artaxerxes Memor,</hi> I haue yet bene bolde to dedicate,

For it cannot be but <hi>Logique</hi> hath enimies, but reason hath foes, but one industrious sometimes shall haue aduersaries.

               <hi>Man</hi> is a substaunce with bodie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of diuerse elements, liuing, hauing the sense of féeling, &amp; endued with reason.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Quantitie</hi> is the greatnesse of a thing,<note place="margin">Quantity.</note> and it is by two means perceyued, by <hi>sight,</hi> and by <hi>feeling,</hi> and his propertie is to be <hi>deuided,</hi> as an Ell into quarters, a shilling into pence, an Oration into sentences. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quantitie</hi> is two wayes considered,<note place="margin">Quantitie deuided.</note> the one as by asking how great, long, or broade a thing is: the other, by asking how many things there be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qualitie</hi> is all (except <hi>Quantitie</hi>) which is subiect vnto the senses of man,<note place="margin">Qualitie.</note> and they be two wayes to be considered: either of the bodie: as coulours, soundes, smellings, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, féeling: or of the minde, as sciences, vertues and affections.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Relation</hi> is a name giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto things not by nature, but in the respect of an other:<note place="margin">Relation.</note> as when I say a <hi>maister,</hi> I must vnderstand <hi>seruants</hi> or <hi>scholers</hi> that he hath, in respect of whom he is so called. And there are two things here to be marked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>grounde</hi> of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and the <hi>ende</hi> whervnto it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: as a <hi>maister</hi> is the <hi>grounde</hi> in that
<pb facs="tcp:18919:12"/>
he teacheth, and hath respect vnto his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler which is taught: againe, the <hi>Scholler</hi> is the <hi>ground</hi> in that he is taught, and hath respect vnto his maister which teacheth him.</p>

               <note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>The <hi>maner of doing,</hi> is a relation vnto that which is done, or suffred: as to loue, is a relation or action, towardes the thing which is loued. And herevnto may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the dutie of euery man: as to teach, to write, to play the lawyer or merchaunt. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">When.</note>
               <hi>When,</hi> is a word, shewing at what time a thing is done: as this day, to morow. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Setling.</note>The <hi>Setling,</hi> is the disposition, gesture, or order of the body, as when it lieth, sitteth, standeth. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Apparay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>The <hi>Apparayling,</hi> either sheweth with what thing any bodie is couered, as with a cloke, coate, gowne, chaine, scepter, mace, or
<pb facs="tcp:18919:12"/>
that which one possesseth, as golde, landes, wife. &amp;c. or that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth anie thing, as the ship holdeth or containeth wares, men. &amp;c. Further, wheras at the beginning, I sayd, that <hi>Logique</hi> was an Art to define the nature of things: as thus you maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine or expresse what man is, <hi>man is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature endued with reason.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
Now you shall note that a definition is foure wayes to be considered: for eyther it is <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall,</hi> which consisteth of the <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> as in the aforesayde defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man: or it is <hi>causall,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the causes be expressed, as Béere is a drinke made of water, Hoppes, and Mault: or else it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of the <hi>parts,</hi> as Matrimony is the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling togither of man and wife: or else it consisteth of the <hi>Accidentes,</hi> as the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a tyme wherein shadowes be most long.</p>
            <p>Thus as a definition declareth what a thing is, so sheweth a deuision howe manye things are comprehended in the same: and it is also foure wayes to be considered, that is, the deuision of a worde,<note place="margin">A deuision deuided.</note> as <hi>tyme</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an hearbe, and also this instant: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision

of the <hi>Generall</hi> into his <hi>Speciall</hi>: as a liuing creature is deuided into a man, a Lion, an Asse. &amp;c. The diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole into his partes, as a bodie into an heade, breast, bellie, féete, and handes: the deuision of the substance into his Accidents: as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero was a Philosophier, an Orator and an Astronomer. After that we haue so shewed what <hi>Logique</hi> is, what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>common words,</hi> and the <hi>most generall</hi> are, what a <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and what a <hi>deuision</hi> is, we wyll briefly speake of the knitting of wordes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in a <hi>Proposition.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note>A <hi>Proposition</hi> is a perfect sentence: she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing a reason true or false: as Man is a liuing creature.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18919:13"/>Againe, a <hi>Proposition</hi> is eyther true or false: true, as, all men are mortall: false, as, no men are mortall. Also it is either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue or negatiue: as, vertue is good, vertue is not good: it is further eyther vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal, as, all men are honest, or perticular, as, some men are honest, or indefinite, as, vertue is the chiefe good thing: or singular, as, Cicero is a perfect Orator.</p>
            <p>The <hi>vniuersall proposition</hi> hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall signes, as these, <hi>all, none. &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>perticular</hi> hath perticular signes, as, <hi>some one, the most part, oftentimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>indefinite</hi> hath no signe. And the singular hath to the one part a nowne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The vse of a proposition,<note place="margin">The vse of a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> or perfect sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is briefly to comprehend, and to couch togither in one sentence, the full summe of a long and large discourse: as in the second booke of the Aeneides of Uirgill. <hi>Troye was destroyed by the Graecians.</hi>

And if the fault be in the consequence, you maye then reiect the whole argument, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the fault of the <hi>consequence</hi>: as,
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>In al holy men now liuing there is sinne:</item>
                     <item>Adulterie is sinne.</item>
                     <item>Therfore in all holy men lyuing, there is adulterie.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here may you denie the consequence, and so reiect the argument. And the reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that in the second figure of meere adfir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiues
<pb facs="tcp:18919:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as the moodes there teach you) there can nothing follow. Marke therefore dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently your <hi>figures,</hi> and <hi>moodes,</hi> and then is the fault of the consequence soone espied. But if the fault be in the <hi>matter,</hi> or things, then haue we thrée wayes to reiect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the same, eyther by denying the vntrue proposition, shewing the vntruth thereof, out of the place, or seate of things, as out of the definition, diuision, causes, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: as,
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>A flattering, and a dissembling kinde of speach, doth not become Philosophers:</item>
                     <item>Eloquence is a flattering, and a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling kinde of speach.</item>
                     <item>Therefore Eloquence doth not become Philosophers.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here may you denie the lesse proposition, shewing that the definition of Eloquence is not right, for Eloquence is an Arte to set foorth thinges well and plainely, and in a méete, and perfect kinde of speach.</p>
               <p>Or else by distinguishing of the things ambigous, and doubtfull: as,
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here are the proposition at <hi>large,</hi> and the <hi>lesse</hi> to be distinguished, for of sinners, some doe repent, some doe not, therefore of such onely as repent not, the first proposition is true, also the <hi>lesse</hi> proposition is to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, for as all men are sinners, so are some without repentance, and some haue repented, in whome notwithstanding yet remayneth naughtie affections, and lewde desires.</p>
               <p>Or else in reproouing the false propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by shewing a contrarie example: as,</p>
               <p>No Legates ought in their iourneys to be hindered:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this ought not be hindered.</p>
               <p>Here we may aunswere vnto the <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> thus: that if a Legate going from Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders through France: into Hispaine, doe carie with him Letters, or anye thing hurtfull vnto the realme of France: he may be hindered, taken, and punished: as they of Athens, tooke the Legates of the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, going to the king of Persia: and as the Romaines tooke the Legates of

                  <hi>Hannibal,</hi> going to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And thus I adiudge to be ynough, for the vnderstanding of arguments, and for the discerning of the faultes of the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the forme, or matter.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing most briefely considered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, both the partes of <hi>reason,</hi> that is, how to frame an argument, and how to adiudge of the same, the labour being small, and the commodity great, let none therein omit such diligence, but that he thereby at the length, may vnderstande the truth, finde not fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, conceyue the certaintie of things, and so shake off fonde opinions, selfe will, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, childishe brawlings, and errors, for than the sight of truth, what can bée more excellent? on the other side, what is so to be hated, as the wallowing in the foule myre of ignoraunce? What therein is so to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred as the opinion of Pyrro? or as in that the iudgement of the Academikes? who doe alleage all things to be vncertaine, &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, this foolishnesse, I might well say, this madnesse, séeketh to ouerthrowe the most singuler gifte of God, that is, truth, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth to abolish all artes, and stay of life,
<pb facs="tcp:18919:22"/>
it laboureth to bereaue vs of the knowledge of God, which being, howsoeuer ingraffed in the nature of man, is (all being Gods gifts) by true arguments to be made manifest, by good reasons to be opened, and by sure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions to be confirmed. But where as some arguments grounded vpon manye of the places aforesayd, may seme right weake, and of small force, therein it shal be the part of the discrete, and wise reader, so to weigh, and consider them, as he, discerning likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoodes from truth, probalitie from playne proofes, maye onely embrace the veritie, and following the same, maye be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thankfull vnto God, whose worthy praise (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) doth most at large in all Artes and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appere.</p>
