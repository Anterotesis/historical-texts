            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A VIEVV OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE Westerne Counties for the <hi>Pacification</hi> of their present Troubles &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been long the mischievous designe of those, who have embroyled this Kingdom in a <hi>Civill</hi> Warre, not only to maintain an <hi>Army</hi> of discontented and seditious persons, for the destruction of their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> but to ingage the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most populous <hi>Counties</hi> in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall dissention amongst themselves. In prosecution of which wicked Counsailes, as they have spared no subtile <hi>Artifices,</hi> to infatuate and seduce the people to their own destruction, and the undoing of their wives and families: so when they find them sensible of those affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they have pulled upon themselves, and willing returne into more peaceable courses; they have not failed to animate them to their former surie, and interrupt all <hi>Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> and <hi>Agreements</hi> which might conduce unto their <hi>Peace.</hi> The first example of this kind was that of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> the Gentry and Commonalty of the which, having played too long a part in this wofull <hi>Tragedy,</hi> had mutually agreed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32916:3"/>
upon such equall termes of <hi>Pacification,</hi> as might restore that Country to its antient quiet; and this they had confirmed by the <hi>subscription</hi> of the hands of the most eminent &amp; able men of either party. But this was presently disallowed by those <hi>factious</hi> spirits, who have too great a power in the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as being utterly <hi>destructive</hi> of their ends and hopes: and upon that dislike commanded not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and so by consequence annulled. How miserable a <hi>Theatre</hi> of blood, death, and rapine, that wretched County hath been made ever since that time, as we see now not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe and Lamentation, so shall <hi>Posterity,</hi> being lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the quarrels which are now on foot, peruse the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it with a greater sorrow. <hi>Cheshire</hi> as not farre off in <hi>situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> was next unto this people in <hi>example</hi> also. They on the sense of those calamities under which they suffered, by nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing an <hi>intestine</hi> warre in their own bowels, had fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like attonement: and for the keeping of the same, the <hi>Principall Agents</hi> of each side had promised one another severally in the word of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and as they did desire to <hi>prosper,</hi> that both themselves, their Tenants, friends and servants would most strictly keep it. But yet this promise made in so solemne manner, and bound with such an <hi>impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> to observe the same, was not found sufficient, for the preventing of all further acts of enmity and desolation, there following on the neck thereof, a <hi>Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament,</hi> wherein was signified and declared, That the said <hi>Pacification</hi> and agreement, was very prejudiciall to the whole Kingdom, derogatory to the power and Priviledge of <hi>Parliament</hi>; and therefore that not only the inhabitants thereof, but that the Gentlemen themselves who were the parties to the <hi>Articles</hi> were not bound unto them; and finally all the inhabitants thereof, commanded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32916:3"/>
to pursue their former <hi>Resolutions,</hi> for the assistance of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the Common cause.</p>
            <p>Though these <hi>examples</hi> might have terrified the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men, such as were most inclinable to their Countries peace, from ventring on the like <hi>conclusions,</hi> which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived would not be left unto their power to observe or not: yet warre and discord are such troublesome and unwelcome guests, that notwithstanding these discouragements, the <hi>Western</hi> Counties have embraced the same Counsailes also, and entertained some <hi>Propositions,</hi> conducing to the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a blessed peace. And first the Gentlemen and other intelligent persons of the County of <hi>Dorset,</hi> having felt some of the effects of <hi>Warre</hi> in the action of <hi>Sherborne,</hi> and seeing how great a flame was raised in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> bordering next upon them, endeavoured to preserve themselves from that <hi>combustion</hi> which had laid wast so many of their neighbours houses. And to that end agreed amongst themselves upon such <hi>Articles,</hi> as the necessity of their affaires, and the sad spectacles before their eyes, did invite them to: whereof Sir <hi>Thomas Trenchard</hi> Knight, and <hi>Iohn Browne</hi> Esquire, two of the Deputy Lieutenants for exercising of the <hi>Militia,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> were as the first <hi>movers</hi> so <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he most effectuall <hi>promoters</hi> too. And yet this <hi>Pacification</hi> so agreed upon, and at a time, when the whole County so distasted the proceedings of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that there was tenne against them for every one that would adventure in their cause, (as the said Gentlemen did signify by letters to diverse of their friends in the <hi>Lower House</hi>) was not held convenient. And thereupon Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> must be hastned to the <hi>Western</hi> parts, that by the power and reputation of his <hi>Armes</hi> the said Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be broken; and all that had consented to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32916:4"/>
Peace might either be compelled to advance the <hi>Warre,</hi> or flie the <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, whilest <hi>Waller</hi> was upon his March, and the affaires of <hi>Dorset-shire</hi> in so good condition, that it was hoped they would be able to make good their own <hi>Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> the <hi>Devon-shire</hi> and the <hi>Cornish</hi> Armies, who had so oft imbrued their hands in each others blood, though still with losse of men and reputation on the <hi>Devon-shire</hi> side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hearken to such counsailes, as God had put into the hearts of some honest Gentlemen, (though otherwise of different opinions) to propose unto them. And it pleased him who <hi>maketh two to be of one minde in an house,</hi> so to incline the hearts both of the greater and the better part of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Counties,</hi> as first to hearken to a <hi>trnce,</hi> and on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of that <hi>Truce</hi> (which was expired the <hi>seventh</hi> of this present <hi>March</hi>) to yeeld to a <hi>Cessation</hi> for twenty daies, that so the <hi>Treaty</hi> might advance with the more apparent hopes of an happy issue. Which being mutually agreed on for the <hi>common good,</hi> their next care was to choose <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> for each side, men of integrity and honour, on whom they might conferre a <hi>concluding</hi> power to bind all parties; and unto whose <hi>determinations</hi> they might with safety and assurance submit themselves. This done, and the <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> assembled at <hi>Mount-Edgecomb</hi> a place in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> on the fourth of <hi>March,</hi> to give assurance each to other, and to all the world, of their integrity, and of the reall intentions which they had to peace (secluded from all sinister and particular ends) they took a solemne <hi>Protestation,</hi> and afterward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for ratification of the same. The <hi>Protestation</hi> is as followeth, which I have here transcribed <hi>verbatim,</hi> that all the World may see, (if they be not blind,) with what syncerity and candor they purpose to proceed in so great a businesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:32916:4"/>
               <hi>I. A.B. doe solemnly vow and pretest in the presence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that I doe not only come a</hi> Commissioner <hi>to this treaty, with an hearty and fervent desire of concluding an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and firme Peace between the two Counties of</hi> Cornwall <hi>and</hi> Devon, <hi>but also will to the utmost of my power prosecute and really endeavour to accomplish and effect the same, by all lawfull waies and means I possibly can, First by maintaining the</hi> Protestant <hi>Religion established by Law in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>The just rights and prerogative of our</hi> Soveraigne <hi>Lord the</hi> King, <hi>The just priviledges and freedome of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>together with the just rights and the liberty of the</hi> Subject; <hi>and that I am without any intention (by fomenting this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Warre) to gaine or hope to advantage my selfe with the</hi> reall <hi>or</hi> personall <hi>estate of any person whatsoever, or obtaining any Office, Command, title of Honour, benefit or reward, either from the</hi> Kings Majesty, <hi>or either or both houses of</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>now assembled. And this I take in the presence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and as</hi> I <hi>shall answer the same at his</hi> Tribunall, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literall sence and meaning of the fore-going words, without any</hi> Equivocation, Mentall Reservation, <hi>or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evasion whatsoever, So help me God.</hi> Which <hi>Protestation</hi> being thus taken, was subscribed also by the hands of all the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> being eighteen in number, for each <hi>County</hi> nine.</p>
            <p>This <hi>preparation</hi> being made, and the syncerity of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions so fully manifested, the <hi>Commissioners</hi> authorized for <hi>Cornwall</hi> (considering that they stood on the higher ground) did first propound their <hi>Articles</hi> to those of <hi>Devon: Articles</hi> of so even a temper, and so agreeable to the Lawes established, that those of <hi>Devonshire</hi> had been bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the same, if all things had succeeded answerably to their former expectations and endeavours. The most materiall of them were to this effect. 1. That the book of <hi>Common-prayer,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:32916:5"/>
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> formerly established by lawfull authority, for the true and sincere worship of God, be duely and truely observed in all the parishes of both <hi>Counties,</hi> untill the <hi>Discipline</hi> be altered by such authority as it was established by; and that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringers &amp; depravers of the same either of the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> be duely proceeded against according to the known Laws of the land. 2. That the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>statute</hi> lawes of this Realm of <hi>England</hi> be truly and really put in execution against all offenders &amp; violaters of the same laws in either <hi>County,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usuall legall course, and as hath been anciently accustomed. 3. That all trade, traffique, and free <hi>Commerce</hi> be open in and between both <hi>Counties,</hi> as heretofore in the most peacable and best times. 4. That no man in his person, estate, or goods, be arrested imprisoned, detayned, outed, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssessed, or any waies molested, by any power or authority, whatsoever, without due <hi>processe</hi> of the Lawes of the Land. And 5. That all new erected fortifications &amp; set guards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City and County of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and in and upon all towns Castles, Bridges and passages within the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> be removed and flighted at the cost and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Erectors</hi> of the same, and that his Majesties Forts, Castles, and other ancient and usuall places of command within both Counties, be put into the same hands and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as they were in before these unhappy differences; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance giuen for the maintaining of the same without any addition or alteration: and that all <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Ammunition,</hi> of all and every person and persons whatsoever, be restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the right owners. Tho other Articles there were, but these the principall. And these together with the <hi>Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the said <hi>Commissioners</hi> desired might be published in all the Market-Townes and <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches of the said two Counties, without any alteration either in the writing, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32916:5"/>
or publishing thereof: to the intent it might appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the world, who were the faithfull observers of the said <hi>Protestation,</hi> first sworn to on the holy <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed by the receiving of the blessed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and who the violaters of the same.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Propositions</hi> being so equall, and so agreeable to the known Lawes of the Land, were like to find but little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition from the <hi>Commissioners</hi> for the other <hi>County,</hi> if they met with any. But whilest they were in <hi>consultation</hi> how to transact and settle their affaires, in such a way as might be permanent and secure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it pleased God to put into their mindes the offering of a <hi>communication</hi> of the same pretious benefit to the adjoyning Counties of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Dorset</hi>; who as they had participated somewhat in the <hi>Calamities</hi> of the <hi>Warre,</hi> so could they not but be as sensible of the <hi>blessings</hi> &amp; effects of their neighbours Peace. Which being taken by them into <hi>consideration,</hi> it was agreed upon of all sides, that letters should be written to the principall persons of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Counties</hi> respectively, to invite them to joyne with them in so good a work, conducing so apparantly to their common happinesse. And this accordingly was done, letters being written and subscribed by the hands of twelve of the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> subscribing in the first place: which letters were dated from <hi>Mount-Edgecomb</hi> on the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> being the very next day save one, that they were assembled. So soone did they agree on that weighty poynt, that there may seem to be, some superior power, which did so readily induce and incline them to it. The place appoynted for the meeting, was the <hi>New Inne</hi> in <hi>Exeter</hi>; the day the fourteenth of this Moneth, which was <hi>Tuesday</hi> last, being the seventh of the <hi>Cessation.</hi> And that they might attend the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with the greater safety and more assurance of their lives and persons: there was a <hi>safe Conduct</hi> granted by the chiefe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32916:6"/>
               <hi>Factors</hi> of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for every one of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the said foure <hi>Counties,</hi> with two men a peece for their retinue, to <hi>come, remain,</hi> and <hi>returne</hi> (I speak out of the words of the Originall) <hi>to and from the said place or any other places which shall be appoynted for the treaty by the said Commissioners.</hi> Which letters of <hi>safe Conduct</hi> doe hear their date at <hi>Plymmouth,</hi> the seventh of <hi>March,</hi> subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the first place, by the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> after by Sir <hi>George Chudleigh, Northeote, Martyn,</hi> and others the chief sticklers in the former troubles.</p>
            <p>One would not think, that an <hi>Accommodation</hi> so just and necessary, tending so visibly to the ease and benefit of all His Majesties Subjects in those <hi>Counties,</hi> so evidently <hi>conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of their lives and fortunes, which had before been made a prey to the sharpest sword; so sensibly conducing to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glory and the Kings Honour, should meet with opposition in that place, and amongst those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who hitherto have given out (and certainly would take it ill not to be believed) that they endeavour nothing more, then the establishment of all these on the surest grounds. Yet so it hapned, that when this newes was brought to the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> which was on Saturday <hi>March</hi> the eleventh in the afternoon: it was received with great heat and passion, as finding their authority to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lessened, and that <hi>unlimited</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> power which they had exercised before on the Subjects there, to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very much, if not quite destroyed. For now they saw that all those <hi>Counties</hi> would be freed from all those <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi> constraints and impositions, which had been forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by their <hi>Committees</hi>; that those in whom they most <hi>confided</hi> had betraied the cause, and were no longer willing to advance their ends in the oppression of their neighbours; that the people would again returne to the Kings obedience, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32916:6"/>
submit themselves to no other rule, then the known Lawes of the <hi>Realme</hi>; and who could tell whether the <hi>contagion</hi> of so dangerous an <hi>example</hi> might not <hi>infect</hi> the neighbouring Counties, and so prevaile at last over all the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Besides there was another circumstance, which added much to their vexation and disquiet; which was that here they met not with a bare <hi>subscription</hi> of mens names; as in that of <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>; or only with a promise made in <hi>the word of a Gentleman,</hi> though bound and made up with an <hi>imprecation,</hi> as in that of <hi>Cheshire</hi>: but with <hi>subscription</hi> of the names of the <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,</hi> the taking of a solemne <hi>Oath,</hi> and the receiving of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to confirme the same. And such a <hi>three-fold cord</hi> (in case the <hi>Wise mans</hi> note be of any credit) <hi>is not easily broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet well fare a gallant confidence. They were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the question to <hi>Break</hi> all these bonds, to <hi>dissolve</hi> the <hi>Treaty,</hi> to reduce matters there to the same <hi>confusion</hi> which they had brought them to before, and make those neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> like the sonnes of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> imployed upon no other service then to kill one another. Why should not two whole <hi>Counties</hi> perish, nay to say truth, why should not a whole Kingdom be exposed unto spoyle and ruine, rather then some <hi>suspected</hi> Malefactors be brought to yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a <hi>Legall</hi> tryall?

This last insisted on so cordially, by some that doe pretend most ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to <hi>Popish</hi> errours, (as is advertised from <hi>London</hi> by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the 11. of <hi>March</hi>) that at the last it was concluded to

dispatch <hi>Prideaux</hi> and <hi>Nicols</hi> two of their <hi>Members</hi> in all hast to <hi>Exeter,</hi> to signify their mislike of the whole businesse to the severall <hi>Counties,</hi> and by all means to break in pieces the <hi>Agreement,</hi> from which they feared such mischiefes would redound unto them. But it is hoped, that notwithstanding their endeavours to subvert this <hi>Treaty,</hi> and the Gentlemen and others of those <hi>Counties</hi> whom it most concernes, will not so easily be altered from their <hi>resolutions</hi>: beginning at the last (though long first) to reassume the use of their own sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; to trust no farther to the insnaring <hi>arts</hi> of others, then they see cause for; to find in what a <hi>comfortable</hi> state they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when they could feele no power above them, but the mild <hi>Scepter</hi> of a mercifull and gratious King; and finally to perceive what irremediable calamities the <hi>York-shire</hi> and the <hi>Cheshire</hi> men have drawn upon themselves and their severall <hi>Countries,</hi> by breaking those Agreements, on the like temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which were so faithfully condescended to for their common good.
