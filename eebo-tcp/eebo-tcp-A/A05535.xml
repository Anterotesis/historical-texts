         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue wherein the Christian Church differs from the Iewish Synagogue, as is manifest in euery one of the particulars aboue expressed. First, as touching the persons, in the Iewish Church, they who were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ministrie, were particularly designed to bee Leuies Tribe:<note place="margin">

And albeit the function where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they are called be diuine, yet the bounds within which, and the persons towards whom the same must be exercised, is limited by the Church, which hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided national Churches in Prouinces &amp; Dioceses, and Dioceses in Parishes: so as both the election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the limitation of their jurisdiction, is from

the power of the Church. This the Apostle calls the measure of the Canon,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> which God did measure out to him, beyond the which, he did not reach in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship: and such a rule, and measure should euery Pastor in the Church haue, beyond the which, hee ought not to passe, entering vpon other mens labour. As the Apostles had their measure distributed to them by God, so now euerie Pastor hath his bounds desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Epist. ad Ianuar.</hi> 118.</note> Our owne Church, besides the Lords day, hath appointed other houres and times for diuine Seruice in great Townes, as houres for Morning and Euening Prayer euery day, for Preaching, and interpretation of Scripture, such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times as they hold to bee conuenient. Thus is it manifest, that the Church hath power to appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther set times besides the Lords day, for his seruice, as wel by the liberty which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his Church to come, and worship before him euery day, as by the practise of the Apostolicall, and Primitiue Churches. Yea further, the Church hath power to appoint religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exercises, and certaine speciall parts of diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb facs="tcp:9002:4"/>
to be performed in the times, which shee thinkes most expedient for edification. So hath our Church bin accustomed to appoint particular Scriptures to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted vpon the daies so called of Exercise; and by the first Booke of Discipline, euery Pastor is ordained to teach in his Congregation on the Sondaies at after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones certaine heads of the Catechisme: Likewise to minister the Sacrament of the Communion vpon the first Sondaies of March, Iune, Septemb. &amp; December. It was the custom of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> in the daies of <hi>I. Caluin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caluin</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 361. <hi>Epist.</hi>
               </note> to celebrate that holy action vpon the day of the Natiuitie, which wee call Yule, and vpon Easter day which we call <hi>Pasche.</hi> The ground of this power is first, the abolishing of the New-moones, Festiual daies, and Sabbaths by the coming of our Sauiour, in whom the body of all these shadows is: and next, the libertie giuen by God to the Christian Church mentioned by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> as ye heard before. For as by the first we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the bondage of the Law, and the obseruation of the set times therein prescribed; so by the second, all times are sanctified to the worship of God, in so farre, that the Christian Church may make choyce of any time in the weeke, any day in the moneth or yeere for their publique meetings to his worship. And as for the Lords Day, which hath succeeded to the Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, albeit God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to sanctifie it by the publike exercise of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet neither is the whole pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like worship nor any part of it appropriated to that time, but lawfully the same may be performed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other conuenient day of the weeke, of the Moneth, or of the yere, as the Church shall think expedient. Vpon this ground <hi>Zanchius</hi> affirmed, <hi>Ecclesiae Christi liberu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse, quos velit praeter dominic. dies sibi sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dos delige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9002:5"/>
And by this warrant did the primitiue Church sanctifie these fiue anniuersarie dayes, of Christs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Holy Ghost. Where it is obiected, that it is onely proper to God to make holidayes, I answer. That it is onely proper to God, to make times, and places holy, by appropriating to them a diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which may not bee performed lawfully, but in these places, and on these times; such as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and Temple, and the Iewish Festiuities vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law were: for vnto them was appropriated by God a worship, which might not be performed on another day: and so these dayes did not only belong to the worship as meere circumstances, but were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts or points thereof, and could not bee omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without marring of the whole action. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, these dayes were holier then other dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a part of Gods worship consisted in obseruation of them. Such holy dayes the Church cannot make. But to make times and places holy by consecration of them to an holy vse, the Church hath power: for the dayes that she appoints are obserued only for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and policie; and haue no relation to the worship performed on them, as any Rite or religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie belonging necessarily to the integritie thereof. The Natiuitie of our Sauiour may bee remembred, and publike thankes giuen to God therefore vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time as well, as vpon the twentie fiue of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>; likewise the Passion, Ascension, and the rest of these benefits: yet wee remember them at certaine set-times, not because the times require such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or the worship such a time to the integritie and
<pb facs="tcp:9002:5"/>
lawfulnesse thereof, but to the end the worship may be performed orderly once euery yeare, in euery place vpon one day, that all people, wheresoeuer they be, at home or abroad, may bee instructed, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to prayse and magnifie the grace of God, and goodnesse of their Sauiour. Herein the reformed Churches differ from the Papists, who Iudaize in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of those Festiuities, because they professe to obserue them, not for order only, but esteeme them to be <hi>sacratiores &amp; sanctiores alijs diebus,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; pars diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni cultus,</hi> which we doe not. For the Lords Day, it hath succeeded to the Sabbath, and is holy by diuine Institution, hauing for euidence and confirmation thereof, both a morall Precept, and the exemplarie practice of Christ, and his Apostles in Scripture. In the forth command, after the labour of six dayes, the seuenth is appointed to bee sanctified in memoriall of Gods rest from his six dayes worke; and the particular day, not being expressed in the command, was notified to the people either by the exemplary practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and the Church in the Wildernesse, or by tradition of the Fathers going before, if so it be, that from the Creation that day was obserued. Now after the legall shaddowes are abolished, whereof the Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was one, if any will demand what day must bee obserued in the Christian Church, wee answere, that questionlesse for the quotient of the number, the day cannot bee altered, which by the Law is appointed. <hi>Heauen and Earth shall perish, but one iot of the Law shall not perish.</hi> Our Sauiour came not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue the Law, but to fulfill it. In the Law wee heare that God rested the seuenth Day, that he blessed and
<pb facs="tcp:9002:6"/>
sanctified it, and there is a libertie giuen to labour six dayes, but the seuenth is commanded to be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: so howbeit the Iewish Sabbath which was the shaddow, be materially abolished as touching the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Day, yet the Day commanded in the Law, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally must remayne, and euer be the seuenth after six dayes worke. But if yee will aske, seeing the seuenth Day in particular is not expressed in the Law, and that day which the Iewes obserued, is abolished by Christ, as the shaddow by the body, how the particular and materiall Day may bee knowne, that the Christian Church should obserue? Vnto this we answere, that the particular Day was demonstrated by our Sauiours Resurrection, and his Apparitions made thereon; by the Apostolicall practice and the perpetuall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, euer since that time, of the Day which in Scripture is called the Lords Day, as that, which the Iewes obserued was called the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; because as the one was appointed by the Lord, for a memoriall of his rest, after the Creation, so the other was instituted by the Lord for a memoriall of his Resurrection after the Redemption. For this wee must hold as a sure ground, whatsoeuer the Catholike Church hath obserued in all Ages, and is found in Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure expresly to haue beene practised by Christ, and the Apostles (such as the sanctification of the Lords Day) the same most certainly was instituted by the Lord to bee obserued, and his practice in that is exemplar, and hath the strength of a particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Hereby it is manifest, that the sanctification of the Lords Day is of diuine Institution, as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the diuine Precept, commanding the seuenth
<pb facs="tcp:9002:6"/>
Day in generall to bee obserued, as of the diuine pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Christ, and the Apostles their specifying the Day, which hath the force of a particular diuine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. In respect whereof, the obseruation of this Day is a point of diuine Worship, and is holy, not by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Constitution, but by diuine Institution. Moreouer this Day is holy by appropriation of it to a certaine religious vse, whereunto no other Day can be applyed, namely, to bee a memoriall of the Lords rest after the Creation, and of his Resurrection after the Redemption: As also to be a signe of our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, and of our glorification hereafter, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the words of the holy Ghost, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. <hi>It shall be a signe betweene me and you, that I the Lord doe sanctifie you:</hi> and that of the fourth to the <hi>Hebrewes, A rest is left to the people of God, wherein we should stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to enter.</hi> For this wee must hold, that whatsoeuer vse vnder the Law, was proper to the Iewes Sabbath, wherein now vnder the Gospell both Iew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile haue interest, remaynes yet proper to the Lords Day that succeeded thereto: And in that respect, this Day differs from all other Dayes being obserued not for policie and order only, but for diuine institution, and the religious vse whereunto it is appropriate, that is, to bee a memoriall, First of the Creation, as hath beene said, because after our sixe dayes worke, we rest on it, being the seuenth, as God did from the workes of the Creation: Secondly, of the Redemption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on it the Lord arose, and perfected that worke: and thirdly, to be a signe of our sanctification, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God, who hath chosen and sanctified vs to be his people, and whom we worship, is God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb facs="tcp:9002:7"/>
who in sixe dayes created the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the seuenth; and God the Redeemer, who rose on this Day, and hauing abolished sinne, and death, did bring in righteousnesse, and life; and God the holy Ghost, by whose power hee did rise, and by whose power we hope also to be raised againe. Vnto this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and religious vse, this Day is appropriated, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto no other Day besides can bee applyed. That to conclude, the Church hath power to appoint times, for the publike worship of God, and to appoint such a kind of worship, as shee thinketh most expedient to bee vsed on these times for edification; although shee hath no power to make the obseruation of any time, a point of Gods worship, or to appropriate thereto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his worship.</p>
            <p>Finally, to end this point of the power of the Church, when the people are conuened in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie place, and at the times appointed, the Scripture hath not set downe, whereat the Pastour should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, how hee should proceed, and wherewith hee should close vp this Seruice: as whether hee should beginne with singing of Psalmes, or praying, or reading, or preaching; and when hee prayes, with what petition he shall beginne, what he shall subioyne next, and so forth: what order he shall obserue in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing and celebration of the Supper, in Marriage, in censuring of notorious offenders by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Absolution: and to bee short, in all such other points of Doctrine, Discipline, and Diuine Seruice, there is nothing particularly prescribed. Although the substance of all be in the Word, yet the order, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, forme, and manner are left to be determined
<pb facs="tcp:9002:7"/>
by the Church. Many of which points, are of farre greater moment, then any of the Articles concluded at Perth.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the power of the Church. We come now to the extent of this power. It is certaine, that this power cannot reach to any thing essentiall or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall in the worship of God: but to the decencie, and order only,<note place="margin">The Church hath power to determine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> worship.</note> which is to bee obserued for edification in the circumstances aboue specified; <hi>Let all things bee done decently, and in order,</hi> saith the Apostle. The things themselues that are to be done, are partly specified in that same Chapter where this rule is giuen, and in the word else-where, they are fully and particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and not left to be prescribed according to the will and iudgement of the Church, but by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a power is giuen only to the Church to prescribe the decent manner, forme, and order how they should be done. And so to determine the circumstances which are in the generall necessary to bee vsed in diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but not particularly defined in the Word. So by warrant of this Precept, the Church hath no power to forme new Articles of Faith, new Precepts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, new Petitions of Prayer, new Sacraments, or new Rites, and Ceremonies, such as Salt, Oyle, Spittle, Chrisme, Ashes, holy Water, Lights, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable such other things; which cannot be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any circumstances, that in the generall are of necessary vse: wherein the Church of Rome abusing her libertie, hath laid vpon the Christian Church a burthen of Rites no lesse intollerable then the Legall Ceremonies, yea, and haue imposed them to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, not onely as things belonging to policie, and
<pb facs="tcp:9002:8"/>
order, but as parts of diuine worship, which we of the reformed Church reiect, esteeming all that to bee <hi>will-worship,</hi> which men impose to be obserued, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie points of the seruice of God, which himselfe hath ordayned in his Word.</p>

               <note place="margin">The obedience due to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Church.</note>The power of the Church being thus limited, it is without controuersie, that the Canons made by her touching the circumstances that in the generall are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the worship of God, ought to bee obeyed so long as they stand vnchanged or abrogated: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they contayne in them any substantiall or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall part of Religion, or that they haue in them any diuine Authoritie, as the Commandements of God, which in conscience bind to obedience; but because in them an order is established tending to vnitie and peace, whereby confusion, scandall, and Schisme is eschewed: and because the power of the Church, whereby these Lawes are made, is the Ordinance of God, and confirmed by the authoritie of his Word, commanding vs to obey them that are set ouer vs in the Lord, the Canons of the Church must be obeyed,
<pb facs="tcp:9002:8"/>
for reuerence of the Ordinance and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which is the onely direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate obiect of our conscience, and the religious band that tyes vs to the obedience of euery humane ordinance for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>But because many excuse their disobedience with a pretext of conscience, I will shortly set downe the rules of conscience, that by the Word of God we are obliged to follow in our actions.</p>
            <p>The first is, whatsoeuer is commanded, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Word expresly,<note place="margin">The rules of Conscience.</note> or by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ought to be obeyed. The next is, whatsoeuer is commanded or forbidden by the Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of our Superiours Ciuill or Ecclesiastique, the same, if it be not contrarie to Gods Word, should be obeyed, by reason of his expresse command;
<q>Obey them that haue the rule ouer you, and submit your selues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. And againe, Submit your selfe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</q>
To this appertaynes lawfull customs hauing the force of a Law, where there is no written Law. Thirdly, touching things that are free, and are neither deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Ciuill nor Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, we haue this rule: <hi>Let euery man stand fully perswaded, in his owne minde, that he may doe or omit that which hee intends, without the offence of God or his Neighbour, but hee that doubts is damned, for whatsoeuer is not of Faith, is sinne, Rom.</hi> 14. These are the rules of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence set downe in the Word, concerning which it is to be obserued, that the first rule is absolute, and the second and third subiect to it. The Lawes of men and their opinions must be tryed, and iudged by the Law
<pb facs="tcp:9002:9"/>
of God; for as the Apostle sayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29.</note> that is, We must obey God rather then men. As for the priuate iudgement of euery mans conscience, it is subiect to both the two former rules. That the iudgement of our minde must giue place to Gods Law, no man doubts: And that it ought to giue place vnto Constitutions Ciuill or Ecclesiastical, no man should doubt, that knowes how God by his Word hath ordayned, that euery soule should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to superiour powers. It may be obiected, What if wee doubt, whether the thing commanded in the law of man bee lawfull and expedient, may wee obey thus doubting, seeing the Apostle sayes, that What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not of Faith is sinne? Vnto this the answer is easie; first, touching the lawfulnesse of that which is commanded in a Law, no man ought to doubt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee bee able to proue euidently that the Law is vnlawfull by the Law of God; which if hee doe, hee must follow the first rule, and rather obey God then men. Next, as for expedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: The things committed to the iudgement of our conscience, and which according to our faith and perswasion wee ought to doe, or omit, are not things determined or concluded by any diuine or humane Constitution, but such things as are free and indifferent, which a man may freely elect or reiect, doe or leaue vndone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out transgression of any Law Diuine,<note place="margin">In matters of expedience where a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ordinance is set downe, the same ought to be the rule of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> Ciuill, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall. In such things, the Apostle willeth euery man to follow that which hee thinks most expedient for edification, and eschuing of scandall. Where a man hath not a Law, his iudgement is the rule of his conscience; but where there is a Law, the Law must
<pb facs="tcp:9002:9"/>
be the rule. As for example, before that Apostolicall Canon that forbad to eate bloud, or strangled things, euery man might haue done that which in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he thought most expedient, according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of times, places, and persons. In presence of the Iewes hee might haue abstayned from these things, if in his heart hee thought it most expedient, for eschuing their offence: Contrariwise, in presence of conuerted Gentiles, he might haue eaten, if hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, that by his abstinence they would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken offence, and doubted of their Christian libertie; but after the making and publication of the Canon that inioyned abstinence, the same was to rule their consciences. And therefore, after that time, albeit a man had thought in his owne priuate iudgement, that to abstayne from these things was not expedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some by his abstinence might haue taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as before; yet in that case he ought not to haue eaten, because now the will of the Law, and not the iudgement of his owne mind, was the rule of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Neither was hee now to respect the scandall, because it was remoued by the Law: for, by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a lawfull Ordinance no man giues scandall, and if any take offence, both the cause and occasion thereof is the peruersnesse onely of the person offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith well, <hi>Res bona neminem offendit, nisi malam mentem,</hi> that is, A good thing (such as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) can offend no man, but an euill minde; which must bee reformed by good information, and not by disobedience, which confirmeth errour, and causes rebellion. <hi>Caluin</hi> in his 363. <hi>Epist.</hi> written to <hi>Oleuian,</hi> giues many reasons, wherefore the comfort
<pb facs="tcp:9002:10"/>
of the Sacrament ought not to be refused to the sicke in time of extremitie, and declares that in his owne iudgement, he thought it expedient not to refuse the same; yet he subioynes, <hi>Scis, frater, alium esse apud nos morem: fero, quia non est vtile contendere,</hi> that is, Yee know, Brother, wee haue another custome: I beare with it, because I thinke not good to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Here <hi>Caluin</hi> preferreth the custome of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> to his owne iudgement, and will leaue that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done which he thought expedient to be done, rather then by doing it, and infringing the custome of the Church, to make contention. What then, shall wee doe ill, that good may come of it? for is it not euill to omit that which we thinke expedient to bee done, and that ought not to be refused, to the end good may come of it, namely, peace preserued, and contention eschued? To this I answer, The euill which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle forbids, is a thing simply vnlawfull in it selfe, and not that which in one respect may be expedient, and in another inexpedient: As to giue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the sicke is expedient for their comfort, but to giue it contrary to the order of the Church, is not expedient. In things of this nature, <hi>Ex duobus malis, minus eligendum est,</hi> that is, Of two euils the least must be chosen. It is euill to refuse the comfort of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the sicke, but it is worse to giue it against the custome of the Church, and make contention. I must therefore in this case choose the least euill, and not giue the Sacrament, because thereby the greater euill being eschued, the lesse ceasseth to bee euil, and becommeth good. It is doubtlesse an euill thing to cast our goods in the Sea, but it is worse to lose our
<pb facs="tcp:9002:10"/>
liues: Here the least euill is to bee chosen, for the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuing the greater, and in that respect it ceasses to be euill. Thus the rule holds in all things of this quality, when that which is euill is not vnlawfull and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, but vnexpedient and vnprofitable. And so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, <hi>Caluine</hi> for this cause preferres the custome of Geneua, to his owne iudgement in a matter of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diencie: for it is euer more expedient to obey a Law, and keepe a lawfull Custome, then to doe a thing thought more expedient, if it cannot be done, but by an open breach of the Law: because thereby the Law must be brought in contempt, priuate opinion prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to publike authoritie, and so confusion, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Schisme brought in; and order, peace, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie shoot to the doore. To conclude, in matters of expediencie, where a Law is set downe, if wee make not the Law the rule of our obedience and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but our owne priuate opinions and conceits, then must we with the Anabaptists disproue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all sorts of Gouernment, and liue like lawlesse Libertines, euery man following his owne conceite; whereunto it is certaine the peruersenesse of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture carryes vs, that is alwayes prone to rebellion, and therefore easily drawne thereto with any shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, pretext of conscience and religion: which the Penner of this pestilent Pamphlet considering, intends with Lyes, Calumnies, Falshoods, craftie Cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Threatnings and Terrours of Oathes, Promises, and Subscriptions, to deceiue the simple, stirre vp the Seditious, confirme the Rebellious, &amp; to beare down the Truth, his Maiesties Authority, the Power of the Church, and all that loue Order &amp; follow after peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9002:11"/>To obuiate this his seditious and malicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it was not onely expedient, but necessary, that this answere should bee made, which by the grace of God, shall giue such satisfaction to all good and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearted men, as they shall preferre the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determination, and lawfull Constitutions of the Church, to the singularitie of their owne, and other priuate mens opinions; order to confusion, peace to contention, and vnitie to schisme: aswell for the feare of God, who hath giuen power to his Church to set downe Lawes for order, and decencie, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to submit our selues thereto; as for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the sacred will of our most gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, at whose instant and earnest desire these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being found lawfull were concluded, and are now commanded to bee practised. When <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue gone out against <hi>Absalon,</hi> hee was stayed by the people, who esteemed his life more worth then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of theirs: So should euery good Christian esteeme of the loue and fauour of the Prince towards the Church. <hi>Salomon</hi> sayes, that the wrath of a King, is the Messenger of Death, and like to the roring of a Lion, which a Wiseman will pacifie, and not prouoke: and that his fauour is as the cloud of the latter raine, and as the dew vpon the grasse. The truth of this is manifest in the Stories of the Church: what comfort the fauour of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great did giue to the Christian Church, may be seene by the barbarous and cruell persecutions of the Emperours that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The euils, troubles, and calamities that the Church of England endured in the dayes of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9002:11"/>
declared what benefit they enioyed by King <hi>Edward</hi> her Predecessor, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Successor. The beastly crueltie, and massacres vsed in France vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gouernment of the Predecessors of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Great, hath made manifest to the World, what wracke and misery the discontentment, and offence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and how great blessing and felicity their loue, and fauour produces to the Church of God within their Dominions. What need wee to goe further then the Scriptures for examples to this purpose? therein wee see, that as the Church decayed vnder wicked and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Gouernours, so did it euer reuiue, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish vnder religious and godly Kings. We stand much vpon the offence of people, and esteeme greatly of their fauour, wherein I will not say we doe euill; but should wee put their fauour and offence in ballance with the fauour, and offence of him whom God hath annointed and appointed to be the nursing Father of this Church? In whose loue we haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and daily findes greater benefite and good for the aduancement of true Religion, then can bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from many thousands of our best Professors; let be at their hands, who in Religion like nothing well but contention, whereby they make their aduantage one way or other, as they are inclined, delighting to fish (as the Prouerbe is) in troubled waters.</p>
            <p>It is often obiected, that the chiefe cause of our yeelding at Perth to the fiue Articles, was the respect we had to the fauour of the Prince, and the feare of his wrath: against my selfe in particular it is falsly obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the penner of this Pamphlet, that I confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we had neither Reason, Scripture, nor Antiquitie
<pb facs="tcp:9002:12"/>
for them, yet to diuert the Kings wrath from the Church, yeelding was best. The truth is, at that time I spake only of kneeling at the receiuing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and said no more then I haue set downe in print in that Treatise which I published for kneeling, in the last words of the first Section of the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the first Section of the second Chapter at the beginning: this was, That neither Scripture, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, nor Reason doe enforce any necessitie either for lying, sitting, standing, or kneeling at the Sacrament; and that all these gestures being indifferent, I held it most expedient to yeeld, and not to striue with our gracious Souereigne for a matter of that nature, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Verse,

                  <l>Cedere maiori virtutis fama secunda est:</l>
                  <l>Illa grauis palma est, quam minor hostis habet.</l>

            <p>This I said at that time, and so yet I thinke, that to eschue the Prince his offence, and to keep, confirme, and increase his loue and fauour towards the Gospell and the Church, was a respect and cause great enough wherefore we should haue yeelded vnto his Maiesties desire in matters indifferent; against the lawfulnesse whereof, nothing hath beene, or can bee obiected, which is not, and may not be easily answered. Against the expediencie, the feare of scandall was and is all that could be pretended; which if wee were peaceably disposed, might haue beene, and yet may be very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remoued: and therefore such a feare ought neither to haue impedite our yeelding at that time, nor our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience now. We are exhorted by the holy Ghost to feare God, and obey the King. Where obedience to
<pb facs="tcp:9002:12"/>
the Prince may stand with Gods feare, it ought to bee preferred by euery good Christian to all other respects, and especially by the Pastors of the Church, who should as lights goe before others both in doctrine, and example, chiefly, when peace and vnitie may bee procured and preserued in Gods house by our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>For vnitie, wee should bee ready to lay downe our liues, as well as for veritie, which <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of Alexandria writing to <hi>Nouatus,</hi> affirmed, saying: <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuerit etiam pati omnia, ne scinderetur Ecclesia Dei,</hi>

To whom S. <hi>Augustine</hi> answers, That they complained most vniustly, that they were persecuted by the Church, because the Church was more heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persecuted by them: and thereupon in the eleuenth Tractate vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayes, Albeit <hi>Ismael</hi> was cast out of his Fathers house, for <hi>Isackes</hi> sake, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls not <hi>Isaack,</hi> but <hi>Ismael,</hi> the Persecutor. In his Booke intituled, <hi>De Vnitate Ecclesiae,</hi> against <hi>Petili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Donatist, he writeth thus: <hi>Grauius persequitur filius patrem male viuendo, quam pater filium castigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do: &amp; grauius ancilla Saram persecuta est per iniquam superbiam, quàm eam Sara per debitam disciplinam: &amp; grauius Dominum persequebantur propter quos dictum est, Zelus domus tuae commedit me, quàm ipse eos, cum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum mensas euertit, &amp; eos flagello de templo expulit:</hi> that is to say, The sonne persecutes the father more grieuously by his wicked liuing, then the father doth the sonne by inflicting due chastisement. And <hi>Agar</hi> the Hand-maid did persecute <hi>Sara</hi> her mistresse more spitefully, by her vndutifull pride, then <hi>Sara</hi> did her by vsing due discipline. And they of whom it was said, The zeale of thine house hath eaten mee vp, did persecute the Lord more cruelly, then hee did them while as he ouerthrew their Tables, and droue them out of the Temple with scourges. And a little before in that same place, he affirmes, that they were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of themselues by the Apostles words: <hi>Qui resistit potestati, Dei ordinationi resistit: qui autem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistunt, ipsi sibi iudicium acquirunt,</hi> that is, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist draw punishment and iudgement vpon themselues: and often repeateth this sentence, <hi>Non poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,

These paines are chiefly taken for thy informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thou mayest know the truth and vnderstand both the matter, and manner of proceeding in the said As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. Since that time, I heare they haue put the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet in Latine, and set forth other Libels full of impious and reproachfull lies against the principall men of our Church. These I haue not seene, and if I had, I would not haue deigned them any answer. For, when leauing the matter, they fall a rayling at the persons of men, that are their betters in all respects, they shew the weaknesse of their cause, &amp; deserue nothing of wisemen, but contempt. This manner of doing is better replyed with the Pillorie, then otherwise. Wee know the eares of many are open to admit detractions, and he liues not, that is not hated by some, who will readily beleeue the most false things: yet, Wickednesse hath not so generally preuailed in the world, nor are we so vnknowne in it, as wee neede any of vs to feare their defamations. If thou, notwithstanding, doest think that such Libels require an answer, I aske thee, How
<pb facs="tcp:9002:15"/>
shall it be done? I know no way my selfe, but eyther to vse Apologies or recriminations. And this last were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile to doe: for though the Writer goeth namelesse, the Faction to whose pleasure he writes is knowne, and they that sport themselues with such libels, sending them from hand to hand, as matters of some worth. Their persons we could easily pay home, and repone true things vnto them in stead of forged, telling them no other matters, then haue beene tried, confessed, and publiquely acknowledged by those that are hottest in this businesse, of themselues: but these are the weapons of the vulgar, which we disdain to vse, <hi>&amp; vltio haec, Christiano homini maxime indeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> As for Apologies, the Wise man saith, That they leaue suspitions in the Readers mind, <hi>&amp; plures Sermones pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocant, &amp; plurium:</hi> The best Apologie against calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is, <hi>conuitiatores factis refellere.

Fame is not at mans disposing: and if any amongst men haue power of it, <hi>in nostra manu est,</hi> as one speakes, <hi>bene vel secus audire.</hi> We therefore resting in the goodnesse of our cause and conscience, will keepe silence, and not vnderstand such things, passing little with the Apostle to be iudged of them, or of the day of man. He that iudges is the Lord, who will lighten things that are hidden in darkenesse, and make the counsells of the hearts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: And then shall euerie man haue praise of God.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end the true causes of this meeting may be vnderstood, wee must draw the occasion thereof somewhat further off, then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation mentioned by the <hi>Libeller.</hi> So it is, That his Maiestie at his late beeing in this Kingdome, did propone to the Bishops, and principall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who were called to meete at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the tenth of Iuly 1617. the fiue Articles now conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, desiring they might be receyued in this Church, and an alteration made of the other customes that obtained before in these points. This proposition was made by his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie himselfe in the Chappell of the Castle, where then his Maiestie remained. Vpon the hearing whereof, humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by the Bishops and Ministers there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that they should bee permitted to conferre amongst themselues, vpon the said proposition, before they gaue any answer. Which being graunted, they went, and met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9002:23"/>
in the Session house of the Paroch Church, where after mature deliberation, it was concluded, they should put vp one common Supplication, to his Maiestie for libertie of a generall Assembly, to aduise and take conclusion in these poynts. It being signified vnto them at the same time by the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> that his Maiesty would take this for a shift, and not content with the Supplication, vnlesse assurance were giuen, that the same Articles, should be yeelded vnto, in the Assembly; Answer was made by the whole number, That howsoeuer, they could not preiudge themselues of their free voyces in an Assembly, by graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the said Articles before-hand, considering they were matters in themselues lawfull, and of a nature indifferent; as they could not thinke but the whole Church would bee readie to giue his Maiestie satisfaction therein, so for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they would doe what lay in them for passing the same. And this they all desired the said Archbishop in their names to answer. But hee denying to promise any thing in the behalfe of the Ministers, in regard of the seditious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, they had, against their promise, at least a number of them penned to be giuen in the next Parliament, Maister <hi>Patricke Galloway</hi> was by them desired to make the said an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and concurre with the Bishops in the foresaid suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for a generall Assembly.</p>
            <p>Thus, all returning to the saide Chappell, petition was made in humble forme to his Maiestie by the Archbishop in the name of the whole, That they might be permitted to meete in an Assembly, where the said Articles should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the answer, which was fit. His Maiestie replying, that hee could not suffer these Articles, which hee counted both lawfull and profitable for the Church, to bee cast in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of an Assembly, where by reason of the multitude, matters went often doubtfully, except he had assurance, the same should be yeelded vnto; answer was made, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they could not that were present, take on them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for the whole Church, yet because they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9002:23"/>
any of these Articles to contayne in them, matters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, they hoped all good Ministers would shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues carefull to giue his Maiestie satisfaction, and should for their owne parts endeuour that the same should be done. This was promised by the Archbishop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> in name of all the Bishops, and by Master <hi>Patrick-Galloway</hi> in name of the Ministers, as was afore-agreed.</p>
            <p>Hereupon his Maiestie was pleased to condescend vpon the meeting of an Assembly at Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Nouember</hi> following, where the said Articles, being reasoned vpon at length, it was found by vniuersall consent, That they contayned in them nothing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in respect the suddaine receiuing of them might giue offence to the weaker Professors, and encouragement to the enemies of Religion, it was thought meete to differ the taking of any conclusion, specially about the keeping of the Festiuall dayes, and kneeling at the Communion, vnto another Assembly; And all the Ministers commanded, like as they who were present for themselues promised, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their people and Congregations, aswell of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the things desired, as of the necessitie they had to receiue the same, because of his Maiesties resolution so to haue it; and by this meanes all offence being remoued, in the next Assembly matters might take an end with vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme consent; in the meane time, lest his Maiestie should offend with this delay, his Maiesties Commissioners, and the Bishops were earnestly entreated by the said Assembly to signifie the true reasons of the present co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuation, &amp; beseech the same to bee well interpreted, seeing no denyall of the Articles was intended, but a care on their parts to remoue all scruple and offence from amongst the people.</p>
            <p>This aduertizement being made, his Maiestie tooke the same so hardly, as forth-with he gaue commandement to the Bishops to obserue the dayes of Christmasse, Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, &amp;c. And to cause all the Ministers of their Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to obserue the like, as also to alter the gesture of sitting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9002:24"/>
at the holy Communion, into that of kneeling, which the Article required. And to sequestrate the stipends of so many as should be found disobedient.</p>
            <p>It grieued all the honest and true-hearted Ministers to see his Maiesty so offended, and many repented the delay made in the last Assembly: and because there was one meane only left to giue satisfaction, to wit, That a new Assembly might be gathered to put end to the same; the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> was entreated to intercede with his Maiesty for a mitigation of the rigour intended against the Ministers, and liberty for a new Assembly, to finish that which remayned to be perfected. To this effect he dispatched his Seruant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Court with haste, writing in such humble sort as became, and for the purpose aboue-said; but receiued this Answere, That touching another Assembly his Maiesty would neuer condescend vnto the same, except better assurance were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of their reasonable conforming; therefore commanded him and the rest of the Bishops in their seuerall Synods, to vrge the receiuing of the said Articles, and as they should find them inclining, to aduertise; and for the sequestration of stipends, his Maiesty would be pleased to remit that rigor for the present, so as the Bishops by themselues in their Sees, with so many others as they could perswade, should put in practice the said Articles according to the Letter, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed vnto them.</p>
            <p>This Answere being communicated vnto the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and a great many others, that were attending at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for the setling of their Churches according to the Commission giuen in Parliament, they all aduised the Bishops to giue obedience in their own persons, and at their Synods, to labour the Ministers of their bounds in the best sort they could, to condescend vnto the Articles proponed.</p>
            <p>The Bishops resoluing to giue obedience, for his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties better satisfaction, and freeing the Ministers of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued wrath, agreed, after their Synods were ended, to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>May</hi> next; and as they should find by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9002:24"/>
report of the Ministers inclination to yeeld to the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to follow their Supplication about a new Assembly.</p>
            <p>According to which agreement, they hauing met at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and vnderstood thar in the Synods kept in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> before, the Ministers were disposed to giue obedience and satisfaction to his Maiestie: they by their Letters hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreated his Maiesties Licence, for the holding of an new Assembly, and obtayned the same; which they signified by their Letters to the Moderators of their seuerall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Countrey, willing them to elect and choose the most wise, learned and peaceable Ministers in their bounds, to be Commissionaries at the said Assembly.</p>
            <p>But contrary to this aduice and direction, certaine facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnruly Ministers, that haue loued alwayes to keepe stirres in the Church, and placed their glory in the opposing of his Maiesties lawfull desires, vsed all the diligence they could, where they had credit, to purchase Commission to themselues, and others that fauoured their opinions, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the said Assembly; and came thither at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in great numbers, &amp; certaine hopes to haue carryed matters otherwise then was inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; howbeit to little effect, as the successe of the said meeting manifested. Vpon these occasions the meeting was brought on; &amp; not abruptly by a Proclamation, being made 20. daies before, as the Libeller would haue it to appear. The said Proclamation being made only to take away all excuse from such as might pretend ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the day. Which being come, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of a long time obserued, the first meeting was begun with prayer &amp; fasting, whereof the Libeller grants that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made in the Church of <hi>Perth</hi> the Sonday prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaines that the fast was little regarded, &amp; it may be by himself, &amp; others of that Sect, whose dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were only to make strife: but he cannot deny, that in the first exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the morning, made by the Bishop of <hi>Abirdene,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was giuen to all that were present, both to sanctifie themselues, &amp; by prayer to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the successe of the affairs vnto God his blessing. The same was repeated in the second
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9002:25"/>
exercise made by the Archbishop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> and nothing omitted on our parts, that was required to bring men to a due regard thereof. But the Libeller excepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second Sermon. First, that although the Text was pertinent, the Preacher ranne quickly from it: Next that in his Discourse of Ceremonies, &amp; the fiue Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, his best Arguments were testimonies cited out of <hi>Caluine, Martyr</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> all peruerted. How the first can bee made good, I see not, seeing if the Text was pertinent, as he confessed, to the time and matters there to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, it is as cleere, that in all his Discourse, hee did so strictly keep himself to the purpose, as there was not so much as one digression made from it. And whether hee brought no Arguments for proofe, or peruerted the testimonies of these learned men: Let the Reader iudge, by the Sermon it selfe, which wee haue made here to bee inserted word for word, as the same was then deliuered.</p>

Of the indifferency of these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, I thinke there is little or no question amongst vs: The conueniencie of them for our Church is doubted of by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but not without cause; They are new and vncouth, such things as we haue not beene accustomed with; and nouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Church, euen in the smallest things are dangerous, <hi>Etiam quae vtilitate adiuuant, nouitate perturbant.</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9002:26"/>
yeelding, or disobeying him, whom for my selfe, I hold it Religion, to offend; I must tell you, that the euill of noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, especially in matters of Rite &amp; Ceremonie, is nothing so great as the euill of disobedience. That which is new this day, with a little vse, will become familiar and old: yee know the prouerbe, A wonder lasts but nine nights in a Towne. But how farre disobedience may goe, what euills it may produce, God knowes. As the Apostle speakes here of Contention, so I say of Disobedience, we haue no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, nor the Churches of God. We leaue that to Papists and Anabaptists, that carry no regard to authoritie: Our Religion teaches vs to obey our Superiours, in all things, that are not contrarie to the Word of God. So our Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion speakes, which is printed in the beginning of your Psalme bookes, So haue wee taught the people in former times,<note place="margin">Psal. Booke, <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> and God forbid, wee should now come in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
            <p>Our case, as I thinke, at this time, is not farre different from that of the Corinthians, at the writing of this Epistle: The question was amongst them, of the behauiour of men, and women in holy Assemblies. What was most decent and beseeming, men to be vncouered, women to haue their heads couered, or by the contrarie. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after that hee had shewed his owne minde in the matter, and giuen some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for it, as hee doth in the Verses preceding, concludes now with this protestation: <hi>If any man seeme to bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, wee haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> As though hee would say, I haue said so much as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent calme and moderate spirits; as for contentious men, I trouble not my selfe with them; They will still be disputing, and say what yee will, they shall still finde a reply, for they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, louers of Victorie, not of Veritie; men that seeketh not the Churches weale, but their owne wills, and make it their credit to bee alwayes stirring: that is not my custome, saith the Apostle (he might speake it well, for hee neuer cared for himselfe, or how he was counted of, so as he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9002:26"/>
might be profitable to the Church, and an instrument of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing soules.) And as it is not my custome, no more is it the custome of the Churches of God; for they fauour not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but follow the things which concerne peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one may edifie, and make better another.</p>
            <p>Some of the Interpreters refer these words to the question in hand, and thinke that the Apostle is here opposing the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Churches, to these that contended for men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering their heads in publike meetings: but the better sort take this to bee spoken against the studie of contention, and thinke the Apostle his meaning here, is onely to shew, that it is not his fashion, nor the fashion of the Churches of God, to bee contentious for matters of such indifferency as those were of. This is <hi>Caluines</hi> interpretation amongst others, for he writing vpon this place, after he had said, that contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Church, is of all euills the most pernicious, addes by way of admonition these words: <hi>Diligenter notemus locum istum, ne abripi nos super vacuis disputationibus sinamus:</hi> Let vs carefully obserue this place, saith hee, that wee suffer not our selues to bee carryed away with vnnecessary disputings. Now, these are vnnecessary disputings, which are made, <hi>De rebus non magnis,</hi> of matters of light moment, <hi>Vel de rebus non ambiguis,</hi> that is, of matters in themselues cleare and euident. <hi>Atqui tales sunt importuni quidam disputatores, qui artis esse putant, omnia in dubium vocare:</hi> Some there are that can finde probabilities against the clearest Truth, and are still disputing about the lightest matters: Such are very troublers, and dangerous heads in a Church, of whom wee should be wary.</p>
            <p>Brethren, to contend is not a fault, if so it bee, for a weightie matter; but to bee contentious in a light busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, this is faultie, and reprooued here by the Apostle. Wee ought to contend alwayes for the Faith, and that earnestly, as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</note> not yeelding to the Aduersarie, in the substance of Religion, one jot: There should our courage and spirituall zeale kindle it selfe;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9002:27"/>
but for matters of circumstance and ceremonie, to make businesse, and as much adoe, as if some mayne point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were questioned, it is to iniurie the Truth of God. By this meanes, men are brought to misse-regard all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and wee that are the Preachers of the Word, come to bee despised.</p>
            <p>In the meane time it is not to be denyed, but they are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which for the inconuenience they bring, ought to be resisted; and if wee bee pressed with such, it is our part to expone our dislike of them in modestie, and by the best, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest meanes we can vse, to decline these which wee esteeme to bee hurtfull: Not (as our follies haue beene great in this kinde) to runne before the time, and seeke to amend mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by declinators and protestations, whereby wee haue profited nothing; onely wee haue incensed authoritie, and hastened vpon our selues the same things which wee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eschue. Well, these things cannot bee made vndone, yet, they should make vs wise for afterwards. And now, Brethren, because the resolution we take at this time touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Articles propounded, will giue to the world a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie what manner of men wee are, whether such as rule their proceedings by iudgement, or are carried head-strong with conceits and opinions; that wee bee nor misse-led by ignorance (for that is the fault of many amongst vs, wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not of matters, nor take paynes to vnderstand what hath beene the iudgement of the most wise and learned, but follow vpon trust, the opinions we haue beene bred with, and of such as we affect) to helpe this, I say, I will, with your patience, spend some time in the question of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, see what warrant they haue, and how they should bee appointed: then from the generall descend to speake of our particulars, touching which I shall freely deliuer my owne minde, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>First, then concerning Ceremonies, howsoeuer some haue imagined them to bee superfluities, which might well bee spared, and that the Church of Rome hath made the very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9002:27"/>
name of them hatefull, aswell because of the multitude of them, wherewith she oppressed Christians, as for the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous choice she made of most of them: are such things, as without which no publike action either Ciuill, or Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique can be rightly performed.</p>
            <p>To this purpose a Politike Writer, hath said well, That as the flesh couereth the hollow deformity of the bones, and beautifieth the bodie with naturall graces, so Ceremonies (such specially, as ancient custome hath made reuerend) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the nakednesse of publike actions, and distinguish them from priuate businesse, that otherwise should not bee so well knowne. The neglect of this in any State, breedes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and with confusion the ruine, and abolishment of the State it selfe; whereof the examples were easie to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Romane Republike, and others, if that were our subiect. But wee are speaking of Church-Ceremonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which no man will deny this generall truth: That in euery publike dutie, which God craues at our hands, there is besides the matter and forme wherein the substance of the dutie consists, a certaine externall forme required, to the decent administration of the same. As for example: God hath commanded his Word to bee preached, and the holy Sacraments to be ministred, Baptisme by the Element of Water, and in a prescript forme of words, such as you know wee vse; and the Sacrament of his blessed Body and Bloud, in the Elements of Bread and Wine, with certaine mysticall words added thereunto: heere is the dutie to bee done, and the substance of it; yet for the ministration of the same in a due and decent manner, there is place, time, and other circumstances moe required. The substance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God hath giuen vs in the Word, from which we may not goe; but for these things that belong to the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, Ecclesiasticall wisedome hath to define what is conuenient, what not; <hi>Ne<expan>

               </gap>, by order; that is, appointed, with deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by such as haue the authoritie to ordaine them; and being once appointed, and concluded by Constitutions, they must bee kept and performed by all that are subiect to the same.</p>
            <p>This, as one speakes well, is that great Ecclesiasticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, by which all other Canons must bee squared; this is the true Touch-stone of trying Ceremonies, and the ballance wherein all Church Orders must be weighed. The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church must be decent and comely, without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, without all meretricious brauerie, not superfluous, but seruing to edification. They must also be done to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not be idolatrous or superstitious; Generally in the Church, all things must be done in order, and no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be either of persons or proceedings, for order hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Throne of the Almightie. This fabricke of the World that wee see, is vpholden by it, States, and Kingdomes are maintayned by it, and without it nothing can flourish or prosper. And if Order should haue place in all things, sure the Church of God, should not be without Order; for our God, whom wee serue, is the God of Order, and not of Confusion, as the Apostle speakes.</p>
            <p>These things will be easily condescended vpon, I meane, that religious duties cannot bee performed without exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Rites: that these Rites should bee qualited, as I haue said, established by Lawes, and after they are established, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by such as are subiect; <hi>Si enim velut in medio positae, singulorum arbitrio relictae fuerint, quoniam nunquam futurum est, vt omnibus idem placeat, breui futura est rerum omnium
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9002:28"/>
confusio.</hi> This is <hi>Caluines</hi> saying in the fourth Booke of his Institutions, and tenth Chapter, which Chapter I would ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly recommend to your reading, for these matters chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In such generals, it may bee wee all agree; but when wee come to particulars; <hi>Tanta moribus hominum inest diuersitas, tanta in animis varietas, tanta in iudicijs, ingenijs<expan>

For the Ceremonie, which to one will seeme decent and comely, will to another appeare not to be so. Now in this case what is to bee done? Some would haue vs search into the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like times, examine what then was in vse to bee done, and follow that. But this cannot well be the rule, seeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles haue not deliuered in writing all that they did; and diuers of the formes vsed by them, which by occasion wee haue recorded, are vnfit for these times, and inconuenient: such as the assembling of people in close and secret mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, their Christnings in Riuers, the ministring of the Lords Supper after meate, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Church-Feasts, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of leuened Bread, abstayning from Bloud, and that which is strangled, the arbitrary maintenance of Ministers, and other more particulars; which to bring againe in vse, were to alter and change in a sort the state of Christianitie it selfe. So it being to vs vncertaine, what the formes of the Apostles were in euery thing; and the dissimilitude of their times and ours being so great, they giue no sure direction that send vs to seeke the resolution of our differences in matters of this nature from them. Reade <hi>Beza</hi> his eight E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle written to that Reuerend Bishop <hi>Edmond Grindall,</hi> then Bishop of London, and you shall finde this to bee his iudgement: His words are, <hi>Scio duplicem esse de Ecclesiarum instauratione opinionem: sunt qui Apostolicae ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his answere and discourse is somewhat long, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to the place, and giue you the heads of it only; first, therefore he sayes, that the doctrine of the Apostles, is in it selfe so exact and perfect, as we ought not to derogate, nor adde any thing vnto it: but next for the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church, wee must not thinke so, because the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles at the first, could not set downe euery thing that was expedient for the Church, and thereupon they proceeded by little and little; and in such Rites as they instituted, they had a speciall respect to the time, places and persons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many were afterwards by the Church worthily aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.

And certainly, there is no other way to keepe away differences for matters of Rites and Ceremonies, but this, That euery man keepe the custome of the Church wherein
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9002:29"/>
he liues, and obserue that which is determined by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours thereof. For in things indifferent wee must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes esteeme that to bee best, and most seemely, which seemes so in the eye of publike authoritie. Neither is it for priuate men to controll publike iudgement: as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make publike Constitutions, so they may not controll nor disobey them being once made. Indeed authoritie ought to looke carefully vnto this, that it prescribe nothing but rightly; appoint no Rites nor Orders in the Church, but such as may set forward Godlinesse and Pietie: yet put the case, that some be otherwise established, they must be obeyed by such as are members of that Church, as long as they haue the force of a Constitution, and are not corrected by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that made them. Except this be, there can bee no order, and all must be filled with strife and contention. But thou wilt say, My conscience suffers mee not to obey, for I am perswaded, that such things are not right, nor well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. I answere thee, in matters of this nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the sentence of thy Superiours ought to direct thee, and that is a sufficient ground to thy conscience for obeying. But may not Superiours erre? May not Councels decree that which is wrong? This no man denyes, and if they decree any thing against Scripture, it is not to be obeyed; for there that Sentence holds good, <hi>Melius obedire Deo quam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</hi> But if that which is decreed, be not repugnant to the Word, and that thou hast no more but thy owne collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions of thy conscience, as thou callest it, how strong soeuer thy perswasions bee, it is presumption in thee to disobey the Ordinance of the Church. And of this wee may bee sure, whosoeuer denyes obedience to Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances <hi>in rebus medijs,</hi> the same will not sticke to reiect Gods owne Word, when it crosses his fancie; <hi>Et videant isti,</hi> (sayes <hi>Caluine) qui plus sapere volunt quam oportet, qua ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne morositatem suam Domino opprobent, Nobis enim satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere istud Pauli d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now hauing shewed you, that Rites are necessary in a Church, the qualities they should haue, and obedience that must bee giuen vnto the Constitutions of the Church once being made, I come to the particulars desired of vs to bee receiued: these must bee seuerally considered, because they are not all of the like respect: some of them strike vpon the duties of our calling, enioyning the practice thereof in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at times where vsuall solemnitie cannot bee kept; as to administrate Baptisme in priuate houses in the case of necessitie, and the Communion to these that are sicke, and in dying: Others of them prescribe the obseruation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne things not in vse with vs, as the confirming of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the keeping of some Festiuities throughout the yeere. And there is a fift Article that requires our accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner of sitting at the Communion, to be changed in a more religious and reuerend gesture of kneeling: ye shall not expect to heare all that may be said, or is at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient concerning these, neither the time, nor the strength of any one man, I think, will suffice to say all without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. I know I speake to men of vnderstanding, and my intent is to say no more of them, then may serue to iustifie the aduise which I minde with Gods helpe to giue vnto you.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Communion to the Sicke, because this Article passed in the late Assembly, with some limitations which his Maiesty disliked. The mind that is offended hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interprets any thing well, so fared it in this matter. The delay of our answere to the rest of the Articles, mooued his Maiestie to call our grant of this Article scornfull and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. I was bold in a priuate Letter to shew there was a mistaking, and iustifie that which was done; neither should I speake any more of it, but that it hath beene complayned, that some of our Ministerie, beeing earnestly entreated by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9002:30"/>
certaine sicke persons, for the comfort of that Sacrament, since that time haue denyed the same. To iustifie therefore that which then was inacted, I say shortly, that by our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wee are directly bound to minister vnto men in the last houre all the helpes and comforts wee possibly can: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall terrours of death, and fearefull doubts of conscience which at that time commonly perplexe men, require this at our hands; therefore Visitation of the sicke is earnestly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Ministers in their admission, that they bee readie to attend the sicke person, and as his estate craues, minister comfort vnto him, by preaching the promises of grace and mercie to all penitent sinners. Why this Sacrament, that is the seale of Gods promises, and a speciall meane of binding vp our Communion with Christ, should bee denyed to such as desire the same in that time, there can be no reason.</p>
            <p>Howbeit saluation depends not vpon the Sacrament, and that they vse it superstitiously that giues it for a <hi>viaticum</hi> to the dying, the end of a man cannot but be the more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his death accompanyed with the greater content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tranquilitie of minde, when his desire is satisfied in this point. For this is to bee considered, that it is not to all that die, nor to all that are sicke, but to such onely whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery is desperate, and vrgently desire the comfort of this Sacrament, that the same is appointed to bee ministred. Of which purpose <hi>Caluin</hi> deliuers his opinion in his 52. Epistle, in these words: <hi>De Coenae administratione censeo, libenter admittendum esse hunc morem, vt apud aegrotos celebretur com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio, quum ita res &amp; opportunitas feret; Nec magnopere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnandum esse, quin maleficis detur, qui plectendi sunt, si qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem postulent, &amp; ad receptionem satis comparatos esse appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat: hac tamen lege, vt sit vnà communio, hoc est, vt panis in coetu aliquo fidelium frangatur.</hi> And in his 361. Epistle, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering some one that had moued him in this matter, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes on this manner: <hi>Cur coenam aegrotis negandam esse non arbitror, multae &amp; graues causae me impellunt,</hi> as you may see in the place. <hi>Bucer, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Zepperus</hi> are of the same
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9002:31"/>
iudgement; and the last of these three, putting the case, that none is by this sicke man disposed to communicate, sayes, <hi>Quod ne sic quidem priuandus est communione aegrotus.</hi> You may see his reasons in the twelft Chapter of his first Booke, <hi>De Politia Ecclesiastica.</hi> Our owne Church hath practised the same in former times, as was qualified in diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars at the last Assembly. So where the reformed Churches haue approued it, and wee our selues by our owne practice, now to stand against it, when, by a speciall Canon it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee done, cannot but bee thought obstinate diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>I come to the Article of Baptisme: This craues that in the case of necessitie, when a child without hazard may not bee brought out of doores, it bee lawfull to the Minister to baptise in a priuate house. It was not long since, a custome amongst vs, that no Minister would baptise, except vpon the ordinarie day of teaching; this same being complayned of in the Assembly that was kept at Holy Rood-house, in the yeare 1602. an Ordinance was made, that whensoeuer a Parent should require baptisme to his child, the Minister should not deny it, without delaying to the ordinarie day of preaching. The question was then of the Time, now it is of the Place: Whereabout, this you all know, that in the institution of Baptisme, the Lord Iesus hath not tyed vs to any place, but his command binds all men to bee baptized: And wee, that are Ministers, by our calling are obliged to baptise, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee doe not thinke Baptisme absolutely necessary vnto saluation, and the child that wants it vpon a necessitie ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable, nothing preiudiced that way; yet if the occasion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, there is no doubt, but the Minister hath a necessitie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon him to baptize, although time, place, and other circumstances required for the due and solemne administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not concurring. But this, yee will say, fosters the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish opinion of the necessitie of Baptisme. Let <hi>Buce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> answer it, To with-hold Baptisme for want of the due solemnities, sayes hee, opens a doore to the Deuill, to bring in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9002:31"/>
of Christs Ordinance, and our whole redemption by him: We haue a Commandement to baptize, and this to vs is a necessary duety which we may not leaue vndone: As for inconueniences, we must meet them as wisely, as we may, by doctrine and diligent catechizing, but in no sort neglect the Commandement that is giuen. Yee shall haue <hi>Caluin</hi> his iudgement also in this matter; being asked: <hi>Vbinam baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus recte administrari possit?</hi> He answers, <hi>Fas non est admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strare baptismum, nisi in coetu fidelium, non quidem v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> templum requiratur, sed vt vbiuis, numerus aliquis fidelium conueniat, qui Ecclesiae corpus efficiat.</hi> Yee haue this in his 185. Epistle. And thus much for Baptisme.</p>
            <p>The third Article is of Confirmation, to be giuen to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are come to the yeares of discretion, and that is one of the most ancient customes of the Christian Church, from the dayes of the Apostles it hath continued, and with them it began. Neither is there any thing more profitable, for it helps children to bee seasoned with the principles of true Religion, layes a good foundation for the better direction of their whole life, preserues the seede of the Church sound, makes children more diligent to learne, and Pastors, and Parents more carefull to instruct them. The neglect of this dutie hath done much harme in the Church, and the restitution of that good custome, which <hi>Caluin</hi> in the fourth Booke of his Institutions earnestly wishes, could not but bring with it an exceeding great benefit. It was in substance agreed vnto in the Assembly at Abirdene; but two things his Maiestie found deficient in the Act: One that there was no mention of laying on of hands vpon the child confirmed: Another was, that the performance of it was not restricted to the Bishops care. And for this last, it is cleare by all Antiquitie, that the power of Confirming appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euer to Bishops; Not, that Confirmation is a Sacrament of greater dignitie then Baptisme, as the Papists teach (these were the thoughts of ignorance:) but as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes, The Church thought fit, that seeing Baptisme is giuen by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9002:32"/>
Presbyters, lest children should be ignorant of the spirituall superioritie of Bishops ouer them, they should attend the receiuing of Confirmation by their hands; so, this was done for the honour of Prelacy, as he speakes. Now, if any man will enuy this honour to Bishops, it is a silly and poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy: for it encreases their charge and burthen; and if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their dutie make them not carefull of it, in this profane and irreligious age, the honor or credit it can bring them, will neuer worke it: Touching imposition of hands, let Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tell vs what it meanes: Hee in his fift Booke, <hi>De Baptismo contra Donatistas, cap.</hi> 23. sayes, <hi>Quid est manuum impositio, nisi oratio super hominem?</hi> that is to say, What is imposition of hands, but a prayer vpon the man, that hands are laid vpon? In all personall benedictions, from the very beginning of the world, it hath beene vsed: Parents doe yet confer their blessing in this manner to their children, and when spirituall blessings are giuen, there can bee no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to doe it with the like ceremonie. But I heare that some cannot abide to heare the word of <hi>Confirmation</hi>; the thing it selfe gladly they admit, but they would haue exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or some the like word put for it: Not onely the abuse, but the very name of the thing abused, (so tender are the hearts of some men) must be put away. For this shortly, I say, that the Scriptures neuer taught vs to place Religion in wordes. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> made no scruple, speaking of a street in Athens, to call it the street of <hi>Mars:</hi> And the ship that <hi>Paul</hi> sayled in, he names by <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> though both these were the Idols of Pagans. If names were to be stood vpon, we should put our selues to great businesse, &amp; it behoueth to change the names of our Moneths, and Dayes, which some haue pressed vnto, but wise men know this to be folly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the word of <hi>Confirmation</hi> was vsed in the Church long before Popery was hatched, as is manifest by Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine, Tertullian, Eusebius,</hi> and others. And thus much of Confirmation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:9002:32"/>The <hi>Festiuities,</hi> which are the next, are impugned by this Argument amongst others, That hereby wee conforme our selues to Papists in the keeping of holy dayes: But had this Argument beene of any force, would the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue agreed so vniformely in the obseruation of them? All of them, so farre as I know, keepe holy the dayes of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, with the Descent of the holy Ghost. The Churches of Bohemie, Vngarie, Polonia, Denmarke, Saxonie, and high Germany: The Heluetian Churches, the Belgique, and those of the low Countreyes; The French, English, and Geneua it selfe, in the beginning of reformation, obserued them all.

            <p>Of the last Article, which requires kneeling, as the most reuerend gesture in partaking the holy Sacrament of the Communion, I haue neede to say much, seeing great stirres are made for this, and as I esteeme without any cause. The Apostle when he professes to deliuer vnto vs that which hee receyued of the Lord, speakes not, either of sitting, or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or standing; by which it is euident, That <hi>situs, vel positus corporis in coena,</hi> as <hi>Zepperus</hi> speakes, is not of the essence of the Sacrament, but to be numbered amongst these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which the Church may alter, and change at their pleasure.

Wee haue learned otherwayes to honour the Sonne, as wee honour the Father, and he that honours not the Sonne so in euery place, especially in the participation of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, should be to vs as a Iew or Pagan. I shall insist no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this purpose: It is an excellent passage that of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon the 98. Psalme, <hi>Nemo carnem illam mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, nisi prius adorauerit:</hi> That is, No man can eate that flesh vnlesse first he haue adored.

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:9002:34"/>Thus I haue shewed you the iudgement of the best Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches touching these Articles: Thereby you haue seene that there is nothing impious or vnlawfull in them: they who shew a dislike of some of them in the last Assembly, could not say other. And surely, if it cannot bee shewed, that they are repugnant to the written Word, I see not with what conscience wee can refuse them, being vrged as they are, by our Souereigne Lord and King: A King who is not a stranger to Diuinitie, but hath such acquaintance with it, as Rome neuer found in the confessions of all men a more potent Aduersary: a King neither superstitious, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable that way, but one that seekes to haue God rightly and truly worshipped by all his Subiects. His Person, were he not our Souereigne, giues them sufficient authoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recommended by him; for hee knowes the nature of things and the consequences of them, what is fit for a Church to haue, and what not, better then we doe all.</p>
            <p>But I heare some answere, That were it knowne, these things proceeded of himselfe, they would make the lesse question of them: but they are thought to come by the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of some of the English Church, or them of our selues at home. For the first, I will but remember you of his Maiesties owne Declaration in the Chappell of Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> where with a great attestation more then needed from a Prince to his Subiects, Hee declared that neither the desire he had for conforming his Churches, nor the solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any person, did set him on this worke, but his zeale for God, and a certaine knowledge that hee could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it in that great Day, if hee should neglect this dutie. His Maiesties Letter to the last Assembly beares so much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Now any of vs would take it euill, not to be beleeued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our solemne attestations: and I trust in all your confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, his Maiestie deserues some greater respect. As to that which is supposed of vs at home, my selfe chiefly, if I shall beleeue the rumours that are going, I will borrow that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table man his speech in a case not vnlike, <hi>Mihi hactenus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemodum

Neither did I heare after that time of them any thing, while that Protestation was formed to bee presented to the States of Parliament: at what time, his Maiestie taking the aduantage of their mis-behauiour, who penned the Protestation and proudly stood to the same, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to haue these Articles admitted in our Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all my care was to saue the Church her authoritie, and labour that they might be referred to an Assembly; which was obtayned vpon promise, that his Maiesty should receiue satisfaction, and the promise was not made by mee alone, but ratified by your selues, as you remember at Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes.</hi> In the Assembly that followed, howsoeuer my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice took no place, I ioyned after the dissoluing therof with my Lords the Bishops, to excuse the delay that was made at the time: but our Letter being euill accepted, and another returning full of anger and indignation, which diuerse of your selues haue seene, I trauelled at the Ministers their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest solicitation, by all the wayes I could, to diuert the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which before this time most certainly yee would haue felt. And all that hath proceeded since ye know. So as I spake before, I would, if it had beene in my power, most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9002:35"/>
haue declined the receiuing of these Articles. Not, that I did esteeme them either vnlawfull or inconuenient, for I am so farre perswaded of the contrary, as I can bee of any thing; but I foresaw the contradiction which would bee made, and the businesse we should fall into. Therefore, let no man deceiue himselfe; these things proceede from his Maiestie, and are his owne motions, not any others.</p>
            <p>I heare others say, they could agree with the Articles, but that they take them to be introductions of the rest of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ceremonies, wherewith they cannot away. To this I answer, That the ready way to haue the rest imposed, is to offend his Maiestie by our resisting; and the way to be freed of them, is to approue our selues in the obedience of these. Thereby both yee and wee shall finde a more gracious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any thing that concerneth the Church. Call to mind the eourses of former times, and tell me if our oppositions did euer gayne vs any thing? If experience will not make vs wise, what can?</p>
            <p>But this, others say, is hard to bee done: because our preaching and practice haue both beene to the contrarie, and a yeelding now cannot but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayne our credits. I will not reply, that it is no credit to be constant in euill, nor any discredit to change for the better; for this would sound harshly in the eares of many: onely I shall wish those who stand so much for their credit, to lay before themselues Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example, who became all to all, that hee might saue some. Hee had preached against Circumcision; against the keeping of the Iewish Sabbaths, their new Moones, and other Rites: he had called them yokes, burthens, impotent, and beggarly rudiments; and reproued Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Gentiles conforme to the Iewes in these things; yet after all this he circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> and practised himselfe diuers of their Ceremonies. The reason was, that he saw no other way to redeeme the libertie of his Ministerie, further the Gospell, and increase the Churches: In this hee placed his credit, and so hee did speed in that; hee stood not much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9002:36"/>
what men reported of him. If the zeale of God leade vs, and the loue of his Church, wee will not looke so much to our selues and to our owne reputation, as to the furthering of the worke of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>It will be replyed, I know, that not for themselues, but for the offence of the people, they feare to admit these things. For hauing preached against holy dayes, and the rest, and hauing defended the Constitutions of the Church, which now must be altered, there cannot but great offence ensue. I can make no other answer to this, then say, That, I trust, none of our Preachers haue stood against the keeping of dayes simply; but against the superstitious keeping of them as Papists doe, and against the lasciuiousnesse of people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning those dayes by vnlawfull exercises: Nor haue wee taught at any time, <hi>sitting</hi> to be of the essence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a Rite that may not be changed; for in that case it is necessary for the Truths sake to informe them otherwise, and make it seene that wee loue Truth more then our owne reputation. If our iudgements haue beene misse-led, and that we haue misse-led others, it is good, that we being resolued of the Truth, helpe to resolue others also. But I doe not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any such ignorance in my brethren; I know, people thinke many times wee contradict our selues, when there is nothing lesse; for they distinguish not well of things, and haue many mistakings. Alwayes, this is sure, the framing of peoples conceits lyes much in our hands. The Dayes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee obserued, haue beene kept this last yeare in the chiefe Burghes by his Maiesties command, what offenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:9002:36"/>But this, they say, takes not away the offence: for Papists will boast, that wee are drawing backe towards them, and the godly cannot but be grieued, that haue a dislike of their Ceremonies. For Papists, first, wee are not to regard them, It is their manner to make aduantage of euery thing: say or doe what wee will, they will still speake euill of the Truth. Are the Churches of England, Germany, and Bohemie in better termes with Papists, then wee? Yee know not how things goe in the world, if yee thinke so. Papists are not the fooles we take them, to be pleased with shadowes, they haue other more substantiall notes, by which they discerne their friends, then by ceremonies. As for the godly amongst vs, wee are sorry they should bee grieued, but it is their owne fault: for if the things be in themselues lawfull, what is it that should offend them? They say, these alterations can worke no good. I answer, The alteration is necessary, if it bee necessary for our Church to inioy his Maiesties fauour, and if it be necessary, it must also be profitable. <hi>Naem causa necessitatis, &amp; vtilitatis aequiparantur in iure.</hi> But if they thinke that we should regard their offence, and offence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Christians, let them know that the offence of our gracious Soueraigne is more to vs then theirs, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand moe.</p>
            <p>Yet were it not better, that his Maiestie should by his authoritie inioyne them, rather then the Church giue any consent, and when the time shall grow better, we may then returne to our old custome? for these are the motions of some. What they call better times, I know not, but our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers saw neuer so good times, nor is it to be hoped that our posteritie shall see the like. Continuance detracts from the worth of things, at least in our conceits: wee haue enioyed peace and libertie so long, that we little know how precious they are. But had we beene in the coates of our fathers, or could wee remember the straits our first Reformers stood in, and were brought vnto in the same Citie, when that good Earle <hi>Alexander</hi> came to their reliefe, wee would thinke it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9002:37"/>
no small blessing to haue our Profession countenanced by Authoritie. As to that which they desire, that his Maiestie should inioyn these things by Authoritie, I leaue it to you to iudge how dangerous the same may proue to the Church. If co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity be enioyned, be sure it wil not be in these matters only, but in others that yee hate more: But I feare it be the purpose of many to rubbe this way vpon his Maiesty the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of tyrannie: for what Christian King did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in Ecclesiasticall matters any thing without aduice of his Clergie? And to impose Lawes vpon the Church without their consent, were as much as to say, the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses things vnlawfull: for if they be lawfull, Why will wee be dissenting? Brethren, his Maiestie is styled, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and hath it by desert, aswell as by inheritance: It were a peruerse course for vs to make it seeme otherwayes. When Iesuites and Papists of all sorts, are by their infamous writings, belying his Maiestie, and traducing his Highnesse fame, onely because he opposes them for the defence of the common Faith; if wee should furnish them matter of new obloquie by our rebellion, we could neuer be excused of vile ingratitude. Rests but one obiection that I haue heard, which I will not omit: They say, the English Church hath beene seeking of old times to haue vs wonder their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and vpon this, some haue called our yeelding vnto a conformitie in these points with them, a betraying of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of our Church and Kingdome. This reason is so euill grounded, that though we should conforme with them in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery outward Rite, obserued not onely by them but by the whole Church of Christ, long before it was so infected with Poperie: it would not inferre the dependance of our Church vpon theirs, but that there is that harmony and conformitie amongst vs, which ought to bee amongst all the reformed Churches both in Doctrine and Discipline. And for our part in maintayning our right, yee may remember not long since, when that Noble man was absolued in England who was excommunicate by vs, wee ceassed not to complaine vntill a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9002:37"/>
new command was giuen, that hee should receiue from vs a new absolution. If matters should come thus to be contested for, which is not to bee expected, wee should not bee found neglectful either of our Church or Country. But what is this we are iealous of? We liue vnder a King, that loues the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes honour more then we all; there offers not one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, wherein his Maiestie failes to expresse his naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his country. Euen now that <hi>Mischant,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of your number, and vnworthy to be named, did vomit forth his spite and vnnatural malice against the whole Nation: And how did his Maiestie resent it? As I haue beene aduertised, he did solemnely declare, That albeit much had beene said against his Maiesties owne person, and nothing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that kinde, which the Deuill could inuent, yet all that did not so much grieue him, as that <hi>Mischants</hi> taxing of his Country and Nation: He is not worthy the name, I will not say of a Christian, but of a Scottish man, that will not, if need be, lay downe his life to meet his Maiesties affection. I know yee are ready enough to make your protestations this way, but beleeue me, he shall neuer hazard willingly his life for his Prince, who stands against his pleasure in so iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>I will say no more, for I haue wearied both you and my selfe, out of a desire to giue satisfaction to you all. How free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly I haue spoken, ye are my witnesses: with what an affection towards the Churches good, God hee knowes. Brethren, wee haue made too much businesse about these matters. The Kingdome of God consists not in them, but in righteousnesse and peace, and ioy of the holy Ghost. Away with fruitlesse and contentious disputings. Remember the worke wee are sent for, is to build the Church of God, and not to destroy it; to call men to Faith and Repentance; to stirre them vp to the works of true pietie and loue, and not to make them thinke they haue Religion enough when they haue talked against Bishops and Ceremonies. If wee shall goe about this carefully, and all of vs striue in our places, by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9002:38"/>
fruitfull preaching, honest liuing, and a wise gouerning, to approue our selues vnto the consciences of our people, wee shall shortly finde matters in a better estate then wee haue seene, and be all of vs an acceptable people to the Lord our God; which that it may bee, God for his Christs sake grant to vs all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THe Sermon ended, the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> came to the Table, at which his Maiesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Noble men, and other members of the Assembly, were sitting; and calling for the ordinarie Clerke of the Assembly, was answered, That Master <hi>Thomas Nicholson,</hi> who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serued the Church in that place, had dimitted his office in fauour of Master <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> Aduocate: This he noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Assembly, as that which hee had vnderstood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and shewed that the said Master <hi>Iames</hi> was a man suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified for the place, of good report, and one that by his aduocation and pleading might further the particular businesse of Ministers before the Session. He desired the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly to consider what was fittest to bee done, and aduise whether they would receiue the said Master <hi>Iames</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place or not: The voyces of his Maiesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Noble men, Bishops, and diuers of the Ministers being asked, they all without exception agreed to his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. And the said Master <hi>Iames</hi> being recalled (for while the voyces were asked, he was remoued) had an oath mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred vnto him, for his diligent and faithfull discharge of that seruice.</p>
            <p>The Libeller obserues here, first, That seates being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Noble men, Barons, Burgesses, and Bishops, with the Doctors; the Ministers were left to stand behinde them as if their part had onely beene to behold; Then sayes, that the choosing of Master <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> to be Clerke, was done without formall voting or lite. But to that, first, although it might bee replyed in a word, that the care of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9002:38"/>
placing seates was onely in the Magistrates hands of the Burghe, where the said Assembly was kept, and that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof, if any was, cannot be thought purposely done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet because no diligence was omitted on the part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and the seates conueniently enough placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the house could beare, wherein the said meeting was kept; wee must thinke this complaint proceeds of too much pride and sawcinesse. The man cannot abide to heare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Church, and places according to degrees; but he must haue patience. Presbyters must now content to sit and stand behind the Bishops, according to the degrees of the old Christian Councels; for the time of confusion is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Church men must learne now to liue orderly. That there was not a lite for election of the Clerke, hee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the dimission made by the former, was in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Master <hi>Iames</hi> onely; and that the Assembly had not so much adoe to choose a Clerke, as to aduise, if they would accept him, in whose fauour the dimission was made. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which point, the voyces of the most, that could bee obserued to bee present, being asked, enough was done for making good his reception in the place, specially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Commissioners to the Assembly were not then knowne, nor a roll made whereby to call them, that had voyce particularly. But this is his curiositie, who gladly would find a fault, euen where none was committed.</p>
            <p>The said Master <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> being admitted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was giuen to all that had enteresse in the said Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to giue in their commissions to him before the next sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and nomination was made of certayne for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, according to the order kept in other Assemblies; in which besides the Bishops, Noble men, Barons, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Burrowes, the most wise and learned of the Ministrie were named indifferently, without any respect had of their opinions and priuate inclinations.</p>

which the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> repressed, saying to the proponer, That he did not expect him to be a troubler of the Church, and the businesse thereof; and that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was met within the bounds of his charge, wherein so long as he serued, he trusted none would vsurpe; at which he kept silence; and streight wayes arose another, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether all the Noble men and Barons present should haue voyce, or not, and if the whole Ministers that were met there, should haue voyces also: The Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> answered, that the order obserued in former Assemblies should here be kept, and no Ministers haue voyce that lacked a commission: But as for Noble men, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons who were come thither vpon his Maiesties missiues, he trusted none there would denie them voyce, specially since in the Assembly that proceeded at Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> it was one of the reasons they made for differring the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of matters, That none of the Noble men, or Barons were then present to assist the proceedings of the Church.</p>
            <p>It was desired also, that the Articles to bee entreated, might bee extended in such forme, as his Maiestie desired them to passe, and that some might be set apart to collect the reasons that should be proponed, for, or against the Articles, that the whole As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It appeared, that their drift was to perturbe the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with such motions in the beginning, therefore the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop requiring them to keepe silence, commanded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties letter which was presented by <hi>Doctor Young</hi> Deane of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and directed to the Assembly, to be publikely read, the Tenor of which Letter wee haue thought meete here also to insert.</p>

You pleade much, Wee perceiue, to haue matters done by consent of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and tell Vs often, that, what concernes the Church in generall, should be concluded, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of the whole, neither doe Wee altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like your purpose: for the greater consent there is amongst your selues, the greater is Our contentment. But We will not haue you to thinke, that matters proponed by Vs of that nature, whereof these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are, may not without such a generall consent be enioyned by Our authoritie: This were a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of your places, and withall a disclayming of that innate power, which We haue by Our calling from God, by the which, We haue place to dispose of things externall in the Church, as We shall thinke them to be conuenient, and profitable for aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing true Religion amongst Our Subiects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it be your care by all manner of wise, and discreete perswasions to induce them to an obedient yeelding vnto these things, as in dutie both to God, and Vs, they are bound: And doe not thinke, that

We will be satisfied with refuses, or delayes, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations; and We know not what other shifts haue beene proponed; for Wee will content Our selues with nothing, but with a simple, and direct accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of these Articles in the forme by Vs sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, now a long time past; considering both the lawfulnesse, and vndeniable conueniencie of them for the better furthering of pietie and religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you. And it should haue rather becommed you, to haue begged the establishment of such things of Vs, then that We should thus neede to be put to vrge the practise of them, vpon you. These mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters indeede concerneth you of the Ecclesiasticall charge chiefly. Neyther would Wee haue called Noble-men, Barons, and others of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, to the determining of them, but that We vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, the offence of Our people hath beene so much obiected; wherein you must beare with Vs to say, That no Kingdome doth breed, or hath at this time, more louing, dutifull; and obedient Subiects, then We haue in that Our natiue Kingdome of Scotland; and so if any disposition hath appeared to the contrarie, in any of them, the same We hold to haue proceeded from amongst you. Albeit of all sorts of men, yee are they, that both of duetie were bound, and by particular benefits obliged, to haue

What, and how many abuses were offered Vs by many of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie there, before Our happie comming to this Crowne, though We can hardly quite forget, yet We little like to remember. Neither thinke We, that any Prince liuing could haue kept himselfe from falling in vtter dislike with the Profession it selfe, considering the many prouocations that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto Vs; But the loue of God, and his truth still vpheld Vs; And will by his grace so doe vnto the end of Our life: Our patience alwayes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, and forgiuing many faults of that sort, and constant maintaining of true Religion against the aduersaries (by whose hatefull practises We liue in greater perill then you all, or any one of you,) should haue produced better effects amongst you, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall resistance of our best purposes. Wee wish We be not further prouoked, and Gods truth, which you professe, of obedience vnto Principalities and Powers, bee no longer neglected, and slandered by such, as vnder the cloake of seeming holinesse, walke vnruly amongst you, shaking hands as it were, and ioyning in this their disobedience vnto Magistracie, with the vpholders of Poperie.

Of this he told them, they had examples many, not one before their eyes; and because the very night before he had receiued a Letter from Master <hi>Iohn Shairpe,</hi> who was exiled the Kingdome, for keeping that disordered Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle at <hi>Abirdene:</hi> contayning an earnest request, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with his Maiestie for libertie to returne into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with assurance he would conforme himselfe to all good orders in time comming, hee made particular mention of him, and of the Letter, giuing the young man his due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for his good behauiour, and the profit hee had made in his Studies, since the time of his Banishment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought them to be wise, and not to commit any thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of afterwards they might repent, to the disgrace both of themselues and their Ministerie.</p>
            <p>This was the effect of his first speech, which the Libeller so depraues, as hee would make you thinke, that hee lackt both iudgement to conceiue, and dexteritie to vtter that which was meete to be spoken in such an audience; but they are witnesses enow to confute his folly, and falshood in that particular. The like imputation he goes about to lay vpon Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> the Deane of Winchester, whom in one place he cals a Scottishman by birth, as if he were now degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had forgotten, or forsaken his Countrey: And in another place scornfully taxeth, for the manner of his speech

whereas his affection to this Country and Church, his care for the good of both, and reputation he hath iustly purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his worthy parts, in the Church where now hee liues, deserued better, and other acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>It is true, that by reason of the trust, and credit commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, by his Maiesty in this businesse; the Archbishop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> desired him to speake, if so hee had any thing to say for seconding the Letter, whereof he was Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, and his words receiued at that time, by one that stood by, were these that followes.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Conference, after Prayer made for a blessing to that meeting, his Maiesties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was read againe, to put them in minde that were conuened of the businesse in hand, at what time the Archbishop of Saint-<hi>ANDREWES</hi> did remember them of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings that had beene kept in these matters since his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties first Proposition of them at Saint-ANDREWES: The promises made at that time to his Maiestie for passing the said Articles: the delay made in the preceding Assembly vpon pretext of satisfying the simple and ignorant sort tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the lawfulnesse of them: Hee told them also of the offence which his Maiestie had taken at that delay: the seuere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer course that was intended against the disobedient Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: and the mitigation which was procured by the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intercession of himselfe and others: and hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought them earnestly to doe, as became wisemen; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit as he perceiued against the aduice giuen in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Synods they were come thither almost all of them, who were disposed to resist the conclusion intended, and that they supposed to carry matters by voyces without regard, what reason would craue of them, they would deceiue themselues in that case, and finde their numbers too weake, if they did not hearken, and submit themselues to reason. And in the end, shewing them the end of their sitting apart was to consider, by what meanes matters might most easily be brought vnto a point, hee said that there appeared but two wayes, one whereof was by disputing the Articles,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9002:46"/>
which was likely to consume a long time, and breed irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then any contentment else: The other was by a calme and wise consultation to consider how the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles might bee receiued in all the Churches with least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and conclude the same; specially since they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the last Assembly to resolue themselues and others, of the equitie of the points required; and which they like best, he desires them to choose.</p>
            <p>The greater part esteeming, that such as were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minded, would neuer receiue satisfaction, vnlesse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were first reasoned: and that it should bring a sore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation vpon the Assembly to conclude any thing, which had not beene first debated by arguments, vrged the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Articles, which was of the rest condescended vnto. Then it being proponed, if they would take the said Articles in order, or beginne with the most controuerted, they agreed vniformely to treate of kneeling at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the holy Sacrament in the first place, hoping that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction being giuen in that Article, the lesse scruple should be made of the rest.</p>
            <p>So according to the order, two were named to dispute that Arcicle, to wit, Doctor <hi>Henrie Philip,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Forbes</hi> for the one side; and Master <hi>William Scot,</hi> and Master <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> for the other: these two last named, after a graue protestation made, of their vnwillingnesse to be heard opposing to any matter, for the which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie seemed so earnest, excused themselues by the necessity of the Commandement, and their owne resolutions, which they held to bee well grounded, wishing that no offence might be taken at their speeches, which they should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, and say nothing, but with that reuerence which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them in so honourable an hearing. And then adding, that the contrary order had beene long time kept in this Church with great profit, and the comfort of many good Christians, if now any would preasse to abolish that which had beene in force, and draw in things not yet receiued, they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9002:46"/>
should bee holden to prooue, eyther that the things vrged were necessary and expedient for our Church: or the order hitherto kept, not meet to be retayned. And for this purpose they alleadged a passage of Master <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his Preface before the Bookes of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Policie,</hi> wherein hee craues that such as seeke the reformation of Orders Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sticall in the Church of England, should content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the Opponents part, and bee subiect to prooue these two things mentioned. It was replyed, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their case and ours, was great: for there a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men desired the Lawes publikely established to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and it was good reason that such should bee put to their confirmation of what they proponed: but heere the Prince, that by himselfe had power to reforme such things as were amisse in the outward policie, required to haue the change made. And therefore it concerned them to bring reasons, why his Maiesties Propositions ought not to bee granted. This they declined for a great while, still protesting the reuerence they beare to his Maiesties commandements; and without mentioning that which they would not oppose in <hi>Thesi,</hi> they wished this question to be reasoned: <hi>Whether kneeling, or sitting at the Communion were the fitter gesture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was answered that the question could bee no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proponed then thus; <hi>His Maiestie desires our gesture of sitting at the Communion to be changed into kneeling: Why ought not the same to be done?</hi> If it could bee shewed by the Word, or by any necessary consequent deduced out of the same, that his alteration craued, ought not to bee granted, because impious or vnlawfull, that should bee enough hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to decline the desire; which wee doubted not his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie would accept well: and if otherwayes, they could bring no argument to the contrary, a necessitie lay vpon vs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
            <p>An houre, or more was spent in such speeches, they decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning still to giue any argument, and offering themselues to answere such reasons, as any man would propone for the

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:9002:48"/>
alteration desired: whereupon the Archbishop of Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> said, that if none would reason, hee would put the Articles to voyces.</p>
            <p>Then they proponed that reasoning should bee publike, and in face of the whole Assembly: it was replyed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be in conference concluded to the preiudice of the Assembly; alwayes matters must first be brought to some point in the conference, and thereafter proponed to the whole number, who should be heard to reason of new, if he listed.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they resolued to fall into the dispute, and first Master <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> brought an Argument from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and practice of the Church of Scotland, which had beene long obserued, and ought not to bee altered, except the inconuenience of the present order were shewed, and the desired gesture qualified to bee better. It was answered, that how euer the Argument held good against the motions of priuate men, yet his Maiestie requiring the practice to be changed, matters behoued to admit a new consideration; and that because it was the Prince his Priuiledge, that had the conseruation and custodie, aswell of the Church, as of the Common-wealth, to call in question Customes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which he perceiued to breed any inconuenience in the state euen by himselfe, it could not bee denyed that in a Church Assembly, such as that was, his Maiestie might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully craue an innouation of any Church Rite, which hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed not to be conuenient for the time.</p>
            <p>From this Argument, they went to another of Christ and the Disciples sitting at the first institution, in discussing whereof, they were brought to acknowledge the gesture not to bee of the essence of the Sacrament, but alterable at the discretion of the Church. Only they held the custome formerly receiued to be the better.</p>
            <p>This was the proceeding of the first Conference, wherein because matters could not be brought to any point, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation was made to the morrow after, and they warned to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9002:48"/>
meete againe at eight of the clocke in the morning. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller affirmes the Propositions made by them touching the order of dispute, and the rest to haue beene reiected by the Moderator, adding, that he determined by himselfe; and that the fewer Reasons proponed by the Ministers, were cut off by cauilling and quarrelling at mens persons: whereas a number are witnesses, and can well remember, that they were heard with patience, to alledge what they could, and answered in that which they proponed till themselues could say no more, and that nothing was done, but according to the custome kept in such cases in all Assemblies.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wednesday the <hi>26.</hi> of August.</head>
               <p>THe Conference being met as was appointed, after inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Name of God, the Reasoners were desired to proceed where they had left the night before, and not to trifle time with speeches of small consequence; which was the effect of all the discourses the Libeller seemes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of. The reasoning continued from eight vnto eleuen of the clocke. And when the whole Reasons proponed, by the two forenamed, were in the iudgement of all men satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, others were required, and had place giuen them to propone their Arguments also, which was done in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with such modestie as could be wished.</p>
               <p>It were needlesse here to repeate the seuerall Arguments and Answers, seeing they are all in the Disputation subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at large set downe; onely where the Libeller sayes, That reasoning was cut off, and the Article of kneeling put to voyces: It is true, that norhing remayning to bee said more in that head then was proponed, the Archbishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired these of the Conference, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o giue their iudgement in the matter reasoned. They opponed, that the custome was not to vote in Conference any matter, before it were brought to the full Assembly, but it was proued otherwise by these
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9002:49"/>
who had frequented the Assemblies, both of old and in the latter times; as likewise it was told them, that these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences resembled the meeting of the Lords of Articles in Parliament, where matters are accustomed to bee prepared and put in order, before they bee proponed to the whole State. And that the voting in Conference was by way of aduice onely, and not to determine: The power whereof belonged onely to the Assembly. This being acknowledged by the whole number to bee so, they offered that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to giue their owne iudgement without preiudging the Assembly; as accordingly they did: The whole number, some ten or eleuen excepted, declaring that by the Reasons proponed, or any thing else they conceiued, they could not deny, but a change might bee made of the gesture in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the holy Sacrament, and that it seemed to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the Church to embrace the Article proponed by his Maiestie about kneeling, in regard of his desire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to haue the same forme here established.</p>
               <p>The Libeller either forgetting himselfe or misse-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (for by the whole Narration he makes, it would seeme, hee was not present himselfe) casts this in the after-noones Conference, though the same was done in the morning; but this, any man may well thinke, is but a light errour, yet it may appeare by this, how little the Narration he makes is to be regarded; for he brings in the Moderator in that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, saying to such as conuened, That the Article of kneeling was concluded by the Conference: and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after sayes, That the same was put to voyces; where it is strange, the Moderator should so forget himselfe, as to say a thing was voted, and incontinent propone the same to bee voted againe, but this we will passe. After the aduice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to bee giuen to the Assembly in this point, it was thought meet, that the Article presently reasoned, with the other Articles proponed by his Maiestie, should all of them be formed in the best and most agreeable words that could bee deuised, for remouing all offence that might bee taken at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9002:49"/>
the same, and no aduantage giuen to the Aduersaries of the Truth; and to this effect were named some graue and wise Brethren, who were desired to haue the same in readinesse at foure of the clocke in the after-noone; it being thought meet, that the full Assembly should not meet before Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day againe, at which time all might be prepared.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wednesday at after-noone.</head>
               <p>ALbeit the meeting of the full Assembly was differred to the next day, yet that after-noone, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thronging in, whether that they were not aduertised of the delay, or that they desired to bee present with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, came thither; which the Archbishop perceiuing, he tooke occasion to excuse the delay of meeting with them, declaring how farre they had proceeded, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had committed the Articles to bee formed, vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Brethren, who were at that time to present them; and therefore desired they should haue patience till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and leaue the Conference for that time by themselues, which they did.</p>
               <p>How soone they were remoued, these who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to forme the Articles, being inquired what they had done, answered, That they had formed the Article about kneeling, but had no leisure to consider of the rest; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, which they had put in forme, was well liked of, and they required to haue the rest in readinesse at the time of the Assemblies meeting the next day.</p>
               <p>The Libeller here remembers a word that escaped the Moderator, while as they resisted so importunately the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Articles in Conference, saying, That hee would commit twentie preiudices to please the King: whereas the truth is, that after many answers made to giue them satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and shew that no preiudice was either intended or done to the Assembly, when as nothing could content them,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9002:50"/>
but still they talked of preiudice, he willed them to be quiet; for rather then his Maiestie should offend with the Church, and these troubles come vpon it, which were iustly to bee feared, hee would commit twentie such preiudices as these were.</p>
               <p>The rest of that after-noone was spent in talking, as the Libeller sayes, vpon Simony, &amp;c. but in the deuising some ouerture for the restrayning of that abuse, to bee proponed to the whole Assembly, which the next day after was by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall consent allowed: As likewise, the Commission for the planting of the Church of Edinburgh, and the forming of the booke of Common Prayers, and extracting of the Canons of the Church. And thus ended this Conference.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Thursday the <hi>27.</hi> of August.</head>
               <p>THat day being an ordinary day of preaching, a Sermon was made by the reuerend Father in God <hi>William</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> against which the Libeller excepts three manner of wayes; First, saying that his Doctrine was farre contrary to that which he had taught before the Estates of Parliament Anno 1606. Secondly, that hee set at nought, the ancient order of our Church, sometime highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by himselfe, extolling the new light; and thirdly, that he presumed to teach them a new kind of Catechisme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he himselfe might be yet catechised. To all which seeing he is now at rest, this much may be truely replyed in his behalfe, That howeuer his opinion in these matters of the externall gouerment were sometimes other, his Doctrine was neuer contrarie to that, which at any time he professed, and preached: but these men haue beene so accustomed in feeding the eares of people with matters belonging to order, neglecting the substantiall points of Religion, which are, Faith and Repentance, as they dreame of no other Doctrine but that; and counts the alteration of iudgement in these
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9002:50"/>
points of outward discipline a sort of Apostasie, and falling from the truth. And where he is said to set at nought, the ancient order of our Church, it is a false and impudent lye, for neither he, nor any else, that seeme most earnest for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing these Articles, did euer contemne the orders, and rites formerly established, but while as they stood in force, reuerently practised them, and were obedient to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church made thereabout; but the circumstances of things now being changed, and these times requiring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fashions and manners, wee thinke without the despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of these, they may be well admitted, and as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably vsed, as euer the other were: For the third, of presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to teach them, by whom he might be catechized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is spoken in despight, I passe it with this answere, That his Sermons, and workes left behind him, which will continue with the posteritie, will witnesse against all their malice, that hee was inferiour to none of the Opposites in preaching, yea, in many degrees superiout to them all.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our purpose; the Assembly being not in full number, to take some conclusion in the businesse, for which they were conuened, after inuocation of the Name of God, it was declared vnto them, that by the labours of the Conference in their priuate meetings, the Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by his Maiestie, were brought and reduced into that forme, as it rested for the Assembly to consider, whether or not, the same should be receiued in our Church; and to moue them the rather to condescend, his Maiesties resolution, to haue the Articles receiued, was declared, and how no other answere could satisfie, but granting of the said Articles. They were likewise remembred of their promises made to his Maiesties selfe at Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and in the last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly, and had the lawfulnesse, and indifferencie of these matters at length of new exponed vnto them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any of their common pretexts left vnanswered, place being giuen to all, that would reason against any one of the Articles, to doe the same. And while some of them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9002:51"/>
insisted by long speeches to haue a continuation made of matters to another Assembly, and a supplication sent to his Maiestie for some longer delay, his Highnesse Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hauing vrged a present answere, they were desired to cease, and not to trifle time, with vnnecessary speeches, seeing matters should receiue decision before they went forth of doores.</p>
               <p>And so some few making shew to reason in the contrary, were permitted to speake, till they had no more to say, and had their reasons answered to the full. The Libeller sayes, the libertie was granted to a few, and that the reasons were checkt, and borne downe with authoritie; but how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this is to the truth, wee leaue it to bee answered by such as were present. And now when they haue set downe in writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that then was said, or possibly they can inuent, Let the Reader iudge, if by the answeres giuen, their obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be not sufficiently confuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctor Lindsay</hi> his answere, being posed on conscience to declare his iudgement touching kneeling at the Sacrament, is maliciously mutilated: His declaration was this, as all the Assembly can testifie, in whose presence it was giuen: On my conscience I neither know Scripture, reason, nor antiquitie that enforceth kneeling, sitting, standing, or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as necessary, but thinke them all indifferent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any of them may bee lawfully vsed, when it is found expedient. And considering nothing to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the weale of our Church, then to keepe peace with our gracious Soueraigne, and not to contend for such matters, I iudge, yeelding to his Highnesse desire, to bee the onely best.</p>
               <p>When all the reasoning was ended, his Maiesties Letter was againe read, to the end the Assembly might see his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse about the same matters. And because of a Pasquill cast in, in the Pulpit of Edinburghe the Sunday before, which was deliuered to the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> the penners whereof had warned the Ministers not to yeeld
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9002:51"/>
to the Articles, giuing them promises of satisfaction for their stipends, in case they should be taken from them, and to fight in the defence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that cause: He disswaded them to leane vnto such suggestions, or be moued with them, for that they would proue nought in the end, as the experience of the seuenteene dayes worke might teach them. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which he is not ashamed of, nor will denie, That were there no other to take imployment against these Mutiners, and seditious persons, he could wish, that he were honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therewith.</p>
               <p>These are the great blasts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errours, which the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler mentions; otherwaies they can take exception at nothing iustly that then was vtttered.</p>
               <p>As matters were then proponed, to be voted, one of that number gaue in writing some particular reasons, for disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grant of the said Articles, which they haue now writ, and imprinted in this Pamphlet; which beeing suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the Libeller speakes, to be some seditious protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Preferrer thereof was aduertised to take heede to his doing, and giue in no Libels, which hee did not set his hand vnto: This while he offered himselfe to doe, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Saint-Andrewes beeing loath to bring him that way in danger, tooke backe the said Writing, and desired the Clerk of the Assembly to reade the same: And when they were perceiued to containe no matter of moment, or any new thing, which had not beene before talked of, they were cast by, as not deseruing any consideration.</p>
               <p>Thus the question was made, Whether they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or refuse the Articles. Here the Libeller peruerts the question, and sayes it was this, <hi>Whether yee will consent to the Articles, or disobey the King?</hi> which is a question of his own deuising; And could not agree, neither with the matter, nor with the persons. It was desired by some, That the Articles might be seuerally voted, pretending that many would agree to some of them, who would not accept of all: But that no subterfuge might be left or giuen to those that gladly would
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9002:52"/>
hang betweene parties, &amp; striue to please all, it was thought meetest to vote them <hi>in Cumulo,</hi> because the denying of one, would be to his Maiestie, as the denying of all.</p>
               <p>The Archbishop of S. Andrewes taking the roll of names in his owne hand, as it was meete, he should doe, though the Libeller thinke otherwise, (for the office of the Clerke is to marke the voices, where they agree, or disagree, which he cannot easily doe, as any may may judge, if he himselfe reade the Roll; neyther is that customable in any iudicatorie consisting of so many persons, as did this Assembly) And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the names as they stood in the roll, where they were found 86. that answered <hi>affirmatiue,</hi> granting to the said Articles; and one and fortie onely that denyed, with foure non liquets. The Libeller sayes, That some were called, who wanted Commission, in which he impudently lies, their Commissions being extant in the rolls: And that others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Commission of whose Negatiue wee were assured, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be called, whereas not any of the whole, was left vnasked. Maister <hi>Iohn Murray,</hi> Minister at Dumferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, excepted, who was past by, for many reasons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe, not needfull here to be expressed.</p>
               <p>As for the order kept in calling of the Roll, it merits no answere: And where it hath been said, That the Noblemen, Barons, and Burgesses, were those that swayed the voices, the most of the Ministrie beeing against it; by the rolls yet extant it is cleare that the whole Laicks that came to this Assembly were 31. of whom two were negatiues as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller confesses, and one departed from the Assembly before the voting; which whole number being laid aside, they were ouerswayed by the voyces of the Ecclesiasticks to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eighteene at least.</p>
               <p>And this is the true Narration of all the Proceedings in the said Assembly, by which, let any man judge of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers Discourse, and how little credit is to bee giuen to the same: For things are yet fresh in the memorie of such as were present, and cannot be forgotten.</p>

it had the consent of the former generall Assembly at S. Andrews, which by a petition to his Maiestie, most humblie required to grant a new Assembly, wherein these matters might be more fully considered, referring the time, and place to his Maiesties pleasure. Thirdly, the premonition was made in due time; first, because at Easter before in the particular Diocesian Synods, aduertisement was made to the Brethren to haue their Commissioners in readinesse against the time to be designed by his Maiestie. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the time designed after the Proclamation, was sufficient to haue all the parts of the Countrie aduertised. Thirdly, the Bishops besides the said Proclamation, gaue lawfull aduertisement by their Letters to the Ministers of their Diocesse. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the occasion, and matters to be handled, were well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough knowne to all long before. For the occasion was by that petition made by the Assembly at S. Andrewes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same matters beeing handled, though not fully discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it was required, That it would please his Maiestie to accept of a delay, and to indict another Assembly; to the end, that the Brethren hauing better leisure to consider the Articles proponed, they might bee the better prepared to giue his Maiestie satisfaction.</p>

               <p>None was contemned that had enterest to bee there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause due premonition was made to all, as it is cleered by the answere to the former exception, albeit some were absent, it shewes not that they were neglected; for first, the absence might haue happened for diuers other occasions, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impeded by sicknesse, some vnwilling to trauell in that Season of the yeare, and some loath to vtter themselues in the matters questioned. Secondly, the absence of these makes not the Assembly null; for from these farre distant High-land Countreyes, as Orknay, Caithnes, Argile, and the Iles which are heere mentioned, few Commissioners were euer accustomed to come to any Assembly heretofore; and to many Assemblies none of these Countreyes come at all: yet their absence did not annull the Assemblies. But in this Assembly there were at the least the Bishops of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeses, who might suffice to answere for the whole; one only excepted, who was absent, not for lacke of aduertizement, but because of disease. Thirdly, if we looke to ancient ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels in the Primitiue Church, we shall find, that the absence of Bishops or their Commissioners, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in Countreyes farre distant from the place where the Councell was holden, did nothing derogate from the lawfulnesse thereof: as for example, in that first famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice, there were present three hundred and eighteen Bishops, yet out of all the Occidentall Countreyes, there are only named in the Catalogue sixteene Bishops, and two Presbyters Commissionaries for the Bishop of Rome; to wit, out of Spaine, one; out of Egypt, eleuen; out of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria one; out of Dalmatia one, out of Carthage one, and out of France one; so, in the first generall Councell at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, there were numbred an hundred and fiftie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, whereof only two or three are found to be out of all the Occidentall Nations: In the first Councell of Ephesus, there are numbred two hundred Bishops, and only three out of the Occident. In the Councell of Chalcedone were three
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9002:54"/>
hundred Bishops, whereof, of the Occidentall Countreyes only foure, or fiue. In the second generall Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, an hundred sixtie fiue Bishops, and of these only ten or eleuen out of the Occident. Now albeit in the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Empire there were many large Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces wherein Christian Religion was professed, yet these Councels (notwithstanding the absence of such) ceassed not to be acknowledged as generall: or if this might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a iust cause to annull a Church Assembly, what a doore should be opened to the Arrians, Macedonians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, Eutychians, to reiect the Decrees of these famous Countreyes, by the which their Heresies were condemned? Lastly, the obedience giuen by the Pastors of these Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which you alledge to haue beene neglected, testifieth their consent to the Acts, and that they haue ratified them for their owne parts.</p>

               <p>In this, as in all the rest almost of their exceptions against the Assembly, there is a false rule laid, whereby to try the lawfulnesse thereof: To wit, the Acts and Custome of the Church of Scotland vnder Presbyteriall Gouernment, which must not rule vs now, seeing the true forme of Church-gouernment now restored is much different from the estate of these times. It is true, that when the Church was gouerned by a paritie of Ministers, they choosed a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator by suffrage, though without any warrant or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eyther out of Scripture or Antiquitie, but being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereto of necessitie in regard of that forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, wherein no man had any ordinary prerogatiue aboue, or before others: but now the forme of Gouernment being altered, and each man knowing his owne roome and station, we are not tyed to obserue that custome, but ought rather to follow the Constitutions and practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, which was ruled by the same forme of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Gouernment that now is established in this Land. And it is manifest, that euer, while the Pope of Rome did tyrannically arrogate vnto himselfe and his Legats Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in all Councels, this course was obserued, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Christian Prince himselfe, when he was present, was President, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">

of the Nestorian Heresie, which was there condemned. And if we looke through the whole Ecclesiasticke History, wee shall find this euer to haue beene the order; yea, in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike Councell, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. according to the iudgement of the most learned, both old and new Writers, the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> was there President as Bishop of Ierusalem, <hi>Euseb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the twofold will in Christ: and because, hee being a Grecian himselfe, it might haue beene thought hee would fauour more the Greeke Church; therefore he purges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of partialitie, referring the whole matter to the decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councell according to the Scriptures: But here the question is, of no substantiall point of Doctrine, but of matters indifferent, not particularly determined by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but depending vpon the Prince, and Churches pleasure to haue them practised, or not. In which the Prince might by his owne authoritie impone a necessitie vpon all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to obey the same, except they could shew euident proofes out of the Scripture, that the same were absolutely vnlawfull. And in case of disobedience, hee might iustly threaten them by his authoritie. Yet all these particular ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and threatnings (which yee mention) with the wrath of Authoritie, imprisonment, exile, depriuation, &amp;c. were directed onely to such, as without reason should bee found obstinate and refractarie, who, by reason ought not onely be threatned, but punished. For if men will not regard au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but doe as their conceit (which some falsly call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) leades them: if neither the Prince his command, nor acts of Synods, can bind them to obedience; may not these threatnings, yea, ought they not to bee vsed towards them, as it hath euer beene the practice in all Councels?

who was President there, would not suffer the Synodal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the West to be read in the Councell, I will answere first to your proofe, and then to the matter it selfe. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son yee vse is captious, for yee reason from a partiall cause to a totall rejection. The Councell of Ephesus was iustly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected for diuers errours committed both in matter, and forme, yet yee choose onely one of the smallest, and applie it falsly to this Assembly. The errours in matter were, That first, it did approue hereticall doctrine, peruerting the grounds of our Faith. Next, it restored pernicious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes alreadie condemned in a Councel at Constantinople, as <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and his followers; and condemned reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for maintenance of the true doctrine, as <hi>Flautanus</hi> Archbishop of Constantinople, and others. The errours in the manner of proceeding were first, The Orthodoxe Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops beaten by the souldiers, (whom <hi>Dioscorus</hi> had brought into the Councell) <hi>fustibus, &amp; gladijs,</hi> with swordes and staues, whereby some dyed of their wounds receiued, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were bound with chaines, and others presently carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prison. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rest that remained were forced to subscribe a blanke paper, wherein <hi>Dioscorus</hi> wrote, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer pleased him; these were the causes, why this Councell was called <hi>Praedatoria Synodus.</hi> It is true, The Pope of Rome alledged some other reasons for the nullitie thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was more offended, because the same seemed dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue to his authoritie, as that the Synode was not conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by him, but by the Emperours commaund: His Legats were not admitted Moderators therein: And his Letters contayning his sentence and opinion were not publiquely read, but supprest. Yee, leauing all the rest of the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er causes, chop onely at this, as if therefore onely, this Councell was reiected: And to make this Assembly at Perth odious, compares it with that hereticall and turbulent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, betwixt the which, there is no similitude at all, no not in the poynt which yee chop at: For the Libell ye speak of, was not peremptorily reiected, but a part of it being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9002:59"/>
read, the reading was interrupted for two causes; first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contained no new thing, but that which had beene alreadie heard, and sufficiently answered to. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contained some things, which could not but giue iust offence. The like was practised in that Councell vnder <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Agatho,</hi> which yee alledged before for a patterne of orderly proceeding: In the eleuenth Session ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we find that certaine Libells of <hi>Macarius,</hi> who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himselfe to the Councell, being presented to bee read publiquely, after they had proceeded a while in reading, they reiected the rest, for that they contayned so absurd doctrine as would haue offended the eares of the hearers: And in the twelfth Session, other Libels presented by him, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and offered by the Emperour to the Synod, after a part thereof was begun to bee read, the Councell finding that they contayned no new reasons, but the same which had beene heard, and discussed before, they caused stay the reading thereof: So, in this Assembly, to reiect a Libell, foolish, and impertinent, could be no fault.</p>

               <p>If all men were alike peaceably disposed towards the weale and peace of the Church, there were no need of these meanes to draw them to their dueties; but seeing some are wickedly set, seeking nothing but disturbance, others pre-occupied

by their owne opinions; others abused, and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the craftier sort, there is need sometimes to vse ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that the vnruly may stand in awe to offend, and the deliberations taken for the good of the Church, may not be hindered. As to the reading of his Maiesties Letter, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Assembly, which the Libeller notes to haue been foure times read, and immediately before the voting of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to moue the Assembly, I would aske him, What is the fault? The Assembly was called by his Maiestie to giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the Articles proponed by himselfe: His Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Declaration of his pleasure, and therewith diuers reasons, why the Church ought to condescend to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse desires: Such as opposed them, insisted still for a new continuation, and the delay of a long time. And it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they should heare his Maiesties owne minde by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who otherwise could not consent vpon the answers twice giuen by his Highnesse Commissioners in that poynt. If the Letter should haue beene read at all the seuerall Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Assembly, there could be no fault in it, and I am sure the time had beene better spent that way, then in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many of their idle discourses. For I thinke in that short Letter, there be more good and solid stuffe, then is in all this long Libell of the Pamphleters; yet did it cost him many houres, and (as we heare) many nights and daies to find out these particulars, at which he might carpe. But I know it is not the consuming of time that troubles him: hee is sorie, That the Assembly did regard the Letter so much, and was moued any way by it, as he speakes. Now we tell him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was read to moue them to consent, and it wrought that, for which it was done: If any fault be, it is this, Their humours, and purposes, were crossed by the reading of the Letter, for we can see no more in it. Touching the terrours and threatnings breathed out by the Moderator of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, what they were, hath beene shewed in the Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the proceedings; for the marking of the names of those that should be dissenting, it is most false: They were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9002:60"/>
to speake in modestie, and abstaine from intemperate words, such as many of that sort are giuen to, when reason failes them: And if they should transgresse, warned of theit danger. But, that it was threatned to delate the names of the voters, howsoeuer they should giue their voyces, it is most vntrue. Yet is it nothing so vnusuall, as he would make it appeare, in Councels and Synods to threaten and terrifie such as are vnruly. In the first Councell of Chalcedon, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> the Emperour forbare not to threaten such as should shew themselues refractary against the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and amongst the instructions giuen to his Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Elpidius,</hi> and others, this is one, <hi>Si quem videritis contur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationi &amp; tumultui s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if such speeches may furnish any exception for the nullitie of Councels &amp; Assemblies, we shal hardly find a lawful Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel or Assembly at all. As to the Sermons, and harrangues, wherewith he said in his first exception, that the Assembly was preoccupied; I would gladly know what Church As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly hath there euer beene kept witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The practice of these famous Monarchs and Kings, who were in their times nursing Fathers of the Church, shewes that Princes are not tyed to any number of Commissioners, but as it seemes good to them, or as the businesse in hand requires, so they doe: Thus in the Councell of Chalcedon, where <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus</hi> (whom yee alleadged before for example of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable proceeding) was present and President, there sate with him other thirteene Iudges and Senators, whose names are there expressed.

               <p>This Act of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trosse Assembly, was past when these caueats were deuised to restrayne the immoderate power of Bishops in the Church, and was yeelded vnto, for satisfying the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of such as opposed to their restitution, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them quiet in the time: but the Bishops now beeing restored by the Assemblies of the Church, and by Acts of Parliament to the exercise of that lawfull power and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which euer they had in the Church, that Act nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of that nature cannot preiudice them. And that Bishops should haue their Commissions from Presbyters men inferiour to them in degree, it is so absurd, as the like hath not beene heard in any Age. But the Libeller is in a dreame, and thinkes no Act, nor any order established to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9002:65"/>
of force, that hee himselfe hath not approued. Where hee sayes, that there was neuer another Constitution of the members of the Assembly set downe by any Act of our Church, then that at Dundy, 1597. it is most false, for in Edinburgh, 1568. in <hi>Iulij,</hi> there is another Constitution, wherein the members of the Assembly are diuided in two sorts, some are appointed to bee ordinary, and perpetuall, as Superintendents, and Commissioners for visitation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; others mutable, are Commissioners of Churches, Townes, and Prouinces; The first, needeth no speciall Commission to euery Assembly, but being once admitted to the Office, were euer acknowledged thereafter as ordinary, and speciall members of the Assemblies. The second, were changed from Assembly, and behooued to produce a new Commission, before they were admitted. Yea in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly holden, <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. at Edingburgh the first of <hi>Iulij,</hi> it was ordayned, that no Minister should haue voyce in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies generall, nor leaue their Parishes to attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, vnlesse they be choosed by their Superintendents, as men knowne able to reason, and of knowledge to iudge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But for the Bishops themselues, they haue alwayes bin reputed ordinary members of the Assembly, and were euer first called in the Rolles, as is to be seene through the whole Registers.

Next, that the Bishops will not stand to this Assembly now, more then the Church did at that time. Thirdly, that some Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours came to this Assembly without Election, by vertue of the said Act, and the Prebyteries that directed them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the same vpon ignorance, and errour, which is not a lawfull consent. Fourthly, that the present Moderatours, are not of the quality of these constant Moderatours; but of a new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition set out at Glasgow, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bishops Deputies in Presbyteries. I answere to the first, that there is no trust to be giuen to you in this businesse, wherin I haue better reason to be beleeued, speaking for worthy and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, whose fame was neuer blotted: then such an one as you are, that did not feare to deny the authority of our Souereigne Prince in his owne presence, and immediately after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare it to the Brethren. Master <hi>Iames Nicolsone</hi> now with God, did moderate that Assembly at Linlythguow, a man for his Wisdome, Knowledge, and Holinesse in greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then that thy calumnies can touch him. All the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9002:66"/>
conclusions thereof were penned by himselfe, at least by his aduice; and to haue made a greater aduantage, then that conclusion could bring with it, would not haue altered a sillable in any Act, nor forged or foysted in any clause, as thou speakest. The Scribe of that Assembly was Doctour <hi>Henry Philip,</hi> yet Minister at Arbrothe, whose truth and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to speake nothing of his Learning Prudence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts, is as well knowne, as is thy perfidie and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rebellions, for which now thou liuest in Exile. And if thy sayings, or the speeches of the like of thee, might call such mens honestie in question, it should not goe well. If I seeme more bitter, in this Answere, to the Reader, then I am accustomed, let him consider, that he who neither spares dead, nor liuing, great, nor small, must bee answered some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as he deserues. Now where yee say, that the Bishops will not stand to that Assembly now, more then the Church then did, I doe not conceiue, whom ye call the Church: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye thinke a handfull of mutinous persons, such as your selfe, to be the Church: otherwise the Ministers generally in all the parts of the Countrey did consent and obey the Acts of that Assembly. And what if the conclusions taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet stands, vnrepealed by other Assemblies that haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? the Bishops doe all acknowledge and stand to. For it is the Law of the Church, that rules them in matters of outward policie, and all other peaceable Ministers: yee, and the like of you stand to no Law, but the will of your owne minds. Thirdly, where ye say, that some Moderatours were sent Commissioners by the Presbyteries vpon an ignorant conceit, that they were bound by the Act of Linlythguow so to doe, ye qualifie no part of this by any particulars, and if ye did, it would be replyed, that in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uention, that is permitted for exercise through the Land, the fittest and choysest of a number is appointed to moderate: And that whether the moderation lay vpon them, or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would haue elected them, and no others to haue bin Commissioners to that Assembly. Lastly, where ye tell vs,

scoffingly, that the present Moderators are of a new edition, to wit, the deputies of Bishops, yee must know, That your changeable Moderators, were of that new edition yee speake of; for in no age was it seene euer before this, that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently euery man was taken in his course, to rule and preside without consideration had of his gifts and qualities.

This yee perceiue, and flie to another shift, according to your custome. Yee graunt your number were fewer, for so they were by moe then another halfe: but their weight, yee say, was greater: for with them, as ye alledge, there was three great ouer-weights in the ballance. First, they had no feare. Secondly, they were not ouercome with perswasion: And the third, they adhered to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church. It is true indeed, that neither the feare of inconueniencies, and euills which might haue ensued to the great hurt of the Church, and hinderance of the Gospel, did moue them, nor could reason, whereby the change was manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both lawfull, and expedient perswade them, but to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9002:67"/>
iudgement of the Church (as ye call it) they adhered, with out regard of good or euill, without respect to right or wrong. And this is the Idoll which they still adore. Now let vs consider this iudgement whereunto they adhered. The iudgement of our Church touching cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and circumstances to bee vsed in the worshippe of God, is two-fold. There is one, that is particular: the other is generall. The particular iudgement determineth and defineth what ceremonies in particular the Reformers thought expedient to be receyued, and reiected. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall declares, what the Church, and euery Christian should esteeme, beleeue, and hold touching the particular order and policie which is set downe for the vse of ceremonies and circumstances to be obserued in the worship of God. The former iudgement is expressed in the first Booke of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and some few Acts of the generall Assemblies cited afterward by your selfe. This other we haue in the one and twentieth Article of the Confession of Faith, about the end thereof, and in the seuenth Chapter of the second Booke of Discipline; both which are afterwards cited in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Discourse, where yee professe your selfe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse the oath. And it is that iudgement whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues by their oath. In this it is declared expresly, That no order, nor policie in ceremonies can be established for all times, ages, and places, but that it is temporall, and may and should be changed, when neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie requires. This is the generall and constant iudgement of the Church, whereunto the negatiue Voters were bound, by their oath to haue adhered, which they did not. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereunto they adhered (as yee alledge) is onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and subiect to change, according to the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and occasions of times, places, and persons: For if by occasion of any of these circumstances, the obseruation, which was profitable at one time, become hurtfull at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that which serued for reformation, breedes and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, profanenesse, or superstition; it is the constant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9002:68"/>
and generall iudgement of the Church, that it should bee changed, and altered, which formerly was obserued. And to apply this to the purpose in hand: It is notoriously knowne, That sitting at the Communion, which at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was iudged most conuenient to abolish the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; bread-worship, makes the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament now to be contemned, and profaned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of Professours: That the want of diuine exercise on the fiue holy-dayes, hath almost buried in obliuion the inestimable benefits of our redemption; the superstitious obseruation of these times not the lesse continuing still in our Church: That the withholding of Baptisme from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in times of necessitie, and the holy Supper from others at the houre of their dying, hath beene the griefe of many good Christians. Lastly, that great ignorance is crept into the Church, by the neglect of the catechising of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and for lacke of a particular triall of their profiting in knowledge, at the Visitations of Churches. And vpon these, and the like considerations, who sees not, that altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in these poynts was expedient? Adde to this, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with the greater part of the reformed Churches, which is to be prefered much, to the singularitie of any priuat opinion, or custome of persons, and Churches. Then the shewing of an vnnecessarie, vndutifull, and vnchristian op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and contradiction to the most religious Prince on earth, who for the glorie of God, and the edification of his Church, did vrge this alteration. In this, if his Maiestie had beene gain-stand without right, or reason, what euils and inconueniencies might haue ensued, it is not easie to say. Ye afterwards call it a matter vncertaine, and depending vpon Gods prouidence; but wee are not to prie in these secrets, and ought to follow his reuealed will, who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to feare him, and obey the King. This obedience should euer be performed, where it may stand with the feare of God. These things haue not beene considered by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue voters: And euidently shew that their pretext of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9002:68"/>
adhering to the particular iudgement of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in such cases they ought not to haue adhered, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a faire excuse, and spacious vaile to couer their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full opposition to his Maiesties will, and the well of the Church, which in the estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery prudent and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Christian must eleuate the authoritie of all their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make the same of no weight.</p>

                  </gap>it man in the art of Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, hee heapes tenne calumnies together in one Section, whereunto in the order they are proponed, I answer; first he sayes, the affirmatiue voters had their Commissions procured by their Bishops. This is so false, as nothing can be more vntruely said: for all the Bishops in their Synods kept before that Assembly, hauing acquainted the Ministers that a supplication would be sent to his Maiestie, for libertie to conuene a generall Assembly, and exponed the necessitie of their admitting the Articles, warned them to chuse the most wise, learned, and peaceable of their number, to bee their Commissioners, if so the libertie craued were obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9002:69"/>
but left the persons to be named by themselues, in their meetings at their Exercises: vpon which aduertisement, it is true, That certaine of your factious sort employed all their meanes to procure Commission to themselues, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they knew would be of their minde; and preuayled so farre, as verie few of the Ministrie possessed with your humor were absent from the Assembly. And to manifest your falshood in this particular: It is notoriously knowne, that at S. Andrewes, one day beeing appoynted for chusing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of that Exercise, the whole number of Ministers conuened; albeit neither before that time, these tenne or twelue yeares past, nor since, diuers of them were euer seene, eyther at Exercise, or Synods. Notice whereof being giuen to the Archbishop of S. Andrewes, who was at that time in the Citie, by certaine that feared a trouble might fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them in the nomination, he comes himselfe to their meeting, and declared, how hee, and all that were present, perceiued they were come that day onely, by pluralitie of voyces, to chuse their Commissioners. And howbeit they might iustly be excluded from bearing Commission, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any voice in the choyce of them that should bee sent, who at other times vouchsafed not their presence to the Brethren, lest it should be said afterwards, that the choyce of their Commissioners were not free, he willed them to name whom they thought meetest. And his owne voyce beeing first desired, he named for two, Maister <hi>Iohn Carmichaell,</hi> and Maister <hi>Alexander Henrysone,</hi> whom hee knew to bee set both of them against the Articles, that they might haue place to reason, and giue voyce in the Assembly. So farre hee was from plotting and preparing voyces to beare forth that businesse. And as he vttered in the Assembly, at diuers times vpon occasion since, wee haue heard him solemnely protest, that he did neuer open his mouth to solicite or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any to stand for receyuing the Articles; but left euery man to his owne iudgement, to doe, and say, as hee should finde the force of reason to moue him. And yet had it beene
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9002:69"/>
so, that the Bishops had named them, and procured their Commission, there should nothing haue beene done, against the custome of the primitiue Church: for no Presbyters were euer admitted to sit in Councels, except they had been authorised by their Bishops, as we shewed before. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the space of many yeares after our reformation, while the Superinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dents ruled Church affaires, no Minister might come to the generall Assembly, except they had chosen and named him, as was qualified before out of their owne Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. This is our reply to the first.</p>
               <p>The second calumnie is, That the affirmatiue Voters were mercenarie Pensioners: If hee had set downe their names, and shewed, whose Pensioners they were, wee should haue easily shewed, that though they were Pensioners, yet they were not mercenarie men. One may safely enioy a benefice conferred vpon him by his Prince, or some noble Personage in regard of his former seruices, yet be no mercenarie. And they may be mercenaries who enioy no pension at all; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the disposition of a man wil make him iustly to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such: Neither to my knowledge was there in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly any one that had pension of his Maiestie, Maister <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> excepted, whom before yee scoffingly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a man of many pensions. But ye are not I hope so farre past shame, as to say, that hee enioyes any of his pensions, how few, or many so euer they be, vpon paction, or promise to be yeelding vnto euerie thing, that his Maiestie should be pleased to propone to the Church: yea it is knowne, that in these same matters he alone did more then ye all, to haue diuerted his Maiestie by humble aduise and perswasion from vrging them further: And tooke the boldnesse to propone his reasons in writing, against the Festiuities, and the Article of kneeling: which his Maiestie was graciously pleased to Answer by himselfe for his better satisfaction. These fiue and fortie yeares, or aboue, he hath liued a Minister in the Church of Scotland, and was his Maiesties owne Chaplaine, during the most of that time. And for his labours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9002:70"/>
trauels taken for the benefit of the Church, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued better reward, then all the pensions hee enioyes. But when this age is gone, his iust praise in despight of you all shall continue with the posteritie. If I pleased, I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the chiefe of your Sect hath a pension of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, of greater worth then all his put together, and enioyes it with preiudice of many poore Ministers; and for no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite at all, except it be merite to worke his Maiestie perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vexation, and keepe the Church with his conceits in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trouble. And I could tell you in a word, that it is more fitting to be his Maiesties pensioner, then the pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of any Burgesses wife, or Ladie in the Countrey, such as many of you are; and were not your purses filled by this meanes, we should not be troubled with your vnrulinesse. These things you must patiently heare, for they are truths, seeing yee forbeare not to lye of men more worthie, beyond all comparison, then is your selfe.</p>
               <p>Your third calumnie is, That they were Platseruers for augmentation of stipends: this is an euident vntruth. The Commission for stipends expired in the Moneth of Iuly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Assembly, and further hope of augmentation they could not haue: where yee shall suffer this to be told you, that the negatiue voters had greater benefit by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, then the affirmatiue: And that according to your manner, you gaue good attendance all that time, and many hopes of good behauiour, till your businesse was effected: Howbeit since, diuers of you haue turned your Cloakes, as wee vse to say; Albeit the benefit is not lost, for it was not to you done, or for any of you, but to the Churches, at which ye presently serue.</p>
               <p>Ye say fourthly, That they were gapers for promotion: But how doe you know that? Who made you a Iudge of your Brethren? Is this pietie to iudge of mens hearts and affections at your pleasure? None of you (forsooth) like to haue promotions, and I warrant you would flie into deserts to hide your selues, if ye knew your selues to be sought to be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9002:70"/>
placed in high roomes: but what meanes then your conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall resort in the chiefe Townes, with the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your owne cures at home? Yee professe not to loue the World, yet none followes it so much. Ye may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure domination, yet will play the Lords ouer Kings, and the consciences of euery man; and think while as ye declame against ambition, wealth, and worldly honour, that yee are not perceyued euen then, and by that meane, chiefly to hunt after these things.</p>
               <p>Ye say fiftly, That they were of suspect credite; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it well, with you, they were so: Nay, yee might say more, ye suspected they were Reprobates; for it is a thing familiar to your Sect, to pronounce of mens saluation, and condemnation, as they fancie. And yet that Booke, which they say some of you haue made vp, to note therein, the names of the holy Societie, is not the Booke of Life. The credite of that Register is not committed vnto you.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, They had subscribed, ye say; other priuate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, more dangerous then the present: I conceiue your meaning to be, of the Articles offered vnto them, that enter in the Ministrie: If yee haue not seene them, ye shall know, that these Articles bind such as enter, to the obedience of the present discipline, and of all, and whatsomeuer acts, and constitutions, that shall be lawfully made hereafter by the Church, in matters of outward policie, and order: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I will not say, the falshood, but the inconstancie of some of your number, gaue the occasion, who after they had promised to liue peaceable, and obedient to the Church, within a few dayes, hauing gotten what they sought for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more turbulent and vnquiet then any.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, They had beene threatned, you say, priuately, with deposition by their owne Diocesian Bishops. And wil ye qualifie this of any one person, wee shall grant all your informalities. But this is so vntrue, as yee neuer shall bee able to doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:9002:71"/>Eightly, They were not well informed in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for lacke, yee say, of full and free reasoning. Here ye construe other men by your selfe, and some of your side; who being asked the reason of their negatiue voyce, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That they had neuer studied the question well, yet that they followed the example of learned and godly men, with whom they had rather erre ignorantly, then follow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops with some shew of reason. And one of your negatiue Voters professed publiquely in the Assembly, That he saw no euident reason against the lawfulnesse of the Articles, yet he would refuse them, because his deceassed father did mislike them. These were the best informations that the most of your negatiues had; as to the affirmatiue Voters, when yee, or any man shall aske them, they will giue reason sufficient for their iudgement.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they were circumuented with promises, yee say, made to them by their Bishops, that they should not be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the practice, if they would only consent to make an act, to please the King. But you should haue named the Bishops that made such promises, for your saying deserues not that credit. It is true, that when some of you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the matters to be lawfull in themselues, complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only of precipitation, and that time was not giuen them to resolue, it was answered by some in priuate, That if they would ceasse from their businesse, and professe so much in publike, which in conference they acknowledged of the lawfulnesse of the Articles, time should bee granted vnto them, before the practice were vrged. But this they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not, and did to the contrary what they could; and this I hope was no circumuention of any man, nor were any of the affirmatiue voters carryed by these promises: for what they voted vnto without any scruple, they haue since that time practised. Your tenth and last calumny, that they were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with publike threatnings, hath been answered before. And now when ye desire your Reader to iudge, whether the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9002:71"/>
voices should be pondered, or numbered; I trust it hath not appeared by any of your alleadged motiues, that there is such cause; on the other side, if your negatiue voters had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled the affirmatiue in number, they might haue beene iustly reiected; first, for the open preiudice they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in preaching, and publike condemning the Articles that they knew were to be reasoned, as impious, Papistical, and Idolatrous. I know yee will oppose to this, the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice you mentioned before, committed by the affirmatiue voters in the practice of the Ceremonies before they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished. But what they did in this, was by the aduice of the chiefe Ministers in the Kingdome, without condemning the former practice of the Church, and vnder protestation, that if the Church did not find the Articles fit to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, their practice should not tye them in after-times, seeing they acknowledged the indifferencie of all these matters. Next, the chiefe reasons which your negatiue voters gaue at any time, were, the hazard of their credits amongst their flockes, and of feare to be reputed inconstant, if they should yeeld at the sudden to that, which they had so openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and what are their reasons being well sifted, but reasons of selfe-loue, and a care to maintaine your popular estimation, which is nothing so much to bee regarded, as is his Maiesties satisfaction? Therfore to end this purpose, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye regard the weight, or the number of voyces, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiues were superior in both.</p>

               <p>Other informalities may be obserued, but these are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prooue the nullity of this pretended Assembly, whereby the established estate of this Church, is so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged, or rather simple people for their facility indangered, if they vpon the pretended authority of this Assembly, shall aduenture to make defection from their former profession confirmed by so many, and well aduised Assemblies, and blessed by the experience of Gods great loue in his best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; or to violate their solemne Oath and Subscription.

The pretender may as safely professe, that hee will alter his profession, or violate his Oath and Subscription, suppose there had beene no Assembly at all. But to detayne simple people in their begunne reuolt, it will be cryed out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, that some few persons (and to make them odious, they will be called Mal-contents, Troublers of the Estate, Seditious persons, and what not? for the which contumelies and reproches account must be made one day) that they may not, nor should not iudge vpon the nullity of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. It is true by way of Iurisdiction, or Superordination as they call it, no priuate man should presume so to doe, for that iudgement belongs to another free and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Assembly; but by the iudgement of discretion, euery Christian man ought to iudge, how matters of Religion are imposed vpon him, and by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9002:73"/>

And if any will still oppose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues thereto, we doubt not to cal them troublers of the Estate, seditious Persons, Schismatickes, louers of Diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and direct Enemies to the Weale, and peace both of the Church, and Kingdome. That ye would bee called such men, ye might well prophesie, seeing ye be priuy to your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; but where ye adiect that <hi>account must be made one day of such contumelies and reproches,</hi> I would but aske you, whether yee doe thinke to passe free in the Day of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and not be brought to your answere, for calling the Seruants of Christ, mercenarie men, and thereby implying his Maiestie, your Souereigne to be another <hi>Balak</hi> in giuing the wages of iniquitie, to hirelings: for condemning all, that are obedient to the voyce of the Church in these matters, as men periured, and without all conscience, and diuers others your malicious speeches, vttered in this Pamphlet: or if you thinke it no fault to make a rent in the body of Christ, which is his Church? which it appeares euidently ye are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about; The answeres following will cleere to all men, that the estate of our Church is no way preiudged by any Act concluded in the Assembly at Perth, and that the obedience thereof, will not inferre a defection from our former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. But that distinction of two-fold iudgement serues little to this purpose: for howbeit lawfully euery man may inquire of things concluded, and for his owne information seeke out the grounds and warrants thereof, yet whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his iudgement incline hee must render himselfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Constitutions of the Church in which he liues.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9002:73"/>
And there is a great difference betweene decerning and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, though eyther yee or your Printer hath mistaken it; for it belongeth to the Iudge to decerne, and Christians, as ye say, euen in their priuate callings may discerne, but this their discerning will neuer free them from the subiection of Lawes imposed, especially in matters of this nature, for wee are now vpon order, and policie onely. And except ye could shew some euident place out of the Word, or bring a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie demonstration to warrant your contrarie iudgement, your disobedience will euer be faultie.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, we should open a doore to all confusion, neyther could there be order in a Church, if euery man should bee permitted to follow his owne conceit, and doe as his priuie iudgment did leade him. This our Church wisely foreseeing, in an Assembly kept at Edinburghe, anno 1583. 10. Octob. statuted, and ordained, That no Act concluded by a generall Assembly, should bee called in question by any particular brother, nay, not in another generall Assembly, except some iust cause might be seene for the change thereof. And if it be not lawfull to call any of the constitutions of the Church in question, much lesse to impugne by writ, and print, the same so maliciously, as you haue done. I omit the vnseeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly match which yee make of English ceremonies, and Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranisme, with Papistrie: for this is your malice against the English Church, which it becomes you to reuerence, and of whom, if ye did loue the truth of God, ye would haue spoken more honorably.</p>

                  <p>Yee are not able to produce any warrant for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme iudgement of the Church, nor Canon of Assembly, nor act of Parliament, nor confession of faith, nor publike protestation, which either condemnes the points conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at Perth, as vnlawfull to bee vsed in the worship of God; or establisheth the contrary as things necessary, that cannot be altered in no time succeeding. And as for your 59. yeares practise, it cannot change the nature of things indifferent, and make these formes and circumstances, which are of themselues alterable, become necessary and vnchangeable: yea, by the contrary, the prescription of a long time giues iust cause often of alteration, because either the things practised, which at the beginning were profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, become hurtfull, or that which was conuenient in the time preceding, becommeth inconuenient: or because the same things are abused to superstition and prophanenesse: or because an opinion is bred, by long custome, of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This I make manifest by the one and twentieth article of the Confession of our faith, confirmed in the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden by his Maiesty, <hi>anno</hi> 1567. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 15. which ye affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

deuised) are but temporall, so may and ought they to bee changed, when they rather foster superstition, then that they edifie the Church vsing the same.</hi> Likewise in the seuenth chapter of the second booke of Discipline, registred amongst the acts of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly, <hi>anno</hi> 1581. we haue two conclusions to the same purpose, set downe in these words: <hi>The finall end of all Assemblies, is first to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, without error and corruption: Next, to keepe comlinesse, and good order in the Church. For this orders cause, they may make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rules and constitutions, pertaining to the good behauiour of all the members of the Church in their vocation. Secondly, they haue power also to abrogate and abolish all statutes and ordinances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ecclesiasticall matters that are found noysome, or vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or agree not with the time, or are abused by the people.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident; that seeing the matters controuerted, are but matters of circumstance, forme, and ceremony, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shall be proued, that neither the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, nor any member thereof in particular, did, or might lawfully binde themselues by oath, subscription, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation, not to change or alter their practise and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes touching these things: for all they that subscribe the Confession of faith, and the second booke of Discipline, did sweare, that they thought these things should and might be altered when necessitie required. This answere being made to the first foure Obligations, we come to the Oath, about which yee spend many words, and before yee begin, moue the question following.</p>

Or what power may compell the alteration of iudgement,

                  <p>The former iudgement of our Church, whereunto wee did binde our selues by our oathes was, that no policie, nor order in ceremonies could be appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that the same might, and ought to bee changed vpon great causes, and weightie reasons, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by the former answere. To this iudgement of the Church, the Assembly at Perth adhered, and according thereto altered some customes, touching circumstantiall ceremonies formerly vsed in the Church, vpon good and great reasons: neither did that Assembly loose the said Oath, or dispense with it in any sort, but hath confirmed it by their owne practise. Wherefore I answere, That euery Preacher and Professor in our Church, should stand to the former iudgement thereof, whereunto he bound himselfe by his Oath, when he did sweare to the Confession of faith, and that no power can compel the alteration of iudgement, or loose the said Oath in any case. And that he who sware, <hi>That he did thinke that no policie, and order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places, but that the same may, and ought to be changed, when necessitie requires</hi>; Did neuer, nor could sweare without breach of this Oath, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie of sitting at the receiuing of the Sacrament (estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our Church, at the reformation, most conuenient, but not necessarie) could bee appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that it might not, nor ought to bee altered in any case: by the contrary all who swore to the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith, did sweare, That the policie, and order of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Sacrament was such, as could not be appointed for all ages, times, and places, and that it might, and should be changed, when it did not so much edifie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in pietie, as foster prophanenesse and superstition. And this, sitting fosters in all these that practise it, with a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious conceit and opinion, that the same was instituted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9002:87"/>
by our Sauiour as a point of diuine worship, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary practise commended to the Church, for an essential or integrant part of the Sacrament, which yee maintaine in this Pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>Now leauing this to bee considered by such as are not partially affected, but loue the truth, and hate contention: I proceed to the Oath, which yee consider first in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, takers of the same: Secondly, in the matter whereto they sweare: Thirdly, in the forme and manner, whereby they are bound: And fourthly, by the force and effect of that forme, for making sure mens particular deeds.

                  <p>The Persons, takers of the Oath, are Christians come to perfect yeares, and free persons, who did not only know in generall the doctrine and discipline, whereto they bound themselues by their oath, but in particular the points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted, as followeth: First, That in the yeare of God, 1581. it was concluded, that the Sacraments should be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely ministred, and not in priuate houses: Secondly, That in the yeare 1560, it was declared by the Church, that Christ sate with his Disciples at Table, when hee insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Supper, and that sitting at Table was the most conuenient gesture to this holy action: Thirdly, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was to be abhorred, as one of the Popes fiue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Sacraments: Fourthly, That the keeping of Holy dayes, such as the Feast of Christmas, imposed vpon the consciences of men, without warrant of Gods word, was condemned by preaching, and corrected by publique cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church.</p>

                  <head>ANS.</head>
                  <p>I will not answere you, as iustly I might, that the first booke of Discipline, whereby the most of these constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are warranted, was neuer knowne to our common Professors, nor acknowledged by our Church, to haue the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall Canons: but I say, The Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9002:87"/>
at Perth hath decreed nothing to the contrary thereof. For first, Touching the administration of the Sacraments, we fully agree to the ordinance made <hi>anno</hi> 1581, to wit, That the Sacraments should bee solemnely ministred, and not in priuate houses: The occasion of making this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was a misorder that fell out in the persons of two Ministers, namely, Master <hi>Alexander Mure,</hi> Minister at <hi>Falkland,</hi> and Master <hi>Alexander Forrester,</hi> Minister at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> as is cleare by the narratiue of the act, which is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue only to the celebration of Mariage, and the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, <hi>extra casum necessitatis,</hi> where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vrgent necessitie order may be kept. But our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether in extraordinary cases the Sacraments may be ministred extraordinarily in priuate houses, as they were in the Primitiue Church by the Apostles, and in the beginning of the reformation, by the Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell? In these and the like cases, there is no act of any As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, that determines what should bee done. Therefore put the case, our Church had sworne and subscribed that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet hath shee done nothing contrary to her oath, either by making, or obeying the acts concluded at Perth, which doe only respect the cases of necessitie.</p>
                  <p>So, whether to sit at a Table in receiuing the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was most conuenient, according as our Church estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the time of reformation, is not the question: but whether to sit at a Table be necessary, as instituted and left by our Sauiours example to be obserued, and that without breach of the institution, the same may not be altered? This question was neuer defined by any Canon of our Church: Therefore put the case, that our Church had sworne and subscribed, That to sit at the Communion was most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, according to the iudgement of our first Reformers: yet, we haue done nothing contrarie to that oath, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing sitting with kneeling, because kneeling at this time is found to be the more conuenient gesture: for that which at one time is more conuenient, may bee lesse conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9002:88"/>
at another. As to our Sauiours sitting (if so be he sate, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>am adhuc sub iudice lis est</hi>) it was not exemplary, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be followed of vs, as shall be afterwards proued; and his practise did only declare, that sitting might be lawfully vsed, not, that of necessitie it must be vsed, and cannot bee altered, when the Church findes the change expedient.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whether Confirmation, as it was abused in Popery for a Sacrament, should be re-induced, is not the question, for that is condemned in the very narratiue of the act made at Perth. But, whether the Bishop in his Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to trie the education of yong children in the grounds of Religion, as in the first booke of Discipline the Superintendent was ordained to doe, whereof yee may reade in the fift head touching the office of Superintendents. Therefore put the case our Church had sworne, and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all the heads and Constitutions of the foresaid booke, yet by the act made at <hi>Perth,</hi> shee hath not violated her oath, by appointing Bishops in their Visitations to take this triall. For they are now the Superintendents of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wee contend not, whether the obseruation of Holy dayes, as that of Christmas, should be imposed vpon the conscience, which in the explication of the first head of the foresaid booke of Discipline is condemned, as also in the first words of the act made at <hi>Perth,</hi> touching the fiue dayes: but the question is, whether the Church may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the commemoration of Christs inestimable benefits vpon the said dayes, as all the reformed Churches doe, and our Diuines hold to bee lawfull. Of this our Church neuer defined any thing. Therfore the making &amp; obseruing of the act touching this point, is not against her former oath. And to conclude, The Subscribers and Swearers vnto our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline, know no Canon nor constitution of the Church made in former times, that is contrary to the Articles concluded at <hi>Perth.</hi> Thus much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The matter whereunto they binde themselues by oath, is the Religion, Doctrine, and Discipline receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland; in respect of this matter, the Oath is partly assertorie, and partly promisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as yee say.</p>

                        </gap> the true Christian Faith and Religion pleasing God, and bringing saluation to man, which is now by the mercy of God reuealed to the world, by the preaching of the blessed Euangell, and receiued, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; defended by many &amp; sundry notable Churches &amp; Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> In these words we haue two limitations pretermitted by you: The first is, that the matter of the Oath, is the Doctrine and Discipline re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to the world by the Gospell: This limitation exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all Ecclesiasticall determinations and constitutions, which are not expresly, or by a necessary consequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written Word. The next is, That the matter of the Oath is the Doctrine and Discipline, which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, beleeued, and defended by many notable Churches and Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland. This limitation excludeth all these things, wherein the Church of Scotland hath not the consent of many notable Churches and Realmes, who with her hath receiued, beleeued, and defended the same. By these two, are all the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie excluded, and cut off from being any part of the matter, whereunto the Swearers by their oath did oblige themselues. And vnto these two, if we adde the third limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there can remaine no more any doubt, touching the matter of the Oath. This is, that the Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, whereunto they sweare, is particularly expressed in the Confession of Faith, established, and publikely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by sundry actes of Parliament. This Confession is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred in the bookes of Parliament, at the yeare 1567. and is inserted amongst the Confessions of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the booke called <hi>Syntagma Confessionum.</hi> But so it is, that in the Confession of our Faith established by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no mention made of the Articles controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: neither hath many notable Churches and Realmes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beleeued, or defended the same, neither are they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, or by necessary consequence contained in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: And therefore they cannot by any point of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9002:89"/>
or part of the Doctrine and Discipline, whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues by their assertory, and promissory Oath. By the Gospell it is not certaine, That our Sauiour and the Apostles did sit at the Supper, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had sitten, yet sitting is no more commanded to be obserued in that sacred action, then the vpper chamber where he sate, or the night season, when the Supper was celebrated, or the sex, and number of the Communicants, who were twelue men, and no women; or the qualitie of the element, which was vnleauened bread, or the order fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally after Supper. All these, howbeit they be certaine, yet none of them are esteemed exemplary; far lesse can sitting, which is vncertaine, be esteemed such. And for the rest of the points, Neither kneeling at the Communion, nor the administration of the Sacraments in priuate houses, when necessitie requires, nor the commemoration of Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable benefits, on certaine set times of the yeare, nor the triall of yong childrens education by the Bishop at his Visitation: none of these, I say, are either expresly or by necessary consequence forbidden in the Gospell, nor are hey condemned by many notable Churches and Realmes, nor abiured in the Confession of our Faith, confirmed by actes of Parliament; and so cannot be counted the matter of this Oath.</p>
                  <p>But to remooue all scruple that may arise, touching the matter of this Oath: It is true, That in the promissorie Oath, the Swearers thereof binde themselues to continue in the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Scotland, and to defend the same according to their vocation and power all the dayes of their liues, vnder the paines contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of the Lords fearefull iudgement. Heere, touching the Doctrine, praised be God, there is no controuersie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs: all the doubt concerneth Discipline, and that is remoued also, if it be taken only for that which is reuealed in the Gospell, or receiued, beleeued and defended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9002:90"/>
notable Churches and Realmes, or that which is set downe in the Confession of Faith, as is already declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But because the Discipline of the Church may be extended beyond these limits, and made to comprehend all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall constitutions and determinations of generall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, formes and ceremonies belonging to the worship of God, and the decent ordering of his house; let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this point more particularly.</p>
                  <p>If by the Discipline of the Church in the words of the Oath,<note place="margin">A considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Discipline whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues:</note> that part of Ecclesiasticall policie bee meant, which concernes the censuring of manners: in which sense it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in the order set downe before our Psalme bookes, and in the seuenth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad of the first booke of Discipline, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (of Ecclesiasticall Discipline) and in the second booke, wheresoeuer it is mentioned, and by all Ecclesiasticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters most frequently: Then it is certaine, that the fiue Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles controuerted, belong nothing to the Discipline, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Swearers binde themselues by their oath, to continue to their liues end.</p>
                  <p>But if therby be meant the whole policie of the Church, in which sense it is sometimes taken, though rarely: then first, it containes all the precepts of policie prescribed in the Word, in which precepts there is no determination concerning these articles, as before we said. Next, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the ordinances of the Church, touching formes, ceremonies, and order to be obserued in Diuine Seruice, and in the exercise of Ecclesiasticall Censures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the circumstances of time, place, and persons. In this part of Discipline, it is true, that all the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted points are contained: But as I shewed before, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the limitations of the matter of the Oath, that this part of the policie is excluded; for it is neither expressely, nor by necessary consequence contained in the Word, nor is it receiued, beleeued, and defended by many notable Churches and Realmes; nor is there any thing concerning it set downe in the Confession of Faith, confirmed by actes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9002:90"/>
of Parliament; onely this generall wee haue, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant order and policie can be set downe in ceremonies, and that constitutions made by men, may and ought to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when need requires.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in the booke of Policie that was published after the Oath, <hi>anno</hi> 1581, and subscribed by sundrie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, there is no mention made of these fiue Articles now in question. In the first booke of Discipline penned <hi>anno</hi> 1560, there are some conclusions set downe touching sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Sacrament, the abolition of Holy dayes dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Saints in Popery, and the Feast of Christmas, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon the consciences of men; as also the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptisme vpon ordinary dayes of preaching, for remouing the Papisticall opinion of absolute necessitie; and if by the discipline mentioned in the Oath, yee vnderstand the conclusions of Policie set downe in that booke, and hold that the Swearers did by their Oath oblige themselues to obey all the conclusions thereof to their liues end: then I demand what is the cause, that yee and your followers do not only refuse to obey, but improue and impugne the most principall point of policie set downe in that booke, namely the office of Bishops, whose prouision, jurisdiction, power and election, are particularly described in the first head of that booke, vnder the name of Superintendents? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the booke is rare, and not at euery mans hand, I will draw out of it onely some few things, touching the jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and power of the Superintendents, that the posterity may see what was the judgement of their Predecessors, the Reformers of Religion, touching the Office-bearers, and gouernment of the Church. And to beginne with the bounds of their jurisdiction, the same is set down with this Title:</p>

For to obey the Discipline in generall, is to obey euery thing, that the Church by the power giuen her of God appointeth to bee done, or not done, for order and policie. So, for any nouation that is made, neither hath the King, nor the Church representatiue violated their Oath, nor haue the inferiour members beene loosed and freed from their oathes, but in giuing obedience to the points of Discipline concluded by their Superiours, they made their oathes and promises good, which otherwise by their disobedience they should haue transgressed.</p>
               <p>As to the Oath which (as you say) the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> affirmeth his Maiestie twice to haue giuen, for maintaining that forme and manner of Gods worship established by the Lawes of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, you might easily haue perceiued, that he did not by the forme which he mentioneth, vnderstand these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different points of policie, wherein some little discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity there is, and cannot but be, in regard of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent estate of our Church and theirs; but by that forme, her vnderstood that same fashion and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, as is prescribed to vs in his Word, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned in the seuerall Confessions of our Faith, which is one, and the same both with them and vs. So you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue that reuerend Fathers speech, and craftily insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate his Maiestie to be guiltie of periury, in that by his Highnesse most lawfull and earnest desire, the alteration of these indifferent things hath beene wrought: but yee should know, that these are but things accessory to the essentiall forme of Gods worship, whereunto his Maiesty did sweare at his Coronation, which to this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly he hath maintained, and will by the grace of God for many yeares after, yea, euen vntill that temporall

Thirdly, Put the case, yee say, the points innouated were matters indifferent; yet seeing they were once abiured for their abuse, they may not be receiued againe, except either we could prooue, that our oath in the beginning was vnlawfull, or that our former formes are become vnlawfull, not expedient for edification of the Church, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> answere to the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the forme of worship vsed in the Church of Scotland is not altered; for still we hold that forme of worship, which is prescribed to vs in the Word, defended &amp; receiued by many notable Churches and Realmes, and particularly contained in the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Faith. As for the gesture and kneeling, and those other circumstances of times and places, where the Sacraments may be ministred in cases of extremity, there is no man, being in his right wits, that will thinke the forme of Gods worship consisteth in such things, or that they are any part thereof. Your second reply we admit, and affirme according thereto, That the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereto we sware, is not alterable, nor can it bee changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the points questioned, being of their owne nature indifferent, are excluded from the Oath, and are no part of the matter thereof.</p>
               <p>To your third reply, I answere, That wee haue not receiued any thing againe in our Church, which euer was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9002:94"/>
damned, and abiured for their abuse: for in the negatiue part of our oath, wherein Papistrie is abiured, there is no mention of kneeling, nor of the commemoration of Christs benefits vpon the fiue anniuersary dayes, nor is any of the other three Articles euer touched. It is true, that Popish dedication of dayes to other Creatures, and the obseruation of them, with an opinion of necessitie, or that they were any part of Gods worship, are abiured in that Confession, (and that also wee haue condemned in the Acte made at <hi>Perth,</hi> concerning the obseruation of these times:) but to make commemoration of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, that our Sauiour by his Birth, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension hath brought vnto vs, we neuer held it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nor did count it a matter of abuse. Therefore it is not necessary, that either our oath be proued vnlawful, or our former formes; it sufficeth, that they bee prooued lesse edificatiue, or not so expedient for the time, because they are abused by the people to superstition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse, as afterwards we will make cleare in their owne place.</p>
               <p>Where yee say, That it was confessed in the Assembly, that they were not expedient for our Church, and that the same were yeelded vnto, for holding of some exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inconueniences, a matter now denied, yee say, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting tyrannie, because you confesse, you haue this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by report; and it is the nature of all your sort to be too credulous, we passe it. In the meane time wee will not deny, that to some, they appeared very inexpedient, for diuers respects, of the which the chiefe were, the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they feared to incurre with their people, that did esteeme the condemning of the abuse of these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to haue been an absolute reiecting of them, as cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies idolatrous, which neuer was done by any prudent or wise Pastor: another respect was, because simple ones, that had not learned to make distinction betweene cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and the substance of Religion, might take

thus abused by people vnto superstition, this is one preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reason wherefore the alteration should haue beene made.</p>
               <p>As to that which they speake of the credite of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, the same ought not to be maintained, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ostering an errour in the hearts of people; namely, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters taught that which they neuer taught, or at least should not haue taught: As by example, that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the fiue Holy dayes, to the commemoration of Christs benefits, is vnlawfull. This I am assured was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuer done by any well aduised Preacher, for it had bin a condemning of the Primitiue Church, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches now in the world, Likewise, to haue taught that kneeling in the acte of receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vnlawfull, were to haue contradicted the best, and most learned Diuines we haue. <hi>Beza</hi> saith of it, <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem habet piae, ac Christianae venerationis, ac proinde olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari.</hi> That is to say, kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath a shew of holy and Christian worshippe, and therefore of old might haue been fruitfully vsed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yee see, he condemneth not simply the ceremonie, but witnesseth that there was a time, when the same did edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and profite. <hi>Caluine,</hi> before him, called it <hi>Cultum legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum,</hi> that is, a Lawfull adoration, being vsed in the action of the Supper, and directed to Christ. <hi>Petrus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> saith, <hi>Multi piè genua flectunt &amp; adorant,</hi> that is, Many in receiuing the Sacrament doe bow their knees religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and adore Christs flesh. <hi>Paraeus</hi> speaking of the same gesture, esteemes it an indifferent ceremonie. And that which so great and learned Diuines iudged to bee lawfull, what are we to condemne?</p>
               <p>Next, I answere, That the credite of the Pastours should not be maintained with the discredit of the Prince amongst his Subiects: for if they who should be patternes of reuerence and obedience to others, shall in their owne persons withstand the lawfull desires, &amp; godly intention

                  <p>IT hath been the vniforme, and constant order of this Church since the Reformation, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants should receiue the Sacramentall elements of Bread and Wine, sitting at the Table.

                  <p>After yee haue laid downe your grounds; some for sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some against kneeling: yee subioyne the tenor of the acte concluded at <hi>Perth,</hi> but most corruptly, as we haue noted in the margine; and then yee forme this argument: That which hath been established by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, by so long custome, and prescription of time, and confirmed by oathes and subscriptions, we may not lawfully alter: But so it is, that sitting at Table, in the acte of receiuing, hath beene esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by lawes, customes, long prescription of time, and confirmed by oathes and subscriptions.</p>
                  <p>A man that had heard the proposition only, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some great matter in the assumption, belonging to some article of Faith, or precept of obedience set downe in Gods Word: and all resolues in an indifferent ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of sitting at the Sacrament. But yet to make simple people beleeue, that it were some necessary or substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point of Religion, that might not be altered, ye make a great shew of lawes, customes, &amp;c, which being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, shall vanish as smoake before the winde. And where yee beginne with a strong alleageance, that it was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with so many lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall: I aske you first, by what Ciuill lawes? Yee say, (so many) yet in your deduction, whereby you affirme the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be euident, yee cite not one law, neither can yee, albeit yee are not ashamed to say (so many). For your Ecclesiasticall lawes, yee cite first, the words set downe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9002:98"/>
in the second head of the first booke of Discipline; the Table of the Lord is then rightly ministred, &amp;c. These words are not a law, for that booke of Discipline was neuer receiued, nor confirmed, either by the Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall estate; some of the Nobility subscribed it, but others, who had the chiefe authority, as Master <hi>Knox</hi> complaines in his History, reiected the same, calling it <hi>Deuout imaginations.</hi> Next, yee cite the ordinance of the generall Assembly, 1562, appointing the order of <hi>Geneua</hi> to be obserued: this Act cannot establish your sitting, for in <hi>Geneua,</hi> they stand, or passe, as they Receiue, and sit not at Table. The last Acte, which yee cite in <hi>anno</hi> 1564, ordaineth Ministers in the ministration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to vse the order set downe in the Psalme book. In that Act there is no mention of sitting, and by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der set downe in the Psalme bookes, that may be meant, which before was called, the order of <hi>Geneua.</hi> How so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, there is no particular law for sitting, no Ciuil law at all: and none Ecclesiasticall; but this onely one, which is generall.</p>
                  <p>Your second probation is, That sitting is established by so long a custome and prescription of time: Who would not, when he heares (<hi>so long</hi>) looke at least for a three or foure hundred yeares? and all this length of time yee can alledge to, is since the yeare of God 1560, not halfe an age: before which time, kneeling was in vse many hundred yeares on the Lords day, and on other dayes in the weeke, euer since the first Institution, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shall be proued, with better reasons, then any yee can bring for the necessity of sitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and prescription for kneeling, yee esteeme to be of no moment, albeit it was a gesture instituted by God: but for sitting, a gesture instituted by man; yee count eight and fifty yeares a long prescription. So men esteeme their owne Dwarfes to be Giants, <hi>Nostrum sic nanum Atlanta vocamus.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:9002:98"/>The last argument wherein yee glory most, is, that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is confirmed by oathes and subscriptions: This is a childish and false alledgeance: for there was neuer oath, nor subscription giuen in our Church, that by any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can import a confirmation of sitting, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent alterable ceremonie, for all times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Seeing no man is astricted longer vnto the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, then the Ecclesiasticall Constitution stands, which being altered by the Church that made it, their oath and subscription bindes them to obserue that, which in stead of the former, is ordained to be receiued. This is manifest by the Constitutions set downe in the seuenteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the booke of Discipline, receiued and confirmed in the generall Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the 24. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, anno</hi> 1581, the tenor whereof followes: <hi>The finall end of all Assemblies, is first to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in purity, without errour or corruption. Next to keepe comlinesse and good order in the Church: for this orders cause, they may make certaine rules and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon I conclude, That so many as haue sworne and subscribed, (after the forme contained in the Oath) to continue in the obedience of the Discipline of the Church; are all obliged by their subscriptions, now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9002:99"/>
not to sit, but to kneele at the Communion: because the Church hath found it meete, that sitting should bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with kneeling? Thus I haue answered your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, lawes, customes, subscriptions and oathes, which yee bring for sitting.</p>
                  <p>I come to consider the ordinances made, as ye alledge, against kneeling: where first yee alledge an Act made in the Assembly 1591, that an Article should bee formed, and presented vnto his Maiesty, and the Estates, for order to be taken with them, who giue or receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the Papistical manner; but by Papistical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is meante, the giuing of the Sacrament by a Masse Priest, and the receiuing the same after the order of the Romane Church: which may be cleared by an Act of the Assembly, <hi>anno</hi> 1565. <hi>Decemb.</hi>

                  <p>Next, yee say, That in the Kings Confession of Faith, &amp;c. are these words contained: <hi>We detest the ceremonies of the Romane Antichrist, added to the ministration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we detest all his rites, signes, and traditions.</hi> This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument were good, if yee did proue kneeling to be a rite or ceremony added to the Sacrament, by the Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. But we know this ceremony to be diuine, and

not Antichristian, a ceremony allowed by God to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his worship: for he hath said expresly in his Word, <hi>Vnto me all knees shall bow:</hi> and againe, <hi>In the name of Iesus euery knee shall bow.</hi> Neither will yee euer be able to proue the vse of this ceremony, in receiuing the Sacrament, to be Antichristian; or to haue been instituted by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ of Rome: for albeit <hi>Honori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore to conclude the answere of this Section, vnto the argument propounded by you, I oppone this.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Euery indifferent alterable ceremony, the innouation and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation whereof, is thought expedient by the Church, may be lawfully altered, notwithstanding of any lawes, customes, oathes, or subscriptions formerly made, for obseruation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>But sitting at the Sacrament is an indifferent alterable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the innouation and abrogation whereof, is thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient by the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sitting at the Sacrament may be lawfully altered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of any lawes, customes, oathes, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions formerly made for obseruation thereof, <hi>for a time.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Proposition is manifest by these Constitutions, which we haue cited out of the seuenteenth chapter of the booke of Discipline, confirmed in the Assembly, 1581, and subscribed by many of the Ministry. Yea, the very nature of alterable ceremonies is such, that to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of them no man is longer astricted, then they stand in their integritie without change; but if for any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9002:100"/>
corruption and abuse, or for some greater or better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, they be altered by the Church, the obligation for obseruing of them ceases, and bindes no more.</p>
                  <p>As to kneeling, which the Assembly hath ordained in stead of sitting, as yet we haue seene nothing against it, neither Law Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor custome, &amp;c.

                  <p>Your argument is, <hi>a captione â fallacia consequentis</hi>: For albeit nothing interuened betweene the eating of the Paschall Supper, and the celebration of the Sacrament, yet it followeth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Sacrament was ministred vnto them sitting. For as yee say, their eating of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schall Supper and sitting were coniunct; and that eating of the Paschall Supper ceasing at the beginning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of this Sacrament; how will it follow, that the gesture of sitting continued, and was not changed? For although nothing interuened betweene the Paschall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the Sacrament, yet the gesture might haue beene
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9002:100"/>
changed, when the action was changed. And as the one action ceased when the other began, so the gesture of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might haue ceased with the action, wherewith it was conioyned: and another gesture might haue begun, and been vsed in the celebration of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, betwixt their eating of the Paschall Supper, and the administration of the Sacrament to the Disciples, there interuened diuers actes; as first, the taking of the bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> secondly, the thankesgiuing: thirdly, the breaking: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the precept, <hi>Take yee, eate yee:</hi> fiftly, the word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the element was made the Sacrament. After this, the Sacrament was giuen by our Sauiour, and receiued by the Disciples, which yee call the ministration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto them. Now albeit it were true, that between the time they sate eating of the Paschall Supper, and the time when the Sacrament began to bee celebrated, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had interuened: yet betwixt that, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of the Sacrament to the Disciples, all these fiue acts interuened. In which time, the gesture of sitting might haue beene changed: for if they changed it not at the breaking of the bread by our Sauiour, which was the first act, yet they might haue changed it at the thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, which was the second; or at the breaking, which was the third; or at Christs pronouncing of the words, whereby the element became a Sacrament. So vpon this ground, that they were sitting, and eating, yee cannot conclude, that they receiued the Sacrament sitting; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the time of their eating of the Paschall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, so many acts interuened, wherein the gesture of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might haue beene changed, before they receiued the Sacrament. Thus it is not certaine, that they sate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament, or, as yee say, that the Sacrament was ministred vnto them sitting.

Now I assume, But the Iewes this night receiued the Paschall Supper, not sitting right vp in chaires or fourmes, as we do, but lying on beds; although that both the gestures might haue been, and were vsed by them in other nights, as is manifest by the testimonie which you cite your selfe out of SCALIGER, <hi>De emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datione temporum, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Quòd in omnibus alijs noctibus tam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus then I reason vpon the ground of your owne demonstration: The gesture of lying, vsed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Paschal Supper, according to the custom of the Iewes, might haue easily and commodiously been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, without working a miracle, by turning about his face and body to the Table, and setting of himselfe right vpon the beddes, with his feete to the ground, as our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is to sitte at table. Therefore, according to your owne principle, it was not Christs minde, that we should sitte vpright at table, as wee doe, and all the Iewes in those dayes vsed to doe at other times; but that wee should lye at table, as the Iewes did at the Supper of the Passeouer.

                  <p>To proue that the Apostolike Church sate at Table, you bring the comparison, that the Apostle makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the partaking of the Lords Table, and the table of Diuels: and the partaking of the table of Diuels, you say, was by a formall sitting at table in the house of the Idoll: for which yee alledge <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast, vpon the eight verse of the second chapter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>; but neither the Text, nor his interpretation proues the formall sitting yee speake of: for the text saith, they laid themselues downe vpon clothes by euery Altar, and not, that they sate: And the Paraphrast, as <hi>Mercerus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds him, saith, That those clothes were <hi>Parapetasma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a,</hi> that is, couerings or mattes, whereupon they laid themselues downe, and not sate, by euery Altar, and not in the Idols house. And for the place of the Apostle:
<q>Yee cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the table of Diuels, there is no materiall or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall table vnderstood, either by the one Table or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by participation, formall sitting is not meant.</q>
This is manifest by these words, <hi>Yee cannot be partakers:</hi> for certaine it is, that they might haue sitten formally at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the house of the Idoll, and eaten of their sacrifices, and might also haue sitten at the Lords Table formally, and receiued the external elements. But the Apostle saith, That these two Tables, and the participation of them are so opposed, as they could not be partakers of both. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the table of Diuels in that place we vnderstand the sacrifices offered to Diuels, and by participation, we vnderstand the eating of these sacrifices, with a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward the Idoll, where euer it was done, whether in the Idols Temple, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. or in the priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Idolaters, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.28. And by the Table of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9002:106"/>
the Lord, we vnderstand the body and blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the Sacrament, and by the partaking of the Lords Table, the spirituall eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud in the Sacrament, by a true and liuely faith. These two Tables, and partakings could not stand together. And so by the Table of the Lord, the Apostle meanes not a material table, at which the Communicants sate, but the body of Christ in the Sacrament. According to this <hi>Causabone</hi> in his Exercitations against <hi>Baronius,</hi> 16.36. citing these words, <hi>Non potestis mensae Domini participes esse,</hi> &amp;c. saith, <hi>Hîc mensa Domini, est ipsa Eucharistia, quam exemplo</hi> Pauli, <hi>Patresita saepè nominant.</hi> That is, The Table of the Lord in this place, is the Eucharist it selfe, which the Fathers often call by this name of the table, following Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example. Now where yee adde, that the people of Israel sate downe to eate and drinke at the feast of the golden Calfe: I am assured, yee thinke not, that the Israelites had a materiall table, at which they sate in that feast, so as their sitting will make nothing for the formall sitting, which yee would conclude. And for that which yee tell vs of the Loue feasts, that people sate at them, and that yee cannot thinke they rose from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receiue the Sacrament; yee must know, that your thoughts are no probation: and whatsoeuer yee thinke, it is the Apostles expresse minde, that they who discerne not the body of the Lord from that, and all other carnall feasts, are guilty of his body.
And if yee thinke these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mysteries were worthily receiued, if after the same manner, and at the same time and table, they receiued without making discretion between the one feast and the other, yee thinke not according to the truth: <q>
                        <hi>Nam hîc coena à mysterijs toto genere diuersa erat:</hi> as <hi>Causabone</hi> speakes in the same booke of his Exercitations, 16.31.</q>
Then to conclude, neither haue yee proued that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or Apostolike Church receiued the Sacrament sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting formally at a table; nor if they sate, that their sitting was exemplary: for
<q>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:9002:106"/>
                        <p>Whatsoeuer is exemplary in Christ his actions, or in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or in the Apostolike Churches, is either morall, and commanded in the Decalogue generally; or then it is some action, or circumstantiall ceremony of Religion, enioyned by precept in the Gospell.</p>
                        <p>But sitting at the Sacrament is neither morall, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Decalogue; or is it an action or circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ceremony of Religion, enioyned by precept in the Gospell.</p>
                        <p>Therefore sitting at the Sacrament is not exemplary, and left vs to be imitated, by Christ, his Apostles, or the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Churches.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although yee had demonstrated, which neither by Scripture or antiquity, yee will euer be able to doe, That Christ and his Apostles did sitte at the receiuing of the Sacrament, could it oblige vs to the like, as I cleared before?</p>

                  <p>It is obiected, that the sitting of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles was not vpright, but sitting with leaning. If wee imitate the example of Christ, wee should sitte after the same manner. Answere, It was the custome receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Iewes before, and in the dayes of Christ, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from the Romanes, or as others alledge, from the Persians, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The reply yee make to this obiection is long, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to be repeated; for the gesture being vncertain, wherewith the Apostles receiued; and sitting neyther being instituted by Christ, nor exemplary to vs; as I haue before shewed, whether they sate vpright, or with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, none of the formes is necessary to bee vsed. So all your following Discourse is idle, and to no purpose; specially where yee say, That sitting was a custome brought into the Church by Christ, whose example being seconded with the practise of the Apostles, is equiualent vnto a precept; and that it is safer for a mans conscience
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9002:107"/>
to imitate Christ and his Apostles, then to depart from them, and imitate the custome of Churches which may erre: for yee haue neither proued sitting to be an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like practise, not yet to be exemplary; and all your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons brought for that purpose, haue appeared to be of no force. Yet two things I note in this your answere: first yee say, That the Iewes did receiue their forme of sitting from the Romanes and Persians; and in this yee erre: for it is manifest, by the sixt of <hi>Amos,</hi> That before they conuersed either with Romanes or Persians, that forme of gesture was vsed amongst them. Next, when yee say, that there is little difference betweene the one fashion of sitting, and the other, that is also false: for it differeth as farre from our forme of sitting, as lying doth: as is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by these words of <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4. <hi>They lye vpon beds of Iuory, and stretch themselues vpon their couches.</hi> And by that verse of IVVENAL <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.

                  <p>Whatsoeuer yee thinke, the faithfull will beleeue, that the Apostle setting downe, as hee doth in that place, the true forme of keeping the Lords Supper, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue omitted the gesture, if the same had been a part of the Institution, and if he had receiued any thing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that from the Lord, he had without all question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the same to the Corinthians. As for your instance of a Table, if yee vnderstand thereby a materiall table, appointed for feasters to sitte at, such a table is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as shalbe cleared in the answer to the second breach:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9002:108"/>
but if by a Table yee vnderstand a commodious part, whereon the elements must bee placed, then the table must be reckoned amongst the necessary circumstances, that accompany the action: for when Christ commanded to doe this, the command did insinuate, That they must conuene in some place to doe it, that there must be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor to giue, and some persons to receiue; that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are giuen and taken, must be placed in some commodious part, on which they may bee consecrated with thankesgiuing, and blessing, where they may bee broken, and where they may be giuen and receiued: such a table is necessary, yet, what the matter, the forme, and quality of this table should be, is no where expressed in the Scripture, but as the time when, and the place where, and the particular persons to whom, and by whom the Sacrament shall bee celebrate: so the particular matter and forme of the Table is not mentioned in the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but omitted with the rest of the necessary circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and left to be determined by the Church, according to the rule of edification and decencie, and is onely insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, as a thing necessarily enioyned with the actions prescribed in the command: for when the Apostle saith, <hi>doe this,</hi> albeit he saith not, doe it at night, or in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or in a priuate or publike place, by such a person and congregation, and such a part or Table, or with such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: yet the command imports, that it should bee done at a conuenient time, in a conuenient place, by meete and qualified persons, with a conuenient gesture, and on a conuenient Table, or on somewhat in stead of a Table. Now, what should be conuenient in such things, it could not be defined; for conueniency changes, according to times, ages and nations: The specification thereof, is left to the wise iudgement of the Church, according to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>quam si moderatricem patiemur,</hi> saith CALV<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yee appeare in this place, to haue forgotten that which you affirmed in the beginning of your dispute, to wit, That nothing interuened betweene the celebration of the Sacrament, and the eating of the Paschall Supper: for now you say, That our Sauiour, no doubt, instructed them how to eate and drinke, before they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to eate and drinke, that is, in your minde, he taught them to conuene themselues, and set them downe at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but I alledge, he taught them to stand or kneele ar the receiuing, which wee know certainly to haue bin the practise of the Churches thereafter: What warrant haue you more for the one, then I haue for the other? The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists will say, that hee taught them the doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and the Sacrifice of the Masse, and all the ceremonies vsed at that action, which being after knowne to the Churches by practise, are omitted by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the Euangelists, when they wrote of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because, as yee say, they presupposed these things to bee knowne.

                  <p>The second breach of the Institution made by knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the act of receiuing, is the taking away the vse of a table. Christ and his Apostles sate at Table, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Wherefore serueth the name of a Table, if wee keepe not the proper vse, and employment of it? The Fathers call it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the sacred Table, the mysticall Table, the spirituall Table, the rationall Table. Whereto serue all these commendations, if in the meane time it be not vsed as a Table, but rather as an Altar? if it be not vsed, as Christ and his Apostles vsed it, that is, by sitting at it, to receiue the dainties set vpon the Table? <hi>And a little after</hi>; The people of God had an Altar for the Sacrifice, and a Table for a Feast. Such like the Ethnickes: so Christians haue an Altar for a Sacrifice, to wit, Christ who is Priest, Altar, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. And a Table for the Feast, after this Sacrifice once made, to wit, the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. As the Israelites, and the Ethnickes sate at the table of their feasts, so doe we at our sacred Feasts, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene an Altar and a Table, a Sacrifice and a Supper made of the thing sacrificed; a dresser or cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord may serue as well for the disposing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</p>

This yee qualifie, because Christ and his Apostles sate at Table: And because the Iewes, and the Ethnickes sate at their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9002:109"/>
feasts made of things sacrificed. And this is your first argument: Your next is, because sitting makes a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene an Altar and a Table, betweene a Supper and a Sacrifice. For answere to your first argument, I say, it is a meere caption, <hi>à fallacia consequentis</hi>: for albeit that Christ and his Apostles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks sate at their feasts, it followeth not, that the proper vse of a table is sitting. The proper vse of a table, is to hold and sustaine the meat that is set thereon: beds in these dayes were ordained for sitting, fourmes, chaires, and bonkers in our times: the taking away of sitting, takes away the vse of the beds, fourmes, and seates whereon they sate, but not the vse of the table: this still remaines, if the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be placed thereon, and consecrate in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, albeit no man sitte thereat. As to Christ and the Apostles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks, they sate at their feasts, when they did eate their sacrifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these feasts were sufficient bodily repasts; at which they spent long time in eating, drinking, and conference: For the ease of their bodies, sitting, lying, or such like a gesture was necessary; but our Sacrament, which is wholly finished, by receiuing a morsell of bread, and a very little wine, requires not a long time, nor such an easefull gesture for the body. It is vncertaine, as I shewed before, what kinde of gesture our Sauiour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles vsed; and if they sate, it was occasioned by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Supper, and no wise requisite for the Sacrament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ease of the body, the action being quickly ended; neither for conference, for there was none vsed thereat: neither for receiuing the dainties, or the elements from the table, by stretching out their hands. As to the bread, <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, that the custome was, of the Master of the feast, to breake the bread in so many peeces, as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the feasters were: and vnto euery one a peece was giuen, as great as an Oliue: or if yee reiect his authority, whom yee formerly cited in the booke of Discipline,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9002:110"/>
1560, which yee make the ground of your order, it is said, the bread was broken by our Sauiour, and deliuered to him who sate next, and that they brake, and deliuered each to his neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise that they diuided the cup amongst them, after our Sauiour had giuen the same; so they stretched not forth their hands to take the elements from the table; and their sitting at table for these ends was needlesse.</p>
                  <p>To your second argument I answere: the distinction of the Table from the Altar is not made by sitting, but by the employments proper to them. The Altar was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the sanctifying of the oblations made to God, the Table to hold and sustaine such things as are offered, and giuen to vs, according to Christs Institution. The Priest stood at the Altar when he offered, and the people when they praied: so the Communicants in the Primitiue Church stood at the Table, when they receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Lords day, and this conformity in gesture tooke not away the difference between the Altar and the Table, as no more doth kneeling, or any other gesture. But to come to the ground, whereupon yee build this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yee say, the people of God had an Altar for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and a table for the feast: So Christians haue Christ for the Altar and the Sacrifice, and a Communion Table for the Sacrament, which is their feast. This your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison hath some shew, but no solidity. There is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, I grant, betweene the Iewish Altar, and Christ, who was the Altar that did sacrifice himselfe, to be a Sacrifice for the sinnes of the world; for the Iewish Altar was the type, and Christ the verity. But what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence is there, betweene the tables whereon the Iewes did eate their sacrifices, and the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The tables whereon they did eate their sacrifices, were not holy instruments, which appertained to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temple, but such as they had in their owne priuate houses; and therefore were not types, which did
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9002:110"/>
eyther signifie our Communion Tables, or whereunto our Communion Tables doe answere, as anti-types<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is to be obserued, that in Christian Religion there is nothing which hath any necessary correspondence, or relation to the Legall ceremonies, but that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the verity of some type, or the antitype of some type. As for example, betweene Christ, and the Leuitical Priest, the Altar, and the Sacrifice, there is relation as betweene the type and the verity: so betweene Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and Baptisme, the Passeouer and the Lords Supper, there is relation, as betweene the type and the antitype; for our Sacraments haue succeeded these, and are in their stead. But as to the Table, whereon the Passeouer and other sacrifices were eaten, the same not being a sacred instrument, or type appointed by God, as hath been said, there is nothing in Christian Religion answering thereto, either as the verity it selfe, or as an antitype succeeding thereto. As therefore their tables were not necessary for eating of their sacrifices (for it is certaine, the Iewes were not a stricted by any diuine ordinance to sitte at Table, when they did eate the Passeouer, and their other Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) but were only commodious receptacles deuised by themselues, which they might haue altered and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed as they thought meet: Euen so, a materiall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall table for celebration of this Sacrament, is not an instrument appointed by our Sauiour, as the Altars and Tables of Shew-bread, but the same is appointed by the Church, according to that power which shee hath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine circumstances for the actions of diuine worship. To the disposing of the elements, some such receptacle and subiect is necessary, as a table, and decency requires it, when, and where the same may be had; but it is not of such a necessary vse, as the Altar vnder the Law, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Altar, a sacrifice could not be offered, but without any such table, the Sacrament hath often been ministred. <hi>Euagrius lib.</hi> 6. <hi>hist. cap.</hi> 13. records, That <hi>Gregorius</hi> Pastor

Finally, where yee adde, That for disposing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a dresser or cupboord may serue, these speeches smell of profanity; as if to hold and sustaine the elements were such a base employment, that the instrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church thought meet they should be placed, should neither be a table, nor named a table. And yet all these religious Epithets, which yee alledge the Fathers gaue to the Communion, as when they called it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the sacred Table, &amp;c. were giuen to it, not because the Communicants did sitte thereat, or for any other gesture of body vsed by them, but because the Lords body, the bread of heauen, the sacred, mysticall, and spirituall food of our soules, were presented thereon in the holy Sacrament. <hi>Causabone Exercit.</hi> 16.36. saith, That by these appellations, the Eucharist it selfe was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. But heere it is manifest, that the Epithets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriected in your discourse, are not only impertinent, but repugnant to the opinion yee hold: For when yee aske, why is it called a table, if men sit not at it? they answer you, Because vpon that table, the heauenly, sacred, and spirituall mysteries are set. In respect thereof, it is called a heauenly, spirituall, sacred, and mysticall table. In the dayes of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> by whom these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets were most frequently giuen to the Sacrament, there was not a table in the Churches, at which men did sitte, but one onely, on which the elements were placed, and consecrate: but yee neuer fall vpon the name of a Table sooner, then yee imagine it was appointed for sitting. And what then thinke yee of the Table of Shew-bread, at which no man did sit? Shall it not be called a Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it lacked your employment of sitting, or table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture?

In all Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> (our Church and very few excepted) the Communion Tables haue no employment, but only to hold, and sustaine the elements: This is to be seen in the Churches of <hi>France, Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Pole,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabone</hi> obserues, that there are two Tables, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the elements are set before the Consecration, and another wherupon they are Consecrate.

                  <p>This also is a calumny, for these words wee vse not in stead of the sacramentall words, because then there should be no Sacrament at all: for by the sacramentall word, <hi>This is my body,</hi> the bread is made the Sacrament

of Christs body: and by this word, <hi>This Cuppe is the New Testament in my bloud,</hi> the Cuppe is made the Sacrament of his Bloud; and without this word, whereby the will of our Sauiour is declared, which makes the Sacrament, all our prayers and wishes should serue to no vse. It is true, after the Sacrament is made by the sacramentall word, these, or the like words are vttered by the Pastor at the deliuery of the Elements, whereby the generall prayer and blessing, wherewith the action beginnes, is applyed particularly to euery Communicant, and they admonished, and instructed to apply it to themselues. This is the dutie both of the Pastor and of the people: for as in the prayer it is our duetie to wish in generall, that all who are to participate the bodie and bloud of Iesus, may be preserued thereby to euerlasting life: so it is our duetie to wish the same to each one seuerally at the instant when he is receiuing. And as it is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples dutie, when the prayer is conceiued for all, to wish that Christs body and bloud may preserue all the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thereof: so, when they receiue seuerally, to wish, that themselues in particular may be preserued thereby: For, if this be one of the principall ends, wherefore they come to receiue, can they receiue worthily without this or the like wish?

                  <p>If yee stand to that, which yee alleadge out of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> was the custome of the Iewes, and vsed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Institution: yee haue no cause to quarrell the distribution of the bread; for the Master of the feast v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to breake the bread in so many peeces as the number of the Feasters were, giuing to euery one a peece: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did each person measure his owne portion, giuing the rest to his neighbour, according to our custome. But leauing this, if we shall consider by the Institution, what part is proper to the Pastor, and what to the People, wee will finde, that as it is the Pastors part to take bread, to blesse, and giue thanks; so is it his part, first, to breake the bread, then to giue it with this precept, <hi>Take, eate</hi>; and so, that it is the Peoples part not to breake it, but to take it broken: for, as it was the part of Christ, first, to giue his flesh for the life of the World, when he did offer himselfe in a sacrifice for our sinnes, which he will haue represented in the Sacrament by the Pastor in breaking the bread: so it was his part to giue his flesh to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not to be broken and sacrificed by them, but to bee eaten, after it was once broken &amp; sacrificed by himselfe. If therefore it be not the part of the people, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the oblation of Christs body, or the donation thereof to vs, but the part of the Pastor properly, who in these actions represents Christ, it cannot be the part of the people to breake the bread, nor to giue the bread one to another. For this cause, in the ancient Church, it was euer giuen, either by the Pastor himselfe, or by his Deacon, who supplied his place, and helped him in the action; but neuer by any of the people to others. And <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in the place which your selfe quotes, saith not, that the people diuided the bread; but that it was permitted to euery one of the people to take a part of the Eucharist, after that some (doubtlesse the Masters
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9002:113"/>
of the Church) had diuided it in peeces, as their custome was. The learned <hi>Musculus</hi> in his common places, <hi>De coena Domini, pag.</hi> 444. speaking of this purpose saith; <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git &amp; dedit Discipulis suis, fregit ipse manu sua panem, ac fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum à se dedit Discipulis: non dedit integrum, &amp; ab ipsis fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum, sed à se fractum panem. Non dedit vt ipsi distribuerent, sed vt à se distributum acciperent &amp; ederent. Erant Apostoli in ca coena Domini, non vt dispensatores mysteriorum Dei: sed vt conuinae, vt fideles, vt Discipuli, vt Communicantes: Christus verò vt Conuiuator, vt Dominus, eadem opera instituens, ac sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipsius manibus dispensans gratiae suae sacramentum.</hi> That is to say, Christ Iesus brake, and gaue to his Disciples: hee brake the bread with his owne hand, and when it was broken he gaue it to his Disciples: he gaue it not whole vnto them, to be broken by them, but he gaue them that which he had broken: he gaue it not to them to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by them, but that they should take it being distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by him, and eate it. The Apostles were in that Supper not as dispensers of the mysteries of God, but as Guests, as the faithfull, as Disciples, and as Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants: but Christ was as the maker of the Feast, as the Master, at one time both instituting and dispensing with his owne hand the Sacrament of his grace. Here you see, that Christ is the breaker, the giuer, the distributer of the Bread, and not the Disciples: And so the Pastor is now the breaker, the giuer, the distributer, and not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let the judicious Reader consider, whether the iudgement of this learned man doth better agree with the Institution, or the opinion of the Pamphlet penner: And whether the Pastor, who according to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breakes the bread, and giues it with his owne hands to the people, or they, who giue the bread to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in whole schaues to bee broken, and distributed by themselues, comes neerer to Christs appointment.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the Cup: If our Sauiour, in giuing of the same, did imitate the custome of the Iewes, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9002:114"/>
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others wrote to haue beene this; that the Master of the Feast, after he had blessed the Cup, did first drinke thereof himselfe, and then gaue it to him who sate next; so as it passed from hand to hand till all had drunken: it seemes, that the Disciples did deliuer the Cup one to another. But there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the distribution of the Cuppe and the Bread: for the distribution of the Bread is not a diuiding onely of the Bread from hand to hand, but a breaking is conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the distributing: for he that giues to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, breakes before he giues. Now in this breaking we know there is a mysterie, which signifies the breaking of the Lords Body; which is an act, as is before made eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that onely appertaines to Christ, both in the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when he did offer himselfe on the Crosse and in the mysterie, when he did represent his oblation, or the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his body, by the breaking of the bread: and therefore is such an act, as ought onely to be performed by him, who in the Sacrament acteth the part of Christ, and represents him sacrificing himselfe. In distribution of the Cuppe there is no such mysterie: for the giuing of it from hand to hand signifies not the shedding of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours bloud, but the taking of the Cup by the Pastor, and the drinking thereof, doth represent that Cup which the Father propined to his Sonne, and the Sonne receiued and dranke, when willingly hee suffered his bloud to bee shed on the Crosse for the remission of the sinnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and for confirmation of the new Testament; which Cup, Bloud, and Testament, is in the Sacrament deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the People by the Pastor in Christs name, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to take, and drinke all thereof. He in whose Name this command is vttered, is properly the Giuer and propiner, because by his authoritie it is giuen, and by the warrant of his word it is receiued. When the King drinks to any of his Subiects, and sends it by the hand of his seruant, the seruant is not properly the

giuer and propiner, but the deliuerer of the gift and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine: and therefore, as in the Sacrament, the Pastor when he takes the Cup, and drinks, acteth the part of Christ, and represents him taking and drinking that most bitter Cuppe of his Passion and death for our sinnes: so, when he giues and commands the people to take, and drinke all thereof, he acteth the part of Christ, applying his bloud, and giuing the New Testament confirmed thereby to euery worthy receiuer, whether the same be deliuered immediately to euery one by his owne hand; or if it bee sent by the hand of the Deacon, as is was in the Primitiue Church, or if it be deliuered from hand to hand by the Communicants amongst themselues. But without all question, if the Pastor may commodiously by himselfe make the deliuery, it is most agreeable to the person which hee carries in that holy action, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents our Sauiour, first, willingly vndergoing death for vs, then, most bountifully applying it to vs with his owne hand.</p>
                  <p>O, but in the 22. of <hi>Luke, verse</hi> 17. our Sauiour sayd, <hi>Take this Cuppe, and diuide it amongst you</hi>: The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Part it amongst you. Here you trouble your selfe, and the Reader much with a long discourse, prouing that in this place the Eucharisticke Cuppe, and not the Paschall is meant: Yet let it be so. What then? they are commanded to part it amongst them, <hi>ergo,</hi> to reach it from hand to hand. This followes not; for when euery one takes his owne part of that which is to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they diuide the whole amongst them, although eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one deliuer not with his hand to his neighbour the thing which is to be diuided, or the remanent thereof: as by example; When the Manna, which was gathered in the Wildernesse, was cast together in heapes, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies came forth, and parted the same amongst them, euery man taking his Homer, which was his part; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies diuided the whole amongst them, without reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9002:115"/>
from hand to hand the heape which was diuided: so when the Disciples were commanded to diuide the Cup amongst them, if euery one did drinke no more then his owne portion, &amp; did leaue the rest to his fellow, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was obeyed: albeit when euery one had drunken, the last had set downe the Cup on the Table, or had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it into his hand, from whom he had receiued it; or if one or two had beene maymed, and lacked the vse of their hands, so that the Cup behoued to be holden to their heads; yet if they dranke no more, but their owne part, with respect to their neighbour, who was to drinke after them, they diuided the Cup: for the diuiding is not the giuing of the Cup, but the parting of the wine amongst them, that was in the Cup: So if they did drinke with such moderation, that one, two, or three dranke it not all, but that all did drinke as our Sauiour commanded; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they did not deliuer it one to another, but receiued it seuerally, euery one from Christs owne hand, as wee doe out of the hand of the Pastor, they neuerthelesse diuided the same amongst them. To conclude, the command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Apostles, importeth, that <hi>Poculum benedictionis,</hi> is not <hi>Poculum ebrietatis, sed charitatis,</hi> that is to say, The Cup of blessing, is not the cup of drunkennesse, but the Cup of charity, which should not be carowsed by one, but should be parted amongst many. And therefore these two phrases, the one vsed by Saint LVKE, <hi>Diuide it amongst you:</hi> and the other by S. MATTHEVV and S. MARKE, <hi>Drinke thereof all, and they dranke of it all,</hi> are equiualent. As to the giuing and deliuering of the Cup, whether it should be, by the hand of the Pastor, or by the mutuall deliuering of the people one to another, because it is not defined by the Scripture, it is indifferent, and left to bee determined by the Church.</p>
                  <p>These grounds being sure, let vs consider your syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatsoeuer action or command is inclosed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Institution, may not lawfully be broken. But that

By what consequence I pray you? Because, say you, that gesture, and this distribution, is no wayes compatible. It is a manifest vntruth; for he that kneeles, may take as well his portion of the wine, and leaue the rest to his neighbour, as he that sittes; and if you thinke that one cannot reach, and deliuer the Cup to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour kneeling beside him, you are deceiued: for I haue seene at one daies seruice a thousand persons, who haue reached the Cup one to another kneeling, as they were accustomed to doe sitting at Table before: yet, as hath been said, that was not necessary, for the precept in the Institution is not, <hi>Giue this Cup one to another,</hi> but <hi>diuide it,</hi> or <hi>part it amongst you,</hi> or <hi>drinke all thereof.</hi>

                  <p>The sacramental Supper should carry the resemblance of a Supper, in the formes and fashions thereof, or else it cannot rightly be called a Supper: for it is not onely the matter, that is, the dainties and food that makes a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, but also the ordering of the guests, and kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of them.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that it cannot properly be called a Supper, except it carry the resemblance of a Supper, both in the dainties, and in the formes and fashions of a supper; but it may be called a supper rightly, as yee speake, although it doe not resemble a supper in all these things. For that which is properly called a supper, hath plenty and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of meat and drinke, at least it is a sufficient bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9002:116"/>
Secondly, at it so much time is spended, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the entertainment. Thirdly, the Guests doe entertaine one another by caruing, and drinking, and other kindly and familiar communication. Fourthly, The time thereof is the euening or night season. I am assured, that the Sacrament, for any resemblance it hath in any of these things to a supper, cannot properly be called a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, farre lesse in respect of ordering, and entertaining the Guests. For at ordinary suppers, Guests are ordered according to their qualities, but heere there is no respect of persons: for entertainment, Guests are entreated <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixè,</hi> that is, largely and long; but heere, more then spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, for the bodily part, with a morsell of bread, and a little wine. These being laid aside, what are your table and sitting thereat, but idle spectacles? Yee breake, and giue the bread one to another: that wee haue shewed to be against the Institution; yee drinke one to another, but we ought not to drinke one to another, as the giuer and propiner drinkes to the receiuer: for our Sauiour onely, who is represented by the Pastor, is the giuer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piner of the Cuppe externally, and of his owne bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; and all the people are but receiuers, not giuers or propiners in any wise. And as to our Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selues, it standeth not in this, That wee haue any fellowship in dispensation of the sacred mysteries, but it standeth in the participation alonely: not in this, that we take the bread, breake, and giue it to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but in this, that we all receiue the same bread, which is broken by the Pastor, and the same flesh which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did breake vpon the Crosse: such like not in that we take the Cup, drinke, and giue it one to another; but in this, that we drinke all of the same Cup, which the Pastor giues after thankesgiuing; and the same bloud which our Sauiour shed for the sinnes of many; otherwise, if wee confound the actions of the Pastor and the people, wee breake and violate the Institution, and disturbe the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9002:117"/>
whole action, making the people not only act their owne part, but also take vpon them the part of Christ, and the Pastor. We must not therefore seeke the resemblance of the Supper in these things, that are manifestly repugnant to the Institution, but in such things, as are contained therein</p>
                  <p>Go too then, and let vs take a view of these: first, in the Institution a supper is resembled by a sufficient repast, not in the quantity, but in the nature and quality of the elements, the one being drie, the other wette; the one meate, the other drinke, in which two kindes a perfect food consists; to teach vs, that in Christ is all fulnesse: <hi>He that comes to me shall neuer hunger, And he that beleeues in me, shall neuer thirst.</hi> Secondly, a Supper is resembled in the Sacrament, by the blessing and distribution that is made by the Master of the feast, and by taking, eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Guests, which are the essentiall parts, and properties of a Supper. Thirdly, as a supper is not the repast of some few, but of the whole family and guestes, who are present; for which cause it was called <hi>coena tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because it was common: So is the Sacrament instituted for all that are present, who may, and will come and present themselues therto. These are the things set downe in the Institution, wherein the resemblance stands. Your table prerogatiues, gestures, formes, fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ordering and entertainment of guestes, we find not, and therefore dare not bee so bold, as to affirme them to be necessary. As in extending the sense of Parables, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration would be kept, that it be not racked beyond the bounds and scope of the purpose, whereupon the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is inferred: so the parabolicke names giuen to these holy mysteries, should not bee extended beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance &amp; similitude set downe in Scripture, for which these names are imposed. Therefore when the Sacrament is called a Table, and a Supper, wee must not thinke that euery thing which is competent to an ordinary table, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9002:117"/>
supper, are to be found and obserued there, but only such as haue cleare warrant in the Institution, either in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or by necessary consequence. In particular, the whole substantiall things, actions, and ceremonies are expressed, from the which wee should take nothing, and whereunto we should adde nothing. The circumstances that doe necessarily accompany such things, actions, and ceremonies, as the time when, the place where, the part whereon, the person by whom, and to whom, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doe necessarily follow the action: for some time and place must be, when, and where it must be done; some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by whom, and to whom it must be celebrated; some part there must be, whereon the elements must be set, and from whence they must be giuen and receiued; some posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and site of body must be vsed by the giuers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, and some order must be obserued for entring and proceeding in the action and finishing therof: some things would go before, as Sermons or Seruice; and it is decent, that the celebration be closed with Psalmes and blessings: but none of these circumstantiall things are particularly defined by Scripture, therefore they are left to bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Church, according to the rules of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order, and decencie.</p>

I answere, They bowed not their head, whilest they did heare, but after they had heard; and this I hope you will not deny: but after the participation of the Passeouer, they gaue thankes with as great reuerence and deuotion, as they vsed after hearing of the Word. Further, at the participation they sate not, but stood all the time, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they shew farre greater reuerence, then bowing of the head, which is finished at one instant, could import.

                  <p>This all is sound, and touching it, wee agree fully with you, that reuerence which is done to the Sacrament should not bee expressed by kneeling, which you truely call a gesture of adoration, and soueraigne worshippe. Therefore should it neither bee giuen to the booke of the Euangell, nor to the elements of the Sacrament, but to him only, who is the Author, and matter of both. And yet if men fall downe, and worship him at the hearing of the Gospell, or after, at the receiuing of the Sacrament, or after, and before it be receiued, being moued thereto by contemplation of his grace, and glory in the one and other: this religious worship no man wil deny to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed, as well by the worthy receiuer of the Sacrament, as by the reuerent hearer of the Word; for as we bow not to the letters and syllables, and sounds of the words of the Gospell, but to him, whose minde and will is declared therein: So doe wee not bow to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine in the Sacrament, but to him, whose body and bloud we receiue thereby.

                  <p>Heere you set your selfe against three parties, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> the Ancients, and the Assembly at Perth. For the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> I answere shortly, That he takes the mysteries with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> for the body and blood of Christ, represented in the Sacrament by the elements of bread and wine. In which sense, they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called great and dreadfull, and ought to bee receiued with great humility of soule, and humiliation of body: <hi>Non enim peccatur adorando carnem Christi, sed peccatur non
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9002:120"/>
adorando</hi>; We sinne not, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in adoring Christs flesh, but we sinne, if wee adore it not in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>That which you blame in the Ancients, of withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the sight of the Sacraments, not only from Pagans, but also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Catechumenists, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> iustifies with great reason, <hi>Hom.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> on these words: <hi>We speak the wisdome of God, which is hid. Alia videmus,</hi> saith he, <hi>alia cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus, aliter afficior ego, aliter infidelis. Infidelis, si lauacrum audiat, aquam simpliciter cogitat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ideo fidei arcana, non sunt temerè apud indignos evulga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da:</hi> We see one thing, saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> we beleeue another. I who beleeue am otherwise affected, then an Infidel is: if an Infidel heare of washing in Baptisme, he thinkes there is nothing there but water, &amp;c. For this cause the mysteries of our faith ought not rashly to be divulgate to the vnworthy. This iudgment of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> is not crossed by S. <hi>Augustines</hi> testimony, but confirmed rather: for if the Sacraments should be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as matters religious, then as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, <hi>Pretiosa margarita est à contemptu vindicanda,</hi> that is, a pretious jewel ought to be preserued from contempt.</p>
                  <p>Where you alledge against the Assembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> that in the late act therof, we are ordained to kneele, for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the diuine mysteries, you are guilty of manifest falshood: for in reciting the words of the act, you blot out some, change others, and thereby corrupt purposely the whole sense and meaning of the act. You blot out these words, <hi>of God, and in due regard</hi>: you change the word <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> in <hi>mysteries,</hi> &amp; these you interpret to be the elements, whereas in the act, the word (<hi>mystery</hi>) signifies not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, but the receiuing of the blessed body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. But that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit may be manifested, I will set downe the act, as it is extracted forth of the Register of the Assembly, vnder the hand of the Clerke thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since we are commanded by God himselfe, that when we come
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9002:120"/>
to worship him we fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and considering withall, that there is no part of diuine worship more heauenly and spirituall, then is the holy receiuing of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: like as the most humble and reuerent gesture of the body, in our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lifting vp of our hearts, becommeth well so diuine and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred an action: Therefore notwithstanding, our Church hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed since the reformation of Religion heere, to celebrate the holy Communion to the people sitting, by reason of the great abuse vsed in the idolatrous worship of Papists: yet now since all memory of by-past superstition, is blotted out of the hearts of the people prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God; in reuerence of God, and in due regard of so diuine a mysterie, and in remembrance of so mysticall an vnion, as wee are made partakers of thereby, the Assembly thinkes good, that, that blessed Sacrament bee celebrated hereafter to the people, humbly and reuerently kneeling vpon their knees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the true copie of the act, differing in many things from that which you sette downe. <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. in the narratiue thereof, the reasons are set downe, wherefore the people should kneele, when they receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are repeated orderly in the conclusion, as the causes of the same. The first reason is, <hi>Since we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himselfe, that when we come to worship him, wee fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Relatiue vnto this, we haue in the conclusion, <hi>Therefore in reuerence of God, the Assembly thinkes good, that the Sacrament be giuen to the people kneeling.</hi> The second reason in the narratiue is, <hi>And considering withall, that there is no part of diuine worship more heauenly and spirituall, then is the holy receiuing of the blessed bodie and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</hi> Relatiue to this, wee haue these words, <hi>And in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of so diuine a mysterie.</hi> Wee say not in regard of the diuine mysteries, which you interpret the elements, but <hi>Mysterie,</hi> that is, the holy receiuing of the body and blood of Iesus Christ, mentioned in the narratiue. Our third reason is, the correspondence which ought to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9002:121"/>
betweene the outward gesture of our body, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and consider the mysticall vnion betweene Christ and vs, and amongst our selues, whereof we are made partakers by receiuing of Christs blessed body and bloud. This is expressed in these words, <hi>Like as the most humble and reuerent gesture of the body in our meditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, becomes so diuine and sacred an action.</hi> Relatiue to this, in the conclusion, we haue these words; <hi>And in remembrance of so mysticall an vnion, as we are made partakers of thereby</hi>: for this <hi>remembrance</hi> is a part of our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So to conclude, we come to worship at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord our Maker, who hath not onely made vs by creation, but who by redemption hath made vs his people, and the sheepe of his pasture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.7. <hi>Psalme</hi> 100.3. that is, God manifested in the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We come to receiue his flesh and bloud, and in reuerence of him wee are commanded by the act to kneele. As yee then inferre vpon your forgery and falshood, that to kneele for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the mysteries is nothing else, but to worship the mysteries: so I inferre vpon the very words wherein the act is conceiued, That to kneele for reuerence of God, in due regard of the diuine mysterie, that is, the receiuing of Christs body and bloud, in remembrance of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vnion, whereof thereby we are made partakers, first, with our Head and Sauiour; and next, through him, with God, and amongst our selues: to kneele, I say, at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the reuerence and respects aforesayd, is to worship God rightly, and that is the due obseruation of his commandement.</p>

               <head>The Doctrine of Papists, touching the honour of Images.</head>
               <p>THe Papists professe, that they giue to their Images two kindes of honour: The one they call Proper,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9002:122"/>
the other Accidentall and improper. The proper, they say, is due to the Image, as it is an holy thing, such as the honour which is giuen to the Euangell, to holy Vessels and Vestures; and it is proper, because it rests in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as in the proper obiect, and is not conueyed by the Image immediately to the principall and archetype, albeit it be giuen to the Image, for the respect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is carryed to the principall, and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence redounds to the principall. This honour they affirme to differ, not in specie, but in degree onely from the honor which is properly due to the principall. <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Imag. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Before wee proceede to the improper and accidentall adoration of Images, we haue here to consider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit no honour, but contempt, and destruction onely be due to Papisticall Images, because they are not holy things, but detestable abominations: yet therefore we must not thinke, that to such things as are truely holy, and applyed to religious vses, reuerent and religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is not due, as to the holy Sacraments, and to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangell, which honor rests in them, and is giuen to them in respect of him, whose word and Sacraments they are, and so redounds to him consequently: such an honour I meane as is the hearing of the Word reuerently, and the handling of the Sacraments, with the preseruing, and vsing of them decently. It is true, this honour is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a spece of adoration, but a religious reuerence onely, which we must not reiect, because the Papists giue the same, or the like, to their Idols: for they giue to things which are not religious, but superstitious, and execrable, a religious honour: therefore this reason is a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, wherwith ye abuse the simple. Papists giue such honor to their Idols, and in so doing they commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: therefore sincere Professors in giuing that honor to the Sacraments &amp; the word, commit idolatry. It followes not, for Papists giue the honor which is due to the Word
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9002:123"/>
and Sacraments vnto their Idols, to which it no wise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: as by example; Papists vse their Images for signes, meanes, and occasions to stirre them vp to worshippe God, and in this they commit idolatry, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, vse, and handle them as holy things, which God hath not allowed to be done: but when a true Christian vseth the Word of God, and the Sacraments for signes, middesse, occasions, and instruments to stirre him vp to worship God, and in that respect honours and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them as holy things, hee doth not commit idolatry, nor breakes not the second Commandement: but by the contrary he obserues that Commandement, in vsing the meanes, which God himselfe hath ordayned to be vsed in his worship: and hee obserues the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which bindes all men to sanctifie the Name of God, and such meanes as he hath vouchsafed to manifest himselfe by to vs in his worship.</p>
               <p>Now I proceede to the accidentall and improper ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which Papists professe themselues to giue to their Images. This is the point here most controuerted, and therefore most expedient to be knowne.</p>
               <p>The accidentall honour which they giue to their Images is, an adoration of their Images coniunctly with the principall; as when the King is honoured, his Robe Royall, and all his Ornaments are honoured coniunctly with his person, and with the same signes of honour that are giuen to his person: <hi>Bellarm. ibidem cap</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The improper honour is the adoration of the Image in place, and stead of the principall: as, when the Prince his Ambassadour is honored for the Prince himselfe; or, an empty Coffin or Image, for the person himselfe, whose Image it is; all the honour due to the Prince, is done in that case to the Ambassadour or Image; as beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, kneeling, discouering of the head, prostration of the body, kiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:9002:123"/>The improper, and accidentall honour, or adoration, differs from the proper: first, because the proper, as they say, although it be the same in specie, with that which is giuen to the principall, yet it differs from it in degree; but this improper honour is the same, both in specie and in degree. Next, because the proper, as they say, <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur,</hi> that is, ends and rests in the Image, and redounds not immediately to the principall, but by way of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The improper, and accidentall adoration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be done to the Image, <hi>non tamen terminatur,</hi> yet it ends not, and rests in the Image, but passes, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conueyed to the principall by the Image, and from the Image. <hi>Bellarm. ibid. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>This is summarily their doctrine, as may bee seene in their Writings. To apply this to our purpose, yee labour to extenuate this adoration, which they professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to giue vnto their Images accidentally and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, saying, that the externall signes of adoration, such as kneeling, bowing, discouering of the head, &amp;c. are onely done before them, and about them. This is too sparingly and rashly spoken: for these externall shewes are not onely done before and about them, but the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adoration is wholy exhibited to them. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Imag. cap.</hi> 23. writeth thus: <hi>Aliquando imago su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur pro ipso exemplari, &amp; ea quae fierent circae ipsum exemplar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Hence it is manifest, that the signes of honour, which are done before them, and about them, are exhibited to them they kisse them, they speake to them, they kneele, they fall downe, they discouer their heads to them, and all is done about them, that would be done about Christ; all is

So, to conclude this point, that by the act at <hi>Perth</hi> we are ordained to bow our knees to the Elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such honour, or signe of adoration is done to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by vs, as Papists grant they giue to their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is a most impudent lye.</p>

                  <p>I haue shewed, &amp; shall presently shew, by Gods grace, the difference in this case to bee as great, as is betweene idolatry, and the true worship of God.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9002:126"/>
of the holy Sacraments: take these occasions, middesse, and signes away, yee abolish Religion, and all the worship of God out of the Word. I hope the Reader by this shall see the difference to bee as great in this case, as is betweene a lawfull meane of Gods worship, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by himselfe, and the inuention of man prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God.</p>
                  <p>Next, the Papists will haue these middesse, occasions, &amp; signes not onely obiects of diuine worship actiue, that is, seruing to stir vp, and moue men to worship, which is the first degree of their idolatry: but they will haue them likewise passiue obiects, such as are to be worshipped ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in stead of the principall, or coniunctly with him; &amp; this is a higher degree of idolatry. In this then they differ also from the Word, Sacraments, &amp; creatures, that these being the ordinary obiects &amp; instruments whereby men must be stirred vp to worship God, &amp; so the obiects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine adoration actiuely, they neither are, nor should they be esteemed passiue obiects of adoration, that is, such as should be adored, either coniunctly with God, or in his stead. This we condemne &amp; detest, yet must not run on with you to the other extremity, &amp; say, that howsoeuer they were ordained of God to be signes &amp; seales of his graces, yet they are not <hi>in statu acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modato ad adora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Shall our corporall food, when it is presented on table before vs, bee in such state, as is proper to stir vs vp to worship God with thanksgiuing &amp; praier? Shall the consideration of the benefit which we haue by the light of the day, &amp; by our rest &amp; sleepe in the night, be esteemed motiues of such moment, that he who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9002:127"/>
is not thereby moued in the morning when he riseth, and at night when he goeth to bed, to pray, and giue thanks, is esteemed a slothfull and ingratefull Christian? Shall a seasonable seede time, shall the first and latter raine, and a faire haruest bee pregnant occasions to remember vs both in priuate and publike to giue thanks, and praise God for his goodnesse? And shall the blessed Sacrament of the body and bloud of Iesus Christ, in the very act, when it is in giuing and receiuing, not be esteemed to be in proper state to moue vs, and stirre vp our hearts to pray, and giue thanks for that inestimable benefite, euen when our Sauiour hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that we should do this in remembrance of him? It is an absurd opinion. Then to conclude; If yee hold these two points which ye haue propounded, to wit, that the Sacrament, and creatures of God should not be vsed as occasions, middesses, and signes to moue vs by the sight and meditation of them, to lift vp our hearts to the spirituall obiect of our faith, that is, to God in Iesus Christ, because <hi>Suarez</hi> saith, that their Images haue that vse; then certainely, you must hold, that God should not bee knowne nor worshipped in the World: for without this vse of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Creatures, God cannot bee knowne, nor worshipped. So whilst yee flye idolatry, yee fall into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme. Next, if yee hold, that the Sacraments in the very act of the administration, are not <hi>in statu accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ad adorandum,</hi> you must take away the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ende of the Sacrament commended to vs by the Lord himselfe in these words, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> interprets these words thus; <hi>So often as yee eate this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe, yee shall declare the Lords death, till he come againe:</hi> that is, as the Confession of our faith, which yee haue sworne and subscribed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines it, <hi>Yee shall extoll, magnifie, and prayse his death.</hi> Now this is a reall act of adoration, which both the Lord himselfe, and his holy Apostle would haue vs moued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9002:127"/>
by this Sacrament. So by these your positions and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, yee mutilate the Sacrament of one of the most principall ends, for the which it was instituted. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally yee take from the Creatures of God, and the holy Sacraments, the most excellent vse, for which they were appointed: namely, to be meanes and motiues to stirre vs vp vnto the worship of our Creator and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

The relatiue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

is onely that which Papists giue to their Idols, for the relation they haue to the principall, which we detest, and condemne as much as your selfe.</p>
                  <p>Where you say, that the signes of the olde and new Testament, and the sacramentall Elements, when they are onely seene, as likewise the Sunne, or any beautifull creature, might then moue vs to adore: I answere, that although they be potentially <hi>obiectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à quo,</hi> obiects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may bee stirred vp to worship; yet are they not actually such, except they bee applyed, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to that vse, either in the ordinary publique ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or in a mans priuate meditation and deuotion: or extraordinarily vpon some present and great occasion; as when the fire came downe at the prayer of <hi>Elias,</hi> and consumed the sacrifice. When the Signes, Sacraments, or Works of God, are after that manner propounded and insinuated, they are <hi>in statu accommodato ad orandum,</hi> and then men ought to adore and worship God: yet it is not necessary that they should, vpon all such occasions, fall downe and kneele, as yee conclude: For when in our priuate meditation and deuotion, or when by some present great occasion, wee are inwardly moued and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to worship; our externall gesture of adoration is arbitrarie, and left to our owne priuate election, to doe what is most conuenient &amp; decent for that time: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the discouering of the head is sufficient, sometime the lifting vp of the eyes onely, and sometime no gesture at all is required; but in the ordinary Ministerie, when the works of God, or his benefites are propounded, and applyed publikely, to stirre vs vp to worship in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Church, then our gesture ceaseth to bee arbitrarie: for it must be such as is prescribed and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church, where we worship.

But wee set them not before vs purposely, wee are by no direction tyed vnto them; they stand only before vs by casuall position, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we choose otherwise to doe.</p>

                  <p>Your former dispute was founded on falsehood, this runnes all vpon ambiguity of speech. To kneele before the Elements hath two senses, either it signifies to kneele to the Elements, as wee are said to kneele before God, when we kneele vnto him; and Papists before their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, when they kneele to them. In this sense, it is a lye to affirme, that we kneele before the Elements. Next, to kneele before any thing, signifieth to kneele, hauing some things before our eyes, or in our sight, or obiect to our senses either by casuall position, as you say, or purposely. To kneele to God before any thing, standing, or set casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before you, you doe not condemne; but to kneele to God, hauing any thing purposely before vs, as the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9002:129"/>
Elements, that yee insinuate to be idolatrie, but I hope you shal neuer proue it: for a Penitentiary kneeles to God purposely before the Congregation, and with a respect to the Congregation; namely, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with him in prayer, he may testifie to them his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, and they being satisfied therewith, may receiue him againe into their fellowship. Heere is a kneeling to God before something purposely, and with respect, which is not idolatrie. When wee come to our common tables, before we eate, either sitting with our heads discouered, or standing, or kneeling, we giue thanks and blesse with a respect to the meat, which is purposely set on table; yet this is not idolatry. And to draw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer to the purpose: The Pastor, when he begins the holy action, hath the bread and the cup set before him purposely vpon the table, and with respect to them hee giues thankes to God, for that it hath pleased him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Sacrament in these Elements, that hee might thereby communicate to vs, the body and the blood of Iesus. And thus hee ought to blesse the Elements, for which the Apostle saith, <hi>The Cup of his blessing which wee blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ?</hi> Heere is a praying, a blessing, a thankesgiuing to God before the Elements, purposely set before vs, and not by casuall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: And it is true, that if any may bee said to kneele before the Elements, it is the Pastor in this part of the action, and not the people. For when they receiue, they do not set the bread before them, as Papists doe the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, but presently they put it in their mouthes, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest they are eating, they continue still kneeling, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread, which is not then before them, but before the Lord Iesus, vnto whom they only kneele. In all this the Pastor doth imitate our Sauiour himselfe, who first tooke the bread, and hauing it purposely before him, or holding it in his hands, <hi>Gaue thankes, and after Supper tooke the Cup, which he did blesse also.</hi> So to kneele or adore God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9002:130"/>
before the Elements, that is, hauing them in our sight, or obiect to our senses, as ordinary signes, means, &amp; memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to stirre vs vp to worship God and our Sauiour, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, immediatly, &amp; onely, and not the Elements, either in his stead, or coniunctly with him; is no idolatry, but the right and true forme of Gods worship.</p>
                  <p>The cause of all this errour is, you make no distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the abuse of Idols in the worship of God, and the right vse of his workes, Word, and Sacraments. To pray, or giue thankes to God before an Image, with respect to it, is idolatry: but to pray and giue thankes to God, hauing his creatures, or Sacraments before our eyes and mindes, and being mooued by the respects that we consider in them, is a most lawfull and religious forme of adoration. For we can neither pray to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor thank him, nor praise him, but euer there must bee, before the eyes of our minds at least, something of his works, Word, or Sacraments, if not before our externall senses; and that we must respect, consider, and be mooued thereby. Contrariwise, to set before the eyes of our minds or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, any Image, as a meane or motiue of adoration, is idolatrie. For although the worship were abstracted, which is occasioned by the Image, and were not giuen vnto it (as neuer any hath said, except your selfe, of the externall adoration) yet it is damned, because no true worship can be properly occasioned by an Image, which is a Doctor of lyes, teaching nothing of God, but false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and vanities. But the blessed Sacrament being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by Christ, to call to our remembrance his death, and the benefit we haue thereby, giues vs so oft as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, a most powerfull and pregnant occasion of thankesgiuing and praise; which if wee should neglect, and not adore, we should bee guilty of the breach of the first Commandement, because we did not adore, when Christ purposely did offer the greatest occasion, that can be presented so to doe. Therefore, when by that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9002:130"/>
we adore our Sauiour, both on the knees of our soule and body, we are no breakers, but due obseruers, as well of the first, as second Commandement.</p>

                  <p>It is true likewise, that God directed his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to bend and bow themselues towards the Arke, and the Temple wherein the Arke was, and the mountaine whereon the Temple was situate: partly, lest that rude people should turne their worshippe another way; partly because of his promise to heare them, when they should pray towards the Temple, or Arke; partly because of his singular manner of presence in the Arke.

Where yee say, That the Altars, and Offerings and other holy things, wanted the like presence, &amp; that before these, they might not bow in that respect, it is vtterly false: For <hi>Salomon</hi> first stood, and after kneeled before the Altar, and prayed, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.12. <hi>And hee stood before the Altar of the Lord in presence of all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands, For</hi> SALOMON <hi>had made a brasen scaffold of fiue cubits long, and fiue cubits broad, and three cubits high, and set it in the middest of the court, and vpon it hee stood, and he kneeled downe vpon his knees before all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heauen, and said,</hi> &amp;c.

That the people bowed when they offered their Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my selfe before the most high God?</hi> Heere we haue <hi>Salomon</hi> kneeling before the Altar, and the people kneeling, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their oblations.

Further, when he saith of the bread, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and of the Cup, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> doth it not import a coniunction betweene his Body and the Elements, and a spirituall presence of his Body in the Sacrament? And should not his body and blood be as present to the eyes of thy minde, thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding, and to the hand of thy heart, thy faith and confidence, as are the Elements to thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall senses, and bodily hand? Haue we not taught our people to this day, and yet should teach them, that in this action, there is an internall and externall receiuer, the hand and the heart: that there is an earthly and spiritual gift, the Elements of the Sacrament, and the body and blood of Christ? And should we not beleeue, that Christ, God, and Man, is as really present in the Sacrament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Diuinity, as we beleeue him to bee bodily present in heauen, giuing and applying the selfe-same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which is in heauen, as really to the inward man, as the Pastor is giuing the Elements to the outward? How dare you then affirme, that the Sacrament hath not such a presence of Chrst, as the Arke, the Propitiatory, and the

Cherubins had. O but he said, that he would dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Cherubins; That dwelling was typicall, but Christ hath promised to dwel spiritually and really in the hearts of the worthy receiuers. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

Sometime hee called the Arke his face, and glory, because it was a type of his face and glory; but the Sacrament is not a bare type, but a powerfull instrument, whereby Christ is communicate vnto vs, that wee may bee made partakers heere of his grace, and hereafter of his glory. Finally, when we are commanded to <hi>doe this in remembrance of him,</hi> we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to adore him; for according to the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made in the Confession of Faith, confirmed by act of Parliament, which yee professe your selfe to haue sworne, <hi>To doe this in remembrance of Christ,</hi> is to magnifie, declare, extoll, and praise his death till his comming againe.

                  <p>We doe fully agree with <hi>Perkins</hi> in all this, for wee neither direct our internall, nor externall adoration to the sacramentall Elements, nor to the place where they are, but to the Manhood of Iesus, which wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and beleeue to be locally only in heauen.

For the question is not, in whom God should bee worshipped, or in what place Christs Manhood is, wherin God should be worshipped; but the question is, whether at the Sacrament in the act of receiuing the sacramentall Elements externally, and the body and blood of Iesus Christ, internally; we may bow our knees, and lift vp our hearts, and adore that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by reason of the personall vnion, that it hath with the Godhead, and the Godhead dwelling in the Manhood corporally.

And with these precepts <hi>Fenners</hi> grounds doe agree: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, by what warrant is it appointed in the forme set downe before our Psalme bookes, touching the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords Supper, that during the time of the distribution, some place of Scripture should bee read, which doth liuely set forth the death of Christ; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that our eyes and senses may not onely be occupied in these outward signes of bread and wine, which are called the visible word, but that our minds and hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, may be fully fixed in the contemplation of the Lords death, which is by this holy Sacrament represented.

                  <p>As for our Church, no such prayer is ordained to bee vttered by the Minister, Therefore no such prayer can be pretended. In the late Canon it is said, That the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and humble gesture of the body, in our meditation and lifting vp of our hearts, best becommeth so diuine an action. Meditation is no prayer, and the heart may be lifted vp by the act of faith and contemplation, aswell as the action of prayer.

                  <p>Albeit neither mentall nor publike prayer be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Act, yet prayer, thankesgiuing, and praise, are all insinuated: for albeit all meditation bee not prayer, yet euery prayer is a meditation: and although in the act of faith and contemplation, the heart may bee lifted vp; yet, that eleuation of the heart requireth not the most humble, and reuerent gesture of the bodie, as

Our act insinuateth such a meditation, and lifting vp of the heart, as is vsed in actions of deuotion, such as prayer and thankesgiuing; which are practised by all, who giue obedience to the act, or doe worthily communicate.

soule. Such a meditation, an Hypocrite and Reprobate may haue at the Table, therefore it cannot be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worke of the minde, which distinguisheth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, from the vnworthie Receiuer. When we heare and reade the Word, the principall work of our mind, should not be a meditation vpon the forme of the characters, the sound of the letters, the coniunction of them, their sounds in the syllables, the syllables in the words, or the force and vertue of the words to signifie the matters; but the chiefe work of our mind should be to conceiue, vnderstand, and consider rightly what is spoken. So when we come to the Sacrament, the chiefe employment of our minde, should not be to consider the proportion that is betweene the naturall vse of the Elements, and the spirituall vse of Christs body and blood, but a meditation and spirituall action correspondent, and analogicke to the externall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall actions. As therefore the principall externall sacramental actions, are to take, eate and drink reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the symbolick Elements, the bread and wine; so the principall worke of the soule, correspondent by analogie thereto, is to remember the sacrifice of Christ, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his body, and shedding of his blood: to consider the benefit that we haue thereby, to put our confidence therein; and for all, to praise and magnifie his name with thankfulnesse. This worke and meditation, is proper to the worthy Receiuers, and stirreth vp in the soule, that most reuerent estimation and affection towards our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, with an humble submission of our minds vnto him, which we call adoration: whereof the outward testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and signe, is the humble and reuerent gesture of the body, prescribed in the act, which is also a gesture most conuenient for prayer. So this gesture prescribed in the act, doth not only attend the prayer vttered by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and conceiued by the people in the act of receiuing, but is proper to that, which is indeed the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal exercise &amp; work of the mind, in al worthy receiuers.</p>

                  <p>The verball prayer vttered by the Pastor, and the mentall conceiued by the people, in the act of receiuing, is not an eiaculation, but necessary to be vsed in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the worthy Receiuers; for no man can receiue the body and the blood of Christ worthily, without a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall hunger and thirst after the righteousnesse and life that is in him: which spirituall appetite and desire, being declared by the Pastor in these or the like words, when he deliuereth the bread: <hi>Grant Lord, that by the vertue of thy body, which we receiue, we may haue life eternall, and be raised vp at the last day.</hi> And when hee deliuereth the Cup: <hi>Grant Lord, that by the vertue of thy blood, which we receiue, we may be purged from our sinnes, and filled with thy Spirit.</hi> And the Receiuers conceiuing, and confirming the same, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their mouthes, as the custome was in the ancient Church, or in their hearts, <hi>Amen</hi>: They send not vp oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional eiaculations, but necessary and ordinary prayers, such as the nature of the action requires.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9002:137"/>
or impetratorie sacrifice, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, yet it is eucharisticke, and a commemoration of the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, and impetratory sacrifice of Christ: And in the very act of receiuing, and by the act of receiuing, wee doe openly acknowledge and confesse before the world, that our confidence of saluation is onely in the sacrifice of the Lord Iesus Christ; which is, a reall praysing, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, extolling, and preaching of his death vntill his comming againe. Now to conclude, yee haue made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long answeres to a short obiection, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the argument remaines in force. Your obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proponed was this:
<q>Wee may pray in the act of receiuing, therefore wee may kneele.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your first answere to this obiection was, That knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not the onely proper and commendable gesture of prayer, and thereupon concluded, we might not kneele. This, as we haue shewed, is not a good consequence.</p>
                  <p>Next, yee answered, that to pray in the act of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery is against the Institution. This we haue confuted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you answered, that wee ought not to pray before a creature: and therefore might not pray in the act of receiuing. The antecedent of this is false, as wee haue shewed: at least, as it is conceiued, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion holds not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, yee sayd, that we are not commanded by the act of <hi>Perth</hi> to pray; and therefore that we may not pray. This followes not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because the prayer of the people in the act of receiuing is mentall, yee inferred, that they might not kneele<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is no good consequence.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, yee sayd, wee may not kneele before the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, and before <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not kneele in the act of receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is most absurd, the Sacrament being a part of Gods worship, instituted by himselfe: but the vse
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9002:138"/>
of Idols and Images in his worship he hath expressely forbidden. So all your answeres are meere sophisticall captions and abductions from the purpose: yet yee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to answere some others, that yee frame against your selfe.</p>

                  <p>A shew of conformitie with the Papists in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, is a breach of the second Commandement: But to kneele at the Sacrament, our hearts being freed of the opinion of Transubstantiation, and our mouthes confessing and professing, that we doe onely kneele to God, and our Sauiour Iesus Christ; is no more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with them in idolatrie, then in the action of prayer to kneele, when we direct our prayers to God, and not to Angels or Saints, or other creatures. For example, To kneele, and say the Lords Prayer in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Saints, and to offer it as a libell of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to be presented, and commended by their prayers to God, which Papists professe themselues to doe, (<hi>Costeri Enchiridion de veneratione Sanctorum,</hi>) is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; yet to kneele, and offer that prayer to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as wee doe, is not idolatrie: although both in the gesture of kneeling, and in the substance of the prayer, there bee a conformitie, our Faith and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being contrarie to theirs, freeth vs of all shew of conformity with them in superstition and idolatry. But the Lord forbade his people (yee say) to be like the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, yet did he neuer forbid them to knele, and lift vp their hands to him in their prayers, although the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles kneeled, and lifted vp hands vnto their gods when they prayed. The things wherein God forbade his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a conformity, were vncleannesse, idolatry, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, witchcraft, &amp;c. and not such ceremonies of diuine worship, as are by himselfe commanded, yet abused by Idolaters. And where yee say, that Christians were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to rest those dayes, on which the Pagans rested, I hope yee will not haue vs to worke on the Lords day, because the Papists rest that day. Finally, when yee say, that the life of Popish idolatrie consisteth in kneeling,

yee speake falsely; for the life of their idolatrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in a professed adoration of the bread, with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Transubstantiation, and not in the outward gesture of kneeling, which being lawfull, and religious in it selfe, is onely abused by them to idolatrie. And doe not all they who sitte at the Sacrament, keepe an outward conformitie with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who will needs sitte, to declare, that they esteeme Christ Iesus to bee onely a meere man? By your argument, all they are transgressours of the first Commandement, that communicate with them in sitting. Now to that which yee adde in the end, that this outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie tickles the Papist, and offends the godly: yee are greatly mistaken; it is your contentious opposition against the truth, and disobedience of the lawfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church, which tickles the Papist, and grieues all good men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not our conformitie, in a lawfull and religious ceremonie.</p>

                  <p>You make the third breach of the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement by kneeling, the retaining of a monument of vile idolatrie; and in this yee erre, for kneeling is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony appointed by God himselfe to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in all actions of adoration, and was not of humane inuention; therefore cannot be a monument of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in this or any other act. If it be abused to idolatry, although abuse the thereof should bee abhorred, yet the religious gesture it selfe, is not to be detested. Let the theefe bee hanged, and the whoore drowned, yet the religious ceremony must bee restored to the right owner, to whom all knees should bow. The burning of Incense was a part of the ceremoniall worship vnder the Law, and abused to idolatrie, when it was offered to the brazen Serpent; yet that part of worship was not abolished, but the Idoll it selfe destroyed, and the ceremony restored to God, vnto whom of right it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. Neither hath your comparison of the brazen Serpent, and kneeling, any force in it; for the brazen Serpent, in the time it was abolished, had no vse: that ceased with the vertue of the cure, that the Israelites receiued by looking vpon it; the act of kneeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth alwayes in a necessary vse, for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of our thankfulnesse to God. And where you say, that kneeling from the first birth in this act, hath been dedicated to idolatrie, I flatly deny it: for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it <hi>Honorius</hi> a foure hundreth yeares since, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, was the man that decreede kneeling to bee vsed in the eleuation, and circumgestation of the Hoste; yet it was not he, that brought in that gesture at the time of participation.

                     </gap>o knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling directed to the bread at the eleuation, &amp;c. was not a prophanation of it at the Sacrament, but a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it in a superstitious, and idolatrous worship. In respect of this, <hi>Caluine</hi> and some other recent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, haue disliked it; and yet they say, if kneeling in the action of the Supper, did not rest in the Elements, but were directed to Christ sitting in heauen, the same were a lawfull sort of adoration. This <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> said, whose words are <hi>Neque externa adoratio esset mala, multi enim piè genua flectunt, &amp; adorant,</hi> that is to say, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adoration in that case, were not euill, for many piously bow their knees, and adore. <hi>Beza</hi> in his twelfth Epistle, saith, That the bowing of the knee at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Elements, is a sort of holy and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reuerence, <hi>Ac proindè olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari,</hi> that is, of old, it might haue been vsed profitably. That testimony which you cite out of the eight Epistle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your custome, yee corrupt, to make it serue your purpose: for <hi>Beza</hi> commending them that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished kneeling at the receiuing of the Sacrament, saith not, <hi>tanquam apertas idolomanias,</hi> but <hi>non minus quam aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas idolomanias,</hi> and so distinguisheth it from idolatrie: like as a little before in the same Epistle, he saith, That this gesture of kneeling being considered in it selfe, is not impious; and in his twelfth Epistle speaking of the same matter, he hath these words, <hi>Interim tamen cum ista per se non sint idololatrica, idem de illis, quod de proximè praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus sentimus.</hi> So we haue <hi>Caluine, Martyr</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> all of them contradictors to you in this, that kneeling at the Sacrament is a monument of vile idolatry. Where I marke further, that in <hi>Beza</hi> his iudgement, kneeling was not at the first birth, in this act, dedicated to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for he saith of it, <hi>quòd olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari,</hi>

                  <p>To this I answere, that wee must consider the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie it selfe, whether it bee of humane or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine institution; if it bee of humane institution, it may be remooued, such as is the crossing of the bread and cuppe in the Sacrament: But if the ceremony bee of diuine institution, such as kneeling is, for the same is commended by God vnto vs in his Word: then wee ought to consider, whether the abuse of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie hath proceeded from the nature of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein it was vsed: for if it bee so, it ought to be abolished in that action, because it can neuer bee purged from the spotte which it contracteth by the action; and in such a case, the action and gesture ought both to bee abolished. But if the abuse proceede not from the nature of the action, but from the opinion of the agent; then the opinion being remoued, the religious ceremonie may bee vsed without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of idolatrie: for example, The abuse of kneeling in eleuation, &amp;c. proceeded not onely from the opinion of the agent, but from the nature of the

action, which is idolatrous and superstitious: kneeling in this action cannot be purged from the contagion of idolatry, because of the relation it hath to the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous action: and therefore both the action and the gesture ought to bee abolished. But the Sacrament of the Supper being an action instituted by GOD, and kneeling being of the owne nature an holy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony, it can neuer receiue contagion of idolatrie from it, but onely from the opinion of the agent: then remooue the opinion, both the action it selfe may bee rightly vsed, and kneeling therein, as being very agreeable to the nature of the action.

                  <p>Your fourth breach is the occasion and danger of idolatry. But kneeling imports no more danger, nor occasion of idolatry, then sitting doth of prophanation and contempt of the Sacrament: and with vs there be many moe prophane Christians, then idolatrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; and people are farre more ready by sitting to take occasion of despising the Sacrament, their senses

leading them to esteeme basely of it, then by kneeling, to thinke the bread and wine to be the body and blood of Christ materially; the same being against sense and reason, and the doctrine of the Word, which teacheth them the contrary. The Virgins in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, by walking and talking, and lying with yong men, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues to vncleannesse, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, gaue place to the Diuell; but the lawfull vse of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremony, can neuer be the occasion of idolatrie, nor can the vse of it giue place to the Diuell: <hi>Res bonae neminem scandalizant,</hi> saith TERTVLLIAN <hi>de velan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Virginibus, nisi malam mentem.</hi> That is, good things giue offence to none, but an euill minde.

As to the feare of Bread-worship, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be caused by the religious vse of kneeling, but by some peruerse disposition of the Receiuer, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can remedie sufficiently, but right information made by sound doctrine. It is true, that to the vncleane, all things are vncleane: a soule that is euill disposed, may like a Spider conuert into poyson the iuyce of the same flower which the Bee turneth into hony: out of the sacramentall Word, <hi>This is my body, which is broken for you,</hi> the Papist draweth the poyson of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation; but the true Christian, the sweet and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9002:146"/>
participation of the body of our Lord. The word giues not to the Papist an occasion of his errour, but he takes occasion at the Word, because of the peruerse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his minde; so kneeling being a religious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, and commanded by God, when it is lawfully vsed at the receiuing of the Sacrament, can neuer giue occasion of Bread-worship, although superstitious men hauing corrupted their mindes, may make it an occasion of that, and worse. The gesture of sitting is at this day abused by <hi>Arrians,</hi> and made a signe of their deniall of the God-head of Christ; and prophane Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians haue taken, and daily take occasion thereby, to fall into the pit of contempt, and prophanation of this Sacrament, from which inconuenience, no ceremonies that can be chosen, will preserue them, except they be warned daily, and directed by the Word how to carry themselues; and if we neglect this, committing their safetie to the ceremonies of sitting, standing, walking, or kneeling, we shall not only bring them to the brinke of danger, but shall drowne them in the depth, either of prophanenesse, or of superstition and idolatry. Now, if you thinke that there is greater danger of idolatrie to be feared from kneeling, then of prophanenesse from sitting, you are much deceiued: for if wee consider the disposition of our people, amongst whom, some I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse haue vnderstanding, &amp; yet are inclined to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; idolatry; the greater company are simple ones, that neuer did, nor euer will, as it is to be supposed, take occasion by kneeling, to thinke the bread the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, or yet to adore it for his body. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was brought in by the Clergie and Scholastickes, wherof the people could neuer haue dreamed, if it had not been daily inculcate into their eares, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded so to thinke, by the false interpretation of the words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The right exposition of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:9002:146"/>
same hath remoued that error, and must still debarre it, not the gesture of sitting; for thereby simple ones are ready, by their owne inclination, to take occasion, as wee haue knowne in time past, of contemning the holy Sacrament, and so from superstition to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a profanation of the Lords Body: from eyther of these extremities no thing can preserue them, but the trauels of a faithfull Pastor, in Catechizing and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. As to men of vnderstanding they are in lesse danger, and howsoeuer they receiue sitting, standing, or kneeling, they know the Elements in the Sacrament to retaine their former substance, and that they are changed in the vse onely. Neither haue such of them, as are inclined to Papistrie, beene conuerted a jot by sitting, from their former errors; but to the contrarie, confirmed in their erronious opinions, disdayning our profession for the irreuerent celebration of the holy Sacrament, If at any time, by the doctrine of truth, they shall be conuerted from their errors, this gesture that is required of kneeling, shall bee a meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them in a constant profession; and as I haue sayd, keepe them also from the other extremitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

But you labour to proue, that the ancient Church did not practise it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for yee say, that when the <hi>Arrians</hi> denyed Christs true diuinitie, the Orthodoxe Church, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his diuinitie, kneeled not in the act of receiuing, which had beene expedient, if the same had beene lawfull: vnto which I answere, That there be many things expedient to be done, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding are not done, nor ought to be done; not because they are vnlawfull in themselues, but for some other respect, as some custome receiued, or some order formerly established, which vpon euery appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant expedience is not to be altered: for example, It was expedient, because of the same heresie, to haue kneeled at all times, when publike prayers were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Christ, or to the Father in his name: yet on the Lords day, which was the most solemne time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the ancient Church kneeled not at publike prayer; not because it was vnlawfull in it selfe to haue knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but because there was an order receiued in the Church, that on the Lords day the people should stand and not kneele.</p>
                  <p>Next, when yee say, that the ancient Church did not kneele at the receiuing of the Sacrament, and will prooue it by this, that it was the custome of the Church to stand in the time of publike prayer all the Lords dayes in the yeere, and on euery day from Easter to Pentecost, because of the ioyfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Christs resurrection: for, say yee, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being a matter of great ioy, far lesse would they

So it is not the nature of the action that will enforce the gesture of standing to haue been vsed in the Sacrament rather then at prayer, but the custome and order of the Church only; which if ye were able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9002:150"/>
as well for standing at the Sacrament, as at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lords day, your argument were strong: but that yee shall neuer doe, except ye grant according to the truth, that the Sacrament is an act of reall ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In that case <hi>Tertullians</hi> testimony, which you cite, would aduance your cause mightily, who sayes, <hi>De geniculis adorare nefas ducimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two or three testimonies of <hi>Eusebius, Chrysostome,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for standing on the Lords day at the Table, or Altar, when the Sacrament was receiued, will not proue a constant and vniuersall practise of that gesture. Neyther is the example of the <hi>Abissines,</hi> and <hi>Muscouites,</hi> who stand to this day, able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyse the practise of the vniuersall Church, for the space of foure or fiue hundred yeeres preceding their dayes, wherein they kneeled at the receiuing. Nor are you able to prooue, that the gesture of kneeling was brought into the Church by the error of Transsubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as ye confidently affirme in the last line of this Section. For <hi>Honorius,</hi> as wee sayd before, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree kneeling to bee vsed at the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but at the eleuation and circumgestation which was a superstitious and idolatrous worshippe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by man. And it is euident, at the time when that Decree was made, the people were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to kneele at the receiuing; and if it had not beene the custome, there is no question, but the same would haue beene straitly enioyned by the same Decree. But it is playne, that before that time, as euer since, this gesture is continued in the Church: for as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> vpon the 98. <hi>Psalme,</hi> testifies, No man doeth worthily receiue, but hee that adores. And in the same places hee saith, <hi>Non peccatur adorando carnem Christi, sed peccatur non adorando</hi>: that is, Wee sinne not in adoring Christs body in the Sacrament; but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9002:151"/>
we sinne, if wee adore it not. And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in one of his Homilies hath these words, <hi>Ergo adora, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica</hi>: that is, Adore then, and communicate, but vnto these, and the rest of the testimonies, yee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, That it followeth not, because they adored, that therefore they kneeled, because (say yee) their testimonies make mention of adoration, not of the Sacrament, but of Christ in the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wee say the same, that at the Sacrament Christ only is to be adored, and not the sacramentall Elements, which are the signes. So in this wee agree; but because that maketh nothing against kneeling, yee subioyne, that their testimonies are to bee vnderstood of spirituall and internall adoration; and to confirme it, yee quote in the Margine <hi>D. Fulke,</hi> vpon the first to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. But let the Reader peruse the place, he shall finde nothing in it against the gesture of kneeling, or any other religious signe of adoration; onely hee saith, that adoration, mentioned by the Fathers, is to be vnderstood of the spirituall adoration of Christ, and not of the externall adoration of the Sacrament. And if hee had meant otherwise, <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> words in the 24. Homilie, vpon the first to the <hi>Corinths, Cap.</hi> 10. cited by himselfe, would haue controlled his saying: <hi>Hoc corpus, etiam iacens in praesepi, reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let vs therefore (sayeth hee) that are Citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen imitate these Barbarians. Thus farre <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</hi> Now to imitate them, is not to come with inward reuerence onely, but to shew it also in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9002:151"/>
gesture; for of them the Scripture saith, <hi>That falling downe, they adored</hi> CHRIST. And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the words following, that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> meanes not of the inward adoration onely, but also of the outward; <hi>Non solum hoc ipsum corpus vides, sicut illi, &amp;c.</hi> Thou doest not onely see the same body as they did, but thou knowest both his power, and dispensation, and thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t ignorant of no thing done by him, as being exactly and accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imitated in all mysteries. Let vs therefore stirre vp our selues with feare, <hi>Et longe maiorem quàm illi Barbari ostendamus reuerentiam</hi>: that is, Let vs shew foorth much more reuerence then these <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The word, <hi>Ostendamus,</hi> manifestly shewes that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> exhorteth his people not to the inward adoration of Christ onely at the Sacrament, but to the externall also. The practise of all Churches since the dayes of Christ confirmeth the same: for there was neuer any Church, wherein the Sacrament was receiued without some externall signe and gesture of adoration. To stand before the Lord in a solemne act of diuine worshippe, is a gesture of adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as yee obserued before out of <hi>Drusius</hi> in the 51. <hi>Page</hi> of this Pamphlet, standing is taken for prayer, because it was the vsuall gesture at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

And as in these actions, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of the head is a signe of adoration, so is it in the receiuing of the Communion; and was so euen when wee did sit at the receiuing: for the reuerence of the bare head was not giuen at that time to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Minister, nor to the externall Elements, but to

So sitting was neuer in vse by your owne argument. As to the gesture vsed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Paschall Supper, which yee affirme was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at the institution of the Sacrament, it was not sitting at a Table vpon fourmes or chaires, but lying, and leaning vpon beds: and it is vncertain, as I shewed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9002:152"/>
before, whether that gesture was continued or not; and albeit it had beene continued, there was neuer Church or Diuine, that thought it exemplary; for if they had done, they would neuer haue vsed standing, or passing, or kneeling in stead of it.</p>
                  <p>If we might bee bold to coniecture, with what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture the Apostles receiued the Sacrament, as yee are bold to affirme that they sate; or what gesture Christ would haue vs to obserue; it were doubtlesse surest to thinke, that the Apostles receiued with that same ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which they vsed at the thanksgiuing and blessing, wherewith the Institution begins: and therefore that the gesture, which the Church thinketh most meet to be vsed at the thankesgiuing, is the gesture fittest for the people to receiue; because the action it selfe is a reall thankesgiuing, and should haue conioyned with it, the thankesgiuing and blessing, wherewith the action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes in the minde and affection of the receiuers: and because euer since the first Institution, wee finde the Church to haue vsed the same gesture at the receiuing, that they vsed at the thankesgiuing and prayer. For when for the space of a thousand yeeres, they stood and prayed, as you your selfe affirme, and so doth your namelesse Master of table gesture; then they stood, and receiued the Sacrament: and after that, when on the Lords day, the Church began, in stead of standing, to vse kneeling at prayer, they began also to receiue the Sacrament kneeling, which forme of receiuing hath continued to our times.</p>
                  <p>But to returne againe to your argument, where yee say, that the proofes made for standing doe euince, that for the space of a thousand yeeres kneeling had no place, I will let you see how futile your argument i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apostles receiued with the same gesture, which they vsed at the thankesgiuing. This yee cannot denie, except yee ouerthrow all the grounds that yee laid, for the example and precept of Christ to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.

In our neghbour Church, some of their defenders of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, will not haue vs inquisitiue of the maner of Christs presence in the Sacrament. And the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> commends the simplicity of the Ancients, which dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, whether Christ was present, <hi>con, sub, in,</hi> or <hi>trans</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this Supper. <hi>Sutton</hi> in his Appendix to his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Lords Supper, condemnes likewise this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search of the maner of Christs presence. If the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Christs presence be not determined, there can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise no other, but a confused worship, of such a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9002:154"/>
and determinate presence. The Papists acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there ought to be no adoration, but where there is acknowledged a bodily presence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence it is, that they proue mutually the one by the other.</p>
                  <p>It will not follow, that we may change sitting into kneeling, because the ancient Church, and some Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, haue changed sitting into standing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause kneeling maketh so many breaches, both in the Institution, and in the second Commandement, and is no wayes a table gesture. By standing, we accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date our selues to a table, to participate of the dainties set thereon: standing was neuer abused to idolatrie, as kneeling hath been; we are not bound to imitate other Churches further, then they imitate Christ. Our sitting is not Scottish Geneuating, but a commendable imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Apostolicall Churches, and obedience to Christs Institution.</p>

And seeing the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed soules shall not be clothed with their bodies before the Resurrection, how can they conclude materiall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculation of the blessed Saints in heauen? All creatures in heauen, in earth, or vnder the earth, are said to bow their knee at the name of Iesus, that is, to acknowledge his Soueraigne authority, howbeit the celestial Angels, blessed soules, and infernall spirits, haue not knees to bow with. The euerlasting felicity of the children of God, is the Supper of glory; Doe they drinke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of that felicity vpon their knees?

                  <p>To proue that kneeling is not practised in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, yee cut off in the beginning from their number the Lutherans, because they acknowledge the Reall presence by way of Consubstantiation. This I grant is an error, yet is it not directly fundamentall. They abhorre, as we doe, the Bread-worship, and they worship Christ in the Sacrament, as we should do; their errour is onely in the manner of his presence, which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should not debarre them from the Communion of the Reformed Churches: with them yee reckon the Church of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> because in their Confession exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Ferdinand, anno</hi> 1535. they say, <hi>Ministri ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò coenae Dominicae,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Ministers when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the words of the Lords Supper, exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this faith, that they may beleeue the body of Christ to be present there. By this yee conclude, that some of them held the errour of Reall presence in the Sacrament; and yet their Confession mentioneth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reall, nor corporall, nor locall presence. And it is no errour to beleeue the presence of Christs body in the Sacrament after some manner; as to beleeue that it is there <hi>obiectiue,</hi> that is, as the reall obiect, whereupon we must fixe and fasten our Faith: and to beleeue that it is there <hi>virtute, &amp; efficacia,</hi> in vertue, and efficacie, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and strengthen vs in newnesse of life heere, and

The Diuinitie is euer, and euery where clothed with the humanitie, wherein it dwelleth bodily, and ought to be considered so in all actions of diuine worship: and the Humanity is euer, and euery where conioyned with the Diuinitie, albeit the same be not <hi>extensiue,</hi> or <hi>diffuse,</hi> as the <hi>Vb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>quetars</hi> hold, through euery place with the Diuinitie: As by example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a man is personally present, there his head, his body, &amp; all his members are present, albeit the foot or the hand be not in the place where the head is, yet they are coniunctly present with the head, where the person is; and so as Christ is personally present at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so is his Diuinitie and Humanity coniunctly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Person. That to conclude, it is no errour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Confession aboue expressed, to beleeue the spirituall, powerfull, and personall presence of Christs bodie at the Sacrament, and in that respect to worship his flesh and blood there: yea, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, That it is sinne, not to worship his flesh there. But you must be excused to exclude all from your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that beleeue any such thing, because yee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied before, that the Sacrament hath such a promise, and presence of Christ, as the Temple or Arke had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>pag.</hi> 51.

vp men to adore the Principall, that is, Christ: And so yee doe acknowledge, that they are ordered of God to be signes only, and seales of his graces, without any promise, power, vertue, or presence of the bodie of Christ; that is the opinion of the Anabaptists. If these be they, whom yee call the purer sort amongst the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi> I know not; this I know, that the <hi>Polonian</hi> Church esteemes them Arrians, who sitte at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom I hope yee will not repute to be the purer sort, or reckon amongst the Reformed. Thirdly, if yee debar from the communion of the well reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all who are of the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> and <hi>Suttons</hi> minde, who commend their simplicitie, that beleeue Christs presence, and are not inquisitiue of the maner, but professe with <hi>Durandus,</hi> saying, <hi>modum nescimus, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiam credimus</hi>; then shall yee excommunicate from your societie, all that preferre the peace of the Church, to the loue of contention and curious disputes, that haue disquieted the Church, rent the body therof a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and diuided the same in factions.</p>
                  <p>Where yee say, that if the maner of Christs presence be not determined, there can arise no other but a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed worship of such a confused, and indetermined pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: your allegation is but rash and prophane. Can yee determine the maner of Christs presence in heauen particularly? or the manner of God the Father his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in heauen and earth, albeit we beleeue that God is in essence and power euery where, and that Christ is bodily in the heauens? These determinations are but generall, and confused notions; yet God forbid wee should say as yee doe, that the presence of the Father and the Sonne in heauen, and in earth, are confused, or that the worship is confused, that is giuen thereto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>As to the Papists, who acknowledge (as yee say) that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9002:156"/>
there ought to be no adoration, but where there is a bodily presence acknowledged in the Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yee be of the same minde, and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all adoration of Christ in the Sacrament, yet we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But if by the reformed Churches, yee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those, who distinguish betweene the signes and the things signified, giuing to the signes the reuerence due to them, and adoring onely the thing signified, to wit, the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament of these, some, I confesse, do erre in esteeming Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bee really and locally present: and yet, seeing they agree with vs in the chiefe and principall grounds of Religion, wee must not excommunicate them from the number of the reformed. But let vs lay aside these, whom yee call <hi>Vbiquetars:</hi> If yee hold the rest for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that are in <hi>Germanie, Polonia, Bohemia, Hungaria, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and great <hi>Britaine,</hi> with the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi>; for one that sitteth at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament in all these Churches, they are an hundred that kneele.</p>

Next, that standing hath neuer beene abused to idolatry, as kneeling hath bin: but these abuses are friuolous, and nothing worth; for in the Church of <hi>France,</hi> where they receiue stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they doe no more accommodate themselues to a table, then they who kneele; for neither doe they reach their hand to the table, to take any thing to themselues therefrom, receiuing all from the hand of the Minister; nor doe they stand socially, as yee will haue sitting to be vsed for society and familiar entertainment; but first one or two commeth, and hauing receiued, they passe to giue place to others. Secondly, yee forget, or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now to conclude: When all your reasons and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses shall be considered by the iudicious Reader, he shall finde, that they all tend to the contempt of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to leade men to a prophane estimation thereof: For first, yee maintaine, that it is to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with no other gesture then a common banquet for bodily repast. Secondly, that it is not <hi>in statu ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodato ad adorandum:</hi> that is to say, That it is not a signe or middest appointed to stirre vp the receiuers to worshippe their Sauiour. Thirdly, that Christ is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not present in the Sacrament at all, or that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not to bee esteemed present after any manner. Fourthly, that at the Sacrament neither his person, nor his body and bloud: that is, neither the giuer, nor the gift is to be adored. Finally, that all, who at the Sacrament adore him by bowing of their knees, are Idolaters, breakers of the second Commandement, and violators of the Institution. These are assertions very contrarious to the iudgement of the Primitiue Church, touching the Sacrament, which of all the parts of Gods worshippe, they esteemed the most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall; as <hi>Casaubone</hi> obserues out of the Ancients in his 16. <hi>Exercit.

sound, nor were censures put in execution against preaching, prayers, and other holy exercises in these dayes: for, at that time, the Preachers gaue all obedience to the acts of the Church made concerning these things. But doe yee not see, by the regraite made at this Assembly, and by the acts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ordinances by your selfe rehearsed, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayning from preaching, and reading at these times, hath not remoued from people their superstitious opinions of the times, nor yet abolished the enormities, and abuses commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them? Certainly, nothing is so powerfull to abolish prophanenesse, and roote out superstition of mens hearts, as the exercise of diuine worship in preaching, praying, and thanksgiuing, chiefly then, when the superstitious conceits of merit, and necessitie are most pregnant in the heads of people, as doubtlesse they are, when the set times of these solemnities returne: for then it is meetest to lance the opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme, when it is ripe. Vpon these and such other reasons, it pleased his Maiestie to require, and our Church to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, that commemoration of the benefits purchased to vs by the Natiuitie, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Sauiour, should be made solemnely on these dayes according to the practise of all other reformed Churches. And there is no question, the errours of the multitude, shall hereby, bee farre more easily remoued, then by any prohibition, that can be made to the contrary; and therewithall the people better instructed in the principall grounds of Religion, then they could by occasionall Doctrine: as also, the honour of God more highly aduanced, for wee know, that ordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices are performed with lesse regard, and more coldly, then these which come more rarely to bee celebrated. Of all these, the hope is the greater, that now (wee owe it to our King, vnder God) the Churches are planted with able and sufficient Pastors, meete to discharge these duties. So by the Assembly at Perth there is nothing concluded either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious to any former constitution of the Church, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sound Doctrine, deliuered from Pulpits in former times.

Prayses set forth with chearfull alacritie of minde: Delight expressed by charitable largenesse, more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bountie; and sequestration from ordinary labours. By these descriptions wee may see, that the Sabbath day is not properly a festiuall day. The ordinary Sabbath is weekely: The festiuall is Anniuersary. Wee may fast vpon the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath, but wee cannot fast and mourne vpon a festiuall day, &amp;c. Vpon the ordinary Sabbath all the parts of Gods worship may bee performed: Vpon festiuall dayes proper Texts, Epistles, Gospels, Homilies, and Sermons, are framed for the mysterie of that day. So that the ordinary Sabbath is morall, and for the worship of God in generall, the festiuall is mysticall. <hi>Essentialia festi</hi>; the essentiall parts of a festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day are cessation from worke, hearing of the Word, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sacraments: commemoration of diuine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries may be performed vpon the ordinary Sabbath, but to make vp a festiuall day, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> requires a determination of day, signification, and representation of the mysteries wrought on such dayes.</p>

                  <p>The description made by <hi>Piscator,</hi> is proper onely to the festiuall dayes prescribed in Gods Word. <hi>Hookers</hi> is more large, and may bee applyed to the Ecclesiasticall Festiuities. The Iewish Sabbath, according to these descriptions, is not properly festiuall, yet the Lords day was esteemed such by the primitiue Church and ancient Diuines, who held it not lawfull for Christians to fast thereon. Proper Texts, Epistles, Gospels, &amp;c. are not to bee framed for the mysterie of the festiuall day, as yee say, but for the benefit and diuine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed to be remembred thereon. If by the ordinary Sabbath yee vnderstand the Iewish Sabbath, it was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly morall, but mysticall, as their festiuall dayes were: and if by festiuall dayes yee vnderstand the dayes obserued in the Christian Orthodoxe Church, we deny them to be mysticall.

from worke to be an essentiall part of the worship, but only concomitant and consequent thereto, because it cannot be commodiously performed without cessation from other businesse. As to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, himselfe professes, that it is contrarie to the iudgement of our Diuines. For they hold, as wee doe, that our Festiuall dayes are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for signification and representation of our mysteries, or memorable workes wrought on these dayes, or as a part of diuine worship; but for order and policie, as meete and commodious circumstances for commemoration of the workes and benefits of God thereon, <hi>Bellar. de cultu San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</p>

                     <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe.</hi> These words are either a command to doe the workes of our calling, as many both Iewish and Christian Diuines doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret: or else a permission, as others doe interpret: If they contayne a command, no countermand may take it away. If a permission, no humane authority may spoyle men of the libertie, that God hath granted vnto them, as long as they haue any manner of worke to doe, for the sustentation of this life. The Muscouites therefore say very well, that it is for Lords to keepe Feasts, and abstaine from labour.

                  <p>Whether the words of the command, bee preceptine, or permissiue, I will neither curiously, nor contentiously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but it seemes, they are not preceptiue; for if wee were commanded to spend the whole sixe dayes in seruile labour, then times could not bee lawfully appointed for publike Prayers in Cities at morne &amp; at euening: nor ordinary times for preaching on the weeke dayes, or for exercise, or for catechizing; nor times for fasting vpon vrgent occasions without sinne, and breach of the Precept. Next the precept

to the order taken by Superiours for publike actions, that by a mutuall harmonie, the weale of the whole bodie both temporall and spirituall may be procured. Otherwise if by this permission the libertie were granted to euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which you imagine, to attend his own businesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of order, or subiection to policie, there could be nothing but confusion amongst men. The generall libertie granted to men touching the vse of times, meats, clothing, talking, sleeping, watching, &amp;c. takes not away the power of Ciuil &amp; Ecclesiastick Gouernors, to set down Constitutions &amp; Canons touching the Dispensation of these things for the weale of the Countrey. Neither doe the Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances touching this Dispensation spoyle men of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but directs them how to vse it profitably and well. The Act therefore of Councell and Proclamation made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, commanding cessation and abstinence from all han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-worke vpon the fiue dayes, that euery one may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attend the holy exercises appointed for these times, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee called a spoliation of the libertie which God hath giuen to men for labour; seeing, as hath beene said, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is not absolute, but subiect vnto order. Moreouer, if we consider the matter it selfe, this which yee say, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be a manifest calumnie: For, if vnder the Law, God did not spoyle his people of libertie, when hee appointed them to rest two dayes at Pasche, one at Whitsonday, one at the Feast of Trumpets, one at the Feast of Expiation, and two at the Feast of Tabernacles; how can the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and the Church be esteemed to spoyle vs of our libertie, that command a cessation from labour vpon three dayes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout the whole yeere? for two of the dayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to wit, Easter, and Whitsonday, are Sondayes. Last of all, he cannot be said to bee spoyled properly, that makes a profitable interchange without any losse; but he that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the exercises of the body, which are little worth, with the exercises of Pietie which is profitable to all things, makes a profitable change without losse: therefore hee who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9002:167"/>
makes this change according to the Proclamation, is not spoyled of his liberty, but maketh vantage by the right vse thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here it shall not bee amisse to recite <hi>Zanchius</hi> opinion in this purpose, who defending their opinion, that esteeme the words to contayne a command, moues a doubt, and answers it after this manner, <hi>Verùm enimuerò videtur cum hac sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia pugnare, &amp;c.</hi> That is, But this fights against their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that hold the words to be a command, that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lawfull to Gods people to assemble themselues on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes beside the Sabbath, to heare Gods Word, to bee present at Prayers, to offer Sacrifices, and such other things belonging to outward worship, which farre lesse can bee denyed to vs: and therefore beside the Lords Day, other dayes are instituted in the Church, <hi>ad feriandum ab operibus seruilibus:</hi> to rest from seruile workes, if not for the whole day, yet for the morning time. He answeres, <hi>Facilis est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conciliatio: sicut opera diuini cultus praeponenda sunt operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus seruilibus, ita haec sunt omittenda, quando illis vacandum est, &amp;c.</hi> that is, These things may be easily reconciled: as the workes of Gods worship are to bee preferred to seruile workes, so these must be omitted, when those are to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And a little after, We sinne not against this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, sayes hee, when wee ceasse from our seruile labour, to waite on Gods worship, <hi>quoties ordo Ecclesiae, aut necessitas postulat,</hi> so often, as the order of the Church, and necessitie requires. This is <hi>Zanchius</hi> iudgement vpon the fourth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Law, in the sixe hundred sixty two page of that Worke. And if a precept cannot impede the appointing of solemne times for the worship of God, farre lesse can a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
                  <p>The Muscouites saying, that it is for Lords to make Feasts, and abstaine from labour, is true: yet amongst them Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall Dayes are obserued. That the Citizens after diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice on these Dayes, betake themselues to their labour, wee doe not reproue, because it is agreeable to their policie.</p>

                  <p>I answere, Although the circumstance of Time, whereon the Anniuersary commemoration is made, differs not in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, or any mysticke signification from the weekly dayes of preaching, yet it differres in frequency and raritie, for the dayes of weekely preaching doe returne; and to astrict the Husband-man to leaue his plough so often, were against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and charitie.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the times of these commemorations being so rare, to wit, three seruile dayes onely in the yeare, and the exercise so profitable, Reason would, if the Husband-man willingly did not leaue his plough at these times, that by authoritie he should be forced, aswell for his owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as for eschuing scandall and contempt. And Master <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> had reason to curse these, who for contempt, and with offence of their Brethren absented themselues from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Christs Natiuitie. Lastly, the difference of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice on these dayes, from the weekely and ordinary, makes them not to differ in holinesse or mysterie from the weekely dayes, more then the difference in seruice, which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the fift of <hi>August,</hi> and fift of <hi>Nouember,</hi> makes these two dayes to bee mysticke, or more holy then other times.</p>

                  <p>To make solemne commemoration of Christs Natiuitie, vpon any other day then vpon the putatiue day of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, would be thought a great absurditie.</p>

                  <p>If yee haue not fallen into this absurditie, yee must grant,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9002:172"/>
that yee neuer made in your time any solemne commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Natiuitie. And, I verily beleeue, that in this omission yee haue many companions; by whose negligence God hath beene defrauded of the honour due to him for this benefit, and the people lacked instruction in a principall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. This Article is the ground of all the rest: for as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayes, If our Sauiour had not beene borne, he had neither suffered, nor risen againe from the dead; and thereupon he calls the day of this commemoration, <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polim omnium Festorum.</hi> Euen for this it was expedient, that a certayne time of the yeare should haue beene appointed for this commemoration, which otherwise would haue been neglected, and, as yee say, thought absurd.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to your Argument, The commemoration of Christs Natiuity, is no more astricted to the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> then to any other time: for although the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> by ordinance of the Church, bee dedicated to that religious seruice, yet the seruice is not astricted to the time, as the seruice of the Iewish festiuities, which lawfully might not be performed on any other dayes then the festiuall. The commemoration appointed by our Church to bee made on these fiue dayes, may lawfully be performed at other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times, although on these dayes the same must not bee omitted. For the seruice, ar I haue said, is not appointed for the Time, but the Time is appointed for the worship. So it is not absurd to remember Christs Natiuitie so oft as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered with all conuenient solemnitie, as it may serue to his honour, and the edification of the Church. Thus wee haue seene, that according to the Doctrine of the reformed Churches, Anniuersarie dayes are and may bee obserued, though not for any mysterie or holinesse that is in them, more then in other dayes, but for order and policy onely. Against this, all the Reasons, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or yee haue brought, or can inuent, shall neuer preuaile more, then the barking of a dogge, against the Moone.</p>

The instinct of nature, and that command out of <hi>Ioel,</hi> is a generall warrant onely: The particular calamitie or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, wherefore a fast, or feast should be proclaymed, is not expressed, neither is the time particularly determined, whereupon the solemne festiuitie, or fast, should be kept, but the one is left to the estimation, and the other, to the determination of the Church. So by that warrant, libertie is giuen to the Church to consider, and define the causes, for the which a fast should bee proclaymed, and to determine the time, when the same should be obserued; and to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that time from common businesse, and consecrate the same to the spirituall exercise of preaching, hearing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fasting, &amp;c. as our Church hath vsed to doe very often.

to appoint occasionall fasts, or festiuities, may not shee for constant, and eternall blessings, which doe infinitely excell all occasionall benefits, appoint ordinary times of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, and thanksgiuing? Ye say that this hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but yee speake without warrant: for there is as great warrant to appoint such dayes, as is for any other point of Ecclesiasticall policie, touching the determination of times, places, formes, and order to be obserued in the worship of God, according to these generall g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The whole policie of our Church touching the vse of these circumstantiall things is ordered by these rules, and according to these did our Church in the first booke of Discipline which yee cite often, ordayne for the purpose now in hand, <hi>That in euery notable Towne a day beside the Sonday should bee appointed weekely for Sermon: that during the time of Sermon the day should be kept free from all exercise of labour, as well by the Master, as by the seruant. That euery day, there be either Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or prayers, with reading of the Scriptures. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme be orderly ministred, either on the Sonday, or after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the dayes of prayer. That at foure seuerall times of the yeere, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be ministred.</hi> viz. <hi>on the first Sonday of March, on the first Sonday of Iune, first Sonday of September, and the first Sonday of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That in euery towne where Schollers are, and learned men repaire, a certaine day euery weeke be appointed for the exercise of Ministers in prophecie.</hi> And the said booke affirmes, <hi>The dedication of times, and houres for such generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exercises of the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer,</hi> to appertayne to the policie of the Church. If the Church hath power after this manner to appoint times for Doctrine, and diuine Seruice, and Doctrine, and diuine Seruice for times, as the doctrine of the Catechisme on Sonday at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, (reade the 9. Chapter of the said booke) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but the Church hath also power to appoint
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9002:174"/>
a certaine time, day, and houre, for commemoration of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, &amp;c. For what more power had our Church at that time to appoint the Sacrament to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred the first Sondaies of <hi>March, Iune,</hi> &amp;c. then she hath now to appoint a Sermon to be made of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon Easter day, and a Sermon of the sending downe of the holy Ghost vpon Whitsunday? and does not the light of Nature teach vs, that rare and great benefits, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with more then ordinary thankefulnesse? Hereby it is cleere, that it is not the Lords soueraignty onely to make or ordayne a thing to be holy, but it is a prerogatiue, that God also hath giuen to the Christian Church. But to the end, this matter may be fully cleered, it is to be obserued, as we said before, that times are made holy, and places two manner of wayes; so things are made holy, either by some inherent qualitie of holynesse, or by consecration of them to holy vses. After the first manner Angels and men were made holy in the creation, sinners are made holy by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and sanctification of the holy Ghost; and of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, God onely is the author. Next, things are made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by consecration of them to holy vses, which vses are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mysticall or politicall. The consecration of things to holy mysticall vses, as of water in Baptisme to be a signe of the bloud, and Spirit of Christ; the elements of Bread and Wine in the Supper to be the Sacrament of his Bodie and Bloud; the Sabbath to bee vnto the Iewes a memoriall of the Creation, a type of signification, and a badge of their profession; the Temple, the Altars, the Sacrifices, and Priests, to bee shaddowes of things to come: all these, and such like are made, and ordayned holy by God; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of things to holy vses for policie, as for maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion, or for order, and decency to be obserued in the worship of God, is not onely Gods prerogatiue, but a priuiledge, and liberty granted by him to the Church; for example, to build, and consecrate places to be Temples, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to bee Hospitals; to giue rent, lands, money, and goods
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9002:174"/>
to the Ministry &amp; poore; to appoint Vessels, Vestures, &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for the publike worship, as Tables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Table-clothes, Napkins, Basens, Cups, and Lauers for the holy Sacraments, these things and the like are made holy by the dedication and consecration of men. After this last manner, the Church hath power to consecrate the fiue Anniuersary dayes to the commemoration of our Sauiour his benefits, to separate them from all other ordinary workes, and so to make them sacred and holy dayes. It was I grant a part of Idolatry to proclaime a holy day vnto the golden Calfe, or to any Idol, or Creature, as ye affirme; but it will not follow that it is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry to proclaime a holy day, for the honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God. And as it was one of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sins, to despise the Festiuities appointed by God for his worship, and instead of these to ordaine a Feast after the deuise of his owne heart, so if we should despise the Lords Sabbath, and instead thereof appoint some other, as the <hi>Machomet</hi> hath done, it were a presumptuous sinne. But this wee are farre from, acknowledging the Lords Day to bee holy by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and appointing the rest to bee kept only for his worship.</p>

                  <p>Againe, where yee say, that these dayes had more then humane warrant, because it is thought that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was the Penman of the Booke of <hi>Esther,</hi> and consequently, a Prophet; and that it appeares that these dayes might not haue beene altered by the Iewish Church, which if they had bin of Ecclesiasticke Constitution, might haue bin done: thoughts, and appearances, are not sure probations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a certaintie as yee doe, of a more then humane war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And if they had receiued from God, any particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection concerning them, the Prophet of God would not haue omitted the same in the Historie. A generall warrant they had, such as the Church must haue for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumstances in the worship of God, as that of the hundred and fifth Psalme, <hi>Giue thankes to the Lord, call on his Name, make knowne his deeds amongst the people.

                     </gap>e was an addition of the Pharisies, who inlarged the glory of this Feast, as they did their Phylacteries; but this is a friuolous conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and the interpretation of <hi>Iunius</hi> words out of the Talmude is no better, to wit, that the Wisemen who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the eighth dayes of that Feast should bee yeerely dayes of ioy, were the Pharisies, because they are called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes Israelis</hi>; for it behoued these that appointed the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuities not onely to bee Wisemen, but men of Authoritie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9002:176"/>
also: And therefore it is more probable, that the Wisemen in the Talmude were the Masters of the great Synagogue, that had power to appoint such Festiuities. But how would our Sauiour, who censured the Pharisies for inlarging their Phylacteries, and corrected the abuses of the Law, brought in by them, haue omitted such a grosse Errour and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Institution and keeping of these holy dayes vnrebuked, if it had beene a Pharisaicall Addition, and not a lawfull Constitution? Then yee teach your Reader a great cunning to play fast and loose, in answering all the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought from the Iewish Church: and that is, whether hee grant, or denie them to bee lawfull, yet to eschew the dint of the Argument; for if hee grant them to bee lawfull, then he may flye to this refuge, that the Iewes had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie directions which wee want; as Prophets who were only Prophets by the Spirit vnto the dayes of <hi>Malachie; Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> vnder the first Temple, and in place thereof vnder the second, a slender voyce sounding from Heauen, called <hi>Bathcoll.</hi> But if hee denie the same to haue beene lawfull, then to alleadge that they were Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Additions, and that wee should not imitate the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies and fond Iewes. I assure my selfe, that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest-hearted man will either follow the Pharisies in their Superstition, nor you in vsing such sophisticall euasions, of which, none will serue against the instances alledged: for if yee say, that the obseruation of the dayes of <hi>Pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So it remaines for any thing ye haue said, that holy dayes were, and might bee lawfully kept, vnder the Law without any particular warrant from God. But put the case, that the same might not haue beene done vnder the Law, it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9002:176"/>
followes not, that the Christian Church hath not libertie to appoint dayes, and times for religious exercises without particular direction. For vnder the Law, God not only set downe the substance of his worship, but all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also, as the persons in particular by whom, the place where, and the times when he should be worshipped, so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as little, or nothing was left to the abitrement of the Iewish Church; and as yee say, these times were so ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, that the greatest part of the externall worship consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in Ceremonies: vnder the Gospell it is not so, for in the Gospell, the substance of these Ceremonies, and of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God is perfectly set downe; but the circumstantiall Ceremonies of time, place, persons, and formes, which are no part of the worship, but pertinences only, are left to bee determined by the Church according to the generall Rules of Order and Decencie. It is true, because the Iewes had one place only appointed by God, for his worship, to wit, the Temple and Tabernacle, whereunto the people could not resort at all times, therefore to their owne election, was permitted the appointing of other commodious places for their Synagogues. And now vnder the Gospell, there is one onely Day of diuine Institution, to wit, the Lords Day, whereunto to tye the worship of God, is a Iudaicall Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie against the Christian libertie and practice. For the time is now come, that from one new Moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come and worship before God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.23. According to the which Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phesie, the Apostolike and Primitiue Church did not only conuene on the Lords Day to worship God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, as they thought commodious to obserue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught often on the Iewish Sabbath, and at Ephesus daily for the space of two yeares, in the Schoole of one <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> testifies, that in some Churches they conuened daily, not onely to preaching, praying, and Lectures, but to the celebration of the Sacrament also. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> in his Epitomie, or Abridgement of Christian Faith, affirmeth, <hi>Apostolos instituisse synaxes,</hi>

                     </note>The obseruation of Anniuersary dayes pertayned to the Ceremoniall Law: but so it is, that the Ceremoniall Law is abolished. Ye confirme the Antecedent, by the reasons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>First, The Anniuersary Dayes were distinguished from the Morall Sabbath: many were the preheminences of the ordinary Sabbath aboue the Anniuersary dayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Apostle cals them <hi>weake, &amp; beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Gal.</hi> 4.9.10. <hi>The elements of the world, Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9002:177"/>
of things to come, Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. The Apostle sayes not the obseruation of Iudaicall dayes, but, <hi>simpliciter,</hi> the obseruation of dayes serued to the people of God for a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall vse and rudiment of Religion. If the obseruation of some anniuersarie dayes was prescribed to the Iewes, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rudiments for their instruction: it followes, that the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes is of it selfe a rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie instruction: Otherwise, the Apostles reason will not hold.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Dayes and Meates are paralelled: therefore, as it is Iudaicall to esteeme some meates cleane, and some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, so to esteeme one day holier then another, is Iudaicall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To substitute other dayes in place of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, as a Christian Pasche, and Whitsonday for the Iewish, is to substitute rudiments to the Iewish, and not to chase them away.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The Iewish anniuersarie dayes were not onely abrogated as shaddowes of things to come, but as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of by gone benefits. In euery respect, all their anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie daies are abolished: Therefore in euery respect, they belong to the Ceremoniall Law.</p>

                  <head>ANS.</head>
                  <p>These arguments yee vse, to prooue the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes to be ceremoniall. I answer them one by one. First, where yee say, that anniuersarie dayes in the Law were distinguished from the morall Sabbath, if ye will of this conclude, that the anniuersarie dayes were not morall, but typicall, I will not deny it. But if yee conclude, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie daies to be therefore simply ceremoniall, I say it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, and that your argument is a caption <hi>à dicto secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, ad dictum simplicitèr.</hi> The obseruation of a weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, amongst the Iewes, was not onely morall, but a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall shadow of things to come: Is the Lords Day then, because it is weekely, not onely morall, but also typicall? But, perhaps, ye reason thus: Anniuersarie dayes are eyther ceremoniall, or morall; but so it is, they are not morall, <hi>ergo.</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9002:178"/>
To this I say, that your diuision is not full nor perfect: for, there be anniuersarie dayes, that are naturall, as the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, and Solstitiall: Others, that are ciuill, as dayes of Markets, and Weapon-shewings, &amp;c. And there be dayes Ecclesiasticall, which are neyther morall, nor mysticall, but meerely circumstantiall to the worship whereunto they are appoynted.</p>
                  <p>To the second I answer, that anniuersarie dayes are not called by the Apostle, Elements, and Rudiments, otherwise then the New-Moones, which are monethly dayes, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths which were weekely dayes: And therefore, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le had called dayes, Shadowes, by reason of their yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuolution, he could not haue concluded, that Sabbaths and New-moones were Shaddowes. It is neither the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor monethly, nor anniuersarie reuolution, that made these dayes ceremoniall; for then ciuill, and naturall, and all kinde of dayes should be ceremoniall; but it was the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall signification which they had, and the ceremoniall worship appropriated vnto them. That the Apostle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the obseruation of these dayes, and not <hi>simpliciter</hi> of dayes, is manifest, both by that which goeth before, vers. 9. and that which followeth, vers. 21. The dayes whereof hee speakes, were Elements of the Law, from the which, that we might be deliuered, Christ was made vnder the Lawe: And the obseruation of these dayes, was a remayning still vnder the seruile yoake of the Law. But, there was neuer man before you, that did thinke the obseruation prohibited for any naturall respect, such as the yeerely, weekely, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly reuolution is; but onely for some legall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or some heathenish superstition. And seeing for these respects onely, the religious obseruation of dayes is dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is a caption <hi>ab accidenti</hi> to conclude, that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of anniuersarie dayes is forbidden.</p>
                  <p>I answer to the third, that to esteeme one day holier, then another, for any inherent holinesse they haue by nature, is superstitious; and to esteeme one day holier then another,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9002:178"/>
for any sacramentall holinesse, that they haue by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is Iudaicall: but, for the vse whereunto the day is applied, as a meete and commodious circumstance, so to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it is no more superstitious and Iudaicall, then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme a Temple holier then a priuate house, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vessels, and clothes that are vsed in the ministration of Sacraments, more holy then other common instruments and vessels. These we call holy, onely by reason of their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a common vse, to a religious. So this argument is a caption <hi>ab homonymia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer to the fourth, That one thing is properly said to be substitute to another, when it is applied to the same vse. Our Pasche, and Pentecost, are neyther applied to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of the deliuerance out of Aegypt, nor testimonies of our thankfulnesse for the First-fruits of the earth, nor to be shaddowes of our spirituall deliuerie to come, and of the First-fruits of the Holy Ghost: neyther doe wee offer the Passeouer, nor the First-fruits, nor any legall sacrifice; and so in no respect are they substitute to these times: but they are dedicated to the commemoration of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghost, not as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, and sacramentall ceremonies, and a part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worshippe, which the Papists esteeme them to be, but as they are fit and meete circumstancess onely for these holy exercises.</p>
                  <p>To the fift and last argument I answer, That the anniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie dayes of the Iewes are abolished in euerie respect, for which by them they were obserued, and so are the weekely and monethly daies: but, as the weekly and monthly course was not the respect for which the Sabbath and New-moons are abolished, no more is the anniuersarie reuolution of the feasts, the respect wherefore they were abrogate, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were shaddowes of things to come, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of temporall benefits, as of their deliuerie out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, which was also typicall. And because they had a legall worship appropriated vnto them, which was likewise cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9002:179"/>
Now to conclude vpon this, that the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes vnder the Gospell, is abolished, is a caption, <hi>à non causa, pro causa:</hi> For the anniuersarie daies kept vnder the Gospell, are not obserued as any part of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship, or as shaddowes of things to come, or as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall signes and Sacraments of by-past, temporall, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall benefits: but they are obserued as commodious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances for the worship appointed to be done on them, to wit, the commemoration of the inestimable benefits of our redemption, which are not temporall, and peculiar to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, or Nation, such as the deliuerance of the Iewes out of Aegypt, and their dwelling in Tents, remembred by their Pasche, and their Feast of Tabernacles; but eternall, and common to all Nations, and People. Neither is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship performed on them legall, and ceremoniall, but euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and spirituall. Thus the obseruation is wholly different. The time is appointed to be obserued, not as a shadow, but as a circumstance onely: the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Theologie of your Preface or Proposition I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9002:179"/>
But I neuer read that God hath made any translation, and denuded himselfe of any prerogatiue in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that belonged to him before in the olde. That which ye subioyne, that Christ and his Spirit hath instituted no other day, but the Lords Day, we freely graunt: for if it were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the fiue dayes had beene instituted by Christ, then we behoued to obserue and esteeme them as necessary parts of Gods worship, and not circumstances determined by the Church, to the worship of God, for order and policie, which we hold with our best Diuines. And therefore wee say in the verie first wordes of our Act, <hi>Wee abhorre the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious obseruation of Festiuall dayes.</hi> This superstitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation is nothing else but an obseruation of them with opinion of necessitie, that is, as necessarie parts of Gods worshippe instituted by Christ. So in this wee agree, yet I doe not allow of the reasons which yee vse, for probation hereof.</p>
                  <p>Your first argument is, If there had beene any other dayes dedicated to Christ, the Apostle spake vnproperly, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, when he said, Hee was rauished in the Spirit vpon the Lords Day. For if there had beene a day for his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and another for his Passion, he should haue said, that he was rauished in the Spirit vpon one of the Lords Dayes. This argument is friuolous. Although all the Festiuall dayes vnder the Law were dedicated to God, and were called Sabbaths, yea sometimes <hi>Sabbath Sabbathôn,</hi> yet none of them is called the Sabbath of IEHOVAH, or the Lords Sabbath; that is reserued to the seuenth day of the Weeke, and the seuenth Yeere, which resembled Gods rest: And although all the Synagogues were Houses dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God, yet the Temple is not called one of Gods Houses, but the House of God; euen so, the Day of Christs resurrection <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the excellencie thereof, is called the Lords Day, albeit other times had beene appoynted for his honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:9002:180"/>Your next Argument is false: in it, yee affirme, That the Apostle condemnes not onely the obseruation of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish dayes, and the Iewish obseruation of the Iewish dayes to a typicall vse: for the conuerted Iewes (yee say) did not obserue them as shadowes of things to come, for then they had denyed Christ: but he condemnes the obseruation of dayes as a Pedagogicall and rudimentarie instruction, not beseeming the Christian Church. But howbeit the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iewes did not obserue the Iewish dayes, as shadowes of things to come, yet they might haue obserued them as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of by-past temporall, and typicall benefits, and for present temporall blessings, as the benefit of their deliuery out of Egypt, and for the Fruits of the earth, which vse was also typicall: Further, they did obserue them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of necessitie, as things instituted by God for his worship, and their saluation, which sort of obseruation was Legall: but this proceeding from infirmitie, and for want of sufficient instruction, was not a denying of Christ, as it had beene, if the same had proceeded from pertinacy, after the knowledge of the Truth receiued. And this was it which the false Apostles vrged vpon the Galatians, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemnes in that Epistle written to them, and not simply the obseruation of any day; for, as after shall bee made manifest, euery obseruation of the Iewish dayes is not damned by the Apostle, who did sometime obserue them in his owne person, after a most lawfull manner. Neither can the obseruation of all dayes bee a Iewish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and rite, and Pedagogicall or rudimentarie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but the obseruation onely of these dayes, which are prescribed in the Law: otherwise the Festiuities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and the festiuall dayes kept by the Heathen, should all bee Iewish Customes and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogicall instructions, which yee will not say, I hope.</p>

Next, the Iudaicall dayes had once that honour,

                  <p>After yee haue vsed two Arguments, to proue, That there is no day of diuine institution, but the Lords Day, a point not controuerted amongst vs, yee labour to answere fiue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, which yee propone against your selfe; and the summe of your answere to the first is this: That the dayes wherewith the Apostle comported, were not the anniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dayes appointed by men, but the Iudaicall dayes, which had once that honour to bee appointed of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be tollerated in the weake Iewes, as long as the Ceremoniall Law, wherein they were commanded, was not buried; the obseruation whereof, notwithstanding, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and reproued in the Galatians.</p>
                  <p>Out of this answere, I forme this Proposition:
<q>All the dayes, whereof the Apostle condemned the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were Iudaicall dayes, prescribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by him in weake Christians, and that once had the honour to be appointed by God himselfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proposition is yours, and is very true. I assume,
<q>But the fiue anniuersarie dayes, appointed by the Assembly of Perth, are not Iudaicall prescribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in weake Christians, and such as had once the honour to be appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Assumption is likewise yours, set downe in the last wordes of your Answere, and is true also. Therefore, I conclude,
<q>That the fiue anniuersarie dayes, are not the dayes, whereof the Apostle condemnes the obseruation: Consequently, hee condemnes not the obseruation of dayes simply, as a Iudaicall Rite and Pedagogicall instruction, contrary to your former Assertion.</q>

                  <p>It is secondly obiected, that seeing the Lords Day was instituted in remembrance of Christs resurrection, the other notable acts of Christ ought likewise to be remembred with their seuerall festiuities. <hi>Ans.</hi> It followes not; that because Christ did institute the remembrance of one benefit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men may institute for other benefits. Secondly, Christs resurrection was a benefit including the rest of his benefits. Thirdly, The Lords Day was not appointed to celebrate the memory of Christs resurrection onely: for then, the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection should bee the proper subiect of Diuine seruice euery Lords Day, and then it were vnlawfull to fast thereupon. Fourthly, It is called the Lords Day, either because the Lord did institute it, as the Communion is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Supper: or else because it was instituted to the Lords honour, and worship, as the Iewish Sabbath is called the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Fiftly, Although it may be applyed to the remembrance of Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeing he rose that day, and in some sort to be a signe of the heauenly rest, yet that is, but <hi>typus communis, &amp; factus,</hi> a common type fitted to resemble such things, not <hi>typus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatus,</hi> that is, appointed by God for that end. Finally, it was appointed for remembrance of all Christs actions, and for his worship in generall; not in a mysticall manner, for the ioyfull remembrance of his resurrection onely. So to diuide Christs actions, and appoint anniuersary &amp; mysticall dayes for their remembrance, is superstitious will-worship, and a Iudaicall addition to Christs institution, in your mind.</p>

Sauiour Iesus Christ also rose againe from the dead the same day. In the iudgement of these Ancients, the Lords Day was not onely instituted for the worship of God in generall, and in that respect called the Lords Day, but because Christ rose vpon that day, and by his resurrection stamped it to bee a memoriall as well of his resurrection, as of the eternall rest whereunto we shall be raised on the last day. In a word, it was not onely instituted for order, and policie, but also for a mysterie; and therein differs from Ecclesiasticall dayes, which are onely appointed for a circumstantiall and not for a mysticall vse.</p>

                     </gap>ion, and consummation of others, as of the Natiuitie, and Passion: And so generally, and <hi>virtute</hi> (as wee say) in vertue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection contaynes the rest, but it contaynes them not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and expresly, as it is necessary we should remember them; for then we should not need any moe Articles of our Creede, but that one of the Resurrection. As the Articles are particular concerning the Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Ascension, so they ought to bee distinctly and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally remembred, both on the Sabbath, and on other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times, which the Church shall appoint.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although the Lords Day was not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for a memoriall of the Resurrection, yet, that was one of the principall causes wherefore it was sanctified,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9002:183"/>
rather then any other day of the weeke. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes as before, <hi>Domini resurrectio consecrauit nobis diem Dominicum, dies Dominicus sacratus est, &amp; declaratus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti resurrectione, &amp; inde coepit habere festiuitatem suam.</hi> And in <hi>Tertullian</hi> his time, it was indeed esteemed a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, eyther to fast or kneele vpon the Lords Day, which custome was confirmed in the Councell of Nice, <hi>Can.</hi> 20. When ye say, that if it were appointed for remembrance of Christs Resurrection, all the diuine Seruice done on the Lords Day, should haue relation only to the Resurrection; It is no consequent: for albeit God blessed, and sanctified the Iewish Sabbath, because hee rested thereon, there were yet other Scriptures read on their Sabbath, then the storie of Creation, and God his rest from it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where ye alledge, that it was called the Lords Day, because it was instituted by the Lord and for the Lord, we will not contend about this, prouiding it be not denyed, that it is called the Lords Day principally, because the Lord rose thereupon, as <hi>Augustine,</hi> and other Ancients af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme euery-where. The Communion is called the Lords Supper, because hee appointed it to be kept for a memoriall of his death till his comming againe. The Iewish Sabbath was called the Sabbath of the Lord their God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was consecrated to his worship: for then the New-moones, and all the other Festiuall Dayes should haue beene so named, which they are not; but also because it was the signe and memoriall of Gods rest that Day. Therefore in the fourth Command, it is expressed as the reason, why the Lord did blesse and sanctifie the Sabbath, <hi>He rested the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Day therefore</hi> (namely, because hee rested on it) <hi>hee blessed and hallowed it:</hi> euen so is the Sonday sanctified and blessed by our Sauiour, and called the Lords Day, because it hath imprinted in it by his Institution a perpetuall memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his Resurrection, whereby hee abolished all the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticall shaddowes of the Law; as first, the strict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise bodily rest, by bringing in, the spirituall and eternall:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9002:184"/>
Secondly, the memoriall of their temporall deliuerance out of Egypt, by bringing in the eternall and spirituall deliuery from the tyrannie of Satan, the slauerie of sin, and the feare of death: and thirdly, the signe and marke of distinction which separa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed the Iew and Gentile, and was a part of the partition wall, in respect whereof, the Iewes were called <hi>Sabbatarij</hi>; all these shaddowes Christ by his Resurrection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th abolished, and by the obseruation of the Lords Day, they are declared to bee abolished; which the obseruation of no other day of the weeke could haue done, because Christ stamped none of them with the memoriall of his Resurrection, but this Day only whereupon he rose.</p>
                  <p>Against this ye alledge, that it is not <hi>typus destinatus,</hi> but <hi>communis &amp; factus,</hi> that is, a Type not instituted by God to be a memoriall of Christs Resurrection, but a common Type fitted to resemble such a thing: the contrary whereof is true. For nothing can bee called a common Type, but that which hath in it selfe by nature, some respect, or qualitie, wherby it is fitted to make the resemblance of such a thing: As in Marriage, in the coniunction of the head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, there is a fitnesse naturall to resemble our vnion with Christ: So in the Pismire there is a qualitie naturall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the vertuous man; and in the Lion and Horse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the strong and stately: but in this day by nature, there is neither qualitie nor respect more, then in any other to make such a resemblance. Moreouer, common Types are neither memorial &amp; prognosticall signes, but demonstratiue only; &amp; all memoriall, &amp; prognosticall signes, which are not naturall, are signes destinate either by God or by man. If ye affirme, that the Lords Day was destinate by man, to be a signe of Christs Resurrection, then yee must grant, that it was instituted by man to bee obserued in remembrance of that benefit, and so it shall not be a day of Diuine, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Institution. Lastly, all the times which God hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with some rare worke or euent, and hath therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee obserued solemnely, haue euer beene desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9002:184"/>
by God to be memoratiue signes of these same things. So the seuenth Day marked with Gods rest, and therefore blessed and sanctified, is a memoriall of Gods rest, and is called the Sabbath of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and it is also a prognosticall signe of the rest of God to be communicated with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full who resemble that rest by a corporall cessation. This the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>There remaynes therefore a rest to the people of God, for hee that enters into his rest, hee also ceases from his owne workes, as God did from his.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the fourteenth day of the first Moneth marked with that rare deliuerance from the destroying Angell, and their escape out of Egypt, and therefore appointed to be solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued to the honour of God: was destinated by God to bee a memoriall of that their deliuerance, and called the Passeouer of the Lord. And euen so the Lords Day being marked with that rare and incomparable benefit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and consecrated in the iudgement of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to the worship of God insteed of the Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is a memoriall signe of the Resurrection destinated by the Lord himselfe; a demonstratiue signe of our spirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from sinne, to newnesse of life; and a prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call signe of our corporeall Resurrection vnto euerlasting life. This Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expresseth in the words before cited: <hi>Dominicus dies Christi resurrectione sacratus, aeternam non solum spiritus, sed etiam corporis requiem praefigurat.</hi> In end where yee conclude, that the Lords Day was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only for a remembrance of his Resurrection after a mysticall manner, but for the remembrance of all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and worship in generall, if your meaning bee, that on the Lords Day, all Christs actions may and ought to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly remembred, as occasion requires, and not his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only, it is true that yee say: but if your meaning bee, that the sanctification of the Lords Day was not ordayned to be a memoriall of Christs Resurrection, I deny your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; preferre to your opinion, the iudgement of all the Ancients.</p>

If for Baptisme, why not for Doctrine, and Prayer, and Thankesgiuing, and all other parts of Gods Worship? For albeit the Lords Day be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to the Worship of God, yet the Worship is not tied to it, but from one Sabbath to another, and from one New-Moone to another, all flesh may appeare before the Lord. That which ye speake of diuiding Christs actions, and the appointing of mysticall dayes, is partly foolish, and partly false. Is it not a folly to thinke, that the actions of Christ ought not to bee diuided, and seuerally remembred in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Sermons, seeing the Spirit of God hath diuided them in this Storie, and that it is impossible at once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them all? And it is false also, because for remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them no day is appointed to bee kept mystically as a part of the worship, but only circumstantially for order, and commoditie: which kinde of obseruation is not a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious wil-worship, but a lawfull determination of commodious times for the worship of God, belonging to the power and policie of the Church.</p>

                  <p>If it was the Iewish Pentecost, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not only obserue an Anniuersary Day, but such also, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9002:185"/>
was legall, and abrogated by the Gospell, and such as hee discharges the Church to obserue: Yet I hope, yee will not say, that his obseruation was Superstitious or Pedagogicall, because he obserued it not as a necessary part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship prescribed in the Law, in respect whereof only, it was Pedagogicall; but as a fit circumstance and opportunitie for the worke of his Ministerie, like as he did often obserue the Iewish Sabbaths, which was not onely lawfull, but in those times verie expedient to be done by him. Hereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the obseruation of dayes, is not condemned by the Apostle, as a Iewish Rite, because Anniuersarie, Monethly, or Weekly; but because it was conioyned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of necessitie, and vsed as a Legall worship: therefore although vpon the Iewish Sabbath, or vpon their Pentecost diuine worship was performed, as the Euangell preached, the Sacraments celebrated, Prayers publikely conceiued, &amp;c. If these things were done, without any mysticall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or respect had to the day, but only because the time was opportune and happily fit for Gods Worke, the exercise was lawfull and could not bee condemned. So wee finde in some churches, that on eueryday the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ministred: that on the Iewish Sabbath, they had an ordinarie Fast, and no well aduised Christian did euer thinke these to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by reason of the day. For if <hi>to the cleane, euery thing be cleane,</hi> all dayes are cleane and sanctified to euery lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the man who is himselfe made cleane by the bloud of Christ: Consequently, euery day, whether it be Weekly or Anniuersarie, is cleane, and sanctified by Christ, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of any part of his Worship, which shall bee thought meete by the Church to be performed to his honour, and the edification of her selfe. The Legall Sabbath and Pentecost, which were abrogated, could not make the Euangelicke Worship, which was performed on them by the Apostles, vnlawfull; farre lesse can the Lords Day, such as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Pasche, and Whitsonday are, or any other day of the Weeke, Moneth, or Yeare, which were neuer legally obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9002:186"/>
make the Doctrine, Prayers, and Sacraments admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred on them, vnlawfull, and superstitious.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I finde in this Obiection a Solution to all your Arguments, for here I find, that there may be a lawfull obseruation of dayes which are abrogated, let be of dayes which are not discharged, so the obseruation bee not legall, with opinion of necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> keeped many Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and the Pentecost, whereon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three thousand by his first preaching.

extant in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and in <hi>Eusebius</hi> there is no Epistle of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarpus</hi>; onely <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in a Letter that hee sends to <hi>Victor,</hi> mentions him. The Epistles of <hi>Polycrates</hi> yee affirme to bee counterfeit, and vpon what reason?

The testimonie of the 118.

This by example he makes plain. His Maiesties deliuerance vpon the fift dayes of <hi>August,</hi> and <hi>Nouember</hi> being Tuesdayes both, wee keepe for their remembrance a Sermon on Tuesday euery week of the yeare: but when by course of the yeare in their seuerall moneths, the very originall dayes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues come about, shal we not, doe wee not celebrate them in much more solemne manner? what question is there? weigh them well, ye shal find the case alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one cannot be, but the other also must bee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike. These are the words of the learned Bishop, which proue his intent so cleerly, that ye are forced to flye to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shift, as your custome is, &amp; say, If the Prophesie should be applyed to any precise day, it should bee applyed to the Lords day. But seeing the words are to be vnderstood aswel of <hi>Dauid</hi> as of Christ, the day is taken, ye say, for the time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, wherin <hi>Dauid</hi> was made King, &amp; the corner stone of Gods people. This is your shift, which cannot auaile you: for if it be taken indefinitely for the day wherin <hi>Dauid</hi> was made the typick corner Stone, then much more must it bee taken for the definite day, whereon Christ the Veritie was made the true corner Stone of the Church of God. If of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> Coronation, it might be said, <hi>This is the day which the

So himselfe sayes, <hi>He became all things to all men, that he might winne some.</hi> The keeping of the 14. day by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> is not an argument that they disagreed from the rest in iudgement, touching the set day (if any then was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined) more then the practise of other ceremonies proues their disagreeing from S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the poynt of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: for this they did onely by way of condescension. So the Apostles in these times might haue kept Easter vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse daies, by the direction of the Spirit, because the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne commemoration of our Sauiours resurrection, which we call Easter, is not to be kept at any set time for any myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that one day hath more then another by diuine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Yet after the Nicene Councell had setled that controuersie, and determined the day, these must iustly be blamed, that contentiously troubled the Christian peace, disobeyed the

                     </gap> is, They are yearely celebrated after a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne manner. The diuersitie of the day confuteth not this assertion, but confirmes rather his saying: namely, that the solemnitie was obserued through all the World, seeing in one part it was celebrated for winning of the Iewes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practise of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in the rest of the World, on Pasche Sonday, whereon our Sauiour rose, according to the tradition of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apostle of the Gentiles. So this same solemnitie being kept through the whole Church, although not on the same day, Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> rule remains good, that the solemne commemoration of Christs resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is Apostolicke.</p>
                  <p>The next probation is no better, to wit, that there is no testimonie in writing for the confirmation of that custome: for by this reason it would follow, that the obseruation of Sonday in stead of the Iewish Sabbath, hath preuayled by a priuate custome only: For in the Apostolique writings, we haue no testimonie for the confirmation of that custome. In Scripture we reade, that our Sauiour rose on that day, that on that day he appeared to his Disciples, that on that day the Apostle appointed collections to be made for the poore, that on that day at Troas the Disciples were assembled to breake bread, and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached: All these actions make as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the obseruation of Pasche Sonday, and as the Bishop of Winchester saith, somewhat more, seeing it is after a sort, the same day by reuolution, whereon our Sauiour did rise: yet all these practises, exercises, and meetings on the Lords day had not demonstrate the sanctification of it, if it had not beene perpetually and vniuersally obserued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Church. This constant and vniuersall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, hath declared these practises to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie, and that our Sauiour did consecrate that day by his resurrection, and apparitions, to be in stead of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kelihood this obseruation was Apostolique. By A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique, I meane not a doctrinall point, which is to bee obserued as a substantiall part of diuine worship, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition necessary to saluation, but the imitation onely of an Apostolique practice concerning order and policie: neither doe I meane such a practice as is expresly set downe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9002:190"/>
and vniuersally obserued through the world, such as the Lords Day is, for such a practice hath the strength of a diuine Precept: but I vnderstand such a practice, as albeit it be not recorded in Scripture, to haue beene done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselues, or the Churches in their time, yet the same being vniuersally receiued in the world, and obserued since the Apostles dayes, is most probably presumed to haue beene practised in their times, and allowed by them. And in this, the Lords Day differs from Pasche, and the other three dayes mentioned by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the Lords Day hath not onely the vniuersall and perpetuall obseruation of the Church, since the dayes of the Apostles, but also the practice of our Sauiour, his Apostles, and the Church in their times expresly recorded in Scripture: The other haue onely an vniuersall and constant practice of the Church, since the Apostles time, which not the lesse ought to be preferred to any priuate or late particular custome. And to returne to the Act of Perth, it ordaynes none of these dayes to be kept for Diuine and Apostolique, but onely, that on them once in the yeare a solemne commemoration be made of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our Redemption; and therefore the Reasons ye bring to proue, that these dayes are not Apostolique, impugne no wayes the lawfullnesse of the act. Where yee say, that the obseruation of the Passion day, hath brought into the church set dayes of fasting, condemned by our Diuines, I aske you, how yee doe proue that affirmation? It is enough yee haue said it. But to conclude this point, I doe verily thinke, That to fast and pray at some set times, were lesse offensiue to God, then to bee often feasting and surfetting, pratling, and lying, traducing our Brethren, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the good order and policie of Gods Church.</p>

We haue answered already, That Christs day or the Lords Day, is the day appointed for remembrance of his Natiuitie, and all his actions and benefits, aswell as for the Resurrection. Next, the one is morall and weekely: the other, is mysticall and anniuersarie. The Lords Day it selfe, is no longer to vs mysticall but morall, sayes <hi>Willet,</hi> and therefore Pasche day is a mysticall Sabbath and anniuersarie, whereas the Lords Day it selfe should be onely morall.</p>

                  <p>The answere which yee haue already made, is already confuted. The Lords Day is generally appointed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all his actions, therefore none of his actions may or should bee remembred at any other set time. This consequence is not necessary: for then we may not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his actions, in the morning and euening Lectures, wee may not remember them in Sermons &amp; Exercises on week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, nor may wee remember them in Catechizing the people. Your next answere is, That the day of the Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is mysticall: This is contrarie to that which yee cited out of Saint <hi>Augustine, pag.</hi> 68. <hi>Ille celebratur ob memoriam solùm, &amp; ideo semper die vigesimo quinto Decembris: at iste celebratur ob memoriam, &amp; Sacramentum.</hi> But, I pray you, How proue yee obseruation of the day of Natiuitie to bee mysticall? because it is anniuersarie, yee say: If this be your Argument (for I finde no other here) it is not good: for in the reuolution of time there is no mysterie, but in the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9002:192"/>
and we haue often said before, that we obserue no day for signification, but the Lords Day onely. The rest we obserue as times meet and commodious, for the worship appointed to be done on them. As to Doctor <hi>Willets</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Lords Day is not mysticall to vs, I oppone to it Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement, who calls it, as yee heard before, a figure and type of life eternall, which is confirmed by the Apostle in the fourth to the Hebrewes. But Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> I hope, takes <hi>(mysticall)</hi> for a darke and obscure shadow of things to come, such as the festiuall dayes vnder the Law were, kept in remembrance, not of spirituall and eternall, but of temporall benefits, which were shadowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of spirituall and eternall benefits to come: And in this sense, the Lords Day is not mysticall, for it is not kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of temporall benefits, which are shadowes of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall, but in remembrance of Christs Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by whom we are put in present possession of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall rest and life, and in hope of eternall. In respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is a memoriall signe of the Resurrection of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, so is is a demonstratiue signe of the benefit which wee enjoy of spirituall rest, and prognosticall of our eternall, and therefore is called a figure and type, by Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> Thus taking a mysterie in a large sense for any signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant signe in Religion, it may be called mysticall. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Testament are called mysteries by the Ancients, not in the sense that the Sacraments of the old Testament were called mysteries, for they were so called, because they were darke and obscure shadowes of things to come; but our Sacraments are the liuely Images of the things themselues, by reason of the plaine and manifest Word of the Gospell annexed to them. By this distinction Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> may be agreed.</p>

                  <p>Wee thinke it sufficient to haue made that obiection once, because it hath neuer yet beene answered: but yee propone it often to assay, if yee shall bee able to fall on some solide solution at last; yet like an euill Archer, the longer yee shoote, yee stray the further from the marke: Yee thinke an Anniuersarie remembrance may be kept, but an Anniuersarie solemnitie should not bee celebrated: yee hide your minde from simple people vnder a mysticall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of words, but to speake that plainly, which yee call the celebration of an Anniuersarie solemnitie, your meaning must be, if yee contradict the Act, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should not bee made, prayers, thanksgiuing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should not be offered on certayne set times in the yeare, in remembrance of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, &amp;c. If yee will haue no such exercise to bee vsed, what Anniuersarie remembrance is it that yee would haue obserued? Is it a priuy meditation in our Chambers, whereunto neither God nor Man is priuie, or some occasionall remembrance in our Lectures and Sermons, as they fall out now and then?

There is a rest kept idolatrously for the honour of idols, as the <hi>Baechanalia, Floralia,</hi> and the holy dayes proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Israelites, for honour of their golden Calfe: These are damnable rests. Finally, there is a rest that is kept religiously, and this rest is kept either for celebritie and commoditie of the religious action onely, or mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: for commoditie and celebritie of the religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, a rest is kept in all the solemne times of fasting: a rest is kept in the houres of Prayers, or Preaching, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuine Seruice. And such is the rest, that his Maiestie hath appointed to bee obserued. The rest, kept mystically, was a significant rest of some thing by-past, present, or to come; such was the rest of the Iewish Sabbath, and of the Legall Festiuities, and such <hi>Augustine</hi> holds, and other many good Diuines, our rest on the Lords Day to be, from the fourth to the Hebrewes. This is called a Sabbath of rest, such a rest his Maiestie hath not commanded; but a rest for commoditie and celebritie of the diuine Seruice only, which

                  <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third gaue this reason, wherefore the Romane Church kept not a Holy day to the Trinitie, <hi>Quoniam Ecclesia Romana in vsu non habet, &amp;c.</hi> Because, sayes he, Glorie to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghost, and other such like things, belonging to the praise of the Trinitie, are daily vttered. The Popes reason is grounded vpon this rule, Whatsoeuer is intreated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the diuine seruice ordinarie, ought not to haue a speciall Holy day, to celebrate the memorie of the same, beside the day alreadie decerned by the Lord. We assume, Christs Natiuitie, Death, Resurrection, &amp;c. are not onely the continuall meditation of a Christian in priuate, but also a remembred, and intreated in the ordinarie and publique seruice. Euery Communion Sonday is a Passion Holy day. Euery Sabbath, that Christs Natiuitie is preached, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie. But to ordayne an Anniuersarie day, or houre of rest, for commemoration of his Natiuitie or Passion, and specially vpon a weeke day, is a Iewish rudiment, and a preiudice to Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>

                  <p>I answere to the Proposition first, and I grant, that whatsoeuer is remembred in the ordinarie diuine seruice, ordinarily and particularly, such as, <hi>Glory bee to the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,</hi> which was said in the diuine seruice ordinarily and particularly, that needes not any particular commemoration vpon some speciall time, sayes Pope <hi>Alexander:</hi> but the inestimable benefits and actions of our Sauiour, which were not ordinarily and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remembred in the daily seruice, but onely in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of the Creede, where all the Articles of Religion are remembred; Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> thought, that for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9002:194"/>
of these, a set time was necessary. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which is your ground, being taken according to the Popes minde, is against you.</p>
                  <p>Next, I answere, your Assumption is false: These bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are not the continuall meditation of Christians in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate; for I am assured, if yee bee a Christian, yee did not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on these things Christianly, when yee did meditate this Pamphlet against the honour of Christ his Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and against the power of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where yee say, That they are remembred in the ordinarie and publique seruice, that falleth our sometimes, but not purposely. When it happens, it is by occasion, and generally that they are touched, because they occurre in your Text perhaps. Otherwise, they may lye buried seuen yeares before they be purposely remembred. And when yee say, That euery Communion Sonday is a Passion Holy day, I would demand, whether it were lawfull on the Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day or Friday before that Communion Sonday, to make a Sermon on the Passion for preparation of the people to the Communion, as I hope, you haue practised sometime your selfe. Now, if this, which your selfe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done, bee lawfull, is it not lawfull also to doe the like on Friday before Easter, which is a Communion Sonday by the acts of our Church? And this is all, that they ordayned by the Act of the Assembly at Perth, touching the remembrance of the Passion. Further, to that which yee say, That euery Sabbath whereon the Natiuitie is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie: I answere, That it is but occasionall, and so falls out by the Text which the Minister teaches; but neither doe the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort purposely to Church to heare the Natiuitie intreated at that time, nor does the Minister intreat of it at large, as the same ought.</p>
                  <p>Finally, yee conclude with that often repeated calumnie,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9002:194"/>
that to ordayne a certayne anniuersary day, or houre of rest, for commemoration of these benefits, is a Iewish rudiment, and a preiudice to Christian libertie. The first is false: For the appointing of houres and times weekely, monethly, or yearely, for preaching any part of the Gospell, is no Iewish rudiment, but a lawfull, good, and wise Christian policie, practised 1500. yeares before yee were borne, throughout the whole Christian world, and allowed by the best Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines both in the primitiue and reformed Church. So farre is it from being a preiudice to Christian libertie, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a principall part of our libertie consists, that we are not astricted in the worship of God to Times, Places, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and others such circumstances by the Gospell, but haue libertie to choose and appoint such as wee thinke most expedient for the honour of God, and edification of his people: of the which libertie the purpose of your Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is to spoile vs, in the Sacrament astricting vs to the gesture of sitting onely, and for Gods publique worship, to the Lords Day onely; as if the Church had no power to appoint preaching, prayers, and diuine seruice to be done at any other time, or the Sacrament to bee receiued in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fashion.</p>

your reason it must be Iewish.

Neither did they euill in

                     <hi>Zanchius</hi> iudgement, that retayned the dayes obserued by the Primitiue Church; consequently in appointing on these 5 dayes Sermons to be preached and diuine Seruice done, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be euil. Specially, if we shall consider, how notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all the Acts, Ciuil, and Ecclesiastick made against the superstitious obseruation, and prophane abuse of Zule day, our people could neuer bee induced to labour on that day, and leaue their idlenesse: and wheresoeuer diuine Seruice was done that day, as in Townes that haue alwayes morning and euening Prayers, they were euer perceiued to resort in greater numbers on that day then any other to the Church: So these dayes being spent prophanely by the greatest sort and superstitiously by many, these euils could not be better remooued, then by Doctrine and diuine Seruice, whereby the time is well spent, and these conceits of the people dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away, and their opinions confuted in the time, when the same are most pregnant.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tooke occasion by inscription of the Altar in <hi>Areopage, To the vnknowne God,</hi> to preach the true God to the Gentiles: thereby he did not authorize their Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hee there cals <gap reason="foreign">

But to make commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inestimable benefits of our redemption vpon the fiue anniuersarie daies, hath beene abolished lawfully by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and Ecclesiasticall Lawes, &amp;c. This assumption is false, in all the parts of it; for first, as we haue shewed, the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ordayned by the Act at Perth was neuer abolished by Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall Lawes, nor yet by consent and vniforme practise of the contrarie: Onely the superstitious obseruation of these dayes with opinion of necessitie, as a part of diuine worship, and the profane abuse thereof, with excessiue banqueting, playing, and carroling was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Secondly, to your prescription of time in things moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I answer, that circumstantiall ceremonies belonging to Religion, are alwaies alterable, and neither can bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed nor established by prescription: for if prescription had force in such things, then the space of 1200. yeares, during which time these fiue dayes were obserued vniuersally throughout the whole Christian world, sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ld haue greater force to establish the obseruation of them, then the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of seuen and fiftie yeares in durance onely. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time does not establish without change such things, but giues occasion to alter them rather, when the alteration makes for the honour of God, the edification of his Church, and auoyding corruption. Thirdly, the Sermons of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Preachers condemned onely, the superstitious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane obseruation of these dayes, and not the obseruation made by the Primitiue, and by the reformed Churches in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9002:198"/>
our time, which is the obseruation onely commaunded by the Act of Perthe. Fourthly, If any were censured, it was not for any fault in the action it selfe, but for transgression of the Ecclesiasticall order, and the scandall, which might haue followed thereupon; as the censures which wee now vse against these, that refuse to performe the diuine seruice appoynted to be done on these times, are not inflicted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault that is in omission, in regard of the time, but onely in regard of the order and policie of the Church, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contemned, giues offence to the simple, and breaks peace and vnitie. Fiftly, we neuer abiured with oathes publique or priuate, the obseruation now required; the dedication of dayes imposed vpon the conscience, with opinion that they are <hi>sanctiores, &amp; sacratiores alijs diebus, &amp; pars diuini cultus,</hi> we detest, and abiure: for nothing can be imposed vpon the conscience, but by the precept of God onely. The Canons of the Church in matters indifferent, doe not oblige the conscience <hi>ratione rei praeceptae quasi pars sit aliqua diuini cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: sed ordinis &amp; politias causa tantum.</hi> So the Canons of the Church made for obseruation of these fiue dayes, bindes not the conscience to the obseruation thereof, as a part of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship, and as the commaundement of God bindes vs to the obseruation of the Lords Day: for it is the will of God, that on the Lords Day, we be religiously exercised, and therefore our obedience in that point, is a part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: but to be exercised in Gods publique worship on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, is not Gods expresse will, yet it is his will, that we should heare the Church, and obey her ordinances in all things that tend to edification, and serue for good order, whereof God is the Author. To conclude, seeing the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of these fiue daies, as the same is prescribed in the act at Perthe, is neither contrarie to any Law, Ciuill, or Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astique; nor condemned by the practice, doctrine, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of our Church, nor abiured by oathes: And therefore may lawfully be restored, receiued, and put in practise againe by our Church.</p>

mysterie of iniquitie was working in their times. The errours of the Orthodoxe Church were the beginnings of the Papistrie, at length they grew to a great masse. So howbeit, the whole lumpe was not formed, till the Antichrist came to his full strength, yet many particulars were entered before, and like brookes came into the great riuer.

                  <p>Here ye insinuate, that the obseruation of the fiue Daies in the Primitiue Church was Papistrie, or else this Discourse is idle. But Papistrie it could not be, before it was receiued, and confirmed by the Pope: so in these dayes it was not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie formally. And if it were not an errour of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Church, but a lawfull order, as at length we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it was neyther materially nor formally Papistrie. The obseruation of these dayes, with a superstitious and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship, is Papistrie: Such was not the obseruation of the Primitiue Church, and such is not the obseruation of the Reformed. But as the lawfull obseruation vsed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church was abolished by the introduction of a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and idolatrous worship in Papistrie, so is the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and idolatrous obseruation in Papistrie, abolished in reformed Churches by the restitution of the lawfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obseruation vsed in the Primitiue Church, which of all reformations is the most perfect and profitable. <hi>Iehu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished Idolatrie of the Heathen, but he restored not the true worship of God: therefore his reformation was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But the reformation made by <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Iosias,</hi> was perfect, because Idolatrie was not onely abolished, but the true worship of God established in place thereof.

                  <p>First, where ye alledge, that all the reformed Churches, haue abandoned the dayes dedicated to Saints: In this, their practise is no way contrarie to the Act made at Perth; for by it no day is ordained to be kept, which is or was dedicate to any Saint, except vnder the name of Saints yee reprehend him, who is the most holy.</p>
                  <p>Next, the exception ye make of our neighbour Church, is calumnious, and false. It is a calumnie, that they obserue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny day dedicated to Saints. All the dayes which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, are dedicated to the honour of God, either for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable benefits that by our Sauiour he hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, or in regard of the blessings that haue come to man, by the Ministrie of his seruants, and Saints. And it is false, that all the reformed Churches, except they, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the obseruation of these dayes: For <hi>Bullinger</hi> in his Commentary vpon the 14. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> affirmes, that the Church of Tigurie obserues the Feasts of the blessed Virgin, of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of the Apostles.</p>

                  <p>The Proposition I admit, the Assumption I deny: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit any mysticall or memorable worke were certainly knowne to haue beene wrought vpon such a time, yet to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme aboue another, except it were sanctified by diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, wee count it Superstition. So albeit wee certainly know the memorable workes of his Maiesties deliuerance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9002:204"/>
to haue beene wrought vpon the fift of <hi>August,</hi> and the fift of <hi>Nouember;</hi> yet we doe not esteeme these dayes aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes, as if the seruice done on them, were more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, in respect of the time: but wee doe only esteeme them as meete circumstances for the thankesgiuing appointed to be made on them to God. The same estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we haue of the fiue dayes, as wee haue oft said before.</p>
                  <p>That our Sauiour was borne vpon the 25. of <hi>December,</hi> no man (I thinke) knowes certainly: the common reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we hold as vncertaine. Therefore wee doe not thinke, the commemoration of Christs Natiuitie vpon that day, and our thankesgiuing therefore more acceptable to God by reason of the day; nor doe wee thinke cessation from worke on that day a part of diuine worship, at it was held in time of Papistry, and is yet by many of our common Professours that lacke instruction: but the worship we doe, in vnto God for his honour, not for the day; and the cessation from work is for the commoditie, and celebritie of the worship. The Act of Perth ordaynes the people to be thus instructed, and the superstitious conceite of the time rebuked. Finally, choice is made of this, and the other dayes, not for any my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie esteemed to bee in them more then in other dayes, but for conformity with the Primitiue Church, the reuerence of whose authoritie in matters of this nature, must be of great force to draw Churches of diuers iurisdictions that agree in doctrine, to vnity in points of externall policie: which vnity is far to be preferred to the priuate custome of any Church, or the singularity of any mans opinion and fantasie. And therefore ZANCHIVS said well, and wisely in the places cited before, That albeit the reformed Churches haue liberty to sanctifie what dayes they thinke good, yet it is more laudable, honest, and profitable, to sanctifie these which the most pure, Apostolick, and Primitiue Church san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. So to conclude, we obserue no day for mystery, or with opinion of necessitie, but only for commodity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie. And this obseruation is approued by the iudgement of the best Diuines in the reformed Church.</p>

            <head>An answere to the dispute, intituled, OF CONFIRMATION, and of Bishopping. Wherein the Pamphlet penner pretends to impugne the third Article, concluded in the Assembly at Perth, touching the triall of young childrens education; the tenor whereof followes.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as one of the most speciall meanes for staying the encrease of Popery, and setling of true Religion in the hearts of the people, is, that a speciall care be taken in triall of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren their education, and how they are catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: which in time of the primitiue Church was most carefully attended, as being most profitable to cause young children, in their tender yeares, drinke in the knowledge of God and his Religion, but is now altogether neglected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the great abuse and errors, which crept into the Popish Church, by making thereof a Sacrament of Confirmation: Therefore, that all superstitions built thereupon may be rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that the matter it selfe being most necessary for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of the youth, may be reduced to the primitiue integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is thought good, that the Minister in euery Parish shall catechize all young children of eight yeares of age, and see that they haue the knowledge and bee able to make rehearsall of the Lords prayer, Beliefe, and ten Commandements, with answers to the questions of the small Catechisme vsed in our Church:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9002:209"/>
And that euery Bishop in his Visitation shall censure the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, who shall be found remisse therein: And the said Bishops shall cause the said children to be presented before them, and blesse them with prayer for the encrease of their knowledge, and continuance of Gods heauenly graces with euery one of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the narratiue of this Act, the Sacrament of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is counted amongst the abuses, errors, and superstitions, which crept into the Papistical Church in stead of the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g childrens education: therefore the first part of the dispute, wherein the Pamphleter intends to prooue that Confirmation is not a Sacrament, contayning nothing that is contrary to the Act, shall be passed by.</p>
            <p>In the second part of the dispute, intituled, <hi>Bishopping,</hi> he contends that the Sacrament of Confirmation and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, is not proper to Bishops, but common to all Presbyters. This contention is idle: for the Sacrament of Confirmation and imposition of hands, being refuted in the former dispute by himselfe, and condemned by the Act, why should hee striue to haue that common, which neither he nor we esteeme to be lawfull? But to the end, all occasion of debate, about this matter might be preuented, the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at Perth ordayned, that the Bishop after examination should blesse the young children with prayer, and purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted the ceremonie of imposition of hands, as a thing indifferent to bee vsed, or not vsed, as the Bishop should thinke most meet: Albeit in the primitiue Church, this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing was alwayes giuen with imposition of hands,as <hi>Caluine</hi> affirmes, <hi>Instit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. wishing that it were restored to the first integritie in the reformed Churches. Yet the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter to make simple ones beleeue, that euery thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Assembly was erroneous, hee giues out, that the Sacrament, at least the ceremonie of Confirmation was there allowed, and appropriated to Bishops.</p>

            <div type="argument">
               <head>ANS.</head>
               <p>If by the Ceremonie or Sacrament of Confirmation, yee vnderstand the miraculous imposition of hands vsed by the Apostles, or yet the bastard Sacrament of Confirmation v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Poperie, whereby <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom yee afterwards cite, sayes, That the Lord would honour <hi>Episcopalem digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> neither of these are allowed by the Act, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to Bishops. Therefore, your whole dispute fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing being directed onely against these two points, is idle &amp; superfluous. But if by Confirmation ye did vnderstand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the Act, the dutie which Bishops should performe in trying at their Visitation, the diligence of Pastors in catechizing young children, and in causing them bee brought before them to bee examined and blessed: this part of Episcopall gouernment yee haue not abjured, but haue approued by your assertorie oath, and obliged your selfe to maintayne and obey by your promissorie oath; if so bee, yee did sweare to the Policie set downe in the first booke of Discipline, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. as yee haue often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. For the wordes in that booke touching this point of Bishops dutie, are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After the Superintendents haue remayned in their chiefe Townes, three or foure moneths at the most, they shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled (vnlesse by sicknesse onely they be retayned) to re-enter in their Visitation. In which they shall not onely preach, but also examine the life, diligence, and behauiour of the Ministers, as also the order of their Churches, and manners of their people:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9002:210"/>
They must further consider, how the poore are prouided for, and the youth instructed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these wordes it is manifest, that it was not a thing common to euery Pastor to visite Churches, and trie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Ministers, specially concerning their instruction of the youth, but that it was proper to the Superintendent. Now, if yee haue sworne that this is lawfull in the person of the Superintendent, how can yee call it a damnable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in the person of a Bishop? whose function and name is the same, differing onely in the origination of the word, the one being drawne from the Latine, the other from the Greeke: for a Bishop in the Greeke tongue is the same that a Superintendent is in the Latine. And in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Churches, the triall of the education of children, which now is a dutie belonging to the Bishops function, is here set downe as a speciall point of the Superintendents office.</p>
               <p>As to the blessing which the Bishop is appointed to giue vnto them, <hi>Caluine</hi> in the place aboue cited, sayes, That it should bee vsed to the end, that graue and sacred action, may haue the greater reuerence and dignitie. This exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of children, in the ancient Church, had ioyned with it, not the blessing onely, but the ceremonie also of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands; and thereupon in the fourth Councell of Carthage, <hi>Can.</hi> 85. It is called, <hi>Examinatio impositionis manus,</hi> and is appointed to be often vsed towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumenists before they were baptised. But this blessing and imposition of hands vpon the Catechumenists, and vpon the young children of Christians, was not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall action, nor a Sacramentall rite, as it was after estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor giuen to Bishops for honour of their Episcopall dignitie, but accessorie onely, as <hi>Caluine</hi> rightly thinks, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the examination, which was the Bishops speciall dutie in his Visitation. It is true, the omission of the principall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the vsing onely of the accessorie, to wit, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9002:210"/>
of hands, was the first corruption, that crept in: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that came in the crossing, the annointing of the forehead and the buffet giuen to the child in stead of the blessing, and so a Bastard Sacrament was instituted in the place of a most profitable point of the Episcopall function. Further, as it is the dutie of euery Pastor, to catechize the young children in his Parish, and try whether the Parents haue kept their promise made at the Baptisme of their Children, in which tryall, if hee shall finde the childe to haue profited well, hee ought to blesse and pray for them: So is it the Bishops dutie in his Visitation to try if the Pastors haue performed their parts, and after examination, to blesse these same children. And as the examination, and blessing vsed by the Pastor, takes not away the power, that parents haue to examine and blesse their owne children; so the examination and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Bishops takes not away the power that Pastors haue of triall, and blessing within their owne Parish. Therefore to conclude, the Ordinance set downe in the Act of Perth appropriates nothing to Bishops, that is common to Pastors and Parents, but preserues vnto euery one the prerogatiue of his owne calling: Neither is there any thing ordayned in the Act, but that which <hi>Caluine</hi> wished ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to be restored againe in the Church.</p>

And to the end, this action, that was in it selfe graue and holy, might haue the greater reuerence and dignitie, the ceremonie of imposition of hands was also vsed.

And the best manner of catechizing were this; That a forme should be penned for that vse, contayning the summe of all the heads of our Religion, and expounding them familiarly, vnto which Faith and Religion the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church of the faithfull should agree: that the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten yeares old, should present himselfe to the Church, to giue a confession of his Faith: bee demanded vpon euery Article, and made to answere seuerally to euery one: and if hee were ignorant of any point, or did not well vnderstand the same, he should be instructed. Thus he should in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Church, and vnder the testimonie thereof make profession of that onely true and sincere Faith, wherewith the Congregation of the faithfull worships God. If this discipline were in vigour at this time, the slouth of some Parents should bee corrected that securely neglect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their children, as a thing not appertayning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end the last Controuersie touching the administration of Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord in priuate houses, may bee the better discussed, wee shall premit some few grounds for cleering the question.</p>
            <p>First, The publike actions of Christian Religion, are not tyed to any certayne time, or place by diuine Institution, but may bee lawfully performed at any time, and in any place, when necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty requires.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the publike actions may be lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, a publike Minister, a lawfull Assembly, and the forme prescribed in the Word, must necessarily be kept.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Howbeit some hold, that Baptisme ministred by a priuate person is valide, and effectuall, yet no man can hold truely, that it is lawfully ministred by such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Although the Communion Elements bee duly consecrated by a publike Minister in a most solemne and lawfull Assembly, yet if he apply them only to his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vse, or to so me other particular person, making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution according to the Institution, the action is not lawfully performed.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The lawfull Assemblies, wherein the publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9002:213"/>
may be performed, are eyther ordinary, or not ordinarie. The ordinary are not defined in the word particularly, but are left to bee determined by the Church, which according to the generall Rules of Christian Policie, hath deuided the Christian people in sundry Congregations called Parishes; whose meeting in the ordinary times and places appointed, are the ordinary Assemblies, wherein the publike actions of Religion should be performed ordinarily.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, The Assemblies that are lawfull, but not ordinary, are the meetings of two, or three at least in the Name of Iesus Christ, wherein he hath promised his presence to heare their Prayers, and approue their lawfull actions of piety. In such Assemblies, the Word hath beene preached, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme ministred, as in the 16. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Master of the Prison, and his Family were baptized by <hi>Paul.</hi> The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Wife, and a Seruant make a Family, where there be no more. The Family of <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Church. This Pamphleter affirmes with Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Paulinus, Esychius, Theophylactus,</hi> and others, That our Sauiour at Emaus, did celebrate the Sacrament to the two Disciples, with whom he communed in the way. There the whole Assembly were but three: whether the Sacrament was ministred, or not at that time, this is certaine; as many as hold, that the same was celebrated, must also hold, that three make the bodie of a Church, wherein the Eucharist may be lawfully ministred: and if the Eucharist, much more Baptisme, which was ministred by <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, where there was no Christian Assembly conuened. Yet doubtlesse, he was baptised in presence of his Seruants who were witnesses to the action. For Baptisme would be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in presence of some witnesses, and the Eucharist can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawfully ministred without some communicants. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Temple bee not necessary, at <hi>Caluine</hi> sayes in the 185. Epistle, yet the Infant should be baptized <hi>in coetu ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo.

                  <p>In the ninth head of the first Booke of Discipline, it was thought expedient, that Baptisme should be ministred, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ordinary dayes of preaching, not that it is vnlawfull to baptise, whensoeuer the Word is preached: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a grosse errour, wherewith many are deceiued, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Children bee damned, if they dye without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, &amp;c. In the order of Baptisme set downe before the Psalmes in metre, it is said, that the Sacraments are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of God to bee vsed in priuate corners, as Charmes, or Sorceries, &amp;c. And in the Assembly holden, 1581. it was ordayned that the Sacraments, should not bee ministred in priuate houses, &amp;c. This laudable order hitherto obserued was altered, &amp;c.</p>

so it is as great an errour not to thinke it necessary, as an ordinary meane, whereby the Grace of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and without the which, if it may be had, and be either contemned or neglected, there is no certainty that God will conferre his grace. Therefore to astrict the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Baptisme to a humane order, touching time and place, which by the Word of God may be lawfully vsed at other times, and in other places, is great temeritie, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Childe, no small danger of the losse of grace, and bringing vpon the Parent and Pastor the guilt of his bloud for contemning, at lest neglecting the ordinary meane of saluation.</p>

                  <p>In priuate Baptisme, the doctrine of Baptisme is omitted, for haste to saue the soule of the Infant as is thought, and so the Sacrament is not ministred according to the dignity of it:

and this hath bred a negligent ministration of Baptisme in publike.

                  <p>The necessarie Doctrine ought not to be omitted, and the act ordaines Baptisme in priuate houses to be ministred after the same forme that in the Congregation. Doctrine at the baptising of Infants, is not vsed for the instruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Infant, but for the instruction and comfort of the Parents and witnesses. Though it be abridged in times of extremitie, it diminishes not the dignitie of Baptisme, but the Sacrament is rather highly aduanced, when it is esteemed to be sufficient by it selfe as the ordinary meane of saluation to the infant.

How proue yee now that the practice bred the opinion? yee coniecture it was so. A good and lawfull custome could no more haue bred it, then the truth of Christs words in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. The opinion, certaynly, was bred by some misse-constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as yee say; and the way to remoue it is neither the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wordes out of the Text, nor the discharging of a

                  <p>Some Diuines condescend thus far, that the Communion may be sent to the sick in the time of the publike action. But <hi>Tilenus</hi> sayes, Whatsoeuer necessitie be pretended, scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sufficient cause can be rendred, wherfore the publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should passe in priuate, because the Ordinance of God is of supreme necessitie. The comforts of the infirme mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred out of order, does rather foster the publike infirmitie of the Church, then heale the priuate infirmitie of the sicke.</p>

                     <hi>Beza</hi> in his Questions, thinkes that the Sacrament should be sent to the sicke. <hi>Caluine</hi> holds that it should bee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at the sickmans bed-side, so both agree in this, that it should be giuen to the sicke. And <hi>Caluines</hi> saying, Epist. 363. may serue for an Answere to that, which yee alledge out of <hi>Tilenus: Quamuis nulla sit legitima coena nisi commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, quae tamen aegrotis dabitur, quia priuata non erit; adulteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na non censebitur. Nam certe partem vel appendicem esse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat publicae actionis:</hi> that is, Albeit no Supper is lawfull but that which is common, yet that which is giuen to the sicke, because it shal not be priuate, is not to be counted vnlawful, for it is eyther a part, or a pendicle of the publike action.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, to deny a necessarie comfort vnto the sick, which may bee ministred without breach of any diuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cures not the publike infirmitie of the Church, but grieues the sicke, and fosters in these who are in health, a base opinion, and contempt of the Sacrament.</p>
