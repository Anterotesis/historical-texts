         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> will not diſpute the ſeverall opinions of men in this kingdome touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the keeping of the running Horſe, becauſe I know many are idle and frivolous, ſome uncertaine, and a few in the right way: onely (in this worke) I would clear one paradox which is ſtrongly maintained, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21982:6"/>
purſued by many of our beſt profeſſors, and that is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or length of time for the preparing or making ready of an horſe for a match or great wager.</p>
               <p>There be divers, nay ſome which I know, carry the goddeſſe <hi>Iſis</hi> on their backs, that affirme an horſe which is exceeding fat, full, newly taken from graſſe, ſoyle, or lofty, liberall and unbounded feeding, cannot be brought to the performance of his beſt labour, under ſix moneths; five is too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and four an act of impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: by which they rob their noble maſters of half a years pleaſure, thruſt upon them a tyring charge to make the ſport loathſome, and get nothing but a cloak for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a few falſe-got crowns, that melt as they are poſſeſſed: yet as hereticks cite Scriptures, ſo theſe finde reaſons to defend want of knowledge; as the danger of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21982:6"/>
too early exerciſe, the offence of greaſe too ſodainly broken, <hi>the</hi> moving of evill humours too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily (which leads to mortall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) and the moderation or helping of all theſe by a ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and bringing of the horſe into order by degrees and time, or (as I may ſay) by an ignorant ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons I know have the ſhew of a good ground; for too early exerciſe is dangerous, but not, if free from violence. To break greaſe too ſodainly is an offence unſufferable, for it puts both the limbs and life in hazard, but not if it be purg'd away by wholſome ſcouring; the haſty ſtirring up of humors in a body where they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound, and are generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and not ſetled, cannot but breed ſickneſſe, but not where diſcretion and judgement eva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them in wholſome ſweats and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21982:7"/>
moderate ayrings; and for the moderation of all theſe by the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe of time, as two moneths for the firſt, two moneths for the ſecond, and as much for the laſt, tis like the curing of the <hi>Gangreen</hi> in an old man, better to dye then be diſmembred, better looſe the prize then bear the charge. For I dare appeale to any noble judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whoſe purſe hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe actions) if 6 moneths preparation, and the dependences belonging to it and his perſon, do not devoure up an hundred pound wager.</p>
               <p>But you will demand of mee what limitation of time I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for this purpose of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I anſwer, that two moneths is ſufficient at any time of the year whatſoever, the horſe having years, ſtrength, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trayning, for I ſpeak not of Colts, and he that cannot do it in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21982:7"/>
two moneths, ſhall never do it truly in fifteen.</p>
               <p>But (reply they) no ſcouring is to be allowed; for they are phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, then unnaturall, they force nature, and ſo hurt nature, they make ſickneſſe, and ſo empaire health, and that indeed nothing is comparable to the length of time, becauſe Nature works e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing her ſelf, though ſhe be longer, yet ſhe hath leſſe danger;</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that ſlibberſauce ſcowrings which are ſtuft with poyſonous ingredients, cannot chooſe but bring forth infirmity, but wholeſome ſcowrings that are compoſed of beneficiall and nouriſhing ſimples, neither occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſickneſſe nor any manner of infirmity, but bring away greaſe and all manner of foulneſſe in that kindly and abundant ſort, that one week ſhall effect and cleanſe away more, then two moneths of dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21982:8"/>
and doubtfull forbearance; I call it dilatorie and doubtfull, becauſe no man in this lingering courſe can certainly tell which way the greaſe and other foulneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will avoyd, as whether into his ordure, which is the ſafeſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſweat, which is hazardous; into his limbs, which is miſchievous; or remain and putrifie in his body, which is mortally dangerous; ſince the iſſue of any, or al of theſe, fall out according to the ſtrength of the horſes body, and the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the keeper; and if either the one fayl in power, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in care, farwell horſe for that year. All this envie cannot chuſe but confeſſe, onely they have one broken crutch to ſupport them, which is, they know no ſcowring, therefore they will allow of no ſcowring (for thus they have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with me) Againſt Barbariſme I will not diſpute, onely I appeal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21982:8"/>
to Art and diſcretion, whether purgation or ſufferance (when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is offended) bee the better doers.</p>
               <p>To conclude, two moneths I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for preparation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that time I have layd my directions: my humble ſuite is, out of a ſincere opinion to truth &amp; juſtice, ſo to allow or diſallow, to refraine or imitate.</p>
               <p>But they reply (by a figure cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Abſurdity</hi>) that whatſoever is given to an horſe more then his naturall food, and that which hee will naturally and with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe receive of his own accord, is both unproper &amp; unwholſome, and therefore he ought not to be forced with any thing againſt his appetite: this I have heard them affirme, and to this I thus reply;</p>
               <p>The naturall food of man is <hi>Bread</hi> onely, other things (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Philoſopher) are but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21982:9"/>
and ſo to be refrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The naturall food of an horſe is Graſſe onely, and ſo all things elſe to be eſchewed: at this argument both humanity &amp; divinity laughs. For other helps, as phyſick, divers meats and divers means are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for both, even by the power of the Almightie: himſelfe tels the contemners thereof, how groſly they erre in this fooliſh opinion. Nay allow them a little ſhadow of truth, that things moſt naturall are moſt beneficiall, then it muſt follow that Graſſe is moſt naturall, and ſo moſt beneficiall: now Graſſe is phyſicall, for in it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all manner of ſimples of all manner of natures, hot, cold, moiſt, drie, of all qualities, all quantities, all mixtures; ſo that whatſoever I give (that is good) is but that which he hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered out of his own nature, onely with this difference, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21982:9"/>
what he gathereth, is in a confuſed manner, clapping contraries toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo abundantly, that we are not able to judge where the: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant quality lyeth; and that which we compound is ſo gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Art and Reaſon, that we know how it ſhould work, and we expect the event, if it be not cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> by ſome greater diſaſter.</p>
               <p>But will they binde themſelves to keep the Running-horſe onely with graſſe, they know then the end of their labour will be loſſe. No, they will allow Corn, nay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers corns, ſome nouriſhing and looſening, as Oats and Rye, ſome aſtringent and binding, as Beans, and ſome fatning and breeding both bloud and ſperm, as Wheat; nay they will allow Bread of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers compoſitions and divers mixtures, ſome before heats, ſome after, ſome quick of digeſtion, and ſome ſlow, and if this be not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21982:10"/>
as phyſicall as any ſcowring a good horſeman gives, I report me to him that ſhall read the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: nay theſe contemners of ſcowrings will allow an egge, nay an egge mixt with other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and for butter and garlick they will uſe it, though it be never ſo fulſome; the reaſon is, becauſe their knowledge can riſe to no higher a ſtayre in phyſick, and authorized ignorance will ever wage battell with the beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; like fooliſh Gallants on Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day, who neither having ability to buy, nor credite to borrow a gold chain, ſcorn at them which wear them, or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Marprelatt,</hi> that not having learning worthy of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> found no felicity but in rayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt divine Fathers.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a horſe is matcht (or to bee matcht) for a runing courſe, you are principally to regard the ſtate of Bodie in which the Horſe is at<note place="margin">The three eſtates of Horſes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> the time of his matching; and this ſtate of Bodie I divide into three ſeverall kindes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is if he be very fat, foule, and either newly taken from Graſſe or ſoyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond, if he be extream leane and poore, either through over-riding, diſorder, or other Infirmitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And the third; if he be in a good and well-liking eſtate, having had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21982:11"/>
good uſage and moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be in the firſt<note place="margin">Times for matching.</note> eſtate of bodie, you ſhall take longer time for his keeping and bringing into order, as two moneths at the leaſt, or more, as you can conclude your wager.</p>
               <p>If he be in the ſecond eſtate of Bodie, that is, very poore; then you ſhall alſo take as long time as you may, yet you need not ſo much as in the former: Graſſe cannot much hurt, and exerciſe may go hand in hand with fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>If he be in the third eſtate of Bodie (which is a meane betwixt the other extreams) then a moneth or ſix weeks, may be time ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to dyet him for his match.</p>
               <p>Now as you regard theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">Particular eſtates of Bodies.</note> eſtates of Bodies, ſo you muſt have an eye to certain particular eſtates of Bodies; As if an Horſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21982:11"/>
be fat and foule, yet of a free and ſpending Nature, apt quickly to conſume and looſe his fleſh, this Horſe muſt not have ſo ſtrickt an hand, neither can he endure ſo violent exerciſe, as he that is of an hard and keltie diſpoſition, and will feed and be fat upon all meats and all exerciſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if your Horſe be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream poverty through diſorder and miſuſage, yet is by nature ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard, and apt both ſoon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his fleſh, and long to hold it; Then, over this Horſe you ſhall by no means hold ſo liberall and tender an hand, nor forbear that exerciſe which otherwiſe you would do to the Horſe which is of a tender nature, a weak ſtomack and a free ſpirit; provided alwaies you have regard to his limbs, and the imperfection of lameneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how to look into the eſtates of Horſes bodies, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21982:12"/>
what time to take for your matchings, I will now deſcend to their ſeverall orderings and die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: and becauſe in the fat Horſe is contained both the leane Horſe, and the Horſe in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate of Bodie, I will in him ſhew all the ſecrets and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which are to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the dyeting and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all three, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or reſervation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; for truth, Sir, I have vowed unto you, and truth I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you.</p>

or of fine Cotton, or other light ſtuffe (if it be in the Sommer ſeaſon) and fold it round about the Horſes bodie, then clappe on his Saddle, and girt the formoſt girt pretty ſtraight, but the other girt ſomewhat ſlack, and wiſp it on each ſide the Horſes heart, that both the girts may bee of equall ſtraightneſſe; Then put before his breſt, a warm breaſt-cloath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the bodie-cloath, and let it cover both his ſhoulders: when the Horſe is thus accoutered and made readie, you ſhall take a little beere into your mouth, and ſpirt it into the Horſes mouth, and ſo draw him out of the Stable, and take his back, leaving ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Groom behind you to trim up your Stable, to carry forth the dung, and to ſhake and toſſe up your Litter, for you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and it is a generall principle, that your Horſe muſt ſtand upon

               <p>When theſe things are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, you ſhall then bring the Horſe into his ſtall, and firſt tye his head up to the Rack in the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, then with hard dry wiſps rub all his foure leggs downe with as great ſtrength as you can, then unlooſe his breaſt cloth, rub his head, neck, and breaſt exceeding much with a dry cloth, then take off his ſaddle, and hang it by, after take off his body-cloth, then rub

               <p>After your horſe is thus clothed up, you ſhall then picke his feet, and ſtop them up with Cowdung, and then throw into his Racke a little bundle of Hay, ſo much as an halfe-penny bottle in a deare Inne, well duſted, choſen, and

               <p>After the Horſe hath ſtood on his bridle an houre, you ſhall come to him, and firſt rubbe his head, face, and the nape of his neck with a clean Rubber made of new rough hempen cloth, for this is excellent for the head, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth all groſſe and filthy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and then you ſhall draw his Bridle, and with a very clean cloth make the Maunger ſo cleane as may be, and if he have ſcattered any Hay therin, gather it up, and throw it back in to his Rack; then you ſhall take the quantity of a quart or better, of ſweet, drie, old and cleane dreſt Oats, of which the heavieſt, and the whiteſt are the beſt, or thoſe which we call the <hi>Poland</hi> Oats, or the cut Oats, for thoſe onely are wholſome, the other which are unſweet, breed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,

               <p>Secondly, that one heate ſhould ever be given, upon that day in the weeek on which he is to runne his match, as thus, If your match is to be run upon the Monday, then your fitteſt heating dayes, are Mondaies, and Frydaies, and the Mondaies to be ever the ſharpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, you ſhall give no heat (except in caſe of extremitie) in very rainy and foule weather, but rather deferre houres, and change times, for it is unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in caſe of ſhowers and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine weather, you ſhall be ſure to provide for your Horſe a warm lined hood, with lined ears, and the nape of the neck lined, to keep out Raine, for nothing is more dangerous then cold wet, falling into the ears, and upon the nape of the neck, and the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The laſt week of this fortnight, if your Horſe bee a foule feeder, you muſt uſe the muzell continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but if he be a cleane feeder, and will touch no litter, then three
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21982:35"/>
daies before your match, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time for the uſe of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell.</p>
                  <p>The morning, the day before your match, feed well both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after ayring, and water as at other times, before noone, and after noone, ſcant his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meat a little before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evening ayrings, feed as at noone, water as at other times; but be ſure to come home before ſunne ſet. This day you ſhall cool your Horſe, ſhooe him, and doe all extraordinary things of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about him, provided there be nothing to give him offence, or to hinder him in reſting, in emptying, or any other naturall or beneficiall action.</p>
                  <p>It is true, I have heard ſome horſmen ſay, that when they had put on the muzell, ſhod their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with light ſhooes, and done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions of ornament about

them, the night before the courſe, that their Horſes have taken ſuch ſpeciall notice thereof, that they have refuſed both to eat, and lye downe; But I feare there is a great miſtake in this conceit, for it is not the thing (as the muzell, the ſhooes, and other trifles) which drawes on theſe apprehenſions, but the abuſe, and miſuſe of them, as when the muzel is too cloſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, or ſuffocats and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heats the Horſe (which the net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzell never doth) when the ſhooes ſtand uneaſie, or any other toy of curioſity that gives offence, then no queſtion but theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happen; for mine own part, touching the nice and ſtraight pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21982:36"/>
hand have the workmanſhip thereof, he may many waies give offence to the Horſe, and in avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cumberſomneſſe, breed a great deale more cumber: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh every one rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd curioſity (which we call ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ornament) then by theſe falſe graces to doe injury to the Horſe. Now for the neceſſary and indifferent things which are to be done to the Horſe, I would rather have them done the day before, then on the morning of the courſe, becauſe I would have the Horſe that morning to finde no trouble or vexation.</p>
                  <p>Late at night you ſhall feed as you did in the morning. Now I do not ſet you down exactly what meat to feed withall, becauſe you muſt bee ruled according to the Horſes ſtomack, and what meat hee beſt liketh, of that give him moſt, either of the ſimple, or with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21982:36"/>
any other compounded, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the meate which is lighteſt of digeſtion, is fitteſt for this purpoſe, and the more (at this time) you forbeare Beanes, and bread, the better it is.</p>
                  <p>The next morning (which is the match day) come to your horſe before day, take off his muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle, rub his head well, and give him a pretty quantity of Oats waſht in muskadine, if he will eat them, or in the whites of eggs, or if hee refuſe both, then trie him with fine dreſt Oats mixt with a little wheat, or with your lighteſt bread; as for beans forbear them. Of any of theſe foods give him ſuch a quantity as may keepe life and ſoule together; then if hee be an evill emptier, and will retaine meat long, you may walke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and in the places where he uſed to emptie, there entice him to emptie, which aſſoone as hee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21982:37"/>
hath done, bring him home, put on his muzzle, let him reſt till you have warning to make ready and leade forth, but if hee be a good and free emptying Horſe, then you need not ſtirre him, but let him lie quiet.</p>
                  <p>When you have warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for leading out, come to your Horſe, and having waſht his navell in a little Muskadine, take off his muzzle, and bridle him up, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you bridle, if you think your Horſe too emptie, you may give him three or foure mouthes full of the waſht meat laſt ſpoke of, then bridle him up and dreſſe him, after having pircht your ſaddle and girthes with ſhoomakers waxe, ſet it on his backe, and girt it as gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be, ſo as he may have a feeling, but no ſtraightneſſe; then lay a very white ſheet over the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle next his skinne, and over it his ordinary cloathes, then his

body-cloth, and breſt-cloth, and wiſpe them round about with ſoft wiſps, then if you have a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or cloth of ſtate for bravery ſake, let it bee faſtned above all: when this is done, and you are ready to draw out, then take halfe a pinte of the beſt muskadine, and give it him with an horne, and ſo lead him away.</p>
                  <p>In your leading upon the courſe, uſe gentle and calme motion, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Horſe to ſmell upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very dung, that thereby hee may emptie himſelfe. And in eſpeciall places of advantage, as where you finde Ruſhes, long Graſſe, Lyng, Heath, or the like, walke your Horſe, and entice him to piſſe, but if you finde no ſuch help, then in eſpeciall places, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the courſe, and chiefly towards the latter end, and having uſed the ſame meanes before, breake ſome of your wiſpes under the

                  <p>Alſo in your leading, if any white or thick foame, or froth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the horſes mouth, you ſhall with a cleane handkerchiefe wipe it away, and carrying a ſmall bottle of cleere water about you, waſh your horſes mouth now and then therewith.</p>
                  <p>When you come to the place of ſtart, before you turle or uncloath the horſe, rub and chafe his legs with hard wiſps, then pick his feet, then waſh his mouth with water, then uncloath him, mount his Rider; ſtart faire, and then refer all the reſt, to Gods good will and pleaſure.</p>

               <p>It is neceſſary that our Keeper obſerve his Horſes dung, for it is the beſt tell-troth of a horſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, yet he muſt not judge it by a generall opinion, but by a private diſcourſe with himſelfe, how the Horſe hath beene fed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe food is the onely thing that breeds alteration, as thus. If the dung becleere, criſp, and of a pale and whitiſh yellow complexion, hanging together without ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more then as the waight breaks it in the falling, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo thin that it will runne, nor ſo thick, but it will a little flat on the ground, and indeed both in ſavour, and ſubſtance, ſomewhat reſembling a ſound mans ordure; then is the Horſe cleane, well fed, and without imperfection; If it be well colloured, yet fall from

               <p>As the keeper hath thus a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reſpect to the horſes dung, ſo hee ſhall take ſome little note from his Vrine alſo; and though they be not altogether ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as the other, becauſe according to the opinion of Phyſitians, <hi>Vrina eſt meretrix,</hi> Urine is a deceiver, chiefly in the horſe, becauſe hee neither eats, drinks, nor labours according to his owne minde, but his Maſters pleaſure: yet it hath ſome true faces, as thus: that V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine which is of a pale yellowiſh collour, rather thicke then thin, of a ſtrong ſmell, and a peircing condition, is a healthfull, ſound,

               <p>It is good for our keeper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the ſtrongeſt eſtate of body, which I account the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and fulleſt of fleſh, ſo it bee good, hard, and without inward
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21982:42"/>
fouleneſſe, to bee the beſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt for the performance of theſe wagers: yet hee muſt herein take to himſelfe two conſiderations, the one the ſhape of the Horſes body, the other, his inclination and manner of feeding. For the ſhape of bodie, there bee ſome Horſes that are round, plump, and cloſe knit together, ſo that they will appeare fat, and well-ſhaped, when they are leane and in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, others are raw-boned, ſlender and looſe knit together, and will appeare leane, deformed, and in poverty when they are fat, foule, and full of groſſe humours. So likewiſe for their inclinations, ſome Horſes (as the firſt before named) will feed outwardly, and will carry a thick rib, when they are inwardly as leane as may bee, and without all manner of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; There bee others (as the latter) that will appeare leane to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21982:43"/>
the eye, and ſhew nothing but skin and bone, when they are full of inward fatneſſe, and have guts as foule as may bee. In this caſe the keeper hath two helps to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his knowledge, the one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other inward.</p>
               <p>The outward helpe, is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward handling and feeling of the Horſes body generally all over, all his ribs, but particularly upon his ſhort and hindmoſt ribbes, if his fleſh generally handle ſoft, and looſe, and your fingers ſinck into it, as into down, then is the horſe foule without queſtion, but if ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it be hard and firme, onely upon the hindmoſt rib it handleth ſoft and downy, then it is a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſigne there is greaſe, and foule matter within the Horſe which muſt bee avoyded, how leane or poore ſo ever hee appeare in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>The inward help is onely ſharp
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21982:43"/>
exerciſe, and ſtrong ſcowring, the firſt will diſſolve and melt the fouleneſſe, the latter will bring it away in abundance.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be fat, and thick, and as it were cloſed up betweene the chaps, or if his jawes handle fleſhie and full, it is a ſign of much foulneſſe both in the head, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; But if hee handle thinne, and cleane, onely with ſome ſmall kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, or lumps between his chaps, then it is only a ſigne of ſome cold or poſe newly taken.</p>

               <p>After he hath eaten his proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, give him into his Rack a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till after dinner.</p>
               <p>When you have dined, give him the former quantity of provender, and the ſame in kinde, and ſo let him reſt till evening, onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

his Hay, if there bee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>At evening dreſſe him well as in the morning, then ride him forth to water, and do as you did in the morning.</p>
               <p>When you come home and have cloathed him up, let him ſtand on his bridle as before, then give him the former quantity of provender, and ſo let him reſt till nine a clock at night, at which time give him the former quantity of provender, and a pretty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till morning.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſhall doe concerning his ordinary keeping at home, where the Horſe hath reſt, and that you may diſpoſe of houres as you pleaſe; but if you be either in travell, in ſport, or other occaſion, ſo that you cannot obſerve theſe particular times, then you muſt divide the maine and whole quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of meate into foure parts, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21982:48"/>
greater quantities, and ſo give them at the beſt coveniency, ever obſerving, to give the leaſt quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before exerciſe, as a third part before mounture, and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after you come to reſt: nor would I have you to diſtract your minde with any doubt or amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe I preſcribe you five ſeverall times of feeding in one day, as if it ſhould either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-charge you, or over-feed your Horſe; queſtionleſſe there is no ſuch matter, when you looke into the true proportion; for it cannot be denied, but whoſoever is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a good Horſe, or good means to keep a good Horſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow him leſſe then one peck a day; nay the Carrier, Carter, Poulter, and Packhorſe, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low halfe a pecke at a watering, and this allowance which I ſet downe comes to no more; for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene pintes of Oats, and one pinte
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21982:49"/>
ofſpelt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beanes up-heaped, makes two gallons, and that is one pecke Wincheſter meaſure: now to give it at twice, fills the ſtomack more, makes the digeſtion worſe, and the appetite weake, whereas to give leſſe, but more oft, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is ever craving, the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alwaies ready, and the appetite never wanting; ſo that health (without diſorder) can never be a ſtranger, therefore once againe, thus much for ordinary keeping.</p>
               <p>But if you intend to give the Horſe an heate, as to hunt, gallop, travell, or the like, which I would wiſh you to doe once, twice, or thrice a weeke, then obſerve your former obſervations, onely the night before, give him little, or no Hay at all.</p>
               <p>In the morning before his heate, very early and before his dreſſing, give him three or foure handfulls of cleane ſifted Oats, waſht either
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21982:49"/>
in ſtrong beere, or Ale, then dreſſe him, ſaddle him, and give him his heate, but if it be ſoddaine, and violent, then let it bee when the Horſe hath emptied himſelfe very well.</p>
               <p>After his heat rub him ſoundly, and bring him drie into the ſtable.</p>
               <p>Then after hee is cloathed up warme, let him ſtand on his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at leaſt two houres, then give him a little bundle of Hay to teare out upon his bridle, and an houre after, feed him as hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed; onely with his firſt Oats, give him an handfull or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of hempſeed well duſted and mixed.</p>
               <p>At night, warme him a little water, and give it him luke-warm; then an houre after, give him his provender, and a pretty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till the next morning.</p>
               <p>The next morning do all things
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21982:50"/>
as in his ordinary keeping.</p>
               <p>Let him ſtand on litter both night and day, yet change of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you intend to travell or jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the morning, then give no Hay (or but little) in the morning.</p>
               <p>In journying ride moderately the firſt houre or two, but after, according to your occaſions.</p>
               <p>Water before you come to your Innne (if poſſible) but if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, then give warme water in the Inne, after the Horſe is fully coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>Trotters oyle is an excellent oyntment, being applied very warme, and well chafed in, to keepe your Horſes limbes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither waſh your Horſe, nor walke your horſe, for the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereth foundering in the body or feet, and breedeth all ſurfeits,

the latter is the ground of all ſtrong colds, which turne to glaunders, and rottenneſſe, but if neceſſity compell you to either, as foule wayes, or long ſtayes, then rather waſh your horſes legs with pales of water at the ſtable doore, then to endanger him in Pond, or River. And for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather ſet one on your horſes backe to keepe his ſpirits ſtirring, then to lead him in his hand, and with dull ſpirits, to receive all manner of miſchiefes.</p>
               <p>This I thinke ſufficient for clean and ordinary keeping.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more difficult or intricate in all the Art of horſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then to ſet downe conſtant and uncontrolable reſolutions, by which to binde every mans minde to an unity of conſent, in the buying of an horſe: for (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old adage) what is one mans meat, is another mans poyſon; what one affects, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſlikes. But to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of reaſon, the precepts of the ancients, and the moderne practiſe of our preſent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21982:51"/>
conceived opinions, I will, as briefly as I can, ſhew you thoſe obſervations, and advertiſements which may ſtrengthen you in any difficult election.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if you will elect an Horſe for your hearts content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you are to take to your ſelf this principall conſideration, namely, the end and purpoſe for which you elect him, as whether for the Wars, for running, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, travell, draught, or burthen, every one having their ſeverall characters, and their ſeverall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of beauty and uncomely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But becauſe there is but one truth, and one perfection, I will under the deſcription of the perfect and untainted Horſe, ſhew all the imperfections, and attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that either nature, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance can put upon the horſe of greateſt deformity.</p>

               <p>To begin therfore with the firſt principles of election, you ſhall underſtand, that they are divided into two eſpeciall heads, the one generall, the other particular.</p>
               <p>The generall rule of election is, firſt the end for which you buy, then his breed, or generation, his colour, his pace, and his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> becauſe the firſt (which is the end for which you buy) is a thing ſhut up onely in your owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap> The other which is breed, you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21982:52"/>
muſt either take it from faithfull report, your owne knowledge, or from ſome knowne and certaine characters, by which one ſtrain or one Country is diſtringuiſhed from another, as the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> is knowne by his hauk-noſe, the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> by his ſmall limbe, the <hi>Barbarie,</hi> by his fine head, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by his rough legs, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> by his generall ſtrong and cleane knittings together, and ſo forth of divers other.</p>
               <p>As for his colour, although there is no colour exempt utterly from goodneſſe (for I have ſeene good of all) yet there are ſome better reputed then others, as the Dapple-gray for beauty, the brown-bay for ſervice, the black with ſilver haires for courage, and the Lyard, or true mixt Roan for continuance; as for the Sorrel, the black without white, and the unchangeable Iron-gray, they are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21982:53"/>
reputed cholericke; the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, the fleabitten, and the black with white marks, are ſanguiniſts; the blankwhite, the yellow dun, the kiteglewed, and the pyebald are flegmatick, and the cheſnut, the mouſedunne, the redbay, and the blewgray, are melancholy.</p>
               <p>Now for his pace, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trot, Amble, Rack, or Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, you muſt referre it to the end alſo, for which you buy, as if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
