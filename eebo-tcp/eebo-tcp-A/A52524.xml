            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

         <div n="1" type="argument">
            <head>The First Argument.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the Case. The Plaintiff,
by his Bill demands the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of a Term for two hundred
Years, in the Barony of <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke,</hi>
upon these settlements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Fredericke</hi> late Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and
<hi>Surry,</hi> Father of the Plaintiff and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47777:3"/>
had Issue, <hi>Thomas, Henry, Charles, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Francis</hi> and <hi>Bernard;</hi> and a Daughter,
the Lady <hi>Katharine: Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Maltravers,</hi>
his eldest Son was <hi>Non compos Mentis,</hi> and care
is taken to settle the Estate and Family, as well
as the present circumstances will admit. And
thereupon there are two Indentures drawn,
and they are both of the same date. The one
is an Indenture between the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> of
the one part; and the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the
Marquess of <hi>Dorchester, Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of
<hi>Eastcricke,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Hatton,</hi> of the other
part: it bears date the Twenty first day of
<hi>March,</hi> 1647. Whereby an Estate is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to them and their Heirs; To these
uses; To the use of the Earl for his life.</p>
            <p>After that to the Countess his Wife for her life,
with power to make a Lease for 21. Years, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the antient Rents.</p>
            <p>The remainder for 200. Years to those Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees,
and that upon such trusts, as by another
Indenture intended to bear date the same day
the Earl should limit and declare; and then the
remainder of the Lands are to the use of <hi>Henry,</hi>
and the Heirs Males of his Body begotten,
with like remainders in Tail to <hi>Charles, Edward,</hi>
and the other Brothers successively.</p>
            <p>Then comes the other Indenture, which was
to declare the Trust of the Term for 200
Years, for which all these preparations are made,
and that declares that it was intended this Term
should attend the inheritance, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the said Barony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be received
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47777:3"/>
by the said <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> and the Heirs Males of
his Body so long as <hi>Thomas</hi> and any Issue Male of
his Body should live, (which was consequently
only during his own life, because he was never like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to marry) and if he dye without Issue in
the life time of <hi>Henry,</hi> not leaving a Wife <hi>prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Enseint</hi> of a Son, or if after his death, the
Digniy of <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundell</hi> should descend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Henry;</hi> Then <hi>Henry</hi> or his Issue should have
no farther benefit or profit of the Term of 200
Years. Who then shall? But the benefit shall
redound to the younger Brothers in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
How is that? To <hi>Charles</hi> and the
Heirs Males of his Body, with the like Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in Taile to the rest. Thus is the matter set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by these Indentures; how this Family was to
be provided for, and the whole Estate govern'd
for the time to come.</p>
            <p>These Indentures are both sealed and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the presence of Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgman,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Edward Alehorne</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Alehorn,</hi> both of them
my Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s Clerks; I knew
them to be so.</p>
            <p>This Attestation of these Deeds is a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
to me they were drawn by Sir <hi>Orlando
Bridgman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Contingency does happen:
for <hi>Thomas Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> dies without Issue,
and the Earldome of <hi>Arundel</hi> as well as the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> descended to <hi>Henry</hi> now
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by <hi>Thomas</hi> his death without
Issue: presently upon this the Marquess of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
the surviving Trustee of this Estate,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47777:4"/>
assigns his Estate to <hi>Marryot,</hi> but he doth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Trusts that he had it himself: Mr
<hi>Marryot</hi> assigns his interest frankly to my Lord
<hi>Henry,</hi> the now <hi>Duke,</hi> and so has done what he
can to merge and extinguish the Term by the
signing it to him, who has the Inheritance.</p>
            <p>To excuse the Marquess of <hi>Dorchester</hi> from
cooperating in this matter, it is said, there was
an absolute necessity so to do; Because the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in the <hi>North</hi> would not be brought to
renew their Estates, while so Aged a person
did continue in the Seigniory, for fear, if he
should dye quickly, they should be compelled
to pay a new Fine. But nothing in the World
can excuse <hi>Marryot</hi> from being guilty of a most
wilful and palpable Breach of Trust, if <hi>Charles</hi>
have any Right to this Term: so that the whole
contention in the Case is to make the Estate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to <hi>Charles,</hi> void, void in the Original
Creation, if not so, void by the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
suffered by the now <hi>Duke,</hi> and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signment
of <hi>Marryot.</hi> If the Estate be Originally
void, which is limited to <hi>Charles,</hi> there is no
harm done; but if it only be avoided by the
Assignment of <hi>Marryot,</hi> with the concurrence
of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> he having notice of the
Trusts, then most certainly they must make it
good to <hi>Charles</hi> in Equity, for a palpable breach
of Trust of which they had notice. So that the
question is reduced to this main single point,
Whether all this care that was taken to settle this
Estate and Family, be void and insignificant; and
all this provision made for <hi>Charles</hi> and the Younger
Children to have no Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47777:4"/>
I am in a very great strait in this Case: I am assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by as good advice, as I know how to repose my
self upon, and I have the fairest opportunity, if
I concur with them, and so should mistake, to
excuse my self, that I did <hi>errare cum patribus;</hi> but
I dare not at any time deliver any Opinion in this
place, without I concurr with my self and my
Conscience too.</p>
            <p>I desire to be heard in this Case with great
benignity, and with great excuse for what I say,
for I take this question to be of so <hi>universal a
Concernment</hi> to all mens Rites and Properties, in
point of disposing of their Estates, as to most
conveyances, made and setled in the late times
and yet on foot, that being afraid I might shake
more settlements than I am willing to do, I am
not disposed to keep so closely and strictly to
the Rules of Law as the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
do, as not to look to the Reasons and
Consequences that may follow upon the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of this Case.</p>
            <p>I cannot say in this Case, that this Limitation
is void, and because this is a point, that in
Courts of Equity (which are not favoured by
the Judgments of the Courts of Law) is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
debated with any great industry at the
Barr; but where they are possessed once of the
Cause, they press for a Decree, according to
the usual and known Rules of Law; and think
we are not to examine things. And because it
is probable this Cause, be it adjuged one way
or other, may come into the Parliament, I
will take a little pains to open the Case, the
Consequences that depend upon it, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47777:5"/>
that lye upon me, as thus perswaded, to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
my Opinion.</p>
            <p>Whether this Limitation to <hi>Charles</hi> be void or
no, is the Question. Now, first, these things are
plain and clear, and by taking notice of what
is plain and clear, we shall come to see what
is doubtful.</p>
            <p>1. That the Term in Question, tho' it were
attendant upon the Inheritance, at first, yet upon
the hapning of the Contingency, it is become a
Term in gross to <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Trust of a Term in gross can be
limited no otherwise in Equity, than the Estate of
a Term in gross can be limited in Law: for I
am not setting up a Rule of Property in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
other than that which is the Rule of Property
at Law.</p>
            <p>3. It is clear, That the legal Estate of a Term for
Years, whether it be a long or a short Term,
cannot be limited to any man in Taile, with
the remainder over to another after his death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Issue; That is flat and plain, for that is a direct
perpetuity.</p>
            <p>4. If a Term be limited to a Man and his Issue,
and if that Issue dye without Issue, the remainder
over, the Issue of that Issue takes no Estate; and
yet because the remainder over cannot take place,
till the Issue of that Issue fail, that Remainder is
void too, which was <hi>Reeves</hi> Case; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because that looks towards a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47777:5"/>
5. If a Term be limited to a Man for life, and
after to his first, second, third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Sons in
Tail successively, and for default of such Issue the
remainder over, though the contingency never
happen, yet that Remainder is void, though
there were never a Son then born to him; for that
looks like a perpetuity, and this was Sir <hi>William
Backhurst</hi> his Case in the 16. of this King.<note place="margin">Modern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, 115.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Yet one step further than this, and that is
<hi>Burgis</hi>'s Case. A Term is limited to one for life,<note place="margin">Modern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, 115.</note>
with contingent Remainders to his Sons in Tail,
with remainder over to his Daughter, though
he had no Son; yet because it was foreign and
distant to expect a Remainder after the Death of
a Son to be born without Issue, that having a
prospect of a perpetuity, also was adjudged to
be void.</p>
            <p>These things have been settled, and by
these Rules has this Court alwayes governed
it self: But one step more there is in this Case.</p>
            <p>7. If a term be devised, or the Trust of a
Term limited to one for Life, with twenty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
for Life, successively, and all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in <hi>esse,</hi> and alive at the time of the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Estates, these though they look
like a possibility upon a possibility, are all good,
because they produce no inconvenience, they
wear out in a little time with an easie interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and so was <hi>Alford</hi>'s Case. I will yet go
farther.</p>
            <p>8. In the Case cited by Mr. <hi>Holt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Roll. abr. tit. devise, 612.</note> 
               <hi>Cotton</hi> and

               <hi>Heath</hi>'s Case, a Term is devised to one for 18.
Years, after to <hi>C.</hi> his eldest Son for Life, and
then to the eldest Issue Male of <hi>C.</hi> for Life,
though <hi>C.</hi> had not any Issue Male at the time of
the Devise, or death of the Devisor, but before
the death of <hi>C.</hi> it was resolved by Mr. Justice
<hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. Justice <hi>Crook,</hi> and Mr. Justice <hi>Berkley,</hi>
to whom it was referred by the Lord Keeper
<hi>Coventry,</hi> that it only being a contingency upon
a Life that would be speedily worn out, it was
very good; for that there may be a possibility up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a possibility, and that there may be a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
upon a contingency, is neither unnatural
nor absurd in it self; but the contrary Rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as a Reason by my Lord <hi>Popham</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Chedington</hi>'s Case,<note place="margin">Co. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 156.</note> looks like a Reason of
Art; but, in truth, has no kind of Reason in it,
and I have known that Rule often denyed in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall.</hi>
In truth, every Executory Devise
is so, and you will find that Rule not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Blanford</hi> and <hi>Blanford</hi>'s Case, 13. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. part
of my Lord <hi>Rolls,</hi> 318. where he sayes, If that
Rule take place, it will shake several common
Assurances: And he cites <hi>Paramour</hi>'s and <hi>Yardley</hi>'s
Case in the Commentaries where it was adjudged
a good Devise, though it were a possibility upon
a possibility.</p>
            <p>These Conclusions, which I have thus laid
down, are but Preliminaries to the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
It is now fit we should come to speak to
the main Question of the Case, as it stands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its own Reason, distinguished from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of these Preliminarie; and so the Case is this.</p>
            <p>The Trust of a Term for Two Hundred
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47777:6"/>
Years is limited to <hi>Henry</hi> in Tail, provided
if <hi>Thomas</hi> dye without Issue in the life of <hi>Henry,</hi>
so that the Earldome shall descend upon <hi>Henry,</hi>
then to go to <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail; and whether this be
a good Limitation to <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail, is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
for most certainly it is a void Limitation
to <hi>Edward</hi> in Tail, and a void Limitation to the
other Brothers in Tail: But whether it be good to
<hi>Charles</hi> is the doubt, who is the first taker of this
Term in gross; for so it is (I take it) now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and I do under favour, differ from my
Lord Chief Justice in that point; for, if <hi>Charles</hi>
dye, it will not return to <hi>Henry;</hi> for that is my
Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s error in <hi>Leonard Loveis</hi>'s Case: for he
sayes,<note place="margin">Co. 10. 87.</note> That if a Term be devised to one and the
Heirs Male of his Body, it shall go to him or his
Executors, no longer than he has Heirs Males of
his Body; but it was resolved otherwise in <hi>Leven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>'s
and <hi>Ashby</hi>'s Case, 11. <hi>Car, B. R.</hi> Rolls
Abridgment, Title Devise, fol. 611. for these
Words are not the Limitation of the time, but an
absolute disposition of the Term.</p>
            <p>But now let us, I say, consider whether this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
be good to <hi>Charles</hi> or no. It hath been said,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It is not good by any means; for it is a
possibility upon a possibility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That is a weak Reason, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Argument in it, for there never was yet
any Devise of a Term with Remainder over, but
did amount to a possibility upon a possibility, and
executory Remainders will make it so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Another thing was said, it is void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47777:7"/>
it doth not determine the whole Estate, and
so they compare it to Sir <hi>Anthony Mildmay</hi>'s Case,
where it is laid down as a Rule, that every Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
or Condition ought to defeat the intire
Estate, and not to defeat part, and leave part
not defeated; and it cannot make an Estate to
cease as to one person, and not as to the other. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not think, that any Case or Rule
was ever worse applyed than that to this; for if
you do observe this Case, here is no <hi>Proviso</hi> at all
annexed to the legal Estate of the Term, but to
the equitable Estate, that is built upon the legal
Estate unto the Estate to <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Heirs Males
of his Body, to attend the Inheritance with a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,</hi>
If <hi>Thomas</hi> dye without Issue in <hi>Henry</hi>'s life,
and the Earldom come to <hi>Henry,</hi> then to <hi>Charles:</hi>
which doth determine the Estate to <hi>Henry</hi> and his
Issue; but the other Estate given to <hi>Charles</hi> doth
arise upon this <hi>Proviso,</hi> which makes it an absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to say, that the same <hi>Proviso,</hi> upon which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
ariseth, should determine that Estate too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The great matter objected is, It is against
all the Rules of Law, and tends to a perpetuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If it tends to a perpetuity, there needs no
more to be said, for the Law has so long laboured
against perpetuities, that it is an undenyable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against any settlement, if it can be found to
tend to a perpetuity.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us examine whether it do so, and
let us see what a Perpetuity is, and whether any
Rule of Law is broken in this Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47777:7"/>
A perpetuity is the settlement of an Estate
or an Interest in Tail, with such Remainders
Expectant upon it, as are in no sort in the power
of the Tenant in Tail in possession, to dock by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Recovery or Assignment, but such Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
must continue as perpetual cloggs upon the
Estate: such do fight against God, for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to such a stability in human Affairs, as the
nature of them admits not of, and they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Reason and the policy of the Law,
and therefore not to be endured.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, future Interests, springing
Trusts, or Trusts Executory, Remainders that are
to emerge and arise upon Contingencies, are
quite out of the Rules and Reasons of Perpetuities,
nay out of the reason upon which the Policy of the
Law is founded in those Cases, especially, if they
be not of remote or long consideration; but such
as by a natural and easy interpretation will speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wear out, and so things come to the right Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
again.</p>
            <p>Let us examine this Rule with respect to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Estates,
and see whether there it will amount
to the same Issue.</p>
            <p>There is not in the Law a clearer Rule than
this, that there can be no Remainders limited after
a Fee simple, so is the express Book: Case 19 <hi>Hen.</hi>
8. in my Lord <hi>Dyer;</hi> But yet the nature of things,
and the necessity of commerce between Man and
Man, have found a way to pass by that Rule, and
that is thus; either by way of Use, or by way of
Devise: Therefore if a Devise be to a Man and his
Heirs, and if he dye without Issue in the life of <hi>B.</hi>
then to <hi>B.</hi> and his Heirs: this is a Fee simple upon
a Fee simple, and yet it has been held to be Good.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chief Baron did seem to think, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47777:8"/>
this Resolution did take its Original from <hi>Pells</hi>
and <hi>Brown</hi>'s Case; but it did not so,<note place="margin">Cro. Mich. 18 Jac. 590.</note> the Law was
setled before; you may find it expresly resolved
19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in a Case between <hi>Hinde</hi> and <hi>Lyon,
3. Leonard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Leonard. 64.</note> Which, of the Books that have lately
come out, is one of the best; and it was there
adjudged to be so good a limitation, that the Heir
who pleaded <hi>riens per descent</hi> was forced to pay
the debt, and it had the concurrence of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> grounded upon the Reason of
<hi>Wellock</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Case cited in <hi>Beraston</hi>'s Case
where it is said, <hi>Crooke, Eliz.</hi> 204. in a devise it may
well be, that an Estate in Fee shall cease in one,
and be transferred to another: all this was before
<hi>Pells</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi>'s Case, which was in 18. <hi>Jac.</hi> It is
true it was made a Question afterwards in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants
Case; but what then? We all know that
to be no Rule to judge by; for what is used to
exercise the Wits of the Serjeants, is not a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Opinion to decide the Law. It was also
adjudged in <hi>Hil.</hi> 1649. when my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> was
Chief Justice, and again in <hi>Mich.</hi> 1650. and
after that indeed in 1651. it was resolved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in <hi>Jay</hi> and <hi>Jay's</hi> Case: but it has been often
agreed that where it is within the compass of one
Life, that the Contingency is to happen, there is
no danger of a perpetuity. And I oppose it to
that Rule which was taken by one of the Lords
the Judges, That where no Remainders can be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
no contingent Remainder can be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which I utterly deny, for there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
limited after a Fee simple, yet there may
a contingent Fee simple arise out of the first Fee,
as hath been shewn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47777:8"/>
Thus it is agreed to be by all sides in the Case
of an Inheritance; but now say they, a Lease
for Years, which is a Chattel, will not bear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
Limitation in regard of the poverty and
meanness of a Chattel Estate. Now as to this
point, the difference between a Chattel and an
Inheritance is a difference only in Words, but not
in substance, nor in Reason, or the Nature of the
thing: for the owner of a Lease has as absolute
a power over his Lease, as he that hath an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
has over that. And therefore where no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity
is introduced, nor any inconveniency doth
appear, there no Rule of Law is broken.</p>
            <p>The Reasons that do support the springing
Trust of a Term as well as the springing use
of an Inheritance, are these.</p>
            <p>1. Because it hath hapned sometimes, and
doth frequently, that men have no Estates at all,
but what consist in Leases for Years: Now it
were not only very severe, but (under favour)
very absurd, to say that he who has no other
Estate but what consists in Leases for Years,
shall be incapable to provide for the Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his own Family, tho' these are directly
within his view and immediate prospect. And
yet if that be the Rule, so it must be, for I
will put the Case; A man that hath no other
Estate but Leases for Years, Chattels real, treats
for the marriage of his Son, and thereupon it
comes to this agreement: These Leases shall be
setled as a Joynture for the Wife, and provision
for the children; sayes he, I am content, but how
shall it be done? Why thus; You shall assign all
these terms to <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Styles,</hi> in Trust for your self
and your Executors, if the marriage take no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
But then, if it takes effect, to your Son
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47777:9"/>
while he lives, to his Wife after while she lives,
with Remainders over. I would have any one
tell me whether this were a void limitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Marriage settlement; or if it be, what a
strange absurdity is it, that a man shall settle it if
the marriage take no effect, and shall not settle
it if the marriage happen.?</p>
            <p>2. Suppose the Estate had been limited to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Howard</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, till
the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> without Issue, then to <hi>Charles,</hi>
there it had been a void limitation to <hi>Charles:</hi>
if then the addition of those words, <hi>If Thomas dye
without Issue in the life of Henry, &amp;c.</hi> have not
mended the matter, then all that addition of
Words goes for nothing, which it is unreasonable
and absurd to think it should.</p>
            <p>3. Another thing there is, which I take to be
unanswerable, and I gather it from what fell
from my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Pemberton;</hi> and
when I can answer that Case, I shall be able to
answer my self very much for that which I am
doing. Suppose the Provisoe had been thus
penned, And if <hi>Thomas</hi> dye without Issue Male,
living <hi>Henry,</hi> so that the Earldome of <hi>Arundel</hi>
descend upon <hi>Henry,</hi> then the term of 200 Years
limited to him and his Issue, shall utterly cease
and determine, but then a new Term of 200
Years shall arise and be limited to the same
Trustees, for the Benefit of <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail. This
he thinks might have been well enough, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the end and intention of the Family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then this would not be a Remainder in
Tail upon a Tail, but a new Term created.</p>
            <p>Pray let us so resolve Cases here, that they may
stand with the reason of mankind, when they are
debated abroad. Shall that be reason here that is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47777:9"/>
not reason in any part of the World besides? I
would fain know the difference, why I may not
raise a new springing Trust upon the same Term,
as well as a new springing Term upon the same
Trust; that is such a chicanery of Law as will be
laught at all over the Christian World.</p>
            <p>4. Another Reason I go on is this; That the
meanness of the consideration of a Term for years,
and of a Chattel Interest, is not to be regarded: for
whereas this will be no reason any where else; so
I shall shew you, that this <hi>Reason,</hi> as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of a Chattel Interest, is a Reason that has
been exploded our of <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> There was
a time indeed that this Reason did so far prevail,
that all the Judges in the time of my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>Rich,</hi> did 6 <hi>Edvardi</hi> 6. deliver their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
That if a Term for Years be devised to one,
provided, that if the Devisee dye,<note place="margin">Dyer, fol. 74.</note> living <hi>J. S.</hi> then
to go to <hi>J. S.</hi> that remainder to <hi>J. S.</hi> is absolutely
void, because such a Chattel Interest of a Term for
Years is less than a Term for Life, and the Law
will endure no limitation over. Now this being
a Reason against Sense and Nature, the World was
not long governed by it, but in 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dyer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dyer, f. 277.</note>
they began to hold the Remainder was good by
Devise; and so 15 <hi>Eliz.</hi> seems too, and 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it
was by the Judges held to be a good Remander;<note place="margin">Dyer, f. 328. Dyer, f. 358.</note>
and that was the first time that an executory
Remainder of a Term was held to be good. When
the <hi>Chancery</hi> did begin to see that the Judges of the
Law did govern themselves by the reason of the
thing, this Court followed their Opinion, the
better to fix them in it, they allowed of Bills by
the remainder Man, to compel the Devisee of the
particular Estate, to put in security that he in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
should enjoy it according to the Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47777:10"/>
And for a great while so the practice stood,
as they thought it might well, because of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Judges, as we have shewn: but
after this was seen to multiply the <hi>Chancery</hi> Suits,
then they began to resolve that there was no need
of that way, but the executory Remainder Man
should enjoy it, and the Devisee of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Estate should have no power to bar it. Men
began to presume upon the Judges then, and
thought if it were good as to Remainders after
Estates for Lives, it would be good also as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
upon Estates Tail: That the Judges
would not endure, and that is so fixed a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that no Court of Law or Equity ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to break in the World. Now then
come we to this Case, and if so be where it does
not tend to a perpetuity, a Chattel Interest will
bear a Remainder over, upon the same Reason
it will bear a Remainder over upon a Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
where that Contingency doth wear out
within the compass of a life, otherwise, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to say, it shall not, because it shall not: For
there is no more inconvenience in the one than in
the other.</p>
            <p>Come we then at last, to that which seems
most to choak the Plaintiffs Title to this Term,
and that is the resolution in <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Baylie</hi>'s Case:
For it is upon that Judgment, it seems, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
must stand or be shaken, and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
made. Now therefore I will take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to see what that Case is, and how far the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it ought to prevail in our Case.</p>
            <p>1. If <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Baylie</hi>'s Case be no more than as
it is reported by <hi>Rolls,</hi> part 2. fol. 129. then it is
nothing to the purpose: A Devise of a Term to
<hi>Dorothy</hi> for life, the remainder to <hi>William,</hi> and if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47777:10"/>
he dyes without Issue, to <hi>Thomas,</hi> without saying,
in the life of <hi>Thomas;</hi> and so it is within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rule of a Limitation of a Term in Tail, with
Remainder over, which cannot be good.</p>
            <p>But if it be as Justice <hi>Jones</hi> has reported it, <hi>fol.
15.</hi> then it is as far as it can go, an Authority: for
it is there said to be, living <hi>Thomas.</hi> But the Case,
under favour, is not altogether as Mr. Justice <hi>Jones</hi>
hath reported it neither; for I have seen a Copy of
the Record upon this account; and, by the way,
no Book of Law is so ill corrected, or so ill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as that.</p>
            <p>The true Case is, as it is reported by Mr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Crook;</hi> and with Mr. Justice <hi>Crooks</hi> Report of
it, doth my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> agree, in his abridgment,<note place="margin">Cro. Hil. 15 Jac. 459.</note>
Title Devise, 612. There it is, a Term of 76
Years is devised to <hi>Dorothy</hi> for Life, then to
<hi>William</hi> and his Assigns all the rest of the Term,
provided if <hi>William</hi> dye without Issue then living,
then to <hi>Thomas;</hi> and this is in effect our present
Case; I agree it. But that which I have to say to
this Case is,</p>
            <p>First, It must be observed, that the Resolution
there, did go upon several Reasons, which are
not to be found in this Case.</p>
            <p>1. One Reason was touched upon by my Lord
Chief Baron, That <hi>William</hi> having the Term, to
him and his Assigns, there could be no Remainder
over to <hi>Thomas,</hi> of which Words there is no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
taken by Mr. Justice <hi>Jones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Dorothy</hi> the Devisee for life, was Executrix,
and did assent and grant the Lease to <hi>William,</hi> both
which Reasons my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> doth lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as material, to govern the Case.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>William</hi> might have assigned his Interest, and
then no Remainder could take place, for the Term
was gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47777:11"/>
4. He might have had Issue, and that Issue might
have assigned, and then it had put all out of
doubt.</p>
            <p>5. But the main Reason of all, which makes
me oppose it, ariseth out of the Record, and is
not taken notice of in either of the Reports of <hi>Rolls,</hi>
or <hi>Jones,</hi> or in <hi>Rolls</hi> Abridgment. The Record
of that Case goes farther, for the Record sayes;
<hi>There was a farther Limitation upon the death of</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<hi>without Issue to go to the Daughter, which was a
plain affectation of a perpetuity to multiply Contingencies.</hi>
It farther appears by the Record, that the Fathers
Will was made the 10 of <hi>Eliz. Dorothy</hi> the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
for life, held it to the 24. and then she gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and assigned the Term to <hi>William,</hi> he under
that Grant held it till the 31 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granted
it to his Mother, and dyed; the Mother
held it till the 1 of K. <hi>James,</hi> and then she dyed;
the Assignees of the Mother held it till 14 <hi>Jac.</hi> and
then and not till then did <hi>Thomas,</hi> the younger Son,
set up a Title to that Estate; and before that time
it appears by the Record, there had been six se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Alienations of the Term to Purchasers, for
a valuable Consideration, and the Term renewed
for a valuable Fine paid to the Lord. And do
we wonder now, that after so long an acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
as from 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to 14 <hi>Jacob.</hi> and after such
successive Assignments and Transactions, that the
Judges began to lye hard upon <hi>Thomas,</hi> as to his
Interest in Law, in the Term, especially when the
Reasons given in the Reports of the Case, were
legal Inducements to guide their Judgments, of
which there are none in our Case? But then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, At last, allowing this Case to be as full
and direct an Authority as is possible, and as they
would wish, that rely upon it; then I say—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47777:11"/>
1. The Resolution in <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi>'s Case,
is a Resolution that never had any Resolution like
it before nor since.</p>
            <p>2. It is a Resolution contradicted by some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
and to shew, that that Resolution has
been contradicted, there is—</p>
            <p>1. The Case of <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Heath,</hi> which
looks very like a contrary Resolution, there is a
Term limited to <hi>A.</hi> for eighteen years, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to the first
Issue of <hi>B.</hi> for life, this Contingent upon a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
was allowed to be good, because it would
wear out in a short time. But</p>
            <p>2. To come up more fully and closely to it,
and to shew you, that I am bound up by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of this Court, there was a fuller and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Case 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. in <hi>July</hi> 1669, between <hi>Wood</hi>
and <hi>Saunders.</hi> The Trust of a long Lease is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
and declared thus: To the Father for
sixty years, if he lived so long; then to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for sixty years, if she lived so long; then to
<hi>John</hi> and his Executors if he survived his Father
and Mother; and if he died in their life-time,
having Issue, then to his Issue; but if he dye
without Issue, living the Father or Mother, then
the Remainder to <hi>Edward</hi> in Tail. <hi>John</hi> did
die without Issue, in the life-time of the Father
and Mother, and the question was, whether <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
should take this Remainder after their death,
and it was Resolved by my Lord Keeper <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
being assisted by Judge <hi>Twisden</hi> and Judge
<hi>Rainsford,</hi> that the Remainder to <hi>Edward</hi> was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47777:12"/>
good, for the whole Term had vested in <hi>John,</hi> if
he had survived; Yet the Contingency never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and so wearing out in the compass of two
Lives in being, the Remainder over to <hi>Edward</hi>
might well be limited upon it.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, that the same Opinion which Sir
<hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> held when he was a Practizer,
and drew these Conveyances upon which the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
now ariseth, remained with him when he was
the Judge in this Court, and kept the Seals;
and by the way, I think it is due to the Memory
of so great a Man, whenever we speak of him, to
mention him with great Reverence and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his Learning and Integrity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> They will perhaps say, Where will you
stop, if not at <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi>'s Case?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Where? why every where, where there
is any Inconvenience, any danger of a perpetuity;
and where-ever you stop at the limitation of a
Fee upon a Fee, there we will stop in the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Term of years. No man ever yet said,
a Devise to a man and his Heirs, and if he die
without Issue, living <hi>B.</hi> then to <hi>B.</hi> is a naughty
Remainder, that is <hi>Pells</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> Case.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Vltimum quod sit,</hi> or the utmost limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Fee upon a Fee, is not yet plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
but it will be soon found out, if men
shall set their Wits on work to contrive by Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
to do that which the Law has so long labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against, the thing will make it self Evident,
where it is Inconvenient, and God forbid, but
that Mischief should be obviated and prevented.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47777:12"/>
            <p>I have done with the legal Reasons of the
Case: it is fit for us here a little to observe the
Equitable Reasons of it; and I think this Deed
is good both in Law and Equity; And the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this Case is much stronger, and ought to
sway a man very much to incline to the making
good this Settlement if he can. For,</p>
            <p>1. It was prudence in the Earl to take care,
that when the Honour descended upon <hi>Henry,</hi> a
little better support should be given to <hi>Charles,</hi>
who was the next Man, and trode upon the
heels of the Inheritance.</p>
            <p>2. Though it was always uncertain whether
<hi>Thomas</hi> would die without Issue living <hi>Henry,</hi>
yet it was morally certain that he would die
without Issue, and so the Estate and Honour come
to the younger Son: for it was with a careful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
always provided, that he should not
Marry till he should recover himself into such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of body and mind, as might suit with the
honour and dignity of the Family.</p>
            <p>3. It is a very hard thing for a Son to tell his
Father, that the provision he has made for his
younger Brothers is void in Law, but it is much
harder for him to tell him so in Chancery. And
if such a provision be void, it had need be void
with a vengeance; it had need be so clearly void
that it ought to be a prodigie if it be not submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to.</p>
            <p>Now where there is no perpetuity introduced,
no cloud hanging over the Estate but during a Life,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47777:13"/>
which is a common possibility where there is no
inconvenience in the Earth, and where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
of this Court concur to make it good; to
say all is void, and to say it here, I declare it, I
know not how to do it. To run so Counter to
the judgment of that great man, my Lord Keeper
<hi>Bridgeman,</hi> who both advised this settlement, and
when he was upon his Oath in this place De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
it good. I confess his Authority is too
hard for me to resist, though I am assisted by
such learned and able Judges, and will pay as
great a Deference to their Opinions as any man in
the World shall.</p>
            <p>If then this shall not be void, there is no need
for the Merger by the Assignment or the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to be considered in the Case: For if so be
this be a good limitation of the Trust, and they
who had notice of it, will palpably break it, they
are bound by the Rules of Equity to make it
good by making some Reparation. Nay, which
is more, if the Heir enter upon the Estate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the Trust, that very Estate doth remain in
Equity infected with the Trust; which was the
Case of my Lord of <hi>Thomond;</hi> so also was the
Resolution in <hi>Jackson</hi> and <hi>Jackson</hi>'s Case: So
that to me the Right appears clear, and the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
seems not to be difficult. Therefore my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thoughts are, that the Trust of this Term was
well limited to <hi>Charles,</hi> who ought to have the
Trust of the whole Term Decreed to him, and an
account of the mean profits, for the time by past,
and a recompence made to him from the Duke
and Maryot for the time to come. But I do
not pay so little Reverence to the Company I
am in, as to run down their solemn Arguments
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47777:13"/>
and Opinions upon my present Sentiments; and
therefore I do suspend the Inrolment of any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in this Case, as yet: but I will give my self
some time to consider, before I take any final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
seeing the Lords the Judges do differ
from me in their Opinions.</p>
            <trailer>The End of the First Argument.</trailer>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="argument">
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47777:14"/>
            <head>THE SECOND
ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>I Am not sorry for the Liberty that was taken
at the Bar to argue this over again, because I
desired it should be so; for in truth I am not in
love with my own Opinion, and I have not taken
all this time to consider of it, but with very great
willingness to change it if it were possible. I have
as fair and as justifiable an opportunity to follow
my own Inclinations (if it be lawful for a Judge
to say he has any) as I could desire; for I cannot
concur with the three Chief Judges, and make a
Decree that would be unexceptionable: But it is
my Decree, I must be saved by my own Faith, and
must not Decree against my own Conscience and
Reason.</p>
            <p>It will be good for the satisfaction of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in this Case, to take notice how far the Court
is agreed in this Case, and then see where they
differ, and upon what grounds they differ; and
whether any thing that hath been said be a ground
for the changing this Opinion. The Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
thus far:</p>
            <p>That in this Case it is all one, the Limitation
of the Trust of a Term, or the Limitation of the
Estate of a Term, all depends upon one and the
same Reason. The Court is likewise agreed
(which I should have said first, to dispatch it out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47777:14"/>
of the Case, that it may not trouble the Case at
all) that the Surrender of Maryot to the Duke
of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the common Recovery suffered
by the Duke, are of no use at all in this Case:
For if this Limitation to <hi>Charles</hi> be good, then is
that Surrender and the Recovery a breach of
Trust, and ought to be set aside in Equity, so all
the Judges that assisted at the hearing of this
Cause agreed; If the Limitation be not good,
then there was no need at all of a Surrender to bar
it, nor of the common Recovery to extinguish it.</p>
            <p>But then we come to consider the Limitation,
and there it is agreed all along in point of Law,
That the measures of the Limitations of the Trust
of a Term, and the measures of the Limitations
of the Estate of a Term, are all one, and uniform
here, and in other Cases, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at Chancery or at Common Law, between
the Rules of the one and the Rules of the other;
what is good in one Case, is good in the other.
And therefore in this Case the Court is agreed
too, that the Limitations made in this Settlement
to <hi>Edward,</hi> &amp;c. are all void, for they tend direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and plainly to perpetuities, for they are Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Remainders of a Term in gross after an
Estate-Tail in that Term, which commenceth to
be a Term in gross, when the Contingency for
<hi>Charles</hi> happens.</p>
            <p>Thus far there is no difference of Opinion:
but whether the Limitation to <hi>Charles,</hi> if <hi>Thomas</hi>
die without Issue, living <hi>Henry,</hi> whereby the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Earldom of <hi>Arundel</hi> descends upon
<hi>Henry;</hi> I say, whether that be void too, is the great
Question of this Case wherein we differ in our
Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47777:15"/>
It is said that is void too; and yet (sever it
from the Authority of <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi>'s Case,
which I will speak to by and by) I would be glad
to see some tolerable Reason given why it should
be so; for I agree it is a Question in Law here
upon a Trust, as it would be elsewhere upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
And so the Questions here, are both Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Law and Equity. It was well said, and well
allowed by all the Judges, when they did allow the
Remainders of Terms after Estates Tail in those
Terms to be void. I shall not devise a Term to
a man in Tail with Remainders over; the Judges
have admirably well resolved in it, and the Law
is setled (and <hi>Matthew Mannings</hi> Case did not
stretch so far) because this would tend to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity.</p>
            <p>Now on the other side, I would fain know,
when there is a Case before the Court, where the
Limitation doth not tend to a perpetuity, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth
any visible inconvenience, what should
hinder that from being good: For though if there
be a tendency to a perpetuity, or a visible incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
that shall be void for that reason; yet
the bare Limitation of the Remainder after an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state-Tail,
which doth not tend to a perpetuity,
that is not void. Why? because it is not? I dare
not say so; see then the Reasons why it is so.
The Reasons that I lie under the load of, and
cannot shake off, are these.</p>
            <p>The Law doth in many Cases allow of a future
Contingent Estate to be limited, where it will
not allow a present Remainder to be limited; and
that Rule, well understood, goeth through the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47777:15"/>
whole Case. How do you make that out? Thus:
If a man have an Estate limited to him, his Heirs
and Assigns for ever, (which is a Fee-simple) but
if he die without Issue living <hi>I. S.</hi> or in such a
short time then to <hi>I. D.</hi> though it be impossible
to limit a Remainder of a Fee upon a Fee, yet
it is not impossible to limit a Contingent Fee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Fee. And they that speak against this Rule,
do endeavour as much as they can to set aside the
Resolution of <hi>Pells</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> Case, which (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
favour) was not the first Case that was so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved;
for as I said before, when I first delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my Opinion, it was resolved to be a good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Case of <hi>Hinde</hi> and <hi>Lyon,
3 Leonard</hi> 64. which by the way is the best Book
of Reports of the later ones that hath come out
without Authority. If that be so, then where a
present Remainder will not be allowed, a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
one will. If a Lease for years come to be
limited in Tail, the Law allows not a present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to be limited thereupon, yet it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a future Estate arising upon a Contingency
onely, and that to wear out in a short time.</p>
            <p>But what time? and where are the bounds of
that Contingency? You may limit, it seems, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Contingency to happen in a life: what if it
be limited, if such a one die without Issue within
twenty one years, or a hundred years, or while <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>-Hall
stands? Where will you stop if you
do not stop here? I will tell you where I will stop:
I will stop where-ever any visible inconvenience
doth appear; for the just bounds of a Fee-simple
upon a Fee simple are not yet determined, but
the first inconvenience that ariseth upon it will
regulate that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47777:16"/>
First of all then, I would fain have any one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me, where there is no inconvenience in this
Settlement, no Tendency to a perpetuity in this
Limitation, and no Rule of Law broken by the
Conveyance, what should make this void? And
no man can say that it doth break any Rule of
Law, unless there be a Tendency to a perpetuity,
or a palpable inconvenience. Oh, yes, Terms are
meer Chattels, and are not in consideration of
Law so great as Freeholds, or Inheritances. These
are words, and but words, there is not any real
difference at all, but the Reason of Mankind will
laugh at it: shall not a man have as much power
over his Lease, as he has over his Inheritance? If
he have not, he shall be disabled to provide for the
Contingencies of his own Family that are within
his view and prospect, because it is but a Lease
for years, and not an Inheritance or a Freehold.
There is that absurdity in it which is to me insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable,
nor is the Case that was put, answered in
any degree. A man that hath no Estate but what
consists in a Lease for years, being to marry his
Son, setled this Lease thus: In Trust for himself
in Tail, till the marriage take effect; and if the
marriage take effect while he lives, then in Trust
for the married couple; is this future limitation
to the married couple good or bad? If any man
say it is void, he overthrows I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Marriage-settlements: If he say it be good,
why is not a future Estate in this Case as good as
in that, when there is no tendency to a perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no visible inconvenience?</p>
            <p>All men are agreed, (and my Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
told us particularly how) that there is a way
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47777:16"/>
in which it might be done, onely they do not
like this way; and I desire no better argument in
the world to maintain my Opinion, than that;
For, says my Lord Chief Justice, suppose it had
not been said thus, if <hi>Thomas</hi> die without Issue,
living <hi>Henry,</hi> then over to <hi>Charles;</hi> but thus, if it
happens that <hi>Thomas</hi> die without Issue in the life
of <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp;c. then this Term shall cease, and
there shall a new Term arise and be created to
vest in <hi>Charles</hi> in Tail, and that had been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
well, and my Lord of <hi>Arundels</hi> intention
might have taken effect for the younger Son. This
is such a subtilty as would pose the Reason of all
Mankind: For I would have any man living open
my understanding so far, as to give me a tolerable
Reason why there may not be as well a new
springing Trust upon the same Term to go to
<hi>Charles,</hi> upon that Contingency, as a new spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lease upon the same Trust: For the latter
doth much more tend to a perpetuity than the
former doth, I am bold to say it.</p>
            <p>But I expect to hear it said from the Bar, and
it has been said often, the Case of <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi>
is a great Authority, so it is. But this I have to
say to it, first, the point resolved in <hi>Child</hi> and
<hi>Balie</hi>'s Case was never so resolved before, nor ever
was there such a Resolution since. <hi>Pells</hi> and
<hi>Brownes</hi> Case was otherwise resolved, and has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been adjudged so since. In the next place, I
will not take much pains to distinguish <hi>Child</hi> and
<hi>Balie</hi>'s Case from this, though the word (Assigns)
and the grant of the Remainder by the Mother,
who was Executrix, are things that <hi>Rolls</hi> lay hold on
as Reasons for the Judgment. But I know not why
I may not with Reverence to the Authority of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47777:17"/>
that Case, and the Learning of those that Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, take the same liberty as the Judges in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>-Hall
sometimes do, to deny a Case that
stands single and alone of it self. And I am of
Opinion the Resolution in that Case is not Law,
though there it came to be resolved upon very
strange circumstances to support such a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for the Remainder of a Term of seventy six
years is called in question when but fifteen years
of it remained, and after the possession had shifted
hands several times, and therefore I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Considerations of Equity swayed that
Case.</p>
            <p>But I put it upon this point, pray consider,
there is nothing in <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Balie</hi>'s Case that
doth tend to a perpetuity, nor any thing in the
Settlement of the Estate there, that could be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an Inconvenience, nor any Rule of Law bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Conveyance; but it is absolutely a
Resolution <hi>quia volumus.</hi> For it disagrees with
all the other Cases before and since, all which have
been otherwise resolved; but it is a Resolution,
I say, meerly because it is a Resolution. And it
is expresly contrary to <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Saunder</hi>'s Case,
which no Art or Reason can distinguish from our
Case or that. For here was that Case which was
clipt and minced at the Bar, but never answered.
<hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Saunder</hi>'s Case is this: To the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
for sixty years, if he lived so long; to the
Wife for sixty years, if she lived so long; then if
<hi>John</hi> be living at the time of the death of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, then to <hi>John;</hi> but if he die
without Issue, living Father or Mother, then to
<hi>Edward.</hi> Suppose these words (living Father or
Mother) had been out of the Case, and it had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47777:17"/>
been to <hi>John,</hi> and if he die without Issue, to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
will any man doubt, but then the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
over had been void, because it is a Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after an express Entail? How came it then to
be adjudged good! because it was a Remainder
upon a Contingency, that was to happen during
two lives, which was but a short Contingency, and
the Law might very well expect the hapning of
it? Now that is this Case, nay ours is much
stronger; for here it is onely during one life, there
were two.</p>
            <p>The Case of <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Heath</hi> in <hi>Rolls</hi> comes
up to this: A Term is devised to <hi>A.</hi>
for eighteen years;<note place="margin">Roll. abr. tit. Devise 612.</note> the Remainder to
<hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder of the first
Issue male of <hi>B.</hi> which is a Contingent Estate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Contingency, and yet adjudged good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the happening of the Contingency was to
be expected in so short a time. Now that Case
was adjudged by my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> Mr.
Justice <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. Justice <hi>Crooke,</hi> and Mr. Justice
<hi>Berkley,</hi> as <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Saunders</hi> Case was by my
Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> Mr. Justice <hi>Twisden,</hi> and
Mr. Justice <hi>Rainsford;</hi> so that however I may
seem to be single in my Opinion, having the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to differ from the three Learned Judges
who assisted me, yet I take my self to be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by seven Opinions in these two Cases I have
cited.</p>
            <p>If then this be so, that here is a Conveyance
made which breaks no Rules of Law, introduceth
no visible Inconvenience, favours not of a Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
tends to no ill Example, why this should be
void onely because it is a Lease for years, there is
no sence in that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:47777:18"/>
Now if <hi>Charles Howards</hi> Estate be good in
Law, it is ten times better in Equity. For it is
worth the considering, that this Limitation upon
this Contingency hapning, (as it hath, God be
thanked) was the considerate Desire of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Circumstances whereof required Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and this Settlement was the result of it,
made with the best Advice they could procure,
and is as prudent a provision as could be made.
For the Son now to tell his Father that the provision
that he had made for his younger Brother is void,
is hard in any Case at Law; but it is much harder
in Chancery, for there no Conveyance is ever to be
set aside, where it can be supported by a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Construction, and here must be an unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
one to overthrow it.</p>
            <p>I take it then to be good both in Law and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
and if I could alter my Opinion, I would
not be ashamed to retract it; for I am as other
men are, and have my partialities as other men
have. When all this is done, I am at the Bar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to consider further of this Case: I would
do so, if I could justifie it; but Expedition is as
much the right of the Subject, as Justice is, and I
am bound by <hi>Magna Charta, Nulli negari, nulli
differre Justitiam.</hi> I have taken as much pains and
time as I could to be informed; I cannot help it
if wiser men than I be of another Opinion; but
every man must be saved by his own Faith, and I
must discharge my own Conscience.</p>
            <p>I have made several Decrees since I have had
the Honour to sit in this place, which have been
reversed in another place, and yet I was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47777:18"/>
to make them, nor sorry when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
by others. And I assure you, I shall not
be sorry if this Decree which I do make in this
Case, be reversed too: yet I am obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it, by my Oath and by my Conscience. For
I cannot adjourn a Case for difficulty out of an
English Court of Equity into the Parliament;
there never was an Ajournment <hi>Propter Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi>
but out of a Court of Law where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are in Latin. The proceedings here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record are in English, and can no way now
come into Parliment, but by way of appeal, to
redress the Error in the Decree. I know I am
very likely to erre, for I pretend not to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but that is a thing I cannot help. Upon the
whole matter, I am under a Constraint, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Obligation which I cannot resist. A man
behaves himself very ill in such a place as this, that
he needs to make Apologies for what he does, I
will not do it. I must Decree for the Plaintiff in
this Case, and my Decree is this:</p>
            <p>That the Plaintiff shall enjoy this Barony for
the residue of the Term of two hundred years,
the Defendant shall make him a Conveyance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
because he extinguished the Trust in
the other and the Term contrary to both Law
and Reason, by the Merger and Surrender and
common Recovery. And that the Defendants do
account with the Plaintiff for the profits of the
premisses by them or any of them received since
the Death of the said Duke <hi>Thomas,</hi> and which
they or any of them might have received without
wilful default; and that it be referred to Sir <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
