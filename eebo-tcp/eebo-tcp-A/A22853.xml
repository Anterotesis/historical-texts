            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8659:3"/>

This knowledge of God hath eternall

Thys is lyfe eternall, that they myght
know thee the onely true God, &amp; Ieſus

            <p>That this knowledge of God, by hys

in hys name, to dedicate the ſame to
your Highnes. The diligent vewe and

well, wyll not a litle enflame and ſet on

am not ignorant, moſt gracious ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
of your good and gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and how muche your Maieſtye is

oppreſſed, to pardon offences, to doo
good to all men, which all are nothing
els but fruites of that knowledge and
loue of God, whych by the woorde of
God, and Goſpell of Chriſt you haue
conceaued. And as the ſame hath alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

waxeth vyle, and chuſeth rather wyth
him to beare afflictions, and ſuffer hard
thinges, then with the world to enioye
the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon. For
ſurely ſuche is the nature of the loue of
God, that as it nothing forceth of, or
regardeth not the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of thys life,
ſo it vtterlye contemneth and treadeth
vnder foote the vanities &amp; loue of this
world, as nothing, in reſpect of his loue,
who firſt hath loued vs.</p>
            <p>To the furtherance whereof, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
reading of this litle treatiſe, wyll
very much helpe. Wherein the Author,
euen of ſenſe and feeling, and as one all
together rauiſhed with the loue of god
ſetteth forth how diuerſly, by his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
and loue, we are mooued to loue
him, and that his vnſpeakeable loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

then by loue againe. Wherein
if it ſhall pleaſe your Maieſty to beſtow

            <p>And to vvhom myght I more aptlye

that it may rather ſerue as a drop by oft fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling

that thinges earthlye, vayne, and tranſitorie

teſtimonie, that the oftener they be inculcate,
the more they ſhall double their pleaſure wyth
profit. Take this therefore in gree and good

not vnlawfull, but rather requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
in tranſlating or readyng the bookes of
Interpretours, be they olde, be they newe, or
what ſoeuer they be, ſithens they cannot well
be without ſome wartes of errour, eſpeciallye
when they are conceaued &amp; written in mood

and as in part, ſo in all made fruitfull to
the Reader. This if any man either of ſpiced
conſcience, or wayward mynde, diſlike or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole,

I wiſh him more wyt, then fantaſtically

chaunged, without preiudice done to God his

him an vnwiſeman, and more then franticke

Phiſicion, how learned or skilful ſo euer he be,
that bccauſe hee hath receaued at his handes
many wholeſome drugs, and comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

But how, or in what ſort God is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

aboundantlye: weighe and conſider by
whom, why, and to what end mankinde
was firſt created, and what thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God
made for the vſe, and eaſe of man. For
this is to be gathered, that of the thinges
created, whether they be heauenly or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall,
viſible or inuiſible, ther is none
other cauſe, but the mere goodnes of the
Creator, which is the Lord God onelye
one, and alone. Whoſe goodnes is of ſuch
greatnes, that of that bliſſefulnes, by the
which he is moſt highlie happy, &amp; bleſſed
for euer, he willeth other to be partners,
becauſe he ſeeth it may be imparted, but
not diminiſhed. That goodnes therfore
which him ſelfe is, and by the which him
ſelfe is bleſſed, onely of his free goodnes,
and not of neceſſitie, woulde he impart
and communicate vnto others, becauſe it
appertaineth to the chiefe good, to haue
will to be profitable, and beſeemeth the
moſt mightie, not to be hurtfull. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no man is able to bee partaker of
his bliſſefulnes, but by vnderſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:8659:13"/>
(for the more it is vnderſtanded, the
more fully it is had) God made a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creature, which might not onelye
vnderſtand the chiefe good, but that by
vnderſtanding might alſo loue it, and by
louyng, myght poſſeſſe it, and by poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
might vſe it: and ſo diſtinguiſhed
that creature, that part might remaine in
the purity of him ſelfe, and not be ioyned
with a bodye, as the Aungell, and parte
might be coupled to a body, as the ſoule.
The reaſonable creature therfore, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into that whiche hath not, and to
that which hath a bodye? That which is
voyde of body is called an Aungel. And
that which hath bodye, is called a Man,
conſiſtinge of the fleſhe, and a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoule.</p>
               <p>The principall cauſe therfore, why the
reaſonable creature was ordeyned, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
goodnes of God. So that both man, and
Aungell, were made bycauſe of Gods
goodnes, for by reaſon that god is good
we are, &amp; in as much as we are, we are
good alſo. But to what ende, was the
reaſonable creature created? To praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:8659:14"/>
God, to ſerue him, and to vſe and enioy
him. In the which the creature him ſelfe
profiteth, and not God. For God is euer

is to bee referred to the goodnes of the

In ſo muche that as oft as this queſtion

is to raygne. For in this the ſeruant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
the profit, and not he to whom it
is done. And as man was made for god,
ſo the world was made for man, that it
might ſerue hym. Man therefore was
placed in ſuch ſtate and degree, both that
he ſhoulde be ſerued, and that he ſhould
ſerue: that on eche ſyde, all the goodnes
might redound to hym ſelfe, as well of
the ſeruice which he receiueth, as of that
which he doth. For ſo God would that
Man ſhuld ſerue him, that not God, but
Man myght bee profited by the ſeruice.
And he alſo would that the world ſhuld
ſo ſerue Man, as Man thereby might in
like ſort be holpen. Al the goodnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to man, both of that which

O my Soule, which thy Spouſe in hys

thy neede, and to tender thy profit. And
accompliſheth both thy delight and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditye,
according to that which eyther
aboundeth in them, or remaineth in thee.
The heauen, the earth, the ayre, the ſea,

<pb facs="tcp:8659:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet thine owne reaſon ſuffereth thee
not to be doubtfull, but inſtructeth thee,
that this is not thine own due, but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And hee that coulde fynde in his hart to

               <p>And what great folly is it, not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
the loue of one ſo mighty: and howe

albeit thou were ſometime defiled, thou

according to the naturall operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his loue, which wonteth to reſtore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to the corrupted, and in them that

therefore thy cogitacion, &amp; alwaies

how greatlye hee loueth thee, in that hee
neither ſuffereth his benefit to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

how diuerſly thou enioyeſt it. And this
ſay I to thee, becauſe that ſo often as I
note or marke the courſe of his mercy, it
ſeemeth to mee that God doth nothyng
els, (if I may ſo ſaye) but onely prouide
for my ſaluation. For I ſee him ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occupied, and buſyed in keping of me,
as if he had forgotten all other thynges,
<pb facs="tcp:8659:26"/>
onely to attende me: ſo continuallye is
God preſent with mee, ſo continuallye
doth he offer him ſelfe ready for me, that
which way ſoeuer I turne me, he neuer
forſaketh me: whereſoeuer I become, he
neuer goeth from me: whatſoeuer I do,
he doth ſtill aſſiſt me. Finally he is the
perpetuall beholder of all my doinges,
and ſo much as may beſeeme, or become

And hereby it appeareth, that albeit hys

notwithſtandinge is euermore with vs.
But what is the pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing trow you
which while I thinke on hym, is wonte

and ſweetely to affect me, that euen
preſently me thinkes, I am diſtraitt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
my ſelf, &amp; both drawen and caried hence,
but God knowes I wot not whether.
Forſooth this it is, that I am altogether
altered, and chaunged into an other, and
a new creature, and feele my ſelfe in ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:8659:27"/>
felicity, as I cannot expreſſe. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is cleared with ioy and ſolace, all
the wretchednes and miſeries of my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes

blotted out of memory. My mynde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth,
myne vnderſtandyng is made

longing made ioyfull and pleaſant. And
now I know not how I ſee my ſelfe in
an other countrye, and as it were in the
armes and boſome of loue I inwardlye
hold and embrace, but what I wot nere.
And while I labour with all my might
continually to keepe it, and neuer to loſe
it, my Soule wreſtleth after a pleaſaunt
maner, as loth to forgo, that ſo faine it

haue therefore receaued of him, not only

alſo attayned the vnderſtauding, what
difference there is betwene me &amp; a beaſt.
I haue I ſaye, receaued the ſhape of my
body, and in my bodye the diſtinction of
ſenſes, myne eyes to ſee, myne eares to
heare, my noſe to ſmell, my handes to
feele, my mouth to taſt, my fete to walk,
and that more is then them al, the health
of them all. And albeit theſe are great
<pb facs="tcp:8659:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things, yet ſerueth this to augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe
benefites, that to the ſeuerall delyght of
euerye ſeuerall ſence, God hath created
thinges conſonant and agreable: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thinges brightly ſhining, many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiouſlye
ſounding, many pleaſantlye
ſauering, many ſwetely taſting, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
delectable in feeling. For the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Creatour, to this vſe &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hath geuen to thinges, ſuch diuers
and variable qualities, that euerye ſenſe
of man might haue wherin to be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In as much as the ſight conceaueth
one thyng, the hearing an other thing,
the ſmelling an other, the taſte an other,
the feeling an other. The beuty of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
feedeth the eye, the harmonye of
muſicke pleaſeth the eare, the fragrancye
of ſauour delighteth the noſe, the ſweete
verder and reales contenteth the taſte.
And who is able to reherſe, or to recken
vp all the delightes of the ſenſes, which
are ſo manyfold, that if any man ſhould
conſider eche one in his kinde, eche one
ſhould ſeeme wonderfull, and ſtraunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

tell of thinges paſt, demonſtrate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

So that if the lyfe of man ſhoulde want

               <p>What neede I tell you of the warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Birdes, the pleaſant melodye of
mens voices, or the harmony of muſicke
in the diuerſitie of tunes: For there are
moe kyndes of conſent and concorde in
Muſicke, then thought can conceaue, or
ſpeeche expreſſe, all the which notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
do ſerue the eare, as thynges
create and made to that vſe &amp; purpoſe.
And as I haue examplified the delyght

of taſte and feeling, being as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and as manyfolde as are the other.
This therefore by no meanes maye bee
gaynſaide, but that the goodnes of God
in theſe is exceedyug wonderfull: But
yet is this to be added, ſo much the more
to his glory, as it is our greater benefit,
<pb facs="tcp:8659:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for my God hath not only made my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

ſuch as is before mencioned, but hath
alſo made it healthy and ſounde: that I

right from wrong, and good from euyll:
and can ſearch for my Creatour, long for
and deſire him, &amp; that finallye can prayſe
him, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to abide with hym.
But if I ſhal confeſſe a further truth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ye, nothyng is all thys, in reſpect of
this benefit: namely that it hath pleaſed
my God ſo to diſpoſe of me, that I ſhuld
be borne, bred and foſtered in ſuch a time
and ſeaſon, and in and among ſuch men,
and ſuch people, as profeſſing his fayth,
and vſing his Sacramentes, may teache
and inſtruct me to beleue, and liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
For this I ſee denyed to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

I am called by Gods mercy and grace.
I wyll yet nowe proceede and go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

as I fel into many ſynnes and offences,
ſo if thou hadſt not ſaued me, into farre

               <p>For if I repent, thou pardoneſt me, &amp;
if I retourne, thou receiueſt mee. And
while I differre to repent, by preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

patience, and gently tarieſt for me. When
I wander thou doeſt waifte me into the
way of thy verity: againe when I ſtriue
or reſiſt, thou doeſt vanquiſh, &amp; conqner
me. When I loyter, or linger in the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

thou openeſt vnto me. Finally thou art
my loadſman to good lyfe, my ſtaffe, and

this alſo O Lord is worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

I neither craued, nor ſought, nor deſired

to ſay: That great is the dignitie of the

               </p>
               <p>Neither ceaſe I here to commend thy
pity, ſithens with ſuch patience thou haſt
borne mine offences. For I rather think
my ſelfe bound to double thy prayſe, and
to geue thee thankes with all my might:
For as muche as thou haſt not required
me according to my ſynfulnes, nor ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the earth to ſwallow me, nor fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heauen to touche me, nor lyghtening to
burne me, nor the riuers to drenche me,
nor any other paine, perill, death, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
(as I haue well deſerued) to
trouble or afflict me. For when by ſynne
I went away from thee, I not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
thine anger and indignation, but
iuſtlye alſo prouoked eche creature of
thine to maligne me. And no maruayle,
for if any mans thrall or ſeruant do run
<pb facs="tcp:8659:33"/>
from his Maiſter, he doth not onelye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
his Maiſter againſt him, bnt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all his ſeruantes, friendes, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
Therfore when I diſpleaſed thee O
Lord my God, Creatour of me, and of al
thinges being, I iuſtly for myne offence
moued euery creature to bee offended at
me. So that if the whole world ſhould
for thy ſake conſpire to fight againſt me,
or any way els to moleſt or trouble me,
I haue no cauſe to complaine that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
wrong or iniurye. For the earth
might ſay vnto me, I ought not to beare
thee, but rather to ſwallowe thee, in as
muche as thou haſt not bene afearde to
fall from my Creator, and to ioyne with
his aduerſary the Deuil, the authour of
diſobedience, ſynne, and iniquity. The
Sunne alſo might vſe this language: I
ought not to ſhine, nor geue light to thy
health, ſafety or ſaluation, but in reuenge
of my Lordes quarell, who is both light
it ſelfe, and of light the fountaine, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to hyde from thee the beames of my
beuty. And thus might euery creature
els, controle and taunt me, &amp; thus might
they wreake thier Creators iniury, if he
<pb facs="tcp:8659:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who created them, did not alſo reſtraine
them, as not willing the death of a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but that he ſhould turne, repent him
and lyue. It behoueth me therefore O
Lord, to be the more humbled vnder thy
mighty hand, and to ſhew my ſelfe vnto
thee ſo much the more thankfull, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and loyall, as thy great benefites ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and require I ſhould bee: leaſt that
differring the puniſhment of my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
thou chaſten me at thy dreadful
comming ſo much the more greuouſlye,
as thou haſt awaited my dutye with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
And thou my Soule, perſwade
thy ſelfe I pray thee, that the long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of God hath now long time expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the effect of the election of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,
which he wyl haue fulfilled in
vs, through the exceſſiue loue which hee
hath borne and doth beare vs. For this
is the cauſe why the Lord hath paciently
waited, and enclined vnto mee, and that
he hath turned his eyes from my ſinnes,
as vnwilling to ſee howe often I haue
offended him. This is the cauſe I ſaye,
why hee hath diſſembled, that he myght
commend his patience, and confirme his
<pb facs="tcp:8659:34"/>
loue. For this cauſe, as I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
me, he ſtroke my hart, and ſtirred it
vp to beholde the ſcarres of myne owne
ſynnes, and to feele the great griefe and
ſorenes of the ſame. And for this cauſe
he lead and conueyed me to the gates of
hell, and to the paynes and tormentes
prouided for the wicked. And to the end
that no hurtful conſideration of my ſins
might remaine within me, he enſpired in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
me a better comfort, and gaue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope of remiſſion, but alſo a full and
perfect pardon. And ſo fully did he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
mee, that neither reuenge can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
me, nor vpbraiding confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me,
nor imputing diminiſh his zeale or loue
towardes me. Yet there be ſome in the
world, and thoſe no ſmall many, that in
ſuch ſort pardon iniurie, as though they
reuenged it not, &amp; yet they caſt it in the
teeth. And other ther be alſo, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they be ſilent, hold their tounges, and
ſay nought, yet they reſerue the malice
in the bottom of their ſtomake, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cloke of ſilence hide ſpite and ran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cour.
But neither of theſe ſortes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules of Gods loue
<pb facs="tcp:8659:34"/>
and charitye. And therefore very farre
from theſe differeth the moſt mercyfull
nature of God: which alwaies dealeth
plainly, and pardoneth and forgeueth ſo
fully and freely, that the conſtant fayth
of the ſynners that do repent their ſins,
and forethinke their offences, may wyth

doth enritch thy pouertie. What ſecrete
affectious he doth enſpire into thee, and
with how pleaſant a cup of loue he doth

Is it a thing ſmall, troweſt thou, vyle or

pardoneth our vices, and geueth vs his
vertues, alwayes as readye to forgeue,
as to geue: being on the one ſide louing,
and on the other ſyde liberal.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore confeſſe our ſyns vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For what ſoeuer goodnes I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlye,

doth iſſue, flow &amp; procede. But
yet one thyng is there, whych more then
theſe all doth inflame, vrge, and mooue
me, to ſet my whole delight, and all my
loue vpon thee.</p>
               <p>This I ſay ſpecially, O my Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu,
makes thee to me both louinge, and
amiable, that thou vouched ſafe of thy
mere mercy, to ſuffer for me moſt ſhame
full and cruell death, in accompliſhinge
the worke of my redemption. This one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
this wholly, and this more then all
thinges, doth chalenge vnto it, euen by
ſpeciall deſert, all our lyfe, all our labour
all our ſeruice, and loue. This is yt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
ſay, that better ſtirreth, ſwetelyer ſeketh,
and greatlyer encreaſeth oure deuotion
toward thee, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thine other kindnes
or goodnes towardes vs. For in this
worke of our reconſiliation made by the
bytter panges of his paſſion, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
creatour was ſo oppreſſed with pain
and trauayle, that he was nothinge lyke
wearied in the workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
world. For of the world, and of al things
in the world,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> he onely ſayd the worde, and
they were made, he gaue the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb facs="tcp:8659:41"/>
and they were created. But for
the reſtauration of mau kynd, the paines
and the ſorowes which he ſuffered, are
in all reſpects manifolde, maruailous, &amp;
vnſpeakeable? Behold therfore how he
loued vs, that for no neede or neceſſitye
on his owne behalfe, but onelye for the
loue which he bare to vs, woulde beare,
and ſuſtaine ſuch paines and ſo meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Iuſtly therefore haue I ſayde, and
may I ſay, that this one thinge excelleth
all other his benefites. For though it be
greatly to be wayed, and alſo to be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for no ſmall token of bountye, that
a man contenteth himſelfe, or condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
frankly to gyue his goodes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet is this much more and infinitly
incomparable to geeue, and be ſtowe a
mans own ſelfe for his neighbour. And
thoughe this bee an argument of greate
loue, and charity, to geue a mans lyfe for
his friendes: yet is this a plaine profe of
great affection to dye for foes, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
as the ſonne of God did, when he
dyed for vs. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were enemies

might preſent vs blameles in the ſyght

vs to the ioyes of that kingdome.</p>
               <p>O how vnſpeakeable therefore is this

Or how marueilous a mercye was thys

with how great a raunſom
man was redeemed: which by reaſon of
his ſynne was iuſtlye enthrauled to the

be hidden, that if man had not ben raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed,
accordyng to gods good mercye
exhibited in his ſonne, with the Deuill &amp;

And all this doo I tell thee, that thou

that I know nothing but Chriſt Ieſu, &amp;

let this wonderful loue towardes me
challenge to it ſelfe all my loue to thee?
that no worldlye deſyre haue power to

that the hart or mynde that is fulfylled

yet corrupted with anye other vice,
while in the ſweetenes of thee it reſteth
conſtant and immoueable. He therfore
that to his Seruauntes geueth ſo great
thinges in this world preſent, how great
trow you, doth he reſerue for them, and
lay vp in ſtore, in the world to come?</p>
               <p>The thinges yet that he preſently ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
are temporall, but thoſe which hee

and confider how great the onelye and

the place is prepared for them. That is
to ſay, that onely high ſoueraigne good,
which is lyfe, lyght, blyſſefulnes, wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
eternitie, and ſuch other like: and
yet is but onelye one in nature moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and high good, ſufficing to it ſelf
in all thinges, needing or wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
and which all haue neede of, not
onely to be, but alſo well to be. Thys
good is God the Father, thys is the
word, that is, the Sonne of the Father,
and this is that one and common loue,
<pb facs="tcp:8659:44"/>
to the Father and the Sonne, namelye
that holy Spirite, which from them both
equally doth iſſue and proceede. And that
which euerye one of theſe is in parſon
particularly, the ſame is the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holye
Ghoſt. For euery ſinguler parſon of this
Trinitie, is doubtles nothyng els but
that high ſoueraigne vnitie, of the god-head
I meane,<note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> and the Deitie, which can
neither be multiplied, encreaſed, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this is that onely one thing
which is needefull and neceſſarye. And
that onely is neceſſarye, in the which all
good is, or which of it ſelfe is the onelye
one, and aloue good. For if eche ſeuerall
good thing, be good and delectable, then
thinke with thy ſelfe how delectable that
good is, which containeth in it the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and delight of all that is good, and
not ſuche as wee fynde, or taſte in Gods
creatures, but ſo far differing in al kinde
of excellency, as the Creator in worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
doth excell the creature. For if lyfe
created be good, howe good is that lyfe
which did create it? If health made, or
<pb facs="tcp:8659:45"/>
geuen be good, how good is that health
that made or gaue it? If the wiſedome
amiable, that conſiſteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge
of thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be made, how amiable is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
wiſedome that made all thoſe things of
nothing? Finally, if in things delectable
the delight be great and manifold, howe
great is the ſame in him that made, and
ordained what ſoeuer is delectable? O
how happye is that Soule, which maye
haue vſe of that good? What ſhall hee
haue myſſe of, that hath it? or what ſhal
he not want, that lackes it? For who ſo
hath that, ſhall together haue the goodes
both of body and ſoule: and thoſe ſuche
alſo, ſo paſſing and ſo excellent, as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eye hath ſene,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> nor eare hath heard,
nor the hart of man hath thought or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.
Why then wander we through
ſo manye thinges, to ſeeke the goodes of
our bodie and ſoule?</p>
               <p>Let vs rather loue that one God in
whom is all that good is, and it ſhall be
inoughe and ſufficient for vs. Let vs
longe after that ſimple good, which of it
ſelfe is all good, and we ſhalbe well, and
ſhall nede to ſeeke no further. For what
<pb facs="tcp:8659:45"/>
loueſt thou O my fleſh, or what deſireſt
thou, O my Soule? There and in that
ſame ſelfe good, that is: in thy Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord God, is doubtles al whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer
ye loue, or deſire. To ſpeake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the goods of the heauenlye king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or to conceaue or vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them,
no man cloathed in the fleſh, ſuffiſeth, or
is able. For in truth they are much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
&amp; better, then eyther they are thought
or perceyued to bee. For the kingdome
of God excelleth all fame, paſſeth all
praiſe, ſurmounteth all cunning, &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
what ſoeuer glorye is thought moſt
royall or famous. The kingdome of god
therfore is full of light, and peace, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
and patience, woorſhippe and glory,
pleaſure and delight, euerlaſting in ioy,
perpetuall in bliſfulnes, and repleniſhed
with all other goodes, what ſoeuer are
vnpoſſible to bee ſpoken, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And yet ought I not therfore to be
mute or ſilent, but to ſay ſo muche as I
can: Bycauſe I cannot ſaye ſo much as
I woulde. For bycauſe we beleue that
God is vnſpeakable, it is not forth with
reaſon to thincke our ſelues not bounde
<pb facs="tcp:8659:46"/>
to ſpeake of him that we can, or are able.
Neyther is this tollerable, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhoulde
not beleue of that life euerlaſting, which
God by his promiſe hath ſealed vnto vs
more a great deale, theu is ſette forth in
wryting. For neyther can the toung, nor
the pen expreſſe ſo much, as the hart can
comprehende, and yet the hart which is
of greateſt capacity, and of al things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth
moſt profoundly, and depely, is
farre to light to compriſe the Maieſty of
God, his ioyes and glory. Of the lyfe to
come therefore, we muſt earneſtly beleue
that it is both euerlaſtiug in it ſelfe, and
euerlaſtinglye happy: And that ther is
aſſured ſecurity, and ſecure tranquility,
peaceable pleaſantnes, blyſfull eternity,
and eternall bliſfulnes, wher is perfytte
loue, no feare, no dread, no want of day:
But cherefull motion, and one ſpirite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all, aſſured of the ſight of God, &amp;
there to abyde in his ioy, where that cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
is, which is the bleſſed congregation
of all Aungels and Saintes, gliſtering
&amp; ſhyning in the righteouſnes of Chriſt.
There I ſay wher euerlaſting ſaluation
aboundeth, where truth reigneth, where
<pb facs="tcp:8659:46"/>
no man deceaueth, nor can bee deceaued?
where no happye man can bee caſt out or
exiled, nor whither anye wretch may bee
drawen or aduaunced. This is the blyſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
contemplatiue life, to the which ſuch
as come by faith fruitfull and charitable,
ſhall be made lyke to the blyſſeful ſpirits,
and raigne in Gods kingdom with them
for euer. For what they beleued here,
that ſhal they ſee there, and beholding the
ſubſtance of their Creatour, wyth pure
hartes, and innocent eyes, ſhall triumphe
in ioy euerlaſting, and through the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of gods loue in mutuall charitie,
ſhall be eche together with other, &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with their God in vnitye &amp; concord.
And hauing receiued the priuiledge of the

               <p>There ſhall be ſuch gladnes, and ſuche

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the fulnes of gods goodnes and

or hauing of gods ſo manyfold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges.
For the hartes of euery one ſhall
there be open eche to other, as corporall

cleane ſhall mens conſciences bee there,
that they ſhall haue continuall cauſe to

&amp; that face to face, as them ſelues

by glorification tranſformed into the like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

without paine, life without death, agility
wythout impediment, fulnes wythout

For whatſoeuer in this life, eyther
