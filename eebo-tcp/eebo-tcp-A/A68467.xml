            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have now at length sent abroad into the world, what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended many days ago, but could not compass till this present time. Many, the most
<pb facs="tcp:13510:5"/>
of these Notions touching the Sacraments, have I preached now and then, in the course of my Lecture, as the Text in hand presented an occasion to me. In the delivery of which, because I could not be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to give that cleer, that full satisfaction which I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at least, not to all my Hearers, I set pen to paper, and out of those severall Notes disperst here and there, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially out of some explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, have I concinnate and fitted up this Treatise, which I now present to your view.</p>
            <p>The last yeer, after that by the advice of some judicious Friends, to whom I imparted the sight therof, I had altered, and amended what was thought needfull, I presented a Copy therof to our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Diocesan, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb facs="tcp:13510:5"/>
that to his Censure it should stand, or fall: if he thought fitting, it should pass abroad; if not, I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the Dust and Moths, the just destiny of unhappy scriblings. To whom should I give an account of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, rather than to Him, by whose favour and permission I enjoy my Licence, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Lecture, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall labours?</p>
            <p>It pleased his Lordship after the perusall of my papers, to redeliver the Copy to me, with that Approbation, of which I confess my selfe to be still am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, <hi>viz.</hi> That hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the substance of my Book to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, agreeable to the Truth of God, and consonant to the doctrin of our present Church. Nor did his Lordship spare to advise me, and put me upon
<pb facs="tcp:13510:6"/>
the Publication of it: alledging that tho the same things are already published: yet to see them laid together, (as here they bee) and brought into a frame, and uniform discourse, would quit the cost, and be worth acceptance.</p>
            <p>A willing mind is soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded: to say the truth, I was easily induced to send it forth into the World. In generall: for the publique benefit of the Church of God; as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Argument to bee no less needfull, than usefull to advance that respect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is due to this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance. In speciall: to plead my Cause, to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to some of my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: whose Ey perhaps, may now resolv them, in that wherin their Ear, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (tho unjustly) detain'd them doubtfull. I blame not
<pb facs="tcp:13510:6"/>
not any, who doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently receiv what is suggested by the New-come Preacher: I commend the inquisitiv Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who will examin the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, before thy will adhere unto it: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would pray the Hearer, I would intreat the Reader, not therfore to neglect the truth of God, nor less regard the Doctrin of our Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the person that now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it to the publique view, is not of greater place, of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts, of more ability. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Goats hair was usefull, and Badgers skins accepted towards the erecting of the Lords Tabernacle. And this poor Treatise of mine, may through Gods blessing, bee profitable (I hope) to some, and do some good in the Church of God. Howsoever: I have done what I could: The
<pb facs="tcp:13510:7"/>
rest I leave to God.</p>
            <p>How needfull the Argument is, you shall find observed and breefly touched in the preface; which when you have read, the rest of the discourse is subdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three generall parts. In the first of which I have endevoured to shew what a Sacrament is: The end and issue whereof is, to determin the Number of true-born Sacraments.</p>

            <p>And thus have you the summe of this Treatise: By which you may guess whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be worth the reading, yea, or no: I have been (as you see) larger in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part, than in the Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall:
<pb facs="tcp:13510:12"/>
this third generall part being equall to the other two. And yet I have not been so large as some Readers would think fitting; neither in this later, and much less in the two former parts therof. My A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie is: This is not an age to blot paper in: They that most commonly bestow time in reading books, are of the Clergie; and to them five words spoken with reason, and understanding, are better than five thousand tautologies, and iterations. Among the Laity, if any one find not full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Minister is at hand in every parish, of whom he may inquire. And I humbly intreat my brethren of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery (what I faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to them in the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) to do me right, in helping their people, that desire it, to
<pb facs="tcp:13510:12"/>
apprehend the best constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what may seem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: imitating therin that of Saint <hi>Austin, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>De A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima, ad Renatum, Vbi mihi animus ergame hominis ignotus est &amp; incertus, meliùs arbitror meliora sentire, quam in-expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata culpare.</hi> As for the truth of what I have set down do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally, and positively, I know my Brethren of the Clergie (if Ministers of the Church of England) may not desert me, much less oppose me, except they will desert their own subscription, in as much as what I have written, hath been collected (<hi>totidem ferè verbis</hi>) out of those books to which they no less than I have heretofore subscribed.</p>
            <p>To this Treatise I have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and printed with it the copy of a Sermon, preached lately (<hi>sc. Iun.</hi> 24. 1638) in
<pb facs="tcp:13510:13"/>
the publique Sermon appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross. So much the rather, because, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter is an argument co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen-german to the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: so in it I have the more largely insisted upon that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin which is most doubted, and discussed, <hi>viz.</hi> The efficacy of Baptism.</p>
            <p>In this Sermon (to give you a taste therof) <hi>After the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Text, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the phrases: you have something interserted tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this Doctrin,</hi> That death doth free us from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinn. <hi>The which, tho a truth, and very usefull, as there I shew for consolation against the fear of death: yet is but briefly touched, and passed over, as not being that which the text in hand doth chiefly aym at. This is indeed, as then I come to shew</hi> That Christians are dead men
<pb facs="tcp:13510:13"/>
and therfore free-men. <hi>Dead, while they are alive, not in sinn, but to sinn, as</hi> Theophylact (<hi>which I pray the Reader to set down in the margent) doth out of</hi> vers. 2. <hi>supply the text, thus reading:</hi> Qui mortuus est pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, justificatus est à peccato. <hi>This is by being baptised into the death of Christ,</hi> i.e. <hi>either into the profession of conformity with Christ in his death, or else into the participation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the power, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Christs death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is a Truth, and the ground of a good Doctrin,</hi> viz. That by the vow of Baptism Christians are dead to sin. <hi>An Argument of confusion to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall-Gospellers. But the second I pitch upon, because, as</hi> Beza <hi>well noteth:</hi> Non ex confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate communio, sed ex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione conformitas; <hi>becaus we partake of the power of
<pb facs="tcp:13510:14"/>
Christs death: thence it is that we are conformable to him in mortification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, to be baptised into the Communion of Christs death: what is it else, but by Baptism to be partaker of his death, and consequently discharged from the Dominion of sin: So the Doctrin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Christians howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before their Baptism, they be servants of sin, yet by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism they are freed from the service, and dominion therof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The uses of this Doctrin are three-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, for instruction, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the efficacy of Baptism; touching which, two cautions</hi>:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That the efficacy of the Sacrament is but instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That it pre-supposeth a right Qualification in the Receiver.</hi>

            </p>

            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether all infants be regenerate in Baptism.</p>
               <p>An Answer set down in two conclusions.</p>
               <p>An objection taken from the usuall phrase of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in pressing the duty of attendance upon the means of grace.</p>
               <p>The answer to it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, for exhortation, And this directed:</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>First, to Parents, To watch carefully over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enslaved.</p>
                  <p>To acquaint them with this benefit: to call upon them &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To all Christians.</p>
                  <p>In generall: to walk as Free-men.</p>
                  <p>In speciall: to hinder the

reign of sinn in themselves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Christians have helps to subdue the power of sinn; <hi>sc.</hi> An interest.</p>
                  <p>First, In the blood of Christ streaming in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints: the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prayers.</p>
                  <p>A Caveat. That if Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans desire this benefit, they must not forfeit their interest by running into tentation.</p>
               </q>
Hitherto the copy of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>These two little books, not much unlike to the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows two mites, have I cast into the Treasury of the Church; I pray God they may be no less accepted with
<pb facs="tcp:13510:15"/>
God, and all good men; that so the succesfulness of these my poore endevours may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to go on cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the work of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and to bestow some big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger volumn upon the Library of this Church, and Nation. I know we are not born for our selvs alone, not for this present age alone. I should choose rather to be too busie (in this kind) and to over-do, rather than to be wanting to my place, and people.</p>
            <p>I cannot hope to live (at least not here wher I am) til I see the harvest of my seeds time, the fruits of my labour here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. We of the Ministery, commonly our greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, in the happy growth of grace in those, whom at our first entrance we find to be of tender years. Nor do I doubt but that amongst these, there
<pb facs="tcp:13510:16"/>
will be found some, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will rejoyce in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of those holy truths, which they have heard, received, and gathered up in their attendance upon my poore labours: and they will say, this, and this did I then heare, and learn: and tho for the present I felt no great sweetness in it, yet do I now taste it, and know it to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth of God. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, this Doctrin of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and their efficacy, which seemed so strange, and uncouth in the ears of divers of the elder Audience, will by the younger sort be received now, and hereafter remembred with happy congratulation.</p>
            <p>Now then for their sakes that they may keep fresh in memory what they have heard, that they may recall to mind what perhaps hath slipt,
<pb facs="tcp:13510:16"/>
and is forgotten, have I sent abroad these, and if God say amen, I shall send abroad some other of my notes. For their sakes, I say, that they may have wherwithall to perswade others what themselvs do know: <hi>viz. That those things</hi> (to use the phrase of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a case not much unlike) <hi>that those things wherof divers have been informed concerning me, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that I also walk order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and keep the Law:</hi> The law I mean of holy teaching, and edification; not wasting the time in curious, and needless speculations; but endevouring (<hi>pro posse meo</hi>) both plainly to explicate, and profitably to apply, what the text of Holy Writ hath led me to.</p>
            <p>In the prosecuting of which, if I have proceeded otherwise (as some say) than others have
<pb facs="tcp:13510:17"/>
done before me; let the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader do that, which those Hearers should have done, <hi>sc.</hi> try, and examine which of us doth most neerly follow the steps of the holy Scripture, and tread in the path of our Mother-Church. To me I confess, it is a scruple to depart from the pattern of wholsome Doctrin, to the which I have subscribed: if it be not so to others, it is not my fault if I dare not follow them. But there is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, who have learned to pretend the authority of such Worthies, and such grave Divines, meerly to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance what themselvs have pitcht upon, in prejudice, and opposition of the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13510:19"/>
of all goodnesse: yet hath not the love of Christ our Saviour stayed here; hee thought not this suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but hath added the Revelation of this benefit for our Comfort; Yea hee hath also wisely invented the way, by which this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit might be conveyed to us, and we put in full posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the same: Nor is the later a lesse demonstration of his singular love than the former. Without the Redemption purchased, what are wee, but a masse of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, borne to endlesse woe, and irrecoverable destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Without the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this Redemption, and the means by which it may become ours, what is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13510:19"/>
this life of ours, but a perpetuall disconsolation? Wherefore, so often as wee blesse God for the benefit of our Redemption purchased by the blood of Christ; so often let us remember to praise him for the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it made unto us by his spirit.</p>
               <p>The way and meanes by which the spirit of Christ doth acquaint us with this Redemption, is the ministery of the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And here is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and malice of Sathan that grand enemy of our Salvation. Hee could not hinder the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but hee will do what hee can to hinder us from the knowledge, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13510:20"/>
comfort of the same: For this end, one while hee seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to darken the light of the Sunne, otherwhiles to oppresse the heat thereof: sometimes to trouble the pure streams of knowledge running in the word, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to turne aside the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of comfort streaming in the Sacraments. Here then is the office of the Church and the members thereof, to preserve (as much as they can) the text of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments free from all Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To preserve I say if it may be; or else to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate both the one, and the other from that which is contracted; that in them,

               <p>Since the time that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (truly so called) hath beene discovered to be meere delusion rather than true Christian doctrine, by the light of the glorious Gospell in this later age, breaking forth like the Sunne from under some cloud; It may be worth our labour to note how by little and little, one point after another hath beene purged from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13510:21"/>
and by the labours of of the industrious learned brought to that light, and perfection, that we cannot readily see what more can be added. If any thing bee yet wanting, it is time that the labours of the faithfull Ministerie be applied to the doctrine of the Sacraments, that it also may be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleared from the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits of errour, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and the people taught to yeeld that respect, and honour, which is due to that sacred ordinance.</p>
               <p>For this cause have I (tho the unablest of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) set pen to paper, that what light my selfe have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by perusing the doctrine of our Church touching this

argument, I may not envy it to others (a fault too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in this age) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther present it to their view, that others also may see the same, and so receive more fruit, and comfort by the Sacraments than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. At least, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be stirred up to dig deeper, and seek further, than happily as yet they have done, into the doctrine, and usefulnesse of these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred mysteries.</p>
               <p>To come to the knowledge of the nature and use of the Sacraments, three things are especially to be learned, <hi>viz. What a Sacrament is: Why it was instituted:</hi> and <hi>what qualification is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Receivers.</hi> To

part, wee have a cleare expression of the Quiddity and Essence of the Sacraments together with the Author and Originall of them; Of which in order.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>The Essence of a Sacrament.</head>
                  <p>THis is conteined in the Genus, and Species. The Genus, or common nature of a Sacrament is, that it is a sign; The Specificall nature or difference of a Sacrament is, that it is externall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
                  <p>A SIGN: This I say sets forth the common nature of a Sacrament: The word is a note of Relation, and puts us upon this question. Whereof is it a sign? The answer is ready; A sign of grace: The Article addeth <hi>signs of grace,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13510:24"/>
and Gods good will towards us.</hi> What this Grace, this effect of Gods good will to us ward is, wee shall best determin, when wee find it in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sacraments: For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the Church saith, it is Inward, and spirituall, that is, such a Grace, as resteth not in the body, but reacheth to the inner man, the Soul, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Moreover, it is a <hi>grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us,</hi> not only reported, or proffered, but also given, and put into our possession.</p>
                  <p>OUTVVARD and VISIBLE. This word puts a difference betwixt this, and other signs of grace. This is a signe for Representation, and therefore must be obvious to the senses. By these is knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the understanding: Thus is the Body a loving yoke-fellow, and helper to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13510:25"/>
the Soul: Neither is this sign only outward, but also visible and subject to the Eye: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in differing from the word: Grace maketh way into the Soul, by the Eare, by the Eye: By the Eare in the word, by the Eye in the Sacraments. The Sacrament is a visible representation of grace; Thus hath God provided for Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Confidence; for Faith, and Assurance: What we heare wee do beleeve, but what wee see, wee know. Wherefore as in the word, we use our eare to heare; so in the Sacrament, we use our eye to see, and behold; else are wee justly blamed. Hath God set up the brasen Serpent, and will not Israel turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to behold the same? Note that this outward visible signe by a peculiar name is termed the Element, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13510:25"/>
puts us in mind that it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall substance, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth therein from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Actions, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Administration; And which by their visibility might put in to be accounted signes: but indeed are not, as in the sequell will appeare.</p>

                  <p>THis is intimated in those words of the Catechisme <hi>Ordained by Christ himselfe.</hi> The Sacrament is a signe by institution, not meerely by naturall signification. Truth there is in the signe a naturall Aptitude to represent what is signified; yet because it hath a resemblance to other things also, the institution doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it to this individuall: Hence there is need of a word to be joyned to the Element to

But, saith he, let the word bee joyned to the Element, and then it is made a Sacrament: which to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of a bare, and naked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the words, which the Schoolmen call the form of the Sacrament, is too je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june, and barren: Most true it is, that the right, and due form of Administration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that there bee made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13510:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a plain and audible recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the precept, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise both. And this in our Church-Liturgy is the matter whereof the prayer of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration consisteth. Yet not our formall Recitation of them is that which doth give virtue to the Element, but the institution of Christ, <hi>i.e.</hi> the precept which he gave for our warrant, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which he added for our encouragement. He I say: For who else durst give such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept? who else can performe such a promise? <hi>Such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> if not given by Christ, is a direct breach of the second Commandement, which as it forbiddeth all Images of God, made by man for this end, to convey honour to God; so also all Images of his grace ordained for the conveyance of holinesse to man. <hi>Such a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13510:27"/>
promise</hi> by which in the use of this, or that creature, Grace may bee expected, who can performe but Christ alone? of whose fulnesse wee do all receive grace for grace: If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none but he can perform the promise of grace, it is fitting that he alone should appoint the signe: And in this do all agree: That Sacraments are Ceremonies of Christs owne immediate ordination,<note place="margin">

The Anabaptists also dispute this question, against their brethren of the Separation. Something also there hath been to do in our Church about it: see <hi>Cartwright</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13510:34"/>
women, and Layicks any power; <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> pleading for it: at last King <hi>Iames</hi> determined the question, in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at Hampton Court, and caused the Rubrick of private baptism in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion book, to appropriate the act of baptising to the lawfull Minister; and that justly, it being most properly the office of the Minister, to stand in the place of God, and to seale his children in their forheads.</p>
               <p>TE, THEE; noteth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie baptised, which is another, not the Minister: so that no man may baptise himselfe, wherein is detected the folly of <hi>Smith</hi> the Se-baptist, who having runne the wild-goose-chace, separating first from the Church of England, then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13510:34"/>
from the Brownists, came at last to the Anabaptists, yet not as a disciple, but as a Father, and founder of a new Church, and therefore baptised himselfe, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> nor any other did before him.</p>
               <p>To end this discourse, wee see what is Essentiall in the forme of Administration, what is accidentall: wee in our Church retain that form of words, which hath been used in the Church of Rome; and justly too; it being confessed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be as well as it could be framed: wherein we may do well to note the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God over his Church, who even in the corruptest time, hath preserved intire this form of Administration, together with the proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptism: by which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13510:35"/>
even the Priests of the worst times baptised Infants into the true faith of Christ: and like a leprous, and infectious mother, is the present Church of Rome; she beareth, and bringeth forth sound children, but presently hazardeth the infection of them with her milk, as it were with deadly poyson.</p>
               <p>That this Element together with the Ceremony, and the form of words used in the Administration, were all of them, ordeined by Christ, is so plain by that text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. that it cannot be denied: thus have we manifested both the Essence, and Originall of Baptism.</p>

and figure, as it is congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to eat flesh, in its figure, which was allowed for the proper food, and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body: yet since Christ hath commanded us to drink that Wine, which he himselfe hath called his blood, we must do what he biddeth, and leav him to stop the mouths of Cavillers: when God calls for obedience by the letter of his word, we must not stand to ask him the ground, and reason of his Commandement: Duties belong to us: Reasons to God.</p>
               <p>Note, that as the Bread ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally was unlevened, that Bread I mean, which Christ our Saviour used, at the first institution; so also the wine in the Cup, was not intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for this new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: our Saviour took
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13510:38"/>
such ordinary provision, as the custome of the country used in the Passeover: happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also the wine that he used was mingled with water; it being the custome of the country to dash their wine to prevent Drunkennesse: which things are fit to be noted, lest we should place any supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the imitation or not imitation of those things whih were but accidentall. The Catholick Church hath appointed Wine to be used, yet indulgence was granted to the Norwegians to use other drinks.

our blessed Saviour, touching the Cup; <hi>This is my blood of the new Testament which is shed for many:</hi> plain also it is out of the speciall end of the Institution of this Sacrament, which (saith our Church out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) is <hi>for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall remembrance of the death of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now for the Sacrament of Baptism, that which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the water (to speak exactly) is the blood of Christ, not the blood in the living bodie, but the blood that was spilt, and shed upon the ground: prefigured in the Law by the blood of the sacrifices, which was sprinkled upon the unclean, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the flesh. The blood of Bulls, and Goats were shaddows of prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the body is Christ;

pleased the providence of God, to make use of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Souldier, to peirce the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and gore the heart, which being done, it is impossible for any one to live. And this watery substance is that, which the water of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, and the water of Baptism doth properly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the which, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence there is a different respect of the blood of Christ, shed for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, and a two-fold use of it after the effusion, <hi>viz.</hi> partly for Nutrition in the Supper: partly for ablution
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13510:41"/>
and purgation, as in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptism: hence are those phrases of washing, and cleansing so <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus both Sacraments have speciall Relation to the death of Christ, which the phrase of Scripture doth manifest: for of Baptism it is said, that by it <hi>we are baptised into his death,</hi> and <hi>buried with Christ, Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. and the Supper is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and commemoration of the death of Christ: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 26. and this doth fully manifest unto us, what that grace is, which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sacrament, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13510:42"/>
how the word <hi>Grace</hi> used in the definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be understood. Doubtlesse hereby is meant not a quality infused, but a gracious gift bestowed upon us: Now of Gods gracious gifts, some are corporall, and reach no further, than the body; Others are spirituall touching the state, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the soule, and such is that Grace, or gracious gift presented in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Again, whereas there be divers sorts of these spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, that <hi>Grace</hi> which is the ground-work of the Sacraments, is not any among the Gifts, and Graces of the Spirit, but the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gift of the Father, who gave his own Sonne for us; indeed Christ himselfe is that gracious gift of God, which is presented to us in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13510:42"/>
the Sacrament. <hi>Christus quâ passus,</hi> the body and blood of Christ given for mankind in the work of redemption,<note place="margin">Christ the grace signified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> are by the Sacrament given to mankind, for the application of that redemption. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> is deceived, while in the heat of his scholasticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he will needs have the Grace of Justification (or as we do better stile it, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) to be the thing which is principally signified in the Sacrament. That is an effect, and consequent, but Christ crucified is the speciall signification of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Reason giveth it, for it is against the nature of the cause, especially of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cause, to represent the effect which it self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth: Adde this; the nature of a sacramentall sign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in analogicall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13510:43"/>
now this is most apt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these Elements and the body and blood of Christ: so also of the operation of the one upon the body, and of the other upon the soul: but no similitude at all betwixt these Elements, and the grace of Justification. To conclude this: both the doctrine of the Schoolmen, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying of the ancients, received from Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ovv from this first part of the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein we have heard the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and Originall of the Sacrament, we may justly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this <hi>Corollary, viz. That if either part be wanting</hi> (that is, if either there want a visible sign, or an invisible grace,) <hi>there can be no Sacrament</hi>: And thus doth the Church teach her children, that the parts of every Sacrament are, and must be two, the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible sign, and the inward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13510:44"/>
grace.<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> How can this be (might some curious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick say,) is the Genus, and and common nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the sign of grace, and is grace now become part of the Sacrament? Is not this all one, as if the man should be called a part of the picture which is the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the man? in very deed to speak properly, grace is no part of the sign, but <hi>Subjectum,</hi> or <hi>Substratum praesuppositum,</hi> the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work thereof: but when we speak in the vulgar phrase, we call those things parts, which are any way Essentiall, and so grace is a part of the sign, that is, essentiall to it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be a sign of grace, it is not a Sacrament; adde this also, that howsover the School saith, that the sign is properly (as indeed properly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13510:44"/>
it is) the Sacrament, and doth relatively oppose it to the grace signified: yet the Church speaking to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the simple, calleth the whole sacred action of Baptism, and of the Supper, by the name of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which taken in this larger signification, is (as it were) compounded of two things, one earthly, the other heavenly: and these vulgarly are called the parts of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as being both of them essentiall, to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Hence is an argument fetcht to overthrow Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, which by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread into the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, hath taken away the sign, and so spoyled the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; for as the soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and the body sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated is not the man; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13510:45"/>
the sign without the grace, nor the grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the sign, but being both together considered rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, do make a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: there may be therfore no change of the one into the other.</p>
               <p>Hence also fetch arguments to convince those five obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Roman Church, to be no true born Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, properly so called; which is thus proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
               <p>MATRIMONY doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr no grace, nor make the married ever a whit the more acceptable in the sight of God; consequently is no Sacrament: nay more, it doth not signifie that grace, which we find to be specially signified in the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> the Passion of Christ. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13510:45"/>
doth shew, that it signifieth the mysticall union betwixt Christ and his Spouse, the Church; and our Church doth grant further, that God <hi>hath consecrated the state of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, to such an excellent mystery that in it is signified, and represented the spirituall marriage, and unity betwixt Christ and his Church:</hi> And indeed, it hath a fair analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in respect of this particular: But the mysticall union is not that, which Sacraments are born to signifie. So then since Matrimony doth neither signify the Passion of Christ, nor conferr any grace, or if any, not the grace of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nor forgivenesse of sinnes, we conclude it to be no proper Sacrament. To this might be added, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony hath no sign, and therfore how should it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13510:46"/>
for what should be the sign? not the parties contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, for then where be the Receivers? nor the consent that passeth between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by words, and signs: for what Analogicall Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have these with the Grace of justification? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it therfore (as doth our Church) for an honourable estate, which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the benefit of this life, for the mutuall comfort and assistance of the man and woman; but not any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly so called.</p>
               <p>ORDINATION doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conferr a certain grace, so may that spirituall and ghostly power be not unfitly called, wherin consisteth the dignity of the Ministery (thus understand those words of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13510:46"/>
our Saviour, breathing on his Disciples, and saying, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv yee the holy Ghost,</hi> Iohn 20.) but this is not the grace of Justification, and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: consequently it is no Sacrament properly so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>ABSOLVTION seemeth to come something nearer to the nature of the Sacrament, in respect of the effect therof, which (say they) is <hi>Remission of sinnes:</hi> and indeed so much the words used by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour saying, <hi>I do absolve thee,</hi> do seem to import: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may it be denyed, but that this Authority of the Ministery, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>Ministery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18</note> is grounded upon those texts so often alleadged, <hi>viz. Matt.</hi> 16.19. and 18.18. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13510:47"/>
do plainly speak of a certain power, and authority in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or reteining sinns, which the Minister hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: neither is this peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the Episcopall Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but common to the Presbyteriall function: Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops indeed are said to have the keys in speciall manner, and consequently a peculiar kind of absolution, which consisteth in removing, and taking away the censurs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: but beside this, there is a power of Absolution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to the Ministery in their Ordination; not impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, or Prince-like, for so that of the Pharises is true, <hi>none can forgive sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See his Sermon entitled, <hi>of the power of Absolution</hi> pag. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>but God alone:</hi> but ministeriall, and Judge-like: This power being primarily in Christ as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, it hath (to use the words of the Reverend Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13510:47"/>
it hath pleased him out of his Commission to grant a warrant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Ministery, and therby to associate them to himself, and to make them <hi>Co-operatores</hi> workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him. So that now by virtue of this their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, they have power not only to publish the conditions of Peace, and Reconciliation to the sonns of men, <hi>viz. cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denti remittentur peccata,</hi> if they beleev, they shall receiv remission; but also to apply the comfortable assurance of remission to this and that man in particular, and upon the sight, and approbation of Penitency, and unfained sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to say to him, as did our Saviour to the Palsie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-man, <hi>tibi remittuntur peccata:</hi> Bee of good cheer, thy sinns are forgiven thee.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13510:48"/>
Thus as the Schools do speak; <hi>clave non errante,</hi> as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it doth or may do through the hypocrisie of the Poenitentiary, if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister faile not in the key of knowledge, that is, in discerning, and rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the penitentiall sorrow, and contrition of the peccant, (contrition I say, for Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth not to them, who feel not the burthen of their sinns) if he faile not in that, his key of power, and Authority delegate is found effectually operative, and hath in it the stamp of God, for the quiet and content of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conscience.</p>
               <p>A great power doubtless; and for which the people may very well (as we find in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.8. they did) glorifie God, which had given such power unto men, yet is not this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13510:48"/>
enough to make Absolution a legitimat and proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because we know it to be essentiall to a Sacrament, not only to conferr grace, but to do it by a sign, a visible sign, a materiall Element, which naturally having an aptitude to resemble, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is appoynted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, and convey Christ to the worthy receiver, this sign is wanting in Absolution; as before in Ordination: words we hear, and gesticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we see, as namely the Imposition of hands: but we have been taught by the Schoolmen, and do beleev it for a truth, that Sacraments do consist of things and words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta constant rebus ut ex materiâ &amp; verbis ut ex for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ.</hi>
                  </note> as it were of matter and form: of things (I say) not of words, nor gestures, which have no analogicall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the grace of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13510:49"/>
much lesse of the Passion of Christ. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they can make no Sacramentall sign, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sign there can be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and legitimate Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>CONFIRMATION hath a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall and visible Element indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chrism: which in the former hath been wanting, but not of divine Institution: we may not deny, but the use of their Chrism is ancient, as appeareth by the records of the Church:<note place="margin">See Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councells alleadged by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier.</hi>
                  </note> very early did it creep into the Church, but wanting divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is no sacramentall sign, and therfore Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no Sacrament proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called. As for those texts of Scripture, <hi>sc.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.20. which they contend to be allusions to the

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13510:53"/>
Branches of this end,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> why they were ordained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A MEAN OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEYANCE; and so of receiving the Grace signified. Herein differ Sacraments from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signs, in that they do not only signifie and represent to the understanding, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that gracious gift of God, but also as Instruments do convey the same: Like the Turf, and the Twig, in Livery and Seiz in; like the Sergeants Mace in receiving his office: Such are the Sacraments; not unfitly compared to Chanells, and Conduit pipes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the water from the Spring to the Cistern, for even so do the Sacraments convey Christ with all his benefits to the worthy receiver.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A PLEDG OF ASSV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13510:53"/>
to assure us therof: note that word [therof] must be referred to the verb <hi>Receiv,</hi> not to the noun <hi>Grace.</hi> Sacraments do not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us that such a benefit there is, but that it is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by receiving the sign; and indeed this doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former: for as by that legall instrument of Livery, and Seizin, the full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the purchase is known to be taken, in taking and receiving that Instrument; so here, whosoever doth, (as all must, and ought) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Sacrament to be an Instrument of conveying, a mean of receiving, cannot choos but acknowledg the same Sacrament, to be a pledge of assurance: Briefly they are first Instruments of conveyance, and means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; consequently seales,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13510:54"/>
and pledges of assurance: Prove the first, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth follow without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint. Excellently therfore hath reverend Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> in three words, set forth the nature of a Sacrament, only I would a little invert the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his words, and fit them to the true meaning of our Church thus; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are signs to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, Instruments to convey, and seals to confirm the conveyance of Christ with all his benefits. Come we to particulars: Baptism doth convey the blood of Christ, and the other Sacrament both body and blood.</p>
               <p>Hence, and hereupon is the Necessitie of receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, even because the Elements do not transferr the grace as they are consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as received. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13510:54"/>
Turf, and Twig: the Mace must be received, else nothing is done. Nor to the Spectator, but to the Receiver doth water in Baptism, the Bread in the Lords Supper instrumentally convey the body, and blood of the Lord Jesus.</p>

Truth it is, that all these are considerable in the Sacraments; they are Signs, Badges, Cognizances, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, externall Ceremonies of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13510:55"/>
Religion, and testifications of our piety towards God: But all these come short of that speciall and prime end, for which they were ordained: Distinctive badges they are in respect of the publike Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, which is the act of the Church: Uniting badges they cannot bee, except first they be instruments: for wee are not united to Christ <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante Ecclesia,</hi> that is, in being first united to the Church, but rather wee are united to the Church, the body of Christ, <hi>mediante Capite,</hi> in being first united to Christ the head, and by him one to another: So then consider the Sacraments in their Administration, and so they be Badges, and Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances: but in respect of their ordination and institution, and so they are Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:13510:55"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whence is it, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are means of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Even from that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall union</hi> of the sign,<note place="margin">Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall union.</note> and the thing signified; which being inseparable, hence it is that in receiving the sign, we receiv the grace also: As by virtue of that personall Union of the two natures, he that entertained, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the sonn of man, did also entertain and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the sonn of God: he that blasphemed and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sonn of man, did the same to the sonn of God: So here, by reason of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall union, who so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receiveth the sign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the grace; who so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily handleth the sign, doth also dishonour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignifie the grace it self.</p>
               <p>Hence also is the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13510:56"/>
of phrases, that what is peculiar to the sign, is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to the signified, and what is proper to the signified grace, is applyed also to the externall sign. Thus Baptism is said to wash the soul from sinn, and the Lords Supper to feed the soul with grace: because it is united, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth that grace to the soul, which indeed can work upon the soul; and the blood of Christ, is said to wash; the body, and blood are said to feed: because they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and conveyed by these Elementall signs, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per operation is to wash, and feed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth not this then prov the Reall Presence of the body, and blood of Christ in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> A Reall presence the Church of England holdeth,<note place="margin">Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:13510:56"/>
if we rightly understand the phrase, and against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarians, we maintain that <hi>the body and blood of Christ are verely, and indeed taken, and received of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Lords Supper.</hi> Nor do we fear to say, that as in Baptism water washeth the body, and as in the Lords Supper the bread feedeth the body, so also doth the blood of Christ wash the soul, and the body of Christ feed it to eternall life: Nor do we understand this to be a truth only thus, that as the one washeth and feedeth the body, so certainly doth the other wash and feed the soul; nor thus only, that at the same time, when the one doth wash, and feed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other doth wash and feed the soul: both these are truths, but neither of them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13510:57"/>
enough to expresse the whole truth; The first noteth no relation at all betwixt the sign, and the grace; the other only a relation of time, not of causality more, or less: But thus we understand it: That, in that the body is washed with this water, and nourished with this bread, the soul is also cleansed by the blood of Christ, and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his body. Thus I say: and in this sence we grant a reall presence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures: our Saviour saith of the bread <hi>this is my body,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth well explain the meaning of it, in that <hi>Quaere</hi> of his: <hi>The bread which we break is it not the Communion of the body of Christ?</hi> as who should say, it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: the same may be said of the water in Baptism, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13510:57"/>
it is the Communion of the blood of Christ, that is, more than a bare sign of represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, even a mean of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that grace, which to the faithfull is really present, and of them verily received in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>This is confessed of all both Romish and Reformed, and had not the Curiosity of mens brains proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to determin prerempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of the speciall manner of this Reall Presence, we might in this have held Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: But as in other matters of Religion, and mysteries of Godlinesse; so also in this, mans restless head and curious brain, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to pry into things reserved, and rash too much to determine of them, and to defend his determinations, hath put the Church to much

That all are included in both places, tho not all mentioned, may yet further appear by this, that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. when God would lastly manifest, how his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and seals had built up <hi>Abraham</hi> in faith by that sore triall, they are again all three repeated, his faith accepted, and commended.

those which should be conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as being all apprehended by the same faith.</p>
               <p>Another part of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is the misinterpretation of that phrase, <hi>The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of faith.</hi> A phrase twice used in that fourth chapter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to (and therfore to be expounded by) that phrase, <hi>The righteousness which is by faith</hi>; and that also,<note place="margin">

not the seal of his faith, as the Anabaptist speaketh full ignorantly, but the seal of the righteousness, that is, of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which commeth by faith, and not by works.</p>
               <p>We conclude therfore, that infants of beleevers may be lawfully baptised; that by Baptism they may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the covenant of grace. Nay, inasmuch as Baptism is the Sacrament of admission, and no time fitter to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the buds of Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, than while they are buds, (that so betimes grace may prevent the growth of naturall corruption.) Infancy is the fittest time for Baptism, nay, the only time in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive ages of the Church. So far is God from barring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from Baptism, that he may rather seem to have allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to it, and it to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:13510:68"/>We conclude also touching Baptism, that it doth not only admit the baptised into the roll of Christians; this indeed is done in Baptism, wherupon there is a necessity of witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and a conveniencie of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like administration: but this is not all, it is also an admission into the Covenant of grace: here is the ground of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they are indeed within the Covenant, and to be dealt withall by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, as men in covenant with God.</p>
               <p>The LORDS SUPPER is the Sacrament of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and confirmation in the covenant of grace. Not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that men be born li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and lively, except a care be had of their preservation: so in the case of spirituall life, not enough that we be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13510:69"/>
into the covenant of grace: except we be confirmed in grace, we may lose our former hopes of future glorie; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the spirit doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them who end in the flesh. For which cause as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full of exhortations to constancy and perseverance, to make our calling and election sure: So hath God ordained also a Sacrament for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and certain confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in grace, and holiness: This is to us the tree of life, and immortality: here is provided for us that bread of life,<note place="margin">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13510:69"/>
Sacrament being ordained for this end, it will hence follow, that all those are to be barred from this Sacrament, which without breach of charity may be thought as yet not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the covenant of grace. Such I count all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unbaptized: these must be sent first to the Laver of Regeneration, before they be admitted to this Sacrament of confirmation. In vain is food sought where there is no life.

                  <hi>To hold that future sins are pardoned by the Remembrance of Baptism ioyned with faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> This they do to prepare a ground for their Sacrament of Penance, which, say they, is the Sacrament of remission for sins committed after Baptism. Our Divines do dispute against the Papists for the future effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Baptism, in this sence, That tho the act of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism be done but once, yet the virtue and force of it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13510:75"/>
so that there needeth not any repetition of the act, nor the institution of any new Sacrament to recover the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy therof; but that by faith, and repentance the force of former Baptism is applyed to future sins for their Remission. I will affirm nothing rashly about this question. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Epicures, and libertines we deny that any sin is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Baptism, but such wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the soul in present standeth guilty: To say, that sins yet to come are pardoned in Baptism as it were by an ante-dated pardon, is dangerous; no, no, we may not say so: what is past before Baptism is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and mortified, <hi>viz.</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sin in children, actuall in men-grown; not sins to come, and uncommitted, these are not pardoned (we speak not of the intention of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13510:75"/>
but of actuall Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) not actually remitted, till by repentance the soul of man be (as it were) re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in the blood of Christ: Briefly then to the question, propounded, I would give this Answer: that Baptism doth profit us in respect of sinns committed afterwards, not becaus they are pre-remitted, or that in Baptism, there is an ante-dated pardon granted; but becaus in Baptism the blood of Christ is communicated, to be a remedy at hand ready for application: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication must daily be made by the hand of faith, if we desire dayly pardon: hence we are taught in the fift petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to pray for our daily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: wherin doubtless we pray for what we want, and not for what we have already: yet because this remedy is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13510:76"/>
not <hi>de Novo,</hi> given every day: but once for all in Baptism: therefore we say, That the Efficacy of Baptismall Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion doth in some sence, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend it self to the sinns of afterward. This for Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>REGENERATION is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in those words of the Church, <hi>A new birth to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi> As sinn is purged away: so also the Spirit of grace bestowed in Baptism, to be, as the habit, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the seed, whence the future Acts of grace, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, watered by the word of God, and good education, may in time spring forth.

Nor only then, but in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, we find the sensible manifestations of the Spirit still mentioned, with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Baptism: which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the providence of God did so order, and dispose of, that by their sight, and sence, their faith might be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed touching the efficacy of the Sacrament.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13510:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we mark the analogy betwixt the sign, and the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: bread and wine, the food of the body, becometh one with the body: So is it here: Christs body, and blood united to us, and made one with us by an un-speakable and unseparable conjunction. Only here is the difference: that bread of Earth is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into thy body because thou art more excellent than it: but this bread which came down from heaven, is more excellent, and active than thou art, and therfore by little and little doth spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualize and as it were change thee into it. By all which it is evident, that the primary grace, and benefit conferred by the Sacrament is, as I said before, our incorporation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, our union with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:13510:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>The secondary, and so the peculiar grace of the Lords Supper, is (as the Catechism hath well expressed it) <hi>the strengthning, and refreshing of our souls, by the body, and blood of Christ,</hi> as our bodys are by the bread and wine. Bread doth nourish, and strengthen the body, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.15. Hence that phrase, <hi>the staff of Bread:</hi> becaus as a staff doth uphold, and strengthen the weak and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knees: so doth bread strengthen the drooping spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. So doth the body of Christ, well and worthily received, strengthen the soul in grace, and holiness. Wine cheareth the heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.13.</note> and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the spirits. So doth the blood of Christ revive the drooping soul:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.9.</note> gladdeth the heavy heart: causeth spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy, and exultation. Thus
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13510:80"/>
that naturall quality, which God hath placed in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to work upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, doth most excellently manifest that spirituall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which is in the body, and blood of Christ to work upon the soul: even to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a spirituall strengthning, and refreshing of the soul, to cure those spirituall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases to which the soul is subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Spirituall diseases in the soul.</note>These diseases are spirituall weakness, and weariness: faintings, and defectiveness: Apostacie and declination: That this is so, not only the frequent admonitions, and exhortations in sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do pre-suppose: but also is confirmed by reason, and evidenced by too wofull experience. Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, may be drawn from the nature of grace it self,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13510:80"/>
which is no part of the soul, nor any faculty in the soul, but only a quality dwelling in the soul, as light in the Ayr, heat in the water; or rather as sap in the branches: for as they dry up, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if either the union of them to the root be cut off, or the passage of the sap be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and interrupted: so is it here (that is) except there be a conscionable use and attendance upon the word, and Sacraments, we cannot expect, that grace should live. The seed of the New-birth is termed incorruptible by S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pet.</hi> 23.</note> because by using the means appointed, it is preserved from decay: Not so is it in the naturall birth; no use of means, no food, nor physick can preserv the liveliness of that, beyond an appointed time. Nay even the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13510:81"/>
of a Remedy is the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of a malady. As therefore the ordination of Baptism to incorporate us first into Christ, doth prov that by nature we are wild Olives: so the ordination of this Sacrament, to continue this Union, and from this Union continued to convey spirituall strength, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing doth sufficiently prov what would become of us after we are in the state of grace, if God should leav man to himself.</p>
               <p>Behold then the goodness of our God, who knowing our malady, hath provided a Remedy: this Remedy is to partake of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs most blessed body, and blood: for which cause our duty is to frequent the same; both to prevent, but especially to repaire the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13510:81"/>
decays of grace in the soul; so then, dost thou keep thy standing in grace? hast thou as yet not failed, nor faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? yet be not high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear the worst; thou knowst not what tentations may encounter thee; nor how much strength thou shalt need: Go therefore to the Sacrament that thy soul may be strengthned, thy strength increased; prevent a mischief: But now, hast thou failed, stumbled, fallen, oh then make haste to this blessed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that thou mayst be refreshed and recovered. See then how much they are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to their own souls, who suffer themselvs to be hindred, and kept away from this blessed Ordinance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be through covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or consciousness. While men covet revenge (or as they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13510:82"/>
use to speak) while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to right themselves, by following the Law, they lose the benefit of Receiving; not that they must needs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, but Sathan doth so disturb the passion in them, while they prosecute the Law, that they cannot settle their thoughts to so holy a work. <hi>Consciousness</hi> also keeps many back from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when sinn hath gotten into the soul, and guilt hath crept into the conscience, we dare not present our selvs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but like our father <hi>Adam</hi> do hide our selvs, and prov the greatest enemies to our own souls.</p>
               <p>To shut up this point: see how each Sacrament doth work as a convenient means to produce that end for which they were ordained. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is appointed to admit us
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13510:82"/>
into the Covenant of grace; to give us our first title, and interest in Christ: and in it we have wrought in us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and Renovation, a death unto sinn, and a new birth unto Righteousness. The Lords Supper doth strengthen, and refresh our souls, and therefore fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and designed to this end: to be the Sacrament of our Confirmation. By Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism (as we heard) the soul was regenerate, and made partaker of the seeds of grace: These seeds being watered, and as it were hatched up by the Ministry of the word, are strengthned, ripened, and confirmed by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: and now is the faithfull soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the state of grace, and certain expectation of eternall Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:13510:83"/>For the close of all that hath been said, touching the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Sacraments, peruse those few lines, which our Church hath set down in the first part of that Homily, which intreateth of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving, and reverend esteeming of the Sacrament of the body, and blood of Christ. The words are these.</p>
               <p>We need not to think that such exact knowledg is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of every man, that he be able to discuss all high points of the doctrin thereof: But this much we must be sure to hold, that in the Supper of the Lord there is no vain ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, no bare sign, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true figure of a thing absent. But as the Scripture saith, the Table of the Lord, the bread and cup of the Lord, the memory of Christ, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of his death; yea,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13510:83"/>
the Communion of the body and blood of the Lord in a marvelous incorporation, which by the operation of the holy Ghost (the very bond of our Conjunction with Christ,) is through faith wrought in the souls of the faithfull, wherby not only their souls live to eternall life, but they surely trust to winn their bodies a Resurrection to immortality.

this therfore in the liberty of the Church to alter,<note place="margin">Chap. 10</note> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Antiquity and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of it doth prov it to be Apostolicall; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the originall of this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, may in a certain sence be said to be Divine. This ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is the analogie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which holdeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sacraments of the old Testament, and the new: they had two, so had we; one for admission, the other for preservation; so have we: cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was for infants, so is Baptism; the Pass-over, and Lords Supper for men grown: circumcision once administred, the Pass-over of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and so Baptism once, and the Lords Supper often; add to this, that the same reason holds in the Sacraments of either Testament for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie of administration:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13510:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for why Circumcision but once, and the Pass-over often? but because one birth-day is enough, not one day of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: so here, once baptised, because it sufficeth to be once admitted into the Covenant of grace: but often do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the Lords Supper, becaus we do often merit expulsion, and so need a frequent confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Baptism doth seal to us the remission of originall guilt, which is but once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and so once remitted: The Lords Supper doth seal to us the remission of actuall transgressions, which being often committed, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and so often remitted. Baptism is the Sacrament of our Regeneration, when the seed of grace is conferred upon our souls; this needeth to be done but once: The Lords Supper is the Sacrament of our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13510:86"/>
confirmation, whence those seeds of grace are to receiv in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas of growth by the dews of heaven; and this is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be done more than once; often therfore do we come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Now, if any demand, how often we ought to approach to the Lords Table;<note place="margin">How often we are to receiv the Lords Supper.</note> it must be answered, the Church hath power to stint the smallest number; but only mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can direct him in the multiplication of that number. Fewer times than thrice a year may no good Christian in the Church of England receiv the Lords Supper, because it is so ordained by the Church; but how oftner, is left to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own conscience, and the advice of his spirituall Physitian.</p>
               <p>So much the more to blame
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13510:86"/>
are they, that neither by the Law of the Church, nor by the necessity of their own souls are perswaded to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Table of the Lord, but rest themselvs within the customary compasse of once a year.</p>
               <p>It may be objected,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> that once a year was as much as Israel did eat the Pass-over: nor would God doubtless have neglected to command expressly the more frequent receiving of it, were it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
               <p>But (for answer herunto) what authority have we to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, or to assign a reason,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sol.</hi>
                  </note> why God did not command this or that? His Laws, and Ordinances are to us a light of direction, not his Omissions: God appointed to the Church of Israel no Sacrament for the spirituall incorporation of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13510:87"/>
no more publike, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fasting dayes, but one in the year; no Ember-weeks at all, that is, no time of solemn fasting, and prayer, before the Ordination of their Priests; doth it therfore follow, that we must have none? or shall we say that such things are not needfull? ought not we in the new Testament, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved greater grace than they, super-abound, and goe beyond them in the practise of Piety? Apply it thus to the objection, passing by the reasons of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which might be assigned, why the Pass-over was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated but once a year: let us say, that inasmuch as it is plain that the Sacrament is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of us in the state of grace, and the way to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and refresh our souls, wherof we have continuall,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13510:87"/>
and daily need; therfore it is a point of Christian wisdome to be as frequent in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as possibly we can, the oftner, the better.</p>
               <p>As on the other side, since Baptism is administred but once in the life time, (a point so firmly beleeved, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, that even the Anabaptists, whom we tax for re-baptising those, whom our Church hath baptised, since that learned <hi>Beza,</hi> and others after him, have wrung from them that Text of <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4.6. will rather deny our Baptism to be a Sacrament, than grant a necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptising.) Since, I say, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is done but once, how much doth it concern them, who are imployed in that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred service, to see that all things be done according to the rules of the holy Spirits di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13510:88"/>
Lest, what is not then done, peradventure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be never done at all, and so the guilt of this carelesness press the soul down to hell. What is required of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, is handled in the next chapter. In the Minister ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty is commended, but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is required. Some question there is touching his intention, that is, whether the action be not Sacramentall, except the Minister intend it so to be. Doubtlesse in this, as in Prayer, and Preaching, his roving thoughts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered passions may defile them to himself, and not make them ineffectuall to others.</p>
               <p>A second Corollary dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from the former premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is the Necessity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,<note place="margin">Necessity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> concerning which the Doctrin of the Church is, that the two legitimate, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13510:88"/>
true born Sacraments, are <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally necessary to salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is plain out of the first question answered touching the number of the Sacraments; <hi>How many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church? Two only, as generally necessary to salvation:</hi> which words, as they do intimate, at least do seem to intimate a superduali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sacraments in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sence (<note n="*" place="margin">In the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, wherin is declared, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in a known tongue; after that, is shewed what is a Sacrament. The question, how many Sacraments, is thus explained: f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t also to divers, and sundry other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as to Oyl, Washing of Feet, and such like: not meaning therby to repute them as Sacraments, in the same signification that the two forenamed Sacraments are.</note> see this explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at full in the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;) so do they fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Doctrin of the Church
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13510:89"/>
touching the necessity of the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> that as (I said) they are generally necessary to salvation: this, all grant, but all agree not in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their necessity; explicate it thus: First, they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>ex praecepto,</hi> as being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and commanded by God, the author of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, we say that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> even in respect of that nature, which God hath put upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed, as means, and instruments to transferre, and convey that grace, without which no salvation: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this kind of necessity is the ground of the other; for therfore are they commanded to be used, because they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be as means, wherby we receiv grace. Thirdly, add this also, that they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13510:89"/>
as means without which that grace is not ordinarily conferred.</p>
               <p>Thus understand those texts of Scripture, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for this purpose. <hi>viz.</hi> Except a man be born of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the spirit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5.</note> he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God. And, except yee eat the flesh of the Sonn of man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.53.</note>and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</p>
               <p>Thus may we understand that phrase of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, <hi>generally necessary,</hi> that is, commonly, and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: So that if the Spirit (who being an Omnipotent Agent, is not tyed to any means: being a spirituall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is not tyed to externall means) if he, I say, do convey grace to any without the use of the Sacraments, this is to be accounted extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:13510:90"/>Hitherto referr the cases of un-avoidable extremity, in which doubtless,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5.</note> the spirit worketh without these means. But generally and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary they are, necessary and so commanded.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let it be thy care, to take heed of neglecting the use of the Sacraments. When God maketh them ready, and calleth thee; be thou ready. Say not: Another time I may receiv them, if not now. Or if not at all: yet I may do well without them, This is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT a Sacrament is, we have heard; and for what end each Sacrament was ordained: and so have learned the efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13510:91"/>
and the benefits therby obtained.<note place="margin">Chap. 11</note> It remaineth that we proceed to enquire, whether this efficacy of the Sacraments depends only, and wholly upon the operative force, and active virtue inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them; or whether this efficacy be only found in them, when they work upon a subject fitted, and pre-dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: or (to speak to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the vulgar) whether there be any thing required of the Receiver, to fit him for the benefits of the Sacrament; so necessarily, as that the want of this preparation, doth bar him from the benefit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the answer to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, there is a direct opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the Romish, and reformed Churches. They hold the efficacy of the Sacrament to be so great, that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13510:91"/>
no preparation, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Receiver. We of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, contrarily mantain: that except the Receiver be thus, and thus qualified, he loseth the benefit of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Not as if the Qualification of the Receiver doth concur actively to produce the grace of the Sacrament; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus in all the works of God, wherin he is pleased to make use of the creatures, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of his own right hand, he hath allotted to each of them a certain measure of activity, beyond which they cannot extend their efficacy: consequently there must be a certain previous disposition in the matter wheron they work, which, if it be wanting, their activity proveth ineffectuall. Instance in the fire, God hath placed in it a certain power of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13510:92"/>
heating, and burning, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus this power allotted to it, is finite, therfore it cannot heat the snow, nor burn the water. Things must be dried before they are apt to kindle; so that the former question touching the efficacy of the Sacrament, is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this; whether there be in the fire so great activity, as to burn all materialls what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it toucheth, or whether the fuell must be first dried, and fitted for the fire, before it will catch the flame? We teach, that the fuell must first be dried: nor can we conceiv but that there was more than ordinary vigour in that fire which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kings</hi> 18.38</note> upon the prayer of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah,</hi> fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench: so here such
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13510:92"/>
an efficacious, and working power we acknowledg in the Sacrament, as to produce the work of grace in the Receiver who is fitted, and prepared, but not otherwise. Let no man stretch this comparison further than it is expressed: we do not say that this activity is in the Element, as heat is in the fire, we know that a corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is no more capable of inherent grace, than a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance is capable of heat and cold. But the efficacie of the Sacrament is from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which, by an Almighty word, having united the thing signified to the sign, doth by the one convey the other to work upon the soul, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>Now that something should be required of them that come to the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Equity of a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required.</note> by way of qualification, is but just, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13510:93"/>
equall: God will be sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all them that draw near to him:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3.</note> and hereby doth he stir up the slothful soul of man to look about, lest by his wretchlesness he do barr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of that benefit, which is to be gained in the Sacrament. What that thing is which is required, we must find out, by taking notice of the age of the Church, wherof we speak, and of the Sacrament wherof the question is framed: for if we speak of the Church <hi>in fieri,</hi> in the first plantation; then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it consisteth of them that are men grown, at least, past their infancy, there is required of them Repentance, and Faith to fit them for Baptism, no less than to the Supper of the Lord. But if we speak of the Church <hi>in facto,</hi> in the succession, and propagation; then (becaus it consisteth of infants, aswell as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13510:93"/>
men grown) if we speak of men-grown, who heretofore were baptised, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them to fit them for the Lords Supper (which is that only which they need,) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if we speak of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who are only admitted to Baptism, and not to the Supper of the Lord, the most that is required of them, is no more but that they be holy; not by any inherent holiness, for how should that be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? but by a federall san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, that is, that they be born of Christian parents: I say this is the most that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, or rather, the most that we look at in them: if they have a Christian to their Parent, either father, or mother, this is enough to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them to Baptism; nor is ther any question at all touching
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13510:94"/>
this, save only with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists.</p>
               <p>Whether the infants of heathens may be lawfully baptised, may be a question, in as much as father, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Some light, for answer to this question, may be taken from the law of Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.</note> and the practise therof in Israel. For infants of eight dayes old,<note place="margin">The Church in such cases supplieth the place of a parent</note> whether born in the house, or bought with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, must be circumcised: Proportionably it may seem lawfull for a Christian, if he have bought, or adopted the infant of an heathen, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him to the Sacrament of Baptism. But letting that pass, there is no doubt, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Christian Parents may be baptised: nor is there any thing more than this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive capacity required of them,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13510:94"/>
or respected in them; and this I take to be the readier way to deal with the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, than to shew it possible, that infants also may have the spirit of grace, and that in charity we may think so of them, and consequently admit them to Baptism. Which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable shift did specially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the opinion of them, who denied the Sacraments to have any instrumentall efficiency in the conveying of grace, allowing them only to be seals to confirm, not instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convey: wherupon, when the Anabaptist objected the defect of grace in infants, to bar them from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in as much as to set a seal to a blanck, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; they, of whom we speak, defended their practice by the judgment of charity. In which respect I may prais their zeal:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13510:95"/>
but I do suppose this to be the readier way to deal with the Anabaptist; to say that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be baptised, not to confirm them in grace, but to conferr grace upon them; that they are presented to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, rather to be initiated, than to be confirmed in the possession of grace. But, in as much as my purpose is not to dispute with hereticks, but to set down the Doctrin of our Church, touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which our Church hath done, with respect unto the use of the Sacraments in the plantation of the Church, and first conversion of men to the faith; following herein the lines of the Scripture, the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages wherof do still look that way, as may appear by all those texts, which the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists (ignorant of this) have mis-applied, to cry down the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13510:95"/>
baptising of infants; Since, I say, this is my purpose; let me proceed in the search of that qualification, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them that come to the Sacraments.</p>

This fiduciall assent, or stedfast beleef of the promise, the Scripture doth other while express by these phrases; <hi>To rest, and rely, or lean upon God, to stay, to roll upon, to trust, to place confidence in him, &amp;c.</hi> The reason whereof is, because in Scripture phrase, he is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to beleev the promise of God, who doth not therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put confidence in God. Say the same touching the precepts
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13510:99"/>
and threatnings. Not he that subscribeth to the truth of them, but he that feareth, and obeyeth, is the beleever. Thus we see how <hi>Faith is a mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, viz.</hi> the Mother, and Nurs of Reverence, Obedience and Confidence. So then stedfastly to beleev the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, is but one act of faith; and so the Church saith, <hi>Faith, by which we stedfastly beleev the promise</hi>; This is one act, but not the only act of faith.</p>
               <p>Note further, that the Church addeth; <hi>The promises made to them in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; which is no less true in the Supper, than in Baptism. <hi>Sacramentall faith,</hi> that is, the exercise of faith, as a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to fit us for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must specially look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacramentall promise, and stedfastly beleev that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall promise, which is made
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13510:100"/>
to the Receiver in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As in the Sacraments, so also in the duty of Prayer, humiliation, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occasion, wherin our faith ought to have a speciall relation to the promise, Mans duty is to look to that promise which in speciall respecteth that duty, and by faith to lay hold upon it; else doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv to lose the benefit of the Promise.</p>
               <p>The promise made to us in Baptism comprehendeth the exhibition of grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. the remission of sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. consequently, the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soul, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. The promise made to us in the Supper, is intimated in those words, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood, which is shed for you</hi>; which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth thus: The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, and blood of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13510:100"/>
Christ, <hi>i.e.</hi> as we have heard, an effectuall means to convey the body and blood of Christ, even Christ and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Hence give answer to that question, <hi>viz.</hi> How it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to pass, that the faithfull do receiv the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament; the Church saith, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and indeed taken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the faithfull, but how commeth it to pass?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That it is done by virtue of Christs promise, and the Receivers faith meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: The promise of Christ is, that the elements thus bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and received, shall be to the Reeciver, the body, and blood of Christ; the Receiver therfore doth look upon the signs, as instruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, means of receiving.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13510:101"/>
Now these two, <hi>viz.</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Christ, and the faith of the Receiver meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do make a kind of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency: Christ can perform whatsoever he promiseth; and faith can beleev whatsoever he revealeth: so to the beleever this, yea, and all things else are possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Possible therfore is Transubstantiation, since Christ can do what he saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> We question not what Christ can do, but whether he doth so indeed, as the Romish Church saith; their assertion of Transubstantiation we dare not receiv, lest we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our eyes, and other senses, which God hath given us, to inform our understanding in their severall objects.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a case, which we may with reason beleev, that the providence of God doth watch to prevent: but suppose it possible, yet neither is there any need of rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, nor shall he remain disunited from Christ. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are means of union in ordinary, but God is not tied to them. Besides, tho Baptism be the first Sacrament of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, and union; yet not the only one: Add this, that, as Repentance can, after a sort, undo what hath been
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13510:103"/>
done in the way of sinn: so may it in such a case supply the defect of former times, and cause that to be now done, without any ceremony, which at the ordinary time was not done. Lastly, in such cases we may distinguish between the benefit of Union, and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and the benefit of Remission, and Regeneration; these later may be suspended for the present, tho not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: but by extraordinary dispensation, the man who hereafter shall perform what is required, in the way of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, tho for the present he do it not, yet may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and united unto Christ; because in such a man Repentance, and Faith, are <hi>in actu signato, &amp; radicali,</hi> tho not in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> secretly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the heart, and seen to God, tho not sensible to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13510:104"/>

                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> for in this we may conceiv a difference betwixt Gods dealing with men in Baptism, and in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: the Lords Supper being often received, except there be a reall performance of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith answerable to the verball profession [<hi>in actu exercito</hi>] God may suspend all benefit of that Sacrament, without irreparable harm, the next time may repair what the former did not; but Baptism being but once administred: because it may seem that who so is not then incorporated, must remain for ever disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therfore tho there be not in present a reall performance of Repentance answerable to the profession, yet will not God suspend all benefit of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13510:104"/>
Baptism, but notwithstanding their carelesness, granteth to them, who belong to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace, present union with Christ, and implantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not Remission, and Regeneration till afterwards: Neither is it absurd to conceiv an union with Christ, without any present fructification; for if the plant ingrafted into the stock doth not presently draw sap from the root, which yet is a naturall Agent, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suspend its operation: how much more may Christ, who is a voluntary Agent, suspend his influence for a time, tho the party be truly united to him.</p>
               <p>According to this may we explain that position of the Schools, <hi>Sacramenta conferunt gratiam non-ponenti obicem, i.e.</hi> that if man be not a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to himself, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13510:105"/>
are not empty signs, but reall instruments to conferr grace: Now that barr, which alone hindereth, is impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and infidelity: Who so doth not profess repentance, and faith, may not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; who so with his profession doth not joyn reall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, ordinarily, doth not receiv the benefit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: much less they, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and practise the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

Christ was faithfull, so was <hi>Moses</hi>; he as a sonn, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> as a servant; his testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is therefore as perfect as that of <hi>Moses:</hi> True, but know we not that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of a man, in his office, is to be measured according to the Intent, and Scope of his office imposed? in which if he fail, he is unfaithfull, if he fail not in that, then is he not unfaithfull, tho he look not to other things; The Minister may be faithfull, tho he meddle not with the sword of Justice; The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, tho he fight not with the sword of the Spirit: So then, what was the office of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13510:107"/>
                     <hi>Moses?</hi> of Christ? of the Apostles? The office of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was to plant a Nationall Church in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Israel: The office of the Apostles, to propagate the Church, and to make it Catholick throughout the world: The office of Christ was to work the Redemption of mankind: See the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.27. If any of them fail in these, then are they unfaithfull; else not hence it was <hi>Moses</hi> office, to set down particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for that Nationall Church: Contrarily the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Apostles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point generall Rules, and Orders for the Catholick Church: Christ by himself did neither of these: but both these, and whatsoever else was necessary for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Church, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and Ministers in severall ages: But by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his own person he established the Covenant of grace, and salvation, gave the Word of life, ordained the Seals, and instituted a Ministery, and so was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his house as a Sonn, and worthy of more honours, than either <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Apostles.

We grant, that neither Precept, nor Pattern formall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, is to be found for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptising; but both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and Pattern virtuall, and implicite; which if found, is not to be neglected: That both may be found in the new Testament, comes thus to be proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:13510:108"/>First, PRECEPT VIRTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALL and IMPLICITE: The precept of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Israel, for the incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Infants, by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, was not repealed by Christ, but rather confirmed, and consequently, tho not expressly written by the Evangelists, yet nevertheless delivered by Christ; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony indeed of Initiation is altered, but the duty it self doth stand still; for what was not repealed, ought to remain: Again, this is to be marked, that God by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> establishing a nationall Church, hath drawn a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pattern, and modell ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to our hands. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as no better laws for the Common-wealth, than those, which from <hi>Moses</hi> may be transferred; So no better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the Church, than
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13510:108"/>
such as may from thence justly, and without wrong to the time of truth, and grace in the new Testament be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated: Some judiciall Laws were peculiar to that Nation, at least to that age of the world; some Ecclesiasticall rites were also peculiar to that age of the Church, and may not now be allowed: but others there were more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and so more perpetuall. And indeed no better directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than what may be fetcht from amongst these. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath gone before us, and given us an example. All grant that the spirituall Courts, the Censures of the Church, the proceeding in the Censures are by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, fetcht from the Church of the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. from thence doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> argue for the maintenance of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13510:109"/>
Ministery. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.14. Laws touching the libertie of womens partaking of the Lords Supper, are thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted. Times, places, persons, consecrated to the service of God, are, and were ordained by the Church, in the Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Israel: and so also do we conclude, the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incorporating Infants into the Church of God; which in that Church having been enacted, was not repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in respect of the substance of the duty, tho the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and Ceremony be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: for we read in <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. that our Saviour in his 40. dayes conversation, taught the Apostles things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the kingdome of God, and <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. he bid them teach all Nations to observ all things that he had commanded them. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13510:109"/>
therefore manifest by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that Pedo-baptism hath ever since been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church of God: doubtless it had not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, had not the Apostles, by this Commandement of Christ, appointed the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. Thus we find a precept virtuall, and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 PATTERN VIRTUALL and IMPLICITE, is in the baptising of whole families, as of <hi>Lydia, Crispus, Gaius, Stephanus,</hi> and others, in which who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but there were Infants also. What say we to those three thousand souls mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Is it probable that they were all present at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, it being in a private house? is it not rather probable, that the men being present, and converted,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13510:110"/>
they brought also their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to be baptised? so that the totall summ of men, women and children, might be 3000 souls: And here doubtless the proceeding of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts was answerable to that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. no sooner is the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but all the males in his house were circumcised, young and old: So doubtless no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the Covenant of grace ratified, betwixt God and the Parents by Baptism, but the Infants also of the family, were accounted holy, and so baptised. Doubtless what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> said to them in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. The promise is made to you, and to your children; the same did St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach to the Gentiles, when they were converted. And how should they confirm the truth of this to them, but by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13510:110"/>
their children: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by children can we with the Anabaptist, understand their youths of discretion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but their Infants also: for in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. and <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. the word is generall to comprehend all their issue and of-spring.<note place="margin">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13510:111"/>
that the Parents having been by <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism directed to Christ, when they knew him, brought children to him to receiv a further blessing from him; and thus much for answer to the first, and main Argument of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13510:111"/>
this, the Major is utterly fals, for neither do these texts prov it, nor the English Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism. Besides there are good reasons against it.</p>
                  <p>The texts prov it not; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they prov the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv, <hi>That whosoever beleeveth, may be baptised:</hi> But from thence to draw a negative conclusion is against Reason; Thus out of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16. it is manifest, that whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, shall be saved; but will the Anabaptist thence conclude, Infants beleev not, (<hi>ergo</hi>) they shall not be saved. God forbid.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Reasons are against it.</head>
                  <p>First, <hi>In respect of Infants</hi>; There needeth none actuall faith in children, as a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition, to fit them for the grace of Baptism: for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13510:112"/>
why? In the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the spirit worketh not as a morall Agent to proffer grace to the will, but as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, or rather supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Agent, to work it in the will, to put grace into the heart, conferring upon them seminall, and initiall grace, which doth not presuppose faith, but is it self the seed of faith; To Parents conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Baptism conveyed (as did Circumcision to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) a superaddition of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, to what they had extraordinarily received: But to their children Baptism con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed (as did Circumcision to <hi>Isaac</hi>) the first seeds of grace, and Regeneration. Add this, that the faith of the Parent is sufficient to qualifie the child for Baptism, yea, for the grace of Baptism; the child I say, in whom as yet
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13510:112"/>
corruption of nature, being scant active, calleth for no act of Personall grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the barr of guilt: pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted he is, but by the act of another, not by consent of his own; therfore the faith of the Parent sufficeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for the child the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the benefit therof: They cavill, and say, every man must live by his own faith, and not by anothers: True, we say so to; only the words of the Prophet are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleaged, and misapplyed; the text doth not add that clause [<hi>not by anothers,</hi>] nor doth it speak simply of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit it self, gained by faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification, Salvation, Preservation, but of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assurance of it: But not to strive hereabout; we see in <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.3. the sick man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the better for the faith of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13510:113"/>
his friends, even in the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins: Parents are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to their Infants, and have more interest in them, than one friend in another: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are a part of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; so that the promise of grace mentioned in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, betwixt God, and the Parent, is not ratified to the whole Parent, except also it extend to his Infant: It is then the faith of the Parent, laying hold of the promise, which qualifieth his Infant for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation into the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Christ. And this is a point of good comfort to the parent,<note place="margin">Comfort to parents.</note> to consider the goodness of God to him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided for him, that as he hath been a naturall instrument to convey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his child the guilt of sin, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall corruption; so may he also, challenging Gods
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13510:113"/>
Covenant by faith, be made a voluntary instrument, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon of sin, and semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace; a just remedy for the former malady.</p>
                  <p>The consideration wherof, were it well and advisedly thought upon, might cure that supine negligence found in Parents, who seldome think of this; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall one day heare the just curses of their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned children, crying, woe worth the negligence of our careless Parents, who having begotten us for their pleasure, therby conveyed to us guilt, and corruption, but never took care to cure us of this malady; yea the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, might provoke them to intend the act of their faith, and not only in the Church cursorily of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, to present their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13510:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to God; but also actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the prayer of faith, challenge Gods promise, for the good of their Infants: for doubtless even in this, as in all other occasions, the more intentive mans faith is, and earnestly set upon the promise to challenge it, the sooner doth it prevail, and obtain the desire. To return to the Anabaptist! since the faith of the Parents sufficeth, since the spirit worketh in Baptism as a supernaturall Agent, there needeth no actuall faith to be found in children; consequently they are deceived, who defend, that none may be baptised without faith inherent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In respect of Men grown,</hi> the want of faith doth not barr them from Baptism, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny water to them, that desire
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13510:114"/>
the Sacrament, if they profess to repent, and beleev, tho peradventure their heart be naught. See then herein the unreasonable dealing of the Anabaptist, who will barr Infants from the water of Baptism, for want of Faith, when (as hath been shewed) not so much the actuall Inexistence of these graces, as the formall profession of them doth qualifie even Men grown, sufficiently for what the Church can do, in the administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                  <p>Two things are usually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against this in the heat of contention,<note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this truth.</note> which I shall briefly touch for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of sober minds, and so return to the former doctrin of preparation.</p>
                  <p>First (say they) children are as farr from Profession of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13510:115"/>
faith, as from performance, consequently to be barred from Baptism.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, that Profession is either actuall, or virtuall: An actuall profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Repentance, and Faith is required of them, who by the acts of reason formerly abused, have multiplyed their personall transgressions; but for Infants a virtuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is sufficient, and such a profession we find in them, in respect of their Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They are not unfitly termed Beleevers, because they are born within the Profession of Christianity: As also the Infants of Pagans, are justly accounted Infidels, because they are born in the Profession of infidelity: And if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had disputed the cause, I doubt not, but as he said of <hi>Levi,</hi> that in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:13510:115"/>
he paid tithes to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi>; so he would have said, that the seed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full do in their Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the faith of Christ; Add this, that this virtuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is actuated by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Sureties, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at Baptism; And this is the answer of our Church, to the former objection; And it is plain, that that Ab-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, is the profession of Repentance, in the name of the child: so also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the Articles, a profession of Faith, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his, according to that well known saying of Saint <hi>Austin, peccavit in alio, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in alio,</hi> as his offence, so his profession is the act of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but his by Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but saith the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, this is the blasphemous
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13510:116"/>
Invention of Pope <hi>Higinius</hi>; where, mark I pray you the spirit of Envy,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> and Detraction, that can speak well of nothing, that is not framed in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of his own brain. <hi>Higinius</hi> is said indeed to have appointed Godfathers, and Godmothers: But the Interrogatories in Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tism were yet more ancient, &amp; might be the sponsion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Parents, in behalf of their children, in use long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Higinius.</hi> The profession of faith, as it appeareth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, was at the first direct, and plain, by recitation of the Creed, and forms of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Afterward it seemeth, that for help of memory, &amp; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a remedy against bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that which the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, was put into questions propounded by the Minister, and answered briefly (as now the form is) by the party; And
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13510:116"/>
what the Men grown answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themselvs, the same did Parents for their children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Higinius:</hi> But why doth his blackmouth call this custome blasphemous? why calls he <hi>Higinius</hi> by the name of Pope? had it not bin enough to have stiled this custome of Interrogatories in Baptism, answered by deputed Sureties, to have stiled it I say, (as some others do) ridiculous, and unreasonable? had it not been enough to have stiled, this <hi>Higinius</hi> Bishop of Rome, as he was indeed, but he must call him Pope? But this is the vehemency of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisticall spirit, to lay on load of rayling words, when there wanteth weight of solid reason. By the Anabaptists own confession, the custome is very ancient: for <hi>Higinius</hi> was the eighth Bishop of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13510:117"/>
Rome, lived in the year of Grace 150. long before the Pope was bred and born, ever since when, it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church. <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> in his Epistle to Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> seemeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that in his dayes it had Antiquity only to plead for the continuance. But neither he, nor any since, till of late years, counted it ridiculous, much less blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous: But passe we over the bitterness of words, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter: Why should Infants be catechised, and asked for a profession of their faith?

                  <hi>And above all things you must give most humble, and hearty thanks to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonn, and holy Ghost, for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13510:120"/>
the Redemption of the world, by the Death, and Passion of our Saviour Christ, both God and Man.</hi> And in the Catechism amongst other things, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which a man ought to examin himself, before he come to the Lords Supper, the Church hath interserted this, <hi>A thankfull Remembrance of the Death of Christ.</hi> Note here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A REMEMBRANCE, The reason wherof is this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Sacrament was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the continuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Sacrifice of Christs Death: His Death was a Sacrifice, this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice must be remembred: God made it remarkable at the first by those prodigies in Nature, the Sunns eclipsing, Earths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaking, Vail-renting, graves opening: But we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13510:120"/>
it in respect of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Christ, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me</hi>; yet is not this a repetition of that Sacrifice, what need that be daily renewed,<note place="margin">This is <hi>S. Pauls</hi> own Argument <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> that was at the first compleat, and perfect? whatsoever needeth daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, and renewing, is in it self imperfect, and incompleat: As therfore this Sacrifice doth agree with the legall propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in this, that it was a bloody Sacrifice; so in this doth it differ, and super-excell them, that it being at once compleat, needeth not (as did they) daily renewing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A THANKFULL RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEMBRANCE must there be, that is, so must we remember the Death of Christ, as that therby we be stirred to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for it: The reason
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13510:121"/>
wherof is, becaus the Death of Christ was not only a meer separation of the body, and soul, but a sacrifice, yea, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, that is, a sacrifice for expiation of sin, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation:<note place="margin">See for this <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. &amp; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2.</note> Indeed it was the substance of all the legall shaddows, the perfection, and accomplishment of all the Typicall expiations under the Law: Nay more, it was the grand, and great deliverance of the Church. If therfore the <hi>Exodus</hi> of Israel out of Egypt deserved a yearly feast of thankfull remembrance: if the Reduction of the Church from the captivity of Babylon was so thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as that it almost drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the memoriall of their <hi>Exodus</hi>; ought not the death of Christ, by which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from sin, and Sathan was wrought, ought not this
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13510:121"/>
I say, to be thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred? The practise of the Church doth plainly manifest it: whence had the whole sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred action that famous name of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia.</hi>
                  </note> so frequent in the writings of the Fathers, and Doctours of the Church, but from the sacrifice of thanks, and praise, at that time offered to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, for the Redemption of the world, by the Death, and Passion of our Saviour Iesus Christ: For this cause it is, that in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie of the Church, this is so carefully remembred, that by the Minister, the whole Congregation should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>to give thanks to our Lord God</hi>; adding, that, <hi>as it is meet, and right, and our bounden duty that we should at all times, and in all places give thanks to the Lord God our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13510:122"/>
so for the present, with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Arch-angels, and all the holy company of Heaven, we laud, and magnifie his glorious Name, &amp;c.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The way, and means to stir us up to thankfulness for the Death of Christ,<note place="margin">Means to stir us up to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> is seriously to consider of the benefits which we receiv therby: Here is a large field of meditation; here cannot the devout soul want matter, wherin to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it self, if we take notice of these particulars: First, what we had been without it. Secondly, what our hopes are by it. Thirdly, how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy we either were of it, or as yet are. Fourthly, by how worthy a person this was wrought. Fiftly, how bitter the cup was which he drank, how painfull, and shamfull the Death was which he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Here therfore, and in these
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13510:122"/>
meditations let the soul dwell, till admiration of the benefit, so good, so great, so freely, so undeservedly bestowed, cause the heart to burst forth into that of <hi>David; Lord, what is man, that thou art so mindfull of him?</hi> Oh dear Saviour! who would not love thee? Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father! who would not bless thee? Oh blessed spirit! who would not obey thee? Oh eternall God! who would not devote himself, soul, body, all, to the honour, and service of this glorious Trinity, that hath done so great things for so unworthy, so wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</p>
               <p>Well, Thankfulness is a branch of the Qualification of our souls for the worthy partaking.<note place="margin">How to express our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> But how is it to be expressed? Answer briefly, by bearing our part in the Psalms, and Alms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13510:123"/>
For the first, we read, that after the Passover, our Saviour, and his company sung a Psalm:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalms.</hi>
                  </note> It is Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his rule, in the time of mirth to sing Psalms: when have we more cause of spirituall mirth, than at this sacred banquet? all dull, and earthly is that heart, that is not now even filled with holy, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raptures. Did <hi>Moses</hi> sing, and <hi>Miriam</hi> dance; and shall not we sing forth the praises of our dearest Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?</p>
               <p>For the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Alms of the Congregation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alms.</hi>
                  </note> we have the laudable custome of the Church in all ages, and the ground therof is taken from that of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 16. <hi>My goodness extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> What
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13510:123"/>
we cannot therfore return to our blessed Saviour himself in token of thankfulness, (and who would not in this kind, even part with all that he hath?) that must we, for his sake, bestow upon his poore members. Collections for the poore, are perpetuall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants upon Communions; the illiberall hand is the evidence of an unthankfull soul: freely we have received, freely let us give, and Christ shall thank us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.34.

So much we know is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by that phrase, to be in Charity: malice and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning must be laid aside, when we address our selvs to the holy Communion: If in hearing the word <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. if in praying <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. how much more when we approach the Table of the Lord? God hath appointed this Sacrament, in a speciall manner to nourish love, and spirituall friendship amongst the brethren while they see themselvs all joyntly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the same Banquet, and all made partakers of the same Bread: Hence hath it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the name of <hi>Communion</hi> (as some think) because it is (at least should be) <hi>communis anio</hi> the common union,<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>i.e.</hi> the uniting of their hearts in common. So that he which forbeareth this Sacrament,

because he is not in charity, is like the patient, that throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away the plaster, because his leg is sore, when as for that very cause he ought to keep it: Even for that cause ought we to agree with our Adversary, and lay aside all rancour, malice, yea all heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning, that we may be thought fit to partake of this holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Note that this Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion standeth in the practise of satisfaction, and restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others, whom we have wronged, and of remission to others upon their confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Nothing less: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that text sheweth what must be done, not what must not be done. Too much consultation, and diligence in matters of such moment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be used, nor too many eyes and hands imployed. Add this, that the object of the Ministers examination, that is, all that he can examin them about, is only matter of knowledg, or of criminall conversation: But beside this, inquiry must be made by each man, touching himself in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13510:129"/>
of inward grace, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they that rely upon the Ministers examination, so they that neglect it, are justly to be blamed: joyn both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, specially in cases ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and scruples of conscience.</p>
               <p>The OBIECT or MATTER of Examination is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> but by the Church reduced to these heads, Whether a man have Repentance, and Faith; Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and Charity: In each of them note the reason of Necessity, and the mark or cognizance of Discovery.</p>
               <p>REPENTANCE, what this is, we heard before, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. Now accordingly must each Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver examin himself, whether he do truly repent, and be heartily sorrowfull for his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13510:130"/>
former sins. And reason good it is, that by contrition and sorrow, the heart should be purged, which by lust, and wrath, and other inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate passions, so often sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God. The mark to discern this godly sorrow is <hi>a stedfast purpose of the heart to lead a new life,</hi> to change the former courses into better. <hi>A purpose,</hi> a stedfast purpose, that is, a purpose of the heart setled and grounded upon reason, and deliberation, <hi>to lead a new life,</hi> to reform all former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and aberrations; this is a certain, and evident mark of true repentance, and godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

They, whose faith feeleth no decay, in the dis-use, and neglect of the Ministerie, may justly fear their faith was never right and sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Operation,</hi> Faith is fruitfull in good works, in all, but specially in the best works, Piety, Charity; at all times, but then doth it exceed it self, when we draw nigh to God: a fruitless faith is dead, a name, a picture, a shadow of faith, but nothing else: nay, there is not all sound in it, if it grow not daily, if it still seek not, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not to exceed the state of yesterday.</p>
