            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

These reasons and experiments may suffice to proue the roundnesse of the earth and water; which might bee farther demonstrated by shewing the falshood of all other figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or irregular that can be giuen vnto it: that it is neither square, nor three-cornerd, nor Piramidall, nor conicall on Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perwise, nor Cylindricall like a barley rowle, nor hollow like a dish, nor of any other fashion, as some haue imagined it to bee of.

                  <p>For the Second, whether abiding still in his place it may not moue rounde, the question is disputed, and maintained one both sides.

Others deny it grounding theire opinion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture, which affirmes the earth to stand fast, so as it cannot bee moued; and vpon Sence, because wee perceaue it not to moue, and lastly vpon reasons drawne from things hurled vp, and let fall vpon the earth.

Nor neede wee feare logging, or that steples and towers would totter downe, for the motion is regular, and steady without rubbes, and knocks. As if you turne a globe about, it will goe steadyly, and a fly will set fast vpon it, though you moue it apace.

                  <p>Notwithstanding all this, most are of another opinion, that the earth standeth still without all motion, rest rather befittinge so heauy and dull a body then motion. The maine reason brought to establish it is this.

                  </p>
                  <p>So againe let two peices of ordinance that will shoote at equall distance bee discharged one iust towards the East, the other towards the West; if the earth moue (as they say it doth) towards the West, the bullet that is discharged East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will fly farther then that Westward.

                  </gap>s. Wee speake onely a word or two of the last, &amp; soproceed. The question is whether the motion of the riuers bee streight, or Circular. The doubts on both sides will best appeare by a sigure first drawne: wherein, Let <hi>(HMO)</hi> be the Meridian of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> or of the Mouth of <hi>Nilus</hi> and answerable to the meridian of the Heauens.

If it runne in a streight line, as is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature of the water it must moue either by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14705:14"/>
the line <hi>(CEB)</hi> or by the line <hi>(DB.)</hi> By the line <hi>(CEB)</hi> it cannot moue: for when it is come to <hi>(E,)</hi> it will stand still. Because from <hi>(E)</hi> to <hi>(B)</hi> it must moue vpward, if it moue at all, which is contrary to the nature of water. If therefore it moue by a streight line it can bee noe other, but <hi>(BD,)</hi> and so from <hi>(D)</hi> to <hi>(B)</hi> it shall continually descend; for of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene <hi>(D,)</hi> &amp; <hi>(B) (B)</hi> is the nearest to <hi>(A.)</hi> But then the fountaine must not bee in <hi>(B)</hi> but higher in <hi>(D)</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emees altogether improbable or impossible. For first the line <hi>(AD)</hi> would bee notably and sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Miles, and the semidiameter <hi>(AB,)</hi> or <hi>(AC)</hi> 3828. miles the line, <hi>(CD,)</hi> would bee 1581. miles, which cannot bee true, if as wee haue proued before, the earth bee round land that the highest hills make noe sensible inaequality. A gaine they that dwell in <hi>(D)</hi> should see the North Pole starre <hi>(N)</hi> as well as they that dwell in <hi>(B,)</hi> which also is false. So then the riuer cannot runne either by <hi>(EB)</hi> or <hi>(DB);</hi> Runnes it then circularly by the line <hi>(CW<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>?)</hi> This seemes probable, and the rather because heereby a reason of the originall of Riuers might more easily bee giuen: For the fountaines <hi>(C)</hi> lying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sse through the hollowes of the earth, and breake out at <hi>(C)</hi> without ascendinge. But here also are some difficulties: for first wee find by experience that the fountaines of most riuers, and those greate ons too, lye sensibly higher then the plaine surface of the Sea. Againe, if the riuer moue directly cound, what should bee the cause that begins and continues this motion? It is a motion besides the nature of the water, and therefore violent, what should driue it forward from the Sea to <hi>(C,)</hi> and from <hi>(C)</hi> to <hi>(B?)</hi> when the water is at <hi>(C,)</hi> or <hi>(W,)</hi> it is as necre to the Center <hi>(A)</hi> as when it is at <hi>(B,)</hi> and therefore it should seeme with more liklyhood it would stand still; for why should it striue to goe further, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where it is, it is as neare to the Center as whither it runnes. Or if some violence doe driue it from <hi>(C,)</hi> towards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14705:14"/>
                  <hi>(W,)</hi> yet (as it is the nature of violent motions) the further it goes the slower it will runne, till in the end it stand still, if there bee noe aduantadge of ground to helpe it forward.
<figure/>
As a bowle throwne downe a hill runnes easily and farre, if it once bee sett a going: but throwne vpon the ice (an euen place) it will without any lett at last stand still. Answere may bee made hereunto, that although there bee noe aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground, yet the water will still moue forwarde from <hi>(C)</hi> to <hi>(B)</hi> because the water that followes, pusheth forwarde that, that runnes afore. which answere will stand, when a good cause may bee shewed, which forcibly driueth the water from the Sea vnto <hi>(C)</hi> and out of the fountaine <hi>(C;)</hi> considering that (after this supposition) they lie both in the same circular superficies. Wherefore seeing, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without any inconueniency suppose it to moue by any of these lines either streight as <hi>(BC)</hi> or <hi>(BD,)</hi> or circular as <hi>(BWC)</hi> let vs enquire farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14705:15"/>
The most likely opinion is, that the motion of the water is mixt neither directly streight, or circular, but partly one, partly the other. Or if it be circular, it is in a circle whose cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a little distant from the Center of the whole globe. Let vs place fountaines then neither in <hi>(C)</hi> nor <hi>(D)</hi> but in <hi>(F)</hi> I say the water runnes either partly s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>ment, for the water descending continually from <hi>(F)</hi> to <hi>(S)</hi> will cause it still to turne forward; or else wholy circular in the circle <hi>(F X B.)</hi> And this is most a greeable to truth. For so it shall both runne round as it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let vs then see what is the hight of <hi>(F)</hi> the fountaines of <hi>Nilus,</hi> aboue <hi>(C)</hi> that is <hi>(B)</hi> the mouth or outlet of it into

Thus then the whole course of <hi>Nilus</hi> being 2700. miles from <hi>(F)</hi> to <hi>(B)</hi> the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or plumb descent of it <hi>(C F)</hi> will be 5. miles.

                  </gap>oe perpetuall violence vpon nature, in gathering togeather, the waters into one place, and being so gathered in keeping them from runing backe to cover the earth. At the first so soone as those hollow channells were prepared, the water did naturally slide downe into them, and out of them without miraculous power they cannot returne. For if the sea <hi>(B Y)</hi> should overflow the land towards <hi>(F)</hi> the water must ascend in running from <hi>(B)</hi> to <hi>(F)</hi> which is contrary to its nature. Certainly the midland countries, whence springs of great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers vsually arise, doe ly so h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gh, that the sea cannot naturally overflow them. For as for that opinion that the water of the sea in the middle lies on a heape higher then the water that is by the shore; and so that it is a harder matter to saile out of a Haven to seaward, then to come in) because they goe vpward): this is an empty speculation contray to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the grounds of nature it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the difficulty that is in this opinion, is to giue a reason how the waters mount vp to <hi>(F,)</hi> and whence the water comes that should flow out of so high a place of the earth, wherein I thinke as in many other secrets of nature we must content our selues with ignorance, seeing so many vaine conjectures haue taken no better successe.</p>

               <p>The Longitude must be reckoned by the degrees of the Aequator, the Latitude by the degrees of the Meridian.</p>
               <p>For example, in these two Haemisphaeres, the longitude of the whole earth is from <hi>(C)</hi> to <hi>(A)</hi> and <hi>(B)</hi> in the Aequator. The latitud is from <hi>(N)</hi> to <hi>(S),</hi> and from <hi>(Q)</hi> to <hi>(P)</hi> the North and South poles, and this reckoned in any meridian. The first meridian is <hi>(A N B S)</hi> which goes by the Canary Ilands, the Aequinoctiall is <hi>(A B C A).</hi> Now I haue a Citty giuen <hi>sc. (D)</hi> I would know in what longitude and latitude it is. For the longitude I consider what meridian passeth through it, which is the meridian <hi>(N D S)</hi> which crosseth the Aequinoctiall in <hi>(I)</hi> at 15 degrees, wherefore I say that <hi>(D)</hi> stands Eastward from the first Meridian 15 degrees. So I finde that the Citty (ε) is 150 degrees Eastward, <hi>(G)</hi> 195, and <hi>(F)</hi> 345.</p>
               <p>For the Latitude I consider what paralell runnes through <hi>(D E G)</hi> or <hi>(F)</hi> and I finde the 30 to passe by <hi>(D)</hi> 45 by <hi>(E)</hi> the 15 by <hi>(F)</hi> the 45 Southward by <hi>(G)</hi> and those numbers are the latitude of the place that are distant from the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>(C A B).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the means whereby the longitude of places is found out, there is scarce any thing that hath troubled Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians so much as the observation of it. For because no standing marke can be taken (the Heavens alwaies run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about) it must needs be difficult. To measure vpon the earth, going alwaies vnder the same paralell, is a way certain in regard of some few places, but so troublesome in it selfe,

and vnprofitable in regard of other places that ly out of that paralell, that it may be accounted a fruitlesse labour. The voyages &amp; accounts of Marriners at Sea, are so full of casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; vncertainty by reason of the doubtfull variation of the compasse, the vnequall violence of windes and tides, the false making of their sea cards, by which they faile, and the ignorance of the Masters for the greatest part, as there can hardly be any assured, reckoning made by them. The best means of observation is by Eclipses of the Sunne &amp; Moone, which in severall Countries are sooner or later seene, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as one place lies farther East or farther West from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But this also falls out so seldome, and when it happens, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
