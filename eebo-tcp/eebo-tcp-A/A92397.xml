            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<date>Friday, July 8. 1642.</date>
Concerning the marching of horſe and foot towards
HVLL.
And, the manner of that Counties appearance on Heworth Moore, on
Thurſday laſt before His Majeſtie.
With the Copy of a Warrant from the Right Honorable the Earl of LINSEY,
Generall of His Majeſties Forces, To Sir <hi>Thomas Metham</hi> Knight, for the compleating of His Regiments.</head>
            <p>ON Sunday laſt about three a clock in the morning, the Trumpet went about to call out the troop of horſe here, which
marched preſently away towards <hi>Hull,</hi> which put us all in great fear, by reaſon of the ſuddenneſſe of it, which we heard
after was cauſed by the coming in of the <hi>Holland</hi> ſhip. The company of foot which attended the Kings Majeſtie, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon Munday and Tueſday, upon Wedneſday the King went himſelf; all this week paſſage betwixt <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>York</hi>
is ſtopt and hindred: Two Proclamations was here publiſhed, one, that none ſhould give any relief to Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the other,
that the King will pardon all the Souldiers that will ſubmit to Him, and give them a Moneths pay in hand till he can otherwiſe
employ them, and provide for them; there was alſo another, that none of the Magazines ſhould be removed from the places where
they are, but kept and employed by His Majeſties Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday directions were given to the Gentlemen who appeared with their horſes, to go to <hi>Heworth Moore,</hi> there to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
His Majeſties pleaſure, who about two a clock in the afternoon came thither; at their coming, His Majeſtie commanded that
the Gentlemen ſhould divide themſelves one way, and their men another way, that He might view them, which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
but upon the view, thoſe who appeared, and were not inrolled, were but a ſmall number, not much above fourſcore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it was ſuggeſted to the King, that not half of the County was ſummoned, and it was thereupon concluded that the Head-Conſtables
ſhould be called on to give an account of their ſervice, and that there ſhould be another Summons.</p>
            <p>From thence His Majeſtie (accompanied with the Prince, the Duke, and the Prince Electour) rid directly to <hi>Beverley,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
His carriage was gone before.</p>
            <p>There are nine Iriſh Rebels which were taken by the Scots, and brought to the King, gone from hence this day towards <hi>London,</hi>
the King refers them to the Parliament, the high Sheriff was to take care for their ſafe bringing up.</p>
            <p>Alſo, on Munday laſt Sir <hi>Thomas Methams</hi> Regiment was commanded ſuddenly to march, his company being to be made up of
the Trained Bands, as appeareth by the enſuing Warrant from the Lord Generall, over ſome companies there are ſtrangers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Officers.</p>
            <p>BY vertue of a Warrant from the Right Honorable,<note place="margin">Eaſt Riding, Com. Ebor.</note> the Earl of <hi>Linſey,</hi> Generall of His Majeſties forces for
the compleating of the Regiment of the Trained Bands now under my command; and for that you have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
this ſervice, in ſending ignorant and untrained men, and ſparing (without any command or direction) ſuch
as formerly have been trained, and ſerved under me; Theſe are therefore by vertue of the ſaid Warrant, ſtraitly in His Majeſties
Name to command you, that upon ſight hereof, you Summon and bring all ſuch perſons that be able of body, as well private as
common, formerly ſet in my Muſter Rolls, now inhabiting and reſiding in your ſeverall Townſhips; And alſo all ſuch as upon the
Summons for this ſervice, have either fled or abſented themſelves, and them with their Arms that are wanting in your ſeverall
Conſtableries, perſonally upon the ſight hereof to bring to me to <hi>Newland</hi> neer <hi>Cottingham,</hi> where I am with my Regiment for
His Majeſties ſpeciall ſervice; as alſo, ſome of the ableſt men of body in your Townſhips, to be in the places of divers impotent,
lame, and unfit for ſervice; And further to certifie unto me the Names of all the private men charged with Arms within your
ſeverall Conſtableries, which be either dead or removed, and without partiality or affection bring ſuch as are fit for ſupply, And
if any by you ſo ſummoned ſhall refuſe to obey, that then you forthwith convey them to His Majeſties Goal at the Caſtle of
<hi>York,</hi> there to remain without Bail or Mainpriſe, till they be by due courſe of Law from thence delivered: Whereof fail you
not at your utmoſt perill.</p>
