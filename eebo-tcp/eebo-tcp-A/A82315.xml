         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>common)</hi> among Profeſſors, then <hi>Zeal without

headlong, againſt the <hi>power</hi> of godlineſs, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Form,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of

and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, thinking thereby they did God <hi>good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi>
And even godly men themſelves, having in ſome things more
<hi>Zeal</hi> then <hi>Knowledge,</hi> have groſly erred and miſtaken in very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

ſaying he muſt go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there ſuffer death; and the ſons

but the <hi>Parliament,</hi> out of a great Zeal are providing for the ſtrict
<hi>Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> Day.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that they may take <hi>Knowledge along</hi> with their <hi>Zeal,</hi>
or rather in the <hi>head</hi> of it, as its guide and Leader, I have thought
good to admoniſh them, that they ſearch the Word of God in this
matter, and that without the Word they preſume to do nothing,
though it ſeem never ſo glorious, ſeeing whatever is done without
the Word, though it ſeem never ſo holy and good, yet is nothing elſe
but plain Idolatry. And becauſe none ſhould ſay that I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Word, and given a falſe ſenſe of it, and am come forth
to trouble the Church with new Light and Notions, I have therefore
produced in this matter only the Teſtimonies of <hi>Others,</hi> yet ſuch,
whoſe names are pretious in the Church for their Wiſdom and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
underſtanding in the Word, as well as for their Faith and
Love, who though dead, yet ſpeak to this matter in theſe following

And Chriſt is not alonely crucified in Paraſceden, and riſen

               <p>The Jews were commanded to celebrate the holy Sabbath one
day in the week,<note place="margin">Ambroſe ad Irenae. Epiſt. 77.</note> that they ſhould be ſubject to no burden: but they
being looſed from worldly buſineſs, I would they had ſo paſſed, that
they had carryed with them no burden of grievous ſins unto the
everlaſting Sabbath of the world to come. Let the Synagogue of
the Jews obſerve the day, let the Church obſerve it to Immortality.

week if it were expedient, and not enough to teach the people.
Neither was there any cauſe to change it from the Saturday, then to
put difference between us and the Jews, and leſt we ſhould become
ſervants to the day after their ſuperſtition. Neither needed we any
holyday at all, if the people might be taught without it.</p>

                  <hi>Bernardine Ochine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ochine in Dialog. cont. Pap.</note> Since Jeſus Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs
appeared to the world, we ought to judge all times of grace to be a

diverſity between one day and another, to be altogether holy &amp;
ſo ſpend them altogether in the honor and glory of God. But the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117712:4"/>
Pope commands the contrary, that there ſhall be a diverſity beween

               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> The eighth day ſignifies allegorically the life to
come. For Chriſt reſted in the Sepulchre, the Sabbath day or whole
ſeventh day, but he roſe in the day following the Sabbath, which
is the eighth, and the beginning of a new week, <hi>nec numeratur ultra
eam alia dies,</hi> neither is any day numbred beyond that. For Chriſt by
his death <hi>concluſit hebdomadas temporum,</hi> hath concluded the weeks of
times, and in the eighth day entered into another kinde of life, in
which there are no more dayes reckoned, but it is one eternal day
without any courſes of night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, The Sabbath was commanded to the Jews in a
figure, as the Apoſtle expreſly ſignifies, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. which is a ſhadow of
future things, but the body is of Chriſt. The Sabbath ſignifies, that
very ſpiritual time which Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs hath illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
which hath no night, whence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith <hi>Ch.</hi> 66. moneth
ſhall be from moneth, and Sabbath from Sabbath: and the Apoſtle
reproves the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that they obſerved days, and moneths, and
times, and yeers, according to the Jewiſh rite, that is only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
therefore that precept (yea all) is ceaſed to perfect Chriſtians, for
the Law is not given to a righteous man. Notwithſtanding the
Church hath retained Feaſts, becauſe of the neceſſity of the word of
God, for their ſakes who are unperfect, for a true righteous man is
ſo like to God, that as God is indifferent to all days, to all places, to
all perſons, ſo is he; every day to him is holyday. But to the weak,
who are not yet mortified according to the old man, it is needful that
they ſhould be occupied in watchings, faſtings, labors, prayers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the uſe of which, they may attain to the profit of the
inner man; but when the body is chaſtened &amp; brought into ſervitude,
and the paſſions of it mortified, then they by degrees may ceaſe, and
be ſo much abated, as the inner man is profited, in ſuch ſort, that if
he ſhould be perfect, theſe things ought altogether to ceaſe. This is
that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Law is our School-maſter to bring us
unto Chriſt,</hi> for the Law made nothing perfect, <hi>Luth. tom. 1. f.</hi> 116.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. Sabbath ſhall be from Sabbath, that is ſaith he,
I will change the rites and Feaſts of the Jewiſh Prieſthood, and there
ſhall not be in the Church, the diſtinction of the Sabbath <hi>ſed perpetua
Sabbata erunt,</hi> but there ſhall be perpetual Sabboths; but theſe
are in the Spirit and in faith. For becauſe of this fleſh of ours, there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117712:4"/>
is need of certain days, wherein we muſt meet together, for the
handling of the word and the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ad <hi>Coloſ.</hi> ca. 2. v. 16.</note> Such a diviſion of dayes belonged to the Jews,
that they ſhould devoutly obſerve the dayes commanded, by ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from others: but amongſt Chriſtians ſuch a diviſion is
ceaſed. But ſome will ſay, we do yet retain ſome obſervation of
days. I anſwer, we in no way keep dayes, as if there were any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in holy dayes, <hi>aut quaſi fas non ſit tunc laborare,</hi> or as if it were
not lawfull to labor then, but only reſpect is had of politie and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not of dayes. And a little after, on theſe words, <hi>The body is of
Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, That the ſubſtance of thoſe things which the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
heretofore did figure, is ſet before our eyes in Chriſt, becauſe
he conteines in himſelf what ever they did foretel ſhould be. And
therefore he that recals the Ceremonies into uſe, either overwhelms
the manifeſtation of Chriſt, or ſpoils Chriſt of his vertue and
makes him void. And therefore if any mortal man ſhall uſurp to
himſelf the office of a Judge in this matter, Let us not obey, ſeeing
Chriſt the lawful Judge abſolves us.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Calvin,</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. ſaith, when therefore proper holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is attributed to dayes by themſelves, when one day is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from another for Religions ſake, when holydays are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
part of the worſhip of God, then dayes are obſerved amiſs.
We now, who have a difference of dayes, do not impoſe the ſnare of
neceſſity on mens conſciences, we do not diſtinguiſh between days,
as if one day were more holy then another, we do not place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Religion and the worſhip of God, but we only provide for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and concord. And ſo the obſervation with us is free and pure
from all ſuperſtition.</p>
