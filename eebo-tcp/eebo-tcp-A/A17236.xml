         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Praeface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>GENTLE Reader,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this myne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
               </note> I am nowe to craue this fauour of thee, that I may be so bolde, as to present thee with such an argument, as of the verie nature of it, is not so welcome to those that are of a quiet and peaceable disposition: such also as my selfe do so little like of, that neuer yet did I medle therewith of myne onwe accord: hauing otherwise business enough, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind, that is sufficient to occupie me. Howbeit, it is needefull also, that the aduersarie be answered, and that the weakenes of their allegations (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might seeme to be strong) be euer discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that others be not shaken thereby. And seeing that I am nowe by this occasion drawne forth to this kind of argument, and withall haue left me good store of matter to goe against, I could do no lesse then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer my call in this kind also. The matter is this. A few yeeres since I somewhat purged, and afterwarde published (as it is sufficiently known vnto manie) the Booke of <hi>Resolution</hi>: the rather to prouoke those discontented countrimen of ours, to gather themselues to more moderate waies, and to better agreement in the cause of Religion: as in my Praeface I had noted before. To which end also I was not so curious in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, but willinglie left whatsoeuer I thought might tollerably stand: and somewhat further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them also, I adioyned thereunto an other little Treatise tending to Pacification. Since which time the same <hi>R. P.</hi> that had set it foorth so corruptly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath not only set it forth so again: but also hath
<pb facs="tcp:13137:3"/>
much increased it, with those common fragments of their moth-eaten Poperie: &amp; with some other both discourses &amp; vagaries besides. Howbeit, he hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the title, and hath framed another so grosly vnto it, that of whom soeuer he borrowed the best part of the former: yet may you be sure that the title of this latter Booke is his, without any question: For beeing weary of the former title, that made the whole matter no more but a Christian exercise (as in deede, beeing purged, it might rightly be termed so) vpon a smal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he iustleth that aside, out of the way: &amp; being very impotently caried with a Pharifaiacall zeale, to aduance the righteousnes of workes, against the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and merits of Christ, hee must needs haue this <hi>Christian Exercise</hi> in the way of godlines, to be a <hi>Directorie, guiding men vnto saluation,</hi> and yet <hi>Christian</hi> too: as though Christ had come downes from heauen, to teache vs to seeke our saluation (at least in part) in our own righteousnes: &amp; not only in his death and merits, without any thing els to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled withall, in that account. The additions also that he hath put therunto, doe seldome answer the former platforme: some, of argument good enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but not so fitly agreeing to the matter that hee had in hand: others, that draw neerer to the matter that was to be handled, but weake in themselues, and in many places to so little purpose, that he doth nought els oftimes but fetch certain idle careers about it. A booke that was much (vntil they had seene it) desired of many, vpon the hope that by the former was concea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of it: but once being had, so little answering their expectation, that accordingly it findeth (euen among the most of themselues) but smal estimation: &amp; being so corrupt a thing as it is, &amp; almost as incorrigible as
<pb facs="tcp:13137:3"/>
the Ma. himself, I mean not to wast my labor about it.</p>
            <p>In the Praeface of which booke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>That the Aduersaries haue it their common maner to make much a doe about nothing.</hi>
               </note> &amp; in certaine of his Annotations theron, he much inueigheth against me, and it passing angry for medling so far as I did with the former. But it is vpon so litle ground, &amp; to so little purpose withal, that for a time I could in no wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe, that it were any better then lost labor, to make him answer: both because the matter it selfe was of no importance, that he laid to my charge, but in al places (to speake of) answereth it selfe: and because the booke likewise was of smal account, nor had, but of few of their own fauorites: &amp; among them also could litle be suffered to come abroad. But yet one other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect there is, wherein at length I was perswaded to make him answer. For it is not vnknown (almost vnto any, in these daies of ours) what greeuous complaints they make against vs, howe boldly and resolutly they cleere themselues, and charge vs, almost in all thinges that goe betwixt vs: as plainly appeareth in their Rhemes Testament for altogether: &amp; in their seueral writings besides, for euery one a part by themselues. Wherein it is a world to see, with what faces &amp; bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of speech they auowe, those foolish &amp; wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of theirs (that without question are only Romish and most schismatical, yet notwithstanding) to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Catholike: &amp; the truth of Iesus Christ, as it was by himself, &amp; by his Apostles deliuered vnto vs, to be no better then plain heresie: and, for those wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises that of late they haue so busily imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues about, how some of them deny those things that were as cleere as the light of the sunne, others iustifie those that are most wicked &amp; trecherous in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree: and, when some of them are punished for those their demerits, &amp; yet but in very moderate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="tcp:13137:4"/>
and but so farre as vrgent necessity required ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet notwithstanding they cry out of such persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as neuer was heard of. Which writings of theirs what man can read (that is not before acquainted with their maner of dealing) but that needs he must yeeld some credit vnto them? although he can think that all is not true: yet so bold speeches as those, must needs breed a perswasion with some, that there is some great cause that so they complain: or at least somwhat there is wherein they are iniured. So that when as now they find by experience, they are not able by learning to shew it to those, that can examine their speeches by learning: the next that remaineth is, by out-facing &amp; boldnes of speech to retain such credit as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the harts of those, that they know will examine nothing they say, &amp; yet neuertheles beleeue that it is as true as the Gospel. Now that they see, that there is no place for the Kingdom of the Beast in the harts of those that examin all things by the word of GOD before they beleeue them: what other way is left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but to establish his throne only in such, as wil beleeue whatsoeuer they say, &amp; neuer make any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>This aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of mine to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the same course likewise.</hi>
               </note>Of which kind of out-facers &amp; liberal speakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this aduersary of mine is one (and so doth shew himself very plainly, in this which he hath doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me) although the matters be not great, that in this priuate quarel of his do lie betwixt vs, yet because it may serue well inough, to shew their maner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in such quarrels as they vse against vs, I saw no cause to refuse the occasion that himself hath offered, and so to put him in mind of his doings therin, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also may so much the better see, what to think of the lauish speeches, high wordes, and great out-cries of
<pb facs="tcp:13137:4"/>
him and his fellowes for these matters. And the more angry that he and his fellowes do now shew themselus to be, and the more impatiently that they do, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they doe, the plainlier do they bewray themselues vnto those, that can rightly decypher whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth: that is, from an euill &amp; a desperate cause. Leesers, I grant, are by common prouerbe allowed to haue their words: yet when they are so very impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, &amp; that for the veriest trifles that are, it is a faire and likely coniecture, both that their wine in spent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, when as now they draw forth nothing but lees: and that they haue but smal store of breade, when as they eate Akorns so fast &amp; hungerly as they doe.</p>
            <p>Which that thou maist the better perceaue in this aduersary of mine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In what maner this my answer in framed vnto him.</hi>
               </note> &amp; in this quarel which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp against me, I haue made him this answer that now I do present vnto thee: it may be, not in so large and ample maner as some would require, but (I trust) both sufficient to note the matter aforesaid, &amp; strong inough for mine own defence in those my doings. The controuersies of purpose I haue euer auoided (I meane for any set Treatice of them, but only so far as did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain vnto mine own needful defence) both because I am wel eased already therof by many, that can dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse them much better then I: and for that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie himselfe, that of purpose doth still enterlace them with other matters, yet himselfe will neuer seeme to haue it his purpose to medle with them. And yet in truth, it seemeth to be the only cause, why he woulde seeme so to deale in matters of godlines: that so, wher as otherwise by learning himselfe dooth know, that he could neuer be able: yet vnder pretence of treating but only of godlines of life, he might win some credite to those popish errors, that hetherto for their pompe
<pb facs="tcp:13137:5"/>
and bellies they haue sought to defend. And therfore lesse maruell, that he was so maruelous angry, that I wiped out those his popish coruptions out of the former booke so much as I did: because it crossed his secrete purpose, &amp; did not suffer him so quietly to enioy that silly help, that now he thought meetest, whereby to let in their naughty errors. Insomuch that heerby they teach vs to beware of their Poperie, not only in such bookes of theirs, as wherein they professe to treat of those matters: but in the residue to, wherein they would in no wise seeme to medle with them, but for to treat of godlines only. And to the end that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test the better perceaue, what are those places wherin he findeth himselfe so much greeued, for this cause I haue praefixed those bookes againe before this myne answer: and in the margent of those places against which he inueigheth, haue noted vnto thee, in what part or Section of this myne Answer I haue treated therof. That so thou mayst the more readily find, both what grounds he hath taken of this his quarell: and how weake they are to beare the burthen that theron he hath layd. This is the effect of my Answer vnto him: which also thou hadst had the last Sommer, but that the Printer (after that it was deliuered into his hands) desired, for one matter therunto appertaining, a further respite. But I trust that now also it commeth not out of season: and such as it is that do I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thy fauorable censure &amp; interpretation, and so bid thee hartily wel to fare in Iesus Christ.

            <head>The answer of <hi>Edm. Bunny</hi> vnto the Praeface and Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of R. P.</head>
            <p>I Haue at the length (with much adoo,<note n="1" place="margin">Not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the first to make any answer here vnto by what reason I was after induced vnto it.</note> got sight of that, which (by others) before I had heard you had doone against mee. Wherein you haue so far discouered your selfe, that for a time, after that I had pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rused your dooings, I thought it needles to make any further answere vnto you: partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that such a quarrell is more priuate, then that it needeth to bee imparted to others; but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, for that the matter that you bring, is so weake, as that it needeth none to cast it downe, but doth easily fall of it selfe, without any further impugning of it. But when I had further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red withall, howe confidently you are woont to speake on your owne behalfe, when you haue no iote of truth to beare you out; and howe readie some others are to beleeue whatsoeuer you say: in this respect I thought it best to make you answer, that so both your selfe and others also may better perceiue that oftimes you complaine without any

And so I must giue you to vnderstand, that although in these your dooings you deepely charge me, yet haue I giuen you so little cause so to do, as that whatsoeuer contempt and reproch you did meane to cast vpon me, and by that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vpon others also, the same is like all to bee yours, and to redound vnto your selfe the author of it: and that not onely in those things wherein you haue directed your stile against mee, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but also in that which in this edition you haue otherwise brought vs.</p>

Perused, and accompanied with a Treatise tending to Pacification by Edm.

The seely help that you haue for your self, is in your misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. but plain dealing had bene much better.

that it did plainely import, that that booke of Resolution was before, and none of mine: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you strooke out that worde Now, that others might the more easily conceiue that opinion of mee, that therein you laboured to cast vpon mee. If in truth you were persuaded, that you had such aduantage against me in those things that follow, as afterward you would seeme that you are, you might well haue spared this kind of dealing: and either you should haue set downe the whole, as I did, so to affoord me my iust defence; or else you should haue suppressed that (togither with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which being seuered from that other, might for your sake seem to charge me with that which I did not.<note place="margin">How hee hath altered my name, either of grosse neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or some foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.</note> Now, that herein you doe leaue out one of the letters of my name (and not onely here, but continually after, almost throughout your whole booke) I know not well what to say vnto it. If you haue done it of set purpose, belike you haue some mysterie in it: if it be so, then bring it foorth, and accordingly you shall heare from mee againe, if neede so require. If not, that is, if you haue no my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in it, then is your negligence very apparant, that hauing it set down right vnto you, you haue so very often missed it, when you were to set it downe againe. And wheresoeuer such negligence reigneth; belike the matters are not great, that there we may looke for. But because that this matter was but of small importance, wee will bee perswaded, that you made store of your diligence heere, and would not gladly spende anie part of it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13137:7"/>
now, that so you might haue the more in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for that which followeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 After the title you take in hand the sentence of Scripture which I did set vnder the same,<note place="margin">Of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of scripture.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday, and to day, and the same for euer. Heb. 13.8.</hi> and therein you charge me two special wayes: and yet notwithstanding you leaue vnto me greater aduauntage against you therein, then you haue any against me, in any part of the whole whatsoeuer. But belike the sentence it selfe being so pregnant as it is, against the very sinewes and marrow of your profession, did at the first, euen at the verie sight thereof, so offend your eies, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward you could not deale peaceably with it. First, (you say) you see not, to what purpose I should place that sentence there:<note place="margin">What fault he findeth in mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</note> you cal it a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; and you thinke it were hard for other men to coniecture, why I did it. What if you knowe not why it was done? What need that offend you? So that the sentence it selfe be good, what neede you be greeued that you finde it there? Are your gatherings or gleanings of that nature, that such a sentence may not bee allowed such place among them. But because you cannot coniecture, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neither, as you suppose, what reason I had there to place it, I will not sticke my selfe to tell you, that which may satisfie you and those others. You must know I had to deale with that, which did not in diuers pointes agree with the truth it selfe in Iesus Christ: which when I laboured to take away, it might be notwithstanding, that I left
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13137:8"/>
some vnespied of mee. In which respect, euerie one may plainely see, that it did very fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the purpose: both to be a defence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for such corruptions as I tooke from it; and to be a preseruatiue withall, against such corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as remained (if any such were) shewing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that I meant not to commend or leaue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto them, but only Iesus Christ our Sauior. And if you had not blind-folded your selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you came to it, with a setled purpose, to catch at whatsoeuer you might get any holde of, your selfe no doubt must needs haue seene it: so fitlie it doth agree with the purpose that I had in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the argument it selfe doth so plainely witnes the same. Then you proceede to a further mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deale more hardly, both with mee, and the text it selfe. The text you would haue sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be, not onely in it selfe harde or obscure; but also one of those <hi>Obscure sentences or places,</hi> wherewith <hi>The holie Fathers noted the ancient he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes to delight themselues, and deceiue others:</hi> and then, comming to mee, that I haue to that ende brought it in; that is, <hi>to delight my selfe, &amp; deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Wherein that you may preuaile the better, in your marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you send vs to Epiphanius &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, &amp; after a sort to S. Peter too, as thogh we should find the same in them. Who knoweth not, I pray you, that heretiks were wont (as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth now in your selues) to vse certain senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture, to establish their errours withall? But what is that to this purpose? Haue you anie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13137:8"/>
dowt of any such dealing in this? must <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday &amp; to day, &amp; the same for euer, be now so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, so apt to deceiue, &amp; so ready a tricke for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike</hi>? I know what you mean: and, if you durst for shame, you would speak plainlier than you do. If Iesus Christ be the only Sauior, for al the ages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past, for the time present, &amp; for the time to com, you see not well where to cog in those other deuises, &amp; mony-doctrines that you haue of your owne. For this cause therfore needs must this also be an <hi>obscure sentence, &amp; apt to deceiue</hi>: &amp; to vse the same, <hi>the tricke of an heretike?</hi> But doe you thinke that Epiphanius or Augustine would sooth you herein: or that S. Peter meant of any such matter? If they would, find it, &amp; set it down: if not, how is it then (marke whence you are falne) that you are not ashamed so fowly to wrest them.<note place="margin">What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage therein he hath left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> The aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that herein you haue left to me against your self, is (in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) no great matter; &amp; yet such as I saide: &amp; such as it is, needs must you heare of it, because you are so ready to catch at others. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth therfore in these 2. points: one, that you do the sentence some wrong, to set it down so negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusedly as you do, not distinguishing the members thereof by orderly pointing, as you had it of me, &amp; as it is (witnes your selues) in the text it self;<note place="margin">How indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly (&amp; therfore il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauoredly) he setteth down that text of scripture.</note> the other, that twise togither you do so resolutely ascribe it to S. Paul. Touching the first it may be but the ouersight of you or your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: howbeit, both of you ought to haue vsed more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in it. The sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to good purpose, it is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13137:9"/>
weightie, and of great importance: you ought to haue seene better vnto it; both he for his part, and you for yours. But I doubt very much, that your Printer hath doone, but as you your selfe set it downe vnto him: and that you haue doone it of purpose, nothing at all regarding how confusedly, nor how ill-fauoredly you serue vs with the word of God. But we will not so take it at your handes. With ill will you are brought at length to haue some dealing with the written worde of God: and very shame hath woon at your hands, not so far to abandon your selues from the scriptures, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise full gladly you would. And nowe that you must for shame doe somewhat, you would gladly do it as ill-fauouredly as you might, that so wee might find, neither life, nor comfort, nor sense ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in. But you shall not so abuse the word of life: you shall not shrinke from it, and yet you shall not sliue it neither. Whereunto if we may be so bolde as to adde, that your selfe is one of these Iesuite-friers (that late ofspring of that ruinous Popedom) as that <hi>R. P.</hi> that is thought to bee the authour of this booke, is said to be: you haue done well, so to let the world vnderstand (and you may do well to marke it your selfe) what ill accord there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Iesus and Iesuites whensoeuer they meete. You had no sooner espied him to be in place, but by and by your stomake rose against him: and some way or other must you needes shewe your gall, there was no remedie. As touching the latter of them, I denie not, but that it is the iudgement
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13137:9"/>
of diuers of the ancient fathers,<note place="margin">How reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely hee setteth down, that which the fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor the learned now, could so fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on.</note> that it might bee the Apostle Saint Paul that wrote it; and, of some that it was: and so likewise of the writers nowe. But yet you cannot bee ignorant withall, that the matter was then in question among them: &amp; yet is, with the learned now. What ground therefore can you haue to affirme so resolutely, that which the fathers of olde, and the learned now, haue not yet so throughly decided? If you alledge the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the church of Rome, we hold it for nothing in these matters now: since the time that you are departed away from the faith, in so manie things as you are: and haue banded your selues against the Lord, and his annointed. And if needs you will looke to be allowed this libertie, that you may so determine vpon it, as you thinke good, you had need first to see how those reasons may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that are to the contrarie: rather than so seruilely to cleaue to the bare iudgement of those, that set it downe as themselues list (I speake it but of your owne companions nowe) without regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto what side the strongest reasons incline. Seeing that we do all agree, that it is Apostolical, and the vndoubted word of God, it can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue vnto it, soberly to harken further of him that wrote it, neither yet to doubt in such a point of an opinion but so farre receiued, so long as wee see not the reasons cleared, that are to the contrarie. But it may be you wil thinke, that these things are so small in themselues, that the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that therein you haue left vnto mee, was not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13137:10"/>
to be regarded, nor so to be laide to your charge. Whether it be litle or great, it forceth not now: but this may I plainely set downe vnto you, that the lesser of them both is of that importance, that therein (as I said) you haue giuen greater cause or iust reproofe; than I did to you, or any other, not onely for setting downe the sentence it selfe in such sort as I did, but also in all the rest that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. When you were so readie to reproue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vpon your owne surmise, without any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for your perswasion therein: you should haue taken such heed to your selfe, as that wherein you condemned another, your selfe were not found more faultie than he.</p>

And I will assure the Reader, togither with you, that such as this your beginning is, such &amp; none other is that which followeth: in the one you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a tast of the other. For such occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I gaue you (in the disposing of the title, &amp; in prefixing the sentence aforesaid) so to inueigh against me as you do, such haue I giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you in that which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: &amp; as you deal in these things against me, as if there were a fault co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing you haue found none, &amp; do not, nor can not lay any to my charge, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so do you in the rest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13137:10"/>
likewise, as (I trust) the indifferent Reader shall soon perceiue. And so you haue done very well, so distinctly to point your finger as you doe, to this your woorthy handling of those matters that you met withall in the first page: &amp; I am content, if so you wil haue it, that it shall stand for a right pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of al the rest. Be it now whatsoeuer it can be: such as this is, such is the other; &amp; any man that will, may in this beginning, see the whole course that you do hold vntill the ending.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Which that your self may better declare,<note place="margin">A friuolous slander of the keies &amp; crown, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yorke his Armes.</note> as you haue ended with this your first page: so haue you a fresh begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the next. For there, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the arms of the church of York, &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop (that now is) togither, you readily infer (a conclusion no doubt, that followeth on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, passing wel) that it is with vs <hi>Good doctrine now, &amp; very commendable in my L. g. of York. to claim both keies &amp; crown from Peters seat, which in the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, is made so hainous, &amp; so bitterly inueied against daily.</hi> But do you in good sadnes beleeue, that now we haue any doctrine of such matters: or if we had, that we account the same to be good? or haue you the face to make this comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the churches of <hi>Yorke</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi>: as though it were none other <hi>claiming of the keies and crowne from Peters seat, which in the B. of Rome, is</hi> (as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you to terme it) <hi>made so hainous &amp;c.</hi> but onely such, as by setting down the armes of the church of <hi>York,</hi> is challenged to the Archbishop there? If you be but in iest, the matter may be more easilie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13137:11"/>
borne: if you bee in earnest, it is too grosse and too plaine an vntruth, for any to oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against it. Your owne fellowes will take so ill with it, that your vnshamefastnes neede not to be chastised of any other.<note place="margin">As good title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, onely by coupling their armes togither, as they haue any by the word of God.</note> But seing that you haue set the comparison, I will not sticke to put you in mind of one speciall point thereto appertaining. You know how your Bishop of Rome hath clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both the keies and the crowne; and that you suppose the same to stand, by very good warrant from the worde of God: on the other side, you know how little the Archbishop of Yorke hath claimed the matters you speake of (the one of them nothing at all; nor the other neither in such sort as you meane) and that your selfe can bee in no wise induced to thinke, that onely by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaling or setting downe the armes of the church and his togither, hee may iustly make any claime vnto them. And yet are not you able to finde in the holy Scriptures, any one place whatsoeuer, whereon you may better ground that vsurpation of your Bishop of Rome, as peculiar to that Sea of his (the <hi>Crowne</hi> at all, or the <hi>Keies</hi> either out of his dioces:) than any bodie els may be able to prooue, that by this title onely, that is, by setting downe of their armes togither, the Archbishop of Yorke may take vppon him those thinges that you talke of. Insomuch that as that can neuer bee prooued, nor hath so much as shew of reason, not anie peece of ground-worke at all: no more hath that of yours in the word of God; howsoeuer that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13137:11"/>
hitherto you haue otherwise borne the world in hand. And, whereas it appeereth in this your new booke,<note place="margin">His printers Alphabet: fit for the matter hee hath in hand.</note> that the first letter of the Alphabet that your Printer hath vsed in the printing thereof (I meane for the capitall, or greater letters) is euer deckt with a couple of deuils, shaking out their tailes, and laying their handes on the first letter of those your labours (as appeereth in al those chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that begin with the first letter of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet (six or seuen in all) it shall bee as easie a matter to prooue, that your whole Booke (whatsoeuer thereof is yours) is of the deuill, only because that by your Printers good meanes in the first letter of your Alphabet they doe so often and so readily meet togither to confer on the matter, or else to confirme it, by such imposing of handes, as there they vse, as for you to proue, that, by ioining those arms togither (which is all out of which you haue made that large conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) it is with vs good <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine now, and very commendable in my Lords grace of Yorke, to claime both keies and crowne from Peters seat.</hi> The common prouerbe is, that it is but an ill procession, wherein the deuill beareth the crosse: and that would not sticke (as weake as it is) to yeeld a stronger proofe for the one, than is any that you haue for the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Then comming to my Epistle Dedicatorie,<note place="margin">Vpon the Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie he associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to an</note> there much plainlier you shew forth your selfe in your right and proper colours.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13137:12"/>
out, in that which you alledge out of mee; seeing the matters are not of any great importance. But the matter that I charge you withall, is, that there you shew your selfe to be so impudently giuen to reproch, euen such a one also, who in manie good respectes you ought to reuerence (your selfe can easily know whom I meane) that first you seeme cleane to forget how wicked an ymp he was, that did but discouer that great ouersight of his father Noah, &amp; made report thereof to his brethren; and did not seeke himselfe rather in silence and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to make it vp, before it had beene further knowne: and what a iudgement it pleased God thereupon to thunder foorth against him by the mouth of his father, &amp; against his posteritie also. There was (not far off) a better example in both his brethren for you to haue followed, if you had the grace to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same: &amp; so much stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against you, as in this you knowe there was a fault indeed, &amp; in the other you settle your selfe but in the weake report of others, &amp; in your own naughtie surmise. But you make no great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to say the worst you can of any of vs: our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are no Noahs to you; &amp; therfore that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Cham crosseth you not. Put case it do not: yet was ther no help with you, but that needs you must ioine your selfe to such a company in so bad an action as that? When (by all likelyhood) you could not bee ignorant, how that same vpon the hearing was found to be a wicked practise, &amp; that by the highest court that we haue, &amp; the parties
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13137:12"/>
condemned for it (who afterward also, for the most &amp; chiefest of them, did themselues confes it) was your desire of reproching so great, that yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding you must take in hand so bad a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; sort your self to such a condemned compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as those? But belike you were loth there shuld be any so bad a matter among vs, and you not to haue a hand in it also: &amp; could not find the worst of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al so base a people, but that, in such an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as that, they were company good inough for your selfe. Howbeit, howsoeuer you can be perswaded of them that in such case they we<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> meet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for you: yet is it on their partes likely inough that, if they had suspected such an one as you to haue bene so ready to ioine with them, euen that only would haue made the meanest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue misliked their owne dooings so much the rather. And then had it been good, that you had bin one at the first, that so all the rest might haue bin stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby. Yet this one thing I can easily graunt you, that you thought your selfe no babe in this, that beeing disposed so to reproch, you chose out such an one, of whom you might be assured, that, after his cause so well debated, &amp; sentence giuen with him in so high a Court as that, he would lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle esteme of the misreport of such fellows as you. But I pray you Sir,<note place="margin">The great lewdnes of his own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in that kind.</note> could you so farre forget your selues, that you had so much leysure, as to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at this? With how great vncleannes you are charged on all hands, and long haue been, &amp; how weakely it is answered by the best of you all, is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13137:13"/>
a matter more cleere, than that I need so much as to point the finger vnto it. And in so great, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, &amp; so monstrous iniquitie of yours, could you so soone let passe the beame of your own eie, for to picke out the mote of an others?

If the vncleannes of that sin had annoied you, there had you a monstrous dunghil of it: if the neernes of it were that which troubled you, there you had it euen at your nose. The number of wiues, that at that time were found (or at least, noted) to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by you, throughout al the twelue Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopriks of France, amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the number of eight

hundred and fiftie thousand, threescore &amp; eleuen, and threescore and two thousand, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Of these, where they had fewest, which was in the Archbishoprike of Vienne, and of yoong women, one thousand-thousand, fourescore and one thousand, eight hundred and foure; &amp; where they had least of this kinde, which was in the Archbishoprike of Vienne also, yet not with stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no fewer, that threescore and eight thousand and nine hundred. And yet besides these, you are noted to haue abused fortie and two thousand, six hundred, fourescore and three others, in Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie also: and where you abused fewest of al in this kinde, which for this matter was the Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of Burdeaux, yet there you are saide to haue abused no fewer than one thousand and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Besides all which, the purueiors of this their harlotrie, or such as they vsed to bring in this game to their hands, such as we call no better than bawdes, (and so consequently, fowlie also corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, though not in their bodies, yet in their soules) were no lesse than one hundred and threescore thousand, eight hundred, twentie and nine: and the bastardes, and bastards bastards, of this holie Clergie (witnesses inow of their vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) seuen hundred, threescore and fifteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, one hundred thirtie and eight persons. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whereas the Clergie of the Archbishoprike of Vienne had the fewest faultes discouered (for the two former) and the Clergie of Burdeaux, for the other: yet, that neither you, nor any other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13137:14"/>
of their fellowes besides, thinke much with them for comming so farre short of the rest, if it please you to consider the number of themselues, and of those whom they corrupted, and to lay them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, you may easily finde, that they were no Saints neither but in this point like to the rest for the number of them. For wheras themselues (togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their officers and seruants) were no mo but fiftie and fiue thousand, &amp; on the otherside, the wiues that they polluted, threescore and two thousand, &amp; two hundred; the yong women, thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and eight thousand, and nine hundred; their male kind also, one thousand and six hundred: in doth so fal out, that they polluted mo than them selues, by seuen thousand &amp; two hundred maried wiues, &amp; thirtene thousand &amp; nine hundred yong women, &amp; al that thousand &amp; six hundred males besides. So that, though you leaue to euery one of their officers &amp; seruants, one (making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but as two partes of three, in respect of their maisters themselues:) yet you leaue two a piece to themselues, and an ouerplus of foure thousand three hundred and on, either to take as a further bootie to themselues; or, if you thinke good, to be bestowed on such of their officers as they would haue the likest to them. Wherunto if we ad their purueiors (or bawds) which were twelue thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; were not only by them corrupted, but also very able men likewise for to witnes this vncleannes of theirs, then also the bastards, &amp; bastards bastardes of this holy Prouince, which were fiftie and seuen

thousand &amp; foure hundred: there may you finde witnesses inow (fourtene thousand &amp; foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mo than themselues, maister, officer, seruant, &amp; al) to witnes this vncleanes against them. The like might be said of the clergie of Burdeux also: but that one onely example may be sufficient to giue you some reasonable tast of the rest. And as for your bishops (which, a man would think shuld herein be freest of al) although themselues be as it is said (Archbishops, &amp; al) vnder an hundred: yet those also (euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues alone, without the help of others for them: see what reuerend fathers you haue that come masking here) haue polluted 468 married wiues, &amp; 900 single women (&amp; haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them 540 bastards) &amp; yet notwithstanding haue abused in Sodomitrie, 124 others besides.<note place="margin">Aboue half a score a peece (one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) had in bodily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse by these holy fathers.</note> When the heades of your clergie are such, I pray you, what may a reasonable man think of the rest? What further he saith of that matter, I refer vnto your own perusing of it. Yet thus much by him doth plainly appeere, that this vncleanes is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spred ouer you al: &amp; that your whole popish clergie is not onely infected, but fowly polluted with it. But these things belike were but triflles with you at home: &amp; that other blunder with vs, a great matter abroad. But by your patience, fie on that forced virginitie of yours: most abhominably it stinketh before God &amp; the world.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the booke was taken.</note> to be gathered <hi>out of certaine of the Schoole-men (as they are tearmed) that liuing in the corrupter time of the Church did most of all by that occasion treat of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life: when as others (of them) were rather occupied about the controuersies that were most in question among them.</hi> But what is there here, that so much offendeth? Forsooth that thereby I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored (as you do charge mee) to make the booke more contemptible in the iudgement of others: &amp; that so I might the rather get it vnder my <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned censure,</hi> to vse at my pleasure. But that I meant not to make it <hi>contemptible,</hi> may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peer, both by the report that I gaue it (better than your selfe before deserued, but much lesse now) &amp; by the paines that I tooke about it, to cleanse it from that corruption of yours, wherewith it could not haue come abroad, and which was a blemish to the booke it self, though you cannot see it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should you (especially taking it so much to your selfe as now you do) haue thought that book so far abased, by imputing a good part of it to anie of those whom there I spake of; as also you could not doe it, without a great ouer-weening of your

And wheras you tell vs of certaine fathers, out of whose <hi>homilies, sermons, commentaries, and other works,</hi> the booke was taken (in which man or you might haue attributed some parte thereof to the Scriptures also, but that you glorie much lesse in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than in the others, that so your glorie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more iustly to your shame) it is nothing at al to the purpose that so you alledge. For thogh the matter therein contained, were first deriued from the Scriptures, and Fathers originally: yet not withstanding that hindereth not, but that it may well be taken out of the monuments and workes of those that wrote long after them, &amp; gathered such matter somewhat neerer togither. Now, as for your selfe, although it may bee that I doo not know you, yet by the light that now you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, of the profoundnes that is in you; and if you bee the partie that most commonly is named vnto it, you are (I warrant you) as likely as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make your choyse rather, where you may haue it neerer gathered togither, then at large in the Scriptures and Fathers themselues. That heerein you charge mee so deepely with <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and that my <hi>studie is lesse than nothing at all</hi> in those your Schoolemen, the matter is not great, if therein I suffer you to take your pleasure of mee: and, when you haue made mee as vnlearned in them, as shall like your selfe best, or best may serue to aduance you, it may bee, that I my selfe could wel be contented to spare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

of that also that you would leaue mee; and yet notwithstanding, am not so little acquainted with them neither, that anie thing I feare your learning in them, or in any others. And (God be thanked) there is much good learning to be had, though a man doo neuer come neere those that you speake of as also there was long before them. But I pray you good Sir, are you able to alledge anie one of them all, from whome a good part of that booke may not bee deriued: either among those that dealt in the controuersies, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect your pointes or doctrine; or among the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if you respect the rules of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation? Or to go no further than your selfe hath occasioned, may we thinke that you are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded indeed, that this booke (which nowe you cal yours) standeth so cleere in all your parables, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Scriptures, application of them, your diuisions also, and manner of speech, from that sort of Schoolemen that before I spake of, or you nowe speake of, that whosoeuer should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that in som good part it descended of them, he must needs be so ignorant in them, as that he knoweth not <hi>so much as the verie subiect and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they handle,</hi> as it pleaseth you, in the depth of that learning of yours to charge mee?

both those burnes or markes of reproch, which in that place the Apostle dooth speake of, and in the verie next wordes that follow: I meane the forbidding of mariage, and meats which God hath created to be vsed, with giuing of thankes of those that are faithfull, and knowe the truth.

and those of no speciall importance, but that well they might haue beene omitted by me, sauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that thereby you might better perceiue howe little cause you had to bee offended in this also. First you charge mee, that whereas you had set downe, that <hi>our Sauiour beeing demaunded by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prince, how he might be saued, would giue him none other hope,</hi> but onely by keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, saying; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life keep the Commandements;</hi> there doo I <hi>helpe the matter with a parenthesis, saying, he would giue him none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope (so long as he sought saluation by his works) but keepe the Commandements.</hi> The next is, that <hi>whereas you alledged out of Saint Paul, and out of the Reuelations, that men shall be crowned in heauen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fight in his life: I bodged in</hi> (as you say) <hi>this parenthesis (in some good measure) thereby to limit the Holy Ghost in his meaning.</hi> The third, and last is, that whereas <hi>you alledged plainly the words of Scripture, No man knoweth whether he be woorthie of loue or hatred in Gods sight: I added this parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis (by outward thinges.)</hi> These are all the places that you charge me withall: I likewise do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge that for the first, &amp; last, it is true; but as touching the second, I say that there you haue somewhat depraued my wordes, from the sense that I had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.

towardes them, so to make your owne wares more saleable to all (and to that end peruerted these places of Scripture, the better to shrowd those naughtie errours, but gainefull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Which how could I, on your behalfe, more easily haue doone, than by giuing so briefe an interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vppon those places? especially, when as my interpretation is such, as is not mine, but borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of others greater than I (as your selfe doeth, or may knowe) and verie agreeable vnto the truth of the places themselues. But as touching this place of Ecclesiastes (which also you haue not rightlie quoted) whereas it pleaseth you to say, that you <hi>plainely alledged the woordes</hi> of that place, as <hi>plainely</hi> as you haue doone it, yet notwithstanding, if you will take the paines to consider of your dooinges againe, you may plainely perceiue, first that you haue added three woordes in the ende, more than the text it selfe dooth yeelde, by anie translation whatsoeuer, (though yet notwithstanding it stand well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the sense of the place) then also, these woordes, <hi>hee bee woorthie</hi> (whereon the chiefe strength of your sense consisteth) are not found in the Hebrew it selfe, nor in Saint Ierome, when of set purpose hee interpreteth the place; although I denie not, but that in your common vulgar translation (which glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

So likewise, more specially to consider of that other place of yours, where you say that I <hi>bodged</hi> in that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis <hi>(in some good measure)</hi> if you marke the place better, you shall finde, that I did not adde these woordes vnto the affirmatiue, as you haue framed them (to your better aduauntage) which indeed had beene more obscurely spoken: and that you haue corruptly cited both my woordes; and yours also. For you saide before, that <hi>none should bee crowned there</hi> (in the life to come) but <hi>according to the measure of his fight in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

haue conceiued, and there you rest. Howbeit you were to haue knowne, both that Cyprian in that his sermon by occasion of the pestilence that then so raged in those partes, endeuoring himselfe to imbolden the people to bee willing to die if God should cal them, might verie wel vtter (in the way of perswasion) many thinges, whereon it were not good to build any generall doctrine: and that all the opinions of the learned, either of him or anie other, are not alwaies to be receiued.

You would gladly shrowd your selues vnder the credit, and reuerend estimation of the godlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but in truth you esteeme of none of them all, but so farre as you hope to wrest them to your owne naughtie purpose.

For whereas you did speake of our naturall parentes, kinsfolke, and freendes (as by the course of your words appeered before; and because that now in that respect you haue reiected my Annotation thereon, which otherwise graunted the selfe-same matter, as we are members of one bodie; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, by that wise note of yours, which you haue set in the margent of the booke it selfe) it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13137:39"/>
most certaine and verie plaine, that no man can gather, that S. Cyprian ment it of those, but rather that he meant it onely of such, as before I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vnto you in that annotation. And there he vseth an argument of the desire that all men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly haue, when they are abroad in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to returne home againe to see their frendes. Herevpon he inferreth as followeth.
<q>Patriam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram paradisum computamus: parentes nostros pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchas habere iam coepimus: quid non properamus &amp; currimus, vt patriam nostram videre, &amp; parentes salutare possimus. Magnus illic nos chaerorum numerus expectat, parentum, fratrum, filiorum, frequens nos &amp; &amp; copiosa turba desiderat, &amp;c.</q>
that is, wee account that paradise is our countrie; we haue now begun to haue the Patriarks to be our Fathers: why doo we not make hast and run, that we may be able to see our country, and salute or parents? A great number of frends do there await vs, of parents, of brethren, of children, a great and mightie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doth (there) desire vs, &amp;c. Wherby we may see, that whereas it is the common nature of all, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and desire to be with their frends, hee dooth giue them to vnderstand, that there they haue a great number of frends, of al sorts, that wil be glad of their comming. Insomuch that howsoeuer a mans desire is, either to his father, or to his brother, or to his sonne, or howsoeuer els (as all, we knowe are not alike delighted with euerie one; but one with his parents, another with his brethren, a third with his children, and so forth with the rest)

And the better to confirme, that hee meant not anie such earthlie knowledge to remaine, within almost as much of the beginning, as this place of yours was towards the ending, hee plainly saith, that, when wee do: part hence thither, <hi>terrenis coelestia, &amp; magna paruis &amp; caducis aeterna fuccedunt:</hi> that is, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earthlie things do heauenly succeed; and that in place of small things, and brittle, we shall there enioy (such, as are both great and aeternall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if I, for so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and needfull recounting of some few sinnes of certaine of the faithfull, deserue such a fee at his handes that you speake of, what may we thinke

that hee will holde such a Proctor as your selfe worthie of, that so smoothly can lull men asleepe in opinion of their owne so absolute cleannes: to so manifest a contradiction of the worde of God; and to the ouerthrowing of soules vnto perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But the matter that galleth you, is this-Seeing that it is in so fresh remembrance with you, how fowlie and shamefully with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo at length you obtained, to haue it set downe for a tolerable opinion, and not to be gainsayed by anie, that the Virgin Marie was altogither without sinne, you are now so very loth to heare of any thing that may call it in quaestion, as that (the rather to proppe vp your great idolatrie to her committed) you would haue all accounted as <hi>fond,</hi> that are not therein as haereticall and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous as you. But the lesse maruell it is that you deale so with mee, when as some of you haue not bene ashamed in much like sort to deale with Saint Ierome himselfe in that very matter that now is betwixt vs. For whereas hee (in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the eight question of Algasia) by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had plainely set downe, that <hi>there was none without sinne, but Christ alone</hi> (and yet with great circumspection, that he did not thereby impeach the dignitie of anie of the godlie, of which he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth Iob, Zacharie, and Elizabeth) some of you notwithstanding in the ende of that his Treatise haue added this Antidotus (in his works printed at Paris, <hi>anno 1534.</hi>) that <hi>solum Christum eximit a peccato, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:13137:45"/>
that Saint Ierome (therefore) <hi>exempted Christ onely from sin, because the Church had not yet determined those matters.</hi> If therefore in this matter you deale so with him, I may take it so much the better, that therein you so deale with mee. Neuertheles when as you make such a woonder at it, and count it to be so absurd a matter, and so impossible to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, you declare your selfe to be either maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ignorant in the sense &amp; meaning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; or els to beare so ill an heart to the truth it selfe, that you will not acknowledge it, when you see it. Otherwise howe could you but see, and acknowledge withall, that to suffer Christ so to be reproched, and in the mean season (thogh it were but for feare) to say nothing in his defence must needes be a breach of the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as hee was God, and had not his honour by them giuen vnto him: of the fift, as hee was their Messias, their Annointed Priest, Prophet &amp; King, and yet was not so auouched by them: of the sixt, as this their silence was, or might bee offensiue to others (offenses being spirituall murther:) and of the ninth, though hee were not but a man, in that he had not his good name by them defended? But in the meane season you haue made this point cleere, that they are maruellous happie men that haue you for their teachers: that either do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the principles of Religion; or cannot in anie wise bee content to confesse an open truth, when as you see that it doth reprooue your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errors.

out by name certain of those (as none of his) which you notwithstanding commend vnto vs among the rest: but also doth adde generally, that <hi>So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Treatises &amp; Sermons are falsly ascribed vnto that Father, that the reckoning of them vp, would require a volume by it selfe.</hi> You were the keepers of these bookes also; you had the writing of them out; &amp; your cause it is that those additions giue credite vnto: we haue receiued them so of you; and our cause is no where holpen by any of those bastard works whatsoeuer, but on the other side as much discredited as they are able. If therefore the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion bee betwixt you and vs, whether part it is that hath so corrupted the Fathers, there is no quaestion, but that needs it must fall to bee yours: or, at least, that it commeth much neerer vnto you, than it doth vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="22">22 But yet to make it somewhat cleerer, by some example,<note place="margin">Particular examples. M.

My selfe at this present will goe no further, but onely to put you a little in mind, both how truly you can finde in your hartes to alledge, and how you alter the place it selfe, when it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for your purpose so to doo. For the former, whereas Augustine teacheth to iudge of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were most to bee esteemed,<note place="margin">De doctrin.

And this for the aduauncement of your Church of Rome, and to make all such things au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike Scripture, that either it bringeth foorth out of your own libraries there: or els at any time it is disposed to send vnto others. For the other; whereas in like maner the same Saint Augustine said at the first, that that bodie of Christ wherein hee rose from death to life, <hi>must</hi> needes be in one place: you haue now of late made him to say, that it <hi>may</hi> be in one place: and this because you saw it made so directly against your fonde and blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous error of Transubstantiation, which now you haue taken vpon you to defend, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haue endeuored to help your selues with such poore helples shifts as these.

What others of this kind might be alledged, your selues do knowe so wel already (both because your selues be the doers, &amp; are daily taken with this kind of dealing) that it is about needles to bring in any mo examples of it. I wold you could as readily acknowledge your

ill dealing herein, to your amendment: as wee are able to charge you with it, to the vtter discredite of the naughtie cause that you haue in hand.</p>
            <p n="23">23 As touching this time that nowe is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (I mean, since the time that God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hath bestowed this light of the Gospell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs) first it is good for you heere to remember, that alreadie I named one such companion of yours in mine Epistle, Iohannes Baptista Fickler: such a companion in this kind of dealing, as anie where I beleeue you were hardly able to finde. And therefore you did wisely, to say nothing of him. Then also I trust your selfe can likewise tell, how deepely you are charged alreadie, that euer since this light of the Gospell hath set you so streight, and put you so much to your shifts as it hath, you haue done your endeuour the best that you could, to frame the Fathers and other writers to your best aduantage. And namely, how to that purpose you haue dealt with Ludouicus Viues, Iohannes Molanus, and Carolus Sigonius, whose books yet extant,<note place="margin">M. Reinolds in his prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Confer. to the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. pag. 23.26.</note> as they were imprinted before, doo plainely shewe in their latter impressions by you, howe fowly you haue abused them since. So likewise, when you got Manutius to Rome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the Fathers for you, vnder the ouersight of foure Cardinals, howe corruptly you began with Cyprian first: and that Manutius himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed resonable plainly, how il he was there imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you. But to come somwhat neerer vnto you what say you to that wherwith Franciscus Iunius

And not onely that, but whatsoeuer Arguments, Annotations, Scholies, &amp; such like, the learned men of late (&amp; some of them euen of your owne side also) had put thereunto, whereby your former dealing with those Fathers was the rather called in question, by the light that they gaue to the woorkes themselues, out of their obseruation, and diligent reading? And haue you not nowe printed them againe after your fashion: dismembred themselues nowe more by you, than by your predecessors before; and spoiled likewise of those learned helps that gaue light vnto them, and to your former il dealing with them? Or could you holde your selues contented to stay there? Haue you not reached foorth those self-same fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of yours to many other good woorks besides, of diuinitie, humanitie, historie, philosophie, lawe, physike, and all: and in them also sometimes put in what you thought good, but for the most part

And yet notwithstanding, haue you not in such sort set them forth, as though they were those Fathers and Authors themselues, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all gelded by you? For, doo you professe the thing you haue doone, or could you finde in your harts that men should be priuie to your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings herein?

Why did you print no mo copies of it, but onely for certain chiefe and speciall persons? Why was it, that not one of those copies might come abroad?

Insomuch that you may safely beare your nouices &amp; prosylites in hand now, that there is no Doctor, nor almost any other approued wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in any thing speaketh against you. For whom you could not correct to your minde, him haue you boldly strooken out cleane: so verie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory now haue you bene. And those misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prosylites of yours must needes be perswaded now, that all is with them, and nothing at all anie where against them.

That so it may be fulfilled in them, that Christ himself noted in others such like, that they shuld be two-fould the children of hell, more than your selues.

God bee thanked also, that before hee would so fullie bring your dooinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, hee suffered you to runne so farre as might

be sufficient to shew vnto all, how you haue deale with the Fathers and Councels, and all other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities before: and how farre past shame you are nowe, to sticke at nothing whatsoeuer it be, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may hope to holde mens eies in blindnes still, and to entangle the truth it selfe. As for your selfe, I doo not charge you as one of the dooers: it was some-what before you came to haue anie place among them; and yet not much. Neither doo. I thinke, that yet you are of that credite with them, as it was then thought meet for those, that should bee the dealers in that matter. But I trust that you will not denie, but that since that time it is come vnto your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that so they haue doone. If it be so, what face haue you then, that could so boldly lay that to my charge, and to the charge of others besides, that neyther in mee, nor in anie of vs, you are able to finde: and that which you knewe might bee found in your selues in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? Were you perswaded, that by crying out so lowd against such dealing, you could haue vs to beleeue, that your selues did so much detest it, that wee might doubt no such thing in you? Indeede we doo not doubt it now: for our selues doo plainely see it. If you did not know so much before, then by all likelyhood you wil soone leaue them now, when as you find that same in them in so plentiful maner, that supposing to be in vs you haue shewed your selfe so much to mislike: vnles you had rather that in your self it should appeere

then might you iustly complaine that I had done you wrong therein: but if you haue put in more, and wickedly mingled the truth of God, with your lies, as it is certaine that you haue done, and I doo charge you, where then is this wrong that you do complaine of.

Would you so faine, so slily passe ouer the great complaints, that the countries here-abouts, as England, France, and Germanie continually haue made, at home, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, of this matter? As for the examples of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, although they be infinite, and, of al sorts and degrees verie manie: yet beeing but priuate, and of seuerall persons, it is not vnlikely, but that such an one as professeth such blindnes as you do, would readily say he saw none of them all.

And as for the two former of these three, neither of them is so farre off, nor in these your wilfull and graceles wandrings so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known vnto you, but that you might easily know
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13137:55"/>
(could you as readily acknowledge it when you do see it) that in Fraunce Lewis the ninth, Philip the faire, Charles the fift, sixt, and seuenth, did all prouide by publike authoritie, against the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, extortion, ambition, and pride of the Sea of Rome: and that although Lewis the eleuenth (in latter time) was content at the Popes request, to abolish the Pragmaticall sanction, and other lawes that they had made to that purpose; yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Bishops, the students of Paris, and Iohannes Romanus the Kings Atturney, a wise, a learned, &amp; an eloquent man, would in no wise consent to the abolishing of them. In Germany likewise the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and commons did earnestly sollicite Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of Austrich the Emperour, both before his coronation, and after, for the redresse of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (in such manner as Fraunce before had done:) and beeing at that time defeated by the wicked counsel of Aneas Siluius, did neuertheles, stil hold on the same endeuour whensoeuer opportunitie serued, and to that ende put vp a supplication to Maximilian, of ten speciall greeuances, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an hundred (in the session of Noremberg) to the Pope himselfe. And for the other, being an English-man (though but a bad one in the quarrel that now you sustain) neuer heard you what great stickling and busines about these matters there was, betwixt William Rufus, and Anselme Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury: betweene Henry the first, and not onely Anselme, but Thurstan also the Archbishop of Yorke: and betweene Henry the

Nor how Edward the third, did to that end not onely reuiue the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Praemunire, made before by Edward the first: but also would in no wise abrogate the same, though hee were much sollicited vnto it by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the eleuenth: nor how Richard the second by publike authoritie likewise both reconfirmed, and further strengthened the same: nor howe, though it was againe attempted to bee abolished in the raigne of Henry the sixt by the earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of Martin the fift, yet was it not obtained, but still stood in force, euen to this praesent age of ours? If these thinges were straunge, or but seldome heard of, I would with good will haue noted vnto you the stories them-selues more at large, and the places whence they are taken: but being so euident and knowne as they are, in is but lost labour to deale any further, but onely to put you in mind of them.

After this you come to an other, as proper a shift, as most of those that are gone before. For whereas I had saide before, that it was the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest way to rest in Christ alone for the whole woorke of our redemption;<note place="margin">That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I teach, that we ought to rest in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for the whole worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish works: and that we all are little occupied in any good woorks.</note> and that in such sort, as that wee sought no helpe of Angell or of Saint, of our owne or other folkes merits: heere come you in with a fonde collection and childish cauill, that, by this reason, such as should neuer pray, nor desire others to pray for him, hee that should neuer fast, nor doo other good deede, but should rather defie the same, and lay all vpon the passion of Christ, should be the neerest to that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage.
But can you in good sadnes no better perceiue how these two may stand togither: both for to rest in Christ alone, for the whole woorke
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13137:57"/>
of our redemption; and yet to be occupyed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall in such woorks, as God hath prepared for vs to walke in? Or if needes you would carpe here at, might you not by the like reason haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at many places of the Apostles, and Christ himselfe? For that you charge vs to doo so little, it is no maruell, nor matter neither: your selues must bee able to giue a better account of your owne life, before that you shall bee allowed with vs, to take the account of any others. But you Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, Seminarie priestes, and all that company of vnnaturall impes, that so wilfully abandon your owne countrie to practise against it, and to deuote your selues to that forraine priest, haue faces of brasse: that although your selues do knowe, that you are defiled (almost) with all manner of euill, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, whoredome, seditious practisings, &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable attempts in the highest degree; yet is your modestie such, that you can bee prying at other folks liues, and flatly condemne them, before that you find them (any thing like) so ill as your owne. Would you giue vs but this sparing, that you would not so hardly charge vs, vntill we were but halfe so bad as your selues, wee might then more easily come vnto agreement for this matter. But when the loosest of all others that this age of ours hath, and those that haue solde themselues to so much iniquitie, take vpon them to be control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers &amp; condemners of others, howsoeuer you may please your owne selues therein, and hope therby to get your owne liues to scape vnespied: yet may

you not thinke, that with those that stand indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, it can be taken for sufficient, whether it be to charge vs, or els no more but to discharge your selues.</p>

You are fain to tolerate it in the one, &amp; of necessitie you must let it alone in the other. But what if it shuld please the wisdom of God to steepe it a little longer in blood, before it shuld find the daies of peace?

Is it not needful, that Princes be at charged abroad, for to mainteine their peace at home? If the same be found among vs, is that so ill a matter in it selfe, as you can bee perswaded, that therein you haue sufficient ground-woorke, to bluster a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad so vile a slander?

like plainnes tell you, that there is nothing at all that followeth, wherein your selfe doo not most plainelie confirme the same vnto vs. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when as I had demaunded of you, why you should stand so much vpon certaine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, and among others recited the manner of Christ descending into hell,<note place="margin">Christs des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</note> that you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued (the <hi>manner</hi> I say, not the thing it selfe) there you, to bring vs and our profession into some discredite thereby, will in no wise bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne that I spake but of the manner of his descending into hell, and not of the thing it selfe (which notwithstanding I did verie plainely set downe) and tell your readers, that <hi>I demaund of you in verie good earnest, why you should stande so much on Christes descending into hell.</hi> But did I so indeede?

their authoritie, as plainly appeereth both in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine your champion, and in your note in the Rhemes Testament on that place. For whereas in this case you take it so ill at their hands, that they, should interprete that to be the Church of God, because therby you find your selues to be tied, for to seeke out your Antichrist there: it is lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel that now when Antichrist hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so much as he hath, you can so il bear, that we shuld take any such course, as auowing your state to be no better, than the power of Antichrist, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles we shuld grant you to be of the church generally. And yet notwithstanding Ierome, in an other place also, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of the end of the 2 chap, of Sophony, he fore-sheweth, that in time then to come, maruelous grieuous things should befal the church in the time of Antichrists raigne, althogh they be such, as <hi>at the first sight may seeme blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> (for any man to say, that such thinges at any time should befal the Church of God, as himselfe doth there confesse) yet neuertheles hee saith, there <hi>in the raigne of Antichrist, it shalbe turned into a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, &amp; deliuered to</hi> (sauage) <hi>beasts, &amp; that it shall suffer whatsoeuer the prophet there describeth.</hi> Wher you may see that notwithstanding that it bee the <hi>Church</hi>; yet doth he not stick to say, that it should notably be eclipsed &amp; that by the power of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ also: &amp; that althogh Antichrist should so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlay it, &amp; that it should become as a wildernes, &amp; be so much pestered with all noisome beastes; yet dooth hee name it, and account it the <hi>Church</hi>

notwithstanding. But you think you haue sped ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel, &amp; made a good market, in that I haue ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Church to be the true,<note place="margin">How they are of that Church, that is true, Catholike &amp; Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: &amp; yet themselues nothing at all the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereby.</note> Catholike, &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike church, wherof I allow you to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by outward profession generally. But you need not boast so much of your peny-woorths, as you would gladly seem that you might. For those titles of true, Catholike, &amp; Apostolike, do but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the church in grosse or generally, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the name or faith of Christ, that there is professed: &amp; are not communicable, or to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to all the members therof indifferently, or to all those sorts that (after their maner) are vnder the same, but onely to one sort of professors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, such as togither with the outward name, are of that profession indeede, that outwardly they doo pretend. From which because you are so farre departed as you are, therefore haue you no part at all in anie of those titles in respect of your selues, although they doo belong vnto that Church (in respect of the faith that it professeth) whereof you are such rotten members as you are. And though your selues are corrupt, and in truth goe directlie against (in manie great and speciall matters, that are of the substance of it) the selfe-fame faith that in tearmes you professe generallie: yet neuerthelesse the faith it selfe that so you professe, beeing considered, not as you holde it, but as it is in it selfe, and as it is holden of vs, and all others, that rectifie our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by the written woorde, is of that nature,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13137:65"/>
as to which those titles of true, Catholike, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike do of right appertaine. Which once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fully and truly inuested in them, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, but that, though not corrupt members yet the whole may rightly take that denomination: both in respect of the faith it selfe, and in respect of the professors of it, one sort truly holding the same, &amp; the others also professing none other but onely the same generally? Doth not a land rightly take his denomination of that graine wherewith it is sowne, though afterward both it selfe be thin, and not onely certaine other graine besides (that came in with it, or else the ground it selfe hath yeelded) is nowe spread among it, but is full of weeds likewise? If you can be content to allow vs the one, you shall find no reason left you, why you should denie vs the other. Much lesse if you call to remembrance that the same Church, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and his Apostles, and all his Disciples adioined themselues, and from which Christ did neuer seperate himselfe (notwithstanding the great corruption and contempt of the woorde of God, and of Christ himselfe that raigned among them) was notwithstanding a true church, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the election of God, and of the doctrine of the lawe, and of the Prophets generally, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the whole. As for my selfe, if I had not in as plaine speeches, and in as full and resolute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, denied you to bee anie true members of the Church of Christ, and so consequently, had not therewithall, opened mine owne meaning, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13137:65"/>
cleane shut you out from the enioying of anie good roome therein: then might you with some better colour haue made such vauntes of those your peny-woorths. But when I did as fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you for rotten members, as I did allow you in that other sense to bee of the Church, it was I warrant you, but <hi>Sardonicus risus,</hi> and a poore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ioy that you had thereby. As therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the faith that in grosse you holde, and for the reuerence that I beare thereunto (as it is in it selfe, but not as you holde it) I allowe you in such sense to be of the Church: so bee you sure, and, if need be, I confirme it vnto you againe, and againe, that in respect of your fowle and great Apostacie, I also, as well as my brethren, account you bee as had members, as euer were anie, and as farre from saluation, and al other priuiledges of the true, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and Apostolike Church (in the course that yet you are in) as euer were the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that put Christ to death, or any others, if you can find anie worse than they.</p>

But it is your lot (in the bad cause that you haue in hande) euer to bee sure to fall, whensoeuer you striue to arise. The cause why I wrote this treatise of Pacification, I had my selfe downe in twoo places: in my Epistie Dedicatorie, the second leafe, and first page; and in the beginning of the Treatise it selfe, in the first leafe, and second page.

to consider of, both in respect of the truth it self; &amp; that you also may grow to some better temper, and not so highly esteeme of your selfe; as hath so great contempt of others ioined withall. And first as touching the whole,<note place="margin">Of the whole booke ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</note> the title you knowe you haue altered now, and that in such fort, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by onely we might easily charge you,<note place="margin">Of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it.</note> that so much as in you lieth, you haue marred it all, euen what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer therin doth tend to the rule of a godly life: &amp; yet not denieng, but that the scriptures therein are good, the Fathers also that there are alledged, &amp; other rules of godlines that are ther prescribed, so far as either of them doth agree with the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word.

Whereby also you haue made it nowe more plainely to appeere, why you
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13137:73"/>
set in hand togither out of others those lessons of godlines, and to commend the same to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: not for any care you had to make them more godlie, but to vse that occasion to nourish in them that pestilent error, of ascribing their saluation (for a good part of it) to their owne proper woorkes; and withall to let in your other errors (wherof this new booke of yours is full) which otherwise you knew well inough, that by anie learning you were neuer able to commend vnto them. Wherein it may be, that you were perswaded, that at the least you should be likened to the Graecians of old, that when they could not by maine force get within the walles of Troy,<note place="margin">The Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian horse.</note> afterward by seeming to break vp their siege, and to leaue a sacred horse behind them, to the great benefit of the Citie, if it were taken in vnto them, by that meanes obtained, that certaine bandes of their owne soldiours were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares taken in, and all the rest immediately after brought in besids, to the vtter ouerthrow of those that receiued so goodly a praesent, so craftily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and left vnto them. It may be I say, that you might liken your self vnto these. For you also, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that now by learning you are not able to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle your errors in the harts of others, as heretofore you were wont to do while you were not resisted; would seeme now to leaue off dealing in matters of controuersie, and heerein to treat of deuotion only: and yet throughout your whole booke you so interlace the controuersies also, and make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion so to hang vppon them, that none can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13137:73"/>
your rules of godlines, but that if they mark not well, they must needes receiue your errours withall. And so vnder pretence of teaching god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, your meaning is, therby to let in your errors into them, as they by leauing that horse vnto them, did seeke to gaine the Cittie thereby. But these thinges are <hi>in summo genere:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The monks hood.</note> of famous warriors, twoo mightie peoples, a noble Cittie, a strange policie, and to the one side vtter destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

At which time the boy to auoide the presse, cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpon the doore, and then espying a shifting Moonke, getting out ouer the heads of those that stucke fast in the doores, thought it a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to him, to leape into his cowle behind him, that so he might get out of the daunger that then was feared. For so you likewise haue thought this moonkish hood of your popish deuotion to be so fine a way for you, to get out your popish errors withall, that you could not hold, but in they must, and abide the aduenture: seeing well inough, that now they wax stale and out of credite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like quickly to perish, vnlesse by such means you could happily raise their credite againe, or at
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13137:74"/>
least praeserue them (some what longer yet) from that consuming fire of the woorde of God, that (not in supposall, as in the other, but in verie truth) so mightily hath begun to consume them alreadie. Howbeit as that Moonke did soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter find fault with his burthen, and rid himselfe of it: euen so you had stuffed those your precepts of godly life so full of your popery, that you may not maruell though they tooke so ill with so vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and needles a burthen, and did seeke to bee disburdened of it. In your newe booke (I graunt) you haue taken a better order.

Then also whereas how you haue inlarged it,<note place="margin">Of the matter of it.</note> in volume or quantitie, double to that it was before, or at least neere thereunto, yet are these your additions such (ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so little appertaining vnto the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the matter it selfe is good: or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

read it for godlines sake, or to stir vp their minde therunto. Not denying hereby, but that some part of the matter (in it selfe) is good: as, that there is a God, which rewardeth good and euill, and of the certaintie of Christian Religion (which two mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are prosecuted at large in two seuerall chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and are the greatest part of your additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and some other besides.

You knowe likewise, that such thinges as are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers argumentes, are not euer so welcome vnto those that (for the time) desire to heare but of the one: though in their kinde the one bee as good as the other, and in time and place as welcome. But yet as touching those <hi>reuerend Catholike Priestes</hi> that you speake of, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so manie among vs to bee falne vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersine by beating out the pointes of Religion, first it may bee that they doo thinke, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as abandon their woonted errours of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, doo vtterlie cast of all true Religion likewise. And yet notwithstanding I will not denie, but that if by them-selues they measure others, they may very well thinke (if they can haue the grace to consider, how far they are falne) that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now to lay againe those first principles of all

            <p n="34">
               <note place="margin">Of a few particulars.</note>34 To come to particulars, my purpose is no more but this, a little to vnfould vnto you these two points: how loth you are to be admonished, or to amend, any thing that already you haue set downe, be it neuer so wrong; and yet that there is verie good cause why you shuld not trust to your selfe so much as you do. That you are loath to be admonished,<note place="margin">That he is loath to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that hee hath done amis.</note> or to amend, that which once you haue doone amisse, appeereth sufficiently in this, for that you doo so greeuously take this little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment that herein I haue tendered vnto you, though in neuer so quiet and gentle manner. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that whereas I neuer vsed any contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of speech against you, for anie thing that you had so corruptly put in; and besides that, abstei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also from iust reproofe, and neuer did anie more, but either left them out, or amended them in quiet manner: you on the other side, by all such occasions haue stirred vp your selfe, to lay on load in reprochfull and taunting speeches. But whereas it seemeth your selfe doth account them as deadly instrumentes against whome they are throwne: yet the truth is, they are but the shuttle-cocks
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13137:75"/>
of your owne vanitie, and carrie with them no force at all against the truth and vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Then also I thinke your selfe may not well denie, but that I admonished you of, or my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended certaine things, wherin you were wrong: which notwithstanding you haue not corrected in this your new booke, but haue come forth with them againe as corruptly now, as you did before. Whereof although I were able to alledge verie manie examples: yet I will content my selfe with few. And first when you haue occasion (whether orderly giuen, or purposely taken) to alledge anie thing out of those bookes that are not Canonical: yet you still call them the Scripture,<note place="margin">Apothry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him: and why.</note> and the H. Scripture, as well as those books that are Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or vndoubted Scripture indeed. And this you do both against the vse &amp; custom of the primitiue Church (respecting the whole generally) and of an euill heart to the holie, and vndoubted woorde of God: that by aduauncing other bookes also to the same degree, you may so the more easily take downe the better estimation of it, and make it no better than those that are of your own allowance. In like manner whereas before I put you in mind of many places corruptly translated,<note place="margin">Corrupt translations stil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Fathers.</note> or wrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, yet neuertheles you hold on still your head-strong course: as, <hi>propter dolos,</hi> for <hi>in lubrico posuisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13137:76"/>
the Fathers, but also against the truth it selfe: and all to continue your former course, and a little therby to helpe out a few od points of your profession, not woorth three halfe-pence the best of them all. So likewise howe you did some-what ouer-slippe your selfe beyond the warrant of the woorde of God, to ascribe that as a custome to Isaac, that the text reporteth but of one speciall time, I noted vnto you towards the beginning. That, you may see, howe I had amended, onely by leauing your errour out, and nothing at all laying it vnto your charge, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying it vnto others. Which notwithstanding now you haue taken it in againe, and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered your weakenes therein, than you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But it may be you will say that that part of your booke was printed before. What if it were? yet was not the vsuall helpe of corrections in the end of your booke denied vnto you. But for this cause to leaue all the fore-part of the booke, and (to bee sure) to leaue you out three partes to your selfe, and to take in hand but the fourth part onely, the hindmost of all (by which time though the print went on, yet might you haue good time of aduisement) &amp; there to picke out but some few things also, wheras I (<hi>pag. 271.</hi>) holpe to rectify the number of quarters, that you (<hi>pag. 297.</hi>) had set down for a <hi>Corus</hi> in Salomons prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

The like might be said of manie others: but these I trust may be sufficient for this matter. And yet I will acknowledge withall, that some few of them you haue some-what amended much, like as you had direction from mee.

But as for that other slip of yours that you talke so praecisely of <hi>twise in one day,</hi> that haue you mended nothing at all: and it may be not perceiued it neither.

But I feare it is you that was the <hi>child,</hi> and not he: because the Scripture (in the next chapter after) doth plainely witnesse, that he was at that time vpon fortie yeeres olde. Whence you shuld haue this conceit of yours, I cannot tell. Howbeit hereby you make me to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance a much like matter that was saide to bee doone in Oxfoord, about the same time that you were there (if you bee the same that I heare that you are:) or at least not so long before, but that a fresh report thereof might very well reach vnto you. A certaine company of country plaiers came thither to play: they made it knowne what they did meane; and, as the maner is, drew in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie soone vnto them. Among other thinges they had to deale with the storie of Isaac: both of his sacrificing, when he was but a childe; and of his marriage, when after he came to riper age. They were not so wel stored of persons to furnish their partes, but that one boy must play Isaac, both in his childhood, and manhood also: but as the boies own face serued their turne for Isaacs childhood; so had they for him a faire long beard, to resemble his manhood. But all the cunning was to hit the time when he should haue his beard on, and when
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13137:81"/>
he should not. What will you? there was no more but right and wrong. When therefore hee came foorth as a childe to bee sacrificed, hee had on his, beard: and when after he was to be married, then as a child he had it off, and onely his owne boyes face to shut vp the matter. But I hope you were neuer so mad, as to take it thence.

Howbeit the storie is (both in the Bible, and in Iosephus too) that they were no lesse than two hundred and fiftie. But it may bee those two hundred were wearie of their entertainment, because you did looke no better vnto them: and so being disposed to play the <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> with you, got them out of sight, when you should haue taken the view of them.

haue made the best search that you can, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all thinges vp-side-downe, that nothing at all might escape vnespied: what is there nowe that for all this you haue found, where-with you may be able to charge me: or wherin haue I made any such fault against the Scriptures, the Fathers, or your self, that deserueth so much as the tenth part one halfe of those out-cries, and outragious spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that you haue blustered foorth against mee? What I had doone, I haue fully acknowledged: how greeuously you haue taken it, that haue I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in some part declared, but not so fully. And now, as Iacob said vnto him, so doo I say vnto you likewise: let it here be laid in the sight of al men, and abide the triall; both of your brethren, and mine. He charged Iacob, that he stale away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge: and tooke away his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him. But were not his daughters the wiues of Iacob, and might not Iacob lawfully take them? And had hee first made Laban priuie vnto it, may wee thinke that Iacob might haue had his consent, so to haue done? He charged him also, to haue taken away his idols with him: and indeede they were gone, but Iacob was wrongfully char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged withall: and could not tell, which way to helpe him vnto them againe. Your idols likewise, I graunt, are gone: but why should you be so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with mee. The truth it selfe hath made them to hide their faces for shame: and I am not able (would I neuer so faine) to shewe you how to get them againe. So that although Labans idols in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13137:84"/>
were gone; yet was there nothing that hee was able iustly to lay to the charge of Iacob: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that at length he: thought he had stirred too much alreadie, and there-vpon drew into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with him. And although that the latter of them bee a greater matter than you are able to reach vnto, of any man els expecteth of you: yet would it not bee amisse, that at your leisure you should consider indifferently, whether you haue not stirred herein a great deale more, than either the cause it selfe required, or els was wisedom (on your owne behalfe) for you to do. For first as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ill dealing and great iniurie that your complaine of,<note place="margin">Then more specially in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> it is such, as either chiefly respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth your selfe in these your labours: or else the cause that you haue in hande. Concerning your selfe, you charge me with altering the title so, as if you would perswade your Reader, that my selfe would haue had the glorie of it: and yet you are faine to set downe the same to your owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, otherwise than you had it of mee; and quite to leaue out that which you sawe discharged mee of it. You complaine of great corruption, mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, falsifiyng: and what not? And yet you bring foorth nothing at all to any purpose, to discharge your credite therein. When I charged Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and some Diuines of olde, to haue had their errours about the immortalitie of the soule, that tooke you as meant of your selfe and your fellowes, and there-vppon are passing angrie for it: and yet was it but your owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13137:84"/>
that so did take it; and in no wise can bee ascribed to mee. Yet these are the iniuries (and a few others of lesse importance) that are so great, as that there is nothing, but open hostilitie may rise vppon them. Concerning the cause that you haue in hande, you are highlie offended, that I haue left out your Purgatorie, Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confession; Satisfaction, idle Munkerie, forced Virginitie, wilfull Pouertie, Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, friuolous Chastening of the bodie, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping, abstinence, and fasting after your manner, and merits: and yet neither haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>taken them from you, but refused our selues so to take them; neyther is it in mee to allowe so honest a place vnto anie such matters, as the truth hath nowe so plainelie declared (the best of them all, as you doo vse them) to bee so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or at least but vaine. That the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is altogither without sinne, is a late errour of yours: and because that vnder it faine you would shrowd your woonted idolatrie to her committed, you cannot abide that it bee cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed neuer so little. Because I cannot allowe that, a speciall commaundement, that was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly giuen vnto some, should stande as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule vnto all, nor, that men may at any time leaue their calling, nor married folkes parte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder without consent: therefore do I both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite Saint Anthonies calling; and call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion S. Augustines conuersion, and yet must may Annotation theron bee dismembred also, to helpe

Doo you not thinke that you were full grauely occupyed, in so serious matters as these? But that was no sufficient way for you to shewe what you are, and what is in you, but that needes you must make your selfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in the meane season you haue made it a likely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in reason, that you would bee loath, that anie should haue such a matter in hand, and not allow you to make one among them: and seeing you haue made such choise of your companions, wee are nowe so much the rather to acknowledge the old prouerbe true, that like will to like, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee see (you knowe whome) and the Frier so met togither. For as for other thinges that belong vnto vs, whrewith you would so gladly find fault, they goe so skant with you, that you are faine to carp at the assurance that the Scriptures do teach vs to haue in God, because it hindreth your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which latter point was in no wise to be reprooued by you: considering how fowly you are polluted because you doo so far abandon that holie ordinance of God from you. And yet are you so eagerly set thereon, that to force that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage on your side, you haue depraued both my Annotation, and Saint Augustines rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, which faine you would haue strengthened against vs therin. With like wisedome and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is it, that when wee aduaunce the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of these daies to the glorie of God; and ioy that our monie dooth not nowe goe foorth to the mainteinance of forraine power abroad: you call the one intolerable lying flatterie; the other you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When I bring in that sentence of Scripture, <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday &amp; today, and the same for euer,</hi> you cannot tell what I should meane thereby; and besides you abuse (for my sake, I feare) the sentence it selfe. When I am so bold as to gesse that a good part of your booke might be taken out of certain of the Schoolmen: thereupon I must bee so ignorant in them, that I do not so much as knowe what they treat on; and yet, both you know that so it might; and your self are faine, both to shut vp your eies, that you might in no wise see whom I speake of, and there also to alter my words againe to your aduauntage. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

in the Pacification, not onely the methode misliketh you, when as notwithstanding you doe finde no fault with it: but also whatsoeuer I say, that do you euer almost take in a contrarie sense, when as notwithstanding the woordes bee cleere inough in themselues, as before is declared. But then comming to your owne sweet selues, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of your countenance is by and by altered, and there you put on more amiable lookes. For you (forsooth) are the onely men that can make books of deuotion, pretie, &amp; contemplation: &amp; you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (it is wel, that this commeth in with <hi>perhaps</hi>) will one day declare, that our profession is such, as hath nothing at all (in heauen, nor in earthy to mooue men vnto it, but onely respect of temporal commoditie; but yours hath all. So that now for deuotion, and the controuersies also, all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that thereunto belongeth, lieth altogither with you, and none with vs. And yet are you no sooner entered into the remembrance of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you haue found in manie of vs, and name <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the silence of the blessed Virgin, and of other Disciples of Christ (leauing him vnto the reproch of all men, and nothing at all defending his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie against them) was a breach of diuers of Gods commaundements, you could not tell how to begin, to find it the breach of anie one. To which end also may bee referred, that knowledge and faith is (with you) but of one weeks learning: your grosse and rude definition of a Christian man: your imperfect discourse against despaire: &amp; your so vnskilfull reckoning of those yeres that I haue admonished you of so distinctly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe in the text it selfe.
