            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DVring the time of my <hi>Seruice</hi> in IRELAND (which began in the first yeare of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties raigne) I haue visited all the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> in sundry iournies and circuits. Wherein I haue obserued the good <hi>Temperature</hi> of the <hi>Ayre;</hi> the <hi>Fruitt<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:9893:4"/>
lying open for Trafficke, into all the West parts of the world; the long <hi>Inlets</hi> of many Nauigable Riuers, and so many <hi>great Lakes,</hi> and fresh Ponds within the Land; (as the like are not to be seene in any part of <hi>Europe</hi>) the rich <hi>Fishings,</hi> and Wilde <hi>Fowle</hi> of all kinds; and lastly, th <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Minds</hi> of the people, endued with extraordinarie abilities of Nature.</p>
            <p>THe obseruation whereof, hath bred in me some curiositie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what were the true causes, why <hi>this Kingdome,</hi> whereof our Kings of <hi>England</hi> haue borne the Title of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign Lords</hi> for the space of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and odde yeares (a period of time wherein diuers great Monarchies haue risen from Barbarisme to Ciuilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fallen againe to ruine) was not in all that space of time, thoroughly subdued and reduced to Obedience of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> although there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9893:4"/>
hath been almost a continuall warre between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Irish;</hi> and why the maners of the meere <hi>Irish</hi> are so little altred since the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, as appeareth by the description made by <hi>Giraldus Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> who liued and wrote in that time) albeit, there haue bin since that time, so many <hi>English Colonies</hi> planted in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as that, if the people were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered at this day by the Poll, such as are descended of English race, would bee found more in number, then the ancient Natiues.</p>
            <p>AND truly, vpon consideration of the conduct and passage of affaires in former times, I find, that the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ought to be cleared of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which a vulgar error hath cast vpon it, in one point; namely, <hi>That Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land long since might haue beene subdued and reduced to</hi> Ciuility, <hi>if some statesmen in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, had not thoght it more fit to continue that</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9893:5"/>
               <hi>Realme in Barbarisme.</hi> Doubtlesse, this vulgar Opinion (or report) hath no true ground, but did first arise either out of Ignorance, or out of Malice. For it will appeare by that which shal heereafter be laide downe in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that euer since <hi>Our Nation</hi> had any footing in this Land, the State of <hi>England</hi> did earnestly desire, and did accordingly endeuour from time to time, to perfect the Conquest of this kingdom, but that in euery age there were found such impediments &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in both Realmes, as caused al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an impossibility, that thinges should haue bin otherwise then they were.</p>
            <p>THe <hi>Defects</hi> which hindred the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Two maine impediments of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> of the Conquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were of two kinds, and consisted; first, <hi>in the faint prosecution of the warre,</hi> and next, <hi>in the loosenesse of the ciuill Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For, the Husbandman must first
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9893:5"/>
breake the Land, before it bee made capeable of good seede: and when it is thoroughly broken and manured, if he do not forth with cast good seed into it, it will grow wilde againe, and beare nothing but Weeds. So a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Country must be first broken by a warre, before it will be capeable of good Gouernment; and when it is fully subdued and conquered, if it bee not well planted and gouerned after the Conquest it wil est-soones return to the former Barbarisme.</p>

in the end an vniuersall and absolute conquest of all the <hi>Irishrie:</hi> it is most certaine, that the English forces sent <hi>hither,</hi> or raised heere from time to time, were euer too weake to subdue and master so many warlike Nations (or Septs) <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

            <p>FOr, that I call a <hi>Perfect Conquest</hi> of a Country, which doth reduce all the <note place="margin">What is a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> people thereof to the Condition of <hi>Subiects:</hi> and those I cal <hi>Subiects,</hi> which are gouerned by the ordinary Lawes and Magistrates of the <hi>Soueraigne</hi> For, though the Prince doth beare the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Soueraign Lord</hi> of an entire coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

            <p>For albeit, <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> doth report, that <hi>Agricola</hi> hauing subdued the greatest part of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> did signifie to the Senat of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he thought <hi>Ireland</hi> might also be conquered with one Legion, and a few ayds:</p>
            <p>I make no doubt, but that if he had attempted the conquest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with a farre greater army, he would haue found himselfe deceiued in his coniecture.<q>For, a Barbarous Country is not so easily conquered, as a Ciuill, where of <hi>Caesar</hi> had experience in his warres against the <hi>Gaules, Germaines,</hi> and <hi>Britaines,</hi> who were subdued to the Roman Empire, with farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty, then the rich kingdoms of <hi>Asia.</hi> And againe, a Countrey pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with many pettie Lordes and States, is not so soone brought vnder entirely, as an entire Kingdome Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by one Prince or Monarch. And therefore, the late King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:9893:8"/>
could sooner win the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> then reduce the States of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>

            <p>BVt let vs see the successe of King <note place="margin">What maner of Conquest King Henrie the second made of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> 
               <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, doubtlesse his expedition was such, as he might haue said with <hi>Caesar: veni, vidi, vici,</hi> For, vpon his first arriuall, his very <hi>Presence</hi> without drawing his sword, preuailed so much, as al the <hi>Petty-Kings,</hi> or <hi>Great Lords</hi> within <hi>Leinster, Conaght,</hi> and <hi>Mounster,</hi> submitted themselues vnto him, promised to pay him tribute, &amp; acknowledged him their chiefe and Soueraigne Lord. Besides, the better to assure this inconstant Sea-Nimph (who was so easily wonne) the Pope would needs giue her vnto him with a Ring; <hi>Coniugio iungam stabili, propriam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que dicabo.</hi> But as the Conquest was but slight and superficiall, so the <hi>Popes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and <hi>the Irish Submissions, were but weake and fickle assurances.</hi> For, as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9893:9"/>
Pope had no more interrest in this kingdome, then <hi>He</hi> which offered to Christ all the kingdomes of the earth; so the <hi>Irish</hi> pretend, <hi>That by their Law, a Tanist might do no Act that might bind his successor.</hi> But this was the best assurance hee could get from so many strong Nations of people, with so weake a power: and yet he was so well pleased with this title of the <hi>Lordship of Ireland,</hi> as he placed it in his <hi>Royall Stile,</hi> before the Dutchies of <hi>Normandy</hi> &amp; <hi>Aquitaine.</hi> And so, being aduertised of somestirs raised by his vnnatural sonnes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> within fiue months after his first arriuall hee departed out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without striking one blow, or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Castle, or planting one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison among the Irish, neither left he behinde him one true subiect more then those he found there at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ouer, which were onely the <hi>English Aduenturers</hi> spoken of before, who had gained the Port Townes in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9893:9"/>
               <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Mounster,</hi> and possessed some scopes of land thereunto adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, partly by <hi>Strongbowes</hi> alliaunce with the Lord of <hi>Leinster,</hi> and partly, by plaine inuasion and Conquest.</p>
            <p>And this is that Conquest of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, so much spoken of, by so many Writers, which though it were in no other manner then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed, yet is the entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> attributed vnto him.</p>
            <p>But the troth is, the conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> was made peece and peece, by slow steppes and degrees, and by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall attempts, in seuerall ages. There were sundry reuolutions, as well of the English fortunes, as of the Irish; some-whiles one preuailing, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles the other, and it was neuer brought to a full period, till his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty that now is, came to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>As for King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, hee was farre from obtaining that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9893:10"/>
Royall, and true Soueraignetie which his Maiesty (who nowe raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) hath ouer the Irish. For the Irish Lords did onely promise to become Tributaries to King <hi>Henry</hi> the second. And such as pay onely <hi>Tribute,</hi> though they bee placed by <hi>Bodin,</hi> in the first <note place="margin">Bodin de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</note> degree of <hi>Subiection,</hi> are not properlie <hi>Subiects</hi> but <hi>Soueraignes.</hi> For, though they bee lesse and inferiour vnto the Prince to whom they pay Tribute, yet they hold all other pointes of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; and hauing paide their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which they promised, to haue their peace, they are quit of all other duties, as the same <hi>Bodin</hi> writeth. And therefore, though King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond had the title of <hi>Soueraigne Lorde</hi> ouer the Irish, yet did he not put those thinges in execution, which are the true markes and differences of <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, to giue Lawes vnto a people, to <note place="margin">The true markes of Soueraignty.</note>

            <p>For they gouerned their people by the <hi>Brehon Law;</hi> they made their owne Magistrates and Officers; they pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and punnished all Malefactours within their seuerall Countries; they made warre and peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without controulment; and this they did not onely during the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in all times, euen vntill the Raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth what maner of subiects these Irish Lords were, by the Concorde made betweene K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, and <hi>Rodericke</hi> ô <hi>Connor</hi> the Irish King

            <p>King <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the twelfth year of his raigne, came ouer again into Ireland: the Stories of that time say, With a great army, but the certaine numbsrs are not recorded: yet it is credible, in regard of the troubles where-with this King was distressed in England, that this army was not of sufficient strength to make an entire Conquest of Ireland; and if it had bin of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Matth, Paris.</note> strength, yet did not the King stay a sufficient time to performe so great an action, for he came ouer in Iune, &amp; returned in Septem. the same yeare Howbeit in that time, the Irish Lords for the most part, submitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to him, as they had done before to his Father: which was but a meere moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery &amp; imposture.

            <p>The personall presence of these two great Princes, King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and King <hi>Iohn,</hi> though they performed no great thing with their armies, gaue such countenaunce to the English Colonies, which encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed dayly by the comming ouer of new voluntaries and aduenturers out of England, as that, they enlarged their Territories verie much.

were leuied by the cheefe Gouernor, vpon iourneyes, and generall hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, were for the most part laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poore subiect descended of <hi>English</hi> race; howbeit this burden was in some measure tolerable in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first; but in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, <hi>Maurice Fitz-Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Desmond,</hi> beeing chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the army against the Scots, began that wicked extortion of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuery,</hi> and pay, that is; He &amp; his army tooke Horse meate and Manf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate, <note place="margin">Statut. 10 H. 7. cap. 4.

And this was after that time, the generall fault of all the Gouernours and Commanders of the army in this Lande. Onely the Golden saying of Sir <hi>Thomas Rookesby,</hi> who was Iustice <note place="margin">Annales Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in Camden.</note> in the thirtieth yeare of king <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. is recorded in all the Annalles of this kingdome, <hi>That he would eate in</hi>

               <hi>wodden dishes, but would pay for his Meat, Gold &amp; Siluer.</hi> Besides, the English Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies being dispersed in euerie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of this kingdome, were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to keepe continuall guards vpon the Borders &amp; Marches round about them; which <hi>Guardes,</hi> consisting of idle souldiers, were likewise imposed as a continuall burthen vppon the poore <hi>English</hi> Free-holders, whome they oppressed and impouerished in the same manner. And because the great English Lords &amp; Captaines had <note place="margin">Baron Finglas. Manus.</note> power to impose this charge, when, <note place="margin">Stat. 10. H. 7. cap. 4. Rot. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam in Castro Dublin.</note> and where they pleased, manie of the poore Freeholders, were glad to giue vnto those Lords, a great part of their Lands, to hold the rest free from that extortion: And many others, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure that intollerable oppression, did vtterly quit their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and returned into <hi>England.</hi> By this meane, the English Colonies grew poore and weake, though the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9893:18"/>
english Lords grew rich and mighty: for they placed Irish Tenants vppon the Landes relinquished by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; vpon them they leuied all Irish exactions; with them they married, and fostered, and made Gossips: so as within one age, the English, both Lords and Free-holders, became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and meer Irish in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in their apparrell, in their armes and maner of fight, &amp; all other Customes oflife whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth, why the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuory,</hi> is called <note place="margin">Statut. 11. H. 4. cap. 6. Baron Finglas. M.

in later times vpon good reason of State:

the Lorde <hi>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> was authorized by speciall Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Archiu. in offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio Remcmorat. regis apud West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> to receiue the homages &amp; Oaths of fidelity, of all the Irishrie of <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> And the King himselfe hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued humble Letters from <hi>Oneale,</hi> (wherein hee styleth himselfe Prince of the Irishry in <hi>Vlster,</hi> and yet ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the King to be his Soueraign Lorde, &amp; <hi>perpetuus Dominus Hiberniae</hi>) remoued to <hi>Droghedab,</hi> to accept the like submissions from the Irish of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> The men of <hi>Leinster,</hi> namely, <hi>Mac Murrogh, O Byrne, O Moore, O Murrogh, O Nolan,</hi> and the cheefe of the <hi>Kinshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laghes,</hi> in an humble and solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did their homages, &amp; made their Oaths of fidelity to the Earl Marshall, laying aside their girdles, their skeins and their Caps, and falling downe at his feet vpon their knees. Which whe they had performed, the Earle gaue vnto each of them, <hi>Osculum pacis.</hi>

            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:9893:26"/>
            <p>Besides, they were bound by feueral Indentures, vpon great paines to bee paide to the Apostolique Chamber, not onely to continue loyall subiects, but that by a certaine day prefixed, they and all their Sword men should clearely relinquish and giue vp vnto the King and his successors all their Landes and possessions which they held in <hi>Leinster,</hi> and (taking with them onely their mooueable goods) shold serue him in his warres against his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rebels. In consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the King should giue them pay &amp; pensions during their liues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the inheritance of all such lands vpon them, as they shoulde recouer from the Rebels, in any other part of the Realme. And thereupon, a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of eighty Markes, <hi>per annum,</hi> was graunted to <hi>Art'Mac Murrogh,</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Kauanaghes;</hi> the enroulement whereof, I found in the White Booke of the Exchequer heere. And this was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9893:27"/>
the effect of the seruice performed by the Earle <hi>Marshall,</hi> by vertue of his Commission. The King in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiued the submissions of the Lords of <hi>Vlster,</hi> namely; <hi>O Neal, O Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Mac Donel, Mac Mahon,</hi> &amp; others; who with the like Humility and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, did homage and fealtie to the Kings owne person; the words of <hi>O Neales</hi> homage as they are recorded are not vnfit to be remembered: <hi>Ego Nelanus Oneal Senior tam pro meipso, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijs mels, &amp; tota Natione mea &amp; Parentelis meis, &amp; pro omnibus subdit is me is deuenio' Ligeus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo vester, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Indenture betweene him and the King, he is not onely bound to remaine faithfull to the Crowne of England, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the <hi>Bonaght</hi> of <hi>Vlster,</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Vlster,</hi> as of right belonging to that Earledomc, &amp; vsurped among other things by the <hi>Oneales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Indentures and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with many other of the same kinde (for there was not a Chieftaine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9893:27"/>
or head of an Irish sept, but submitted himselfe in one forme or other) the King himselfe caused to bee enrolled and testified by a Notary publique, &amp; deliuered the enroulments with his owne hands to the Byshop of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> then Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> so as they haue beene preserued, and are now to be found in the Office of the Kings Remembrancer there.</p>
            <p>With these humilities they satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the young King, and by their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bending, auoyded the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent storme, and so brake that Army, which was prepared to breake them. For the King hauing accepted their submissions, receiued them in <hi>Osculo pacis,</hi> feasted them, and giuen the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Knight-hood to diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did breake vp and dissolue his armie, and returned into <hi>England</hi> with much honor, &amp; smal profit, (saith <hi>Froissard.</hi>) For though he had spent a huge masse of Treasure in transporting his army,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9893:28"/>
by the countenance whereof, he drew on their submissions, yet did hee not encrease his reuennew thereby one sterling pound, nor enlarged the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> borders the bredth of one Acre of Land; neither did he extend the Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Courtes of Justice one foote further then the English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherein it was vsed and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before. Besides, he was no sooner returned into <hi>England,</hi> but those <hi>Irish</hi> Lords laide aside their maskes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and scorning the weake forces which the King had left behinde him, beganne to infest the borders; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence whereof, the Lord <hi>Roger Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> being then the Kings Lieutenant, and heire apparent of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> was slaine, as I saide before. Whereupon the king being moued with a iust appetite of reuenge, came ouer againe in person, in the 22. yeare of his raigne, with as potent an armie, as he had done before, with a ful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9893:28"/>
to make a full Conquest of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: he landed at <hi>waterford,</hi> and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from thence to <hi>Dublin,</hi> through the wast Countries of the <hi>Murroghes, Kinshelaghes, Cauanaghes, Birnes,</hi> and <hi>Tooles,</hi> his great armie was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed for want of victuals and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, so as he performed no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing in that iourney; onely in the <hi>Cauanaghes</hi> Countrey, hee cut and cleared the paces, and bestowed the honor of Knighthood vpon the Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancasters</hi> son, who was afterwards King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fifte, <note place="margin">Hollingshead in Richard the 2.</note> and so came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where entring into Counsell how to proceede in the warre, he receiued newes out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of the arriuall of the bannished Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> at <hi>Rauenspurgh,</hi> vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Regall authority, and arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and putting to death his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Officers.</p>
            <p>This aduertisement suddainely brake off the kings purpose touching
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9893:29"/>
the prosecution of the warre in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and transported him into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where shortly after hee ended both his raigne and his life. Since whose time, vntill the 39. yeare of Q <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was neuer any armie sent ouer of a Competent strength or power to subdue the Irish, but the warre was made by the English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, onely to defend their borders; or if any forces were transmitted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they were sent only to suppresse the rebellions of such as were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of English race, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our Dominion ouer the Irish.</p>
            <p>DVring the raigne of king <hi>Henrie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Henry 4.</note> the fourth, the Lorde <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> the Kings second sonne, was <note place="margin">The Lord Thomas of Lancaster his seruice.</note> Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who for the first eight yeares of that Kings raign, made the Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> and others his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, who only defended the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with forces leuied within the

He tooke the submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>O Birne</hi> of the Mountaines, <hi>Mac Mahon,</hi> and <hi>O Rely,</hi> by seuerall Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">

the Lord <hi>Furniual</hi> being the kings <note place="margin">The Lorde Furniuall his seruice.</note> Lieutenant, made a martial circuit, or iourney, round about the Marches &amp; Borders of the Pale, and brought all the Irish to the Kinges peace, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Alb. libr.

Hee had power to make them seeke the Kings peace, but not power to reduce them to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Subiectes: yet this was then held so great and worthy a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, as that the Lords &amp; chiefe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Pale, made certificate thereof in French vnto the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in <hi>France:</hi> which I haue seen Recorded in the <hi>white Booke</hi> of the Exchequer at <hi>Dublin.</hi> Howbeit his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was so ill paid and gouerned, as the English suffered more dammage by the Sesse of his Souldiers (for now
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9893:30"/>
that Monster (<hi>Coigne,</hi> and <hi>Liuerie</hi>) which the Statute of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> had for a time abolished, was risen againe from hell) then they gained profit or security, by abating the pride of their enemies for a time.</p>
            <p>DVring the minority of King <hi>Henry</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Henry 6.</note> the sixt, and for the space of seuen or eight yeares after, the Lientenants and Deputies made only a bordering warre vpon the Irish, with small and scattered forces; howbeit, because there came no treasure out of <hi>England</hi> to pay the Soldier, the poore English fubiect, did beare the burthen of the men of warre in euery place, &amp; were thereby so weakned and impouerish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the State of thinges in Ireland, stood very desperate.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Cardinall of <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> (who after the death of <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> did wholly sway the State of <hi>England</hi>) beeing desirous to

place the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> tooke occasion to remooue <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> from <note place="margin">Richard Duke of Yorke his seruice.</note> that gouernment, and to send him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> pretending that hee was a most able and willing person, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme seruice there, because he had a great inheritance of his owne in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; namely, the Earledom of <hi>Vlster,</hi> and the Lordships of <hi>Conaght</hi> &amp; <hi>Meth,</hi> by discent from <hi>Lionell</hi> Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not finde that this great Lord came ouer with any numbers of waged souldiers, but it appeareth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what good termes hee tooke that Gouernment, by the Couenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and him, which are recorded and confirmed by Acte of <note place="margin">Archiu. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro Dublin.</note> Parliament in Ireland, and were to this effect:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he should be the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ten yeares.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:9893:31"/>
            <p n="2">2. That to support the charge of that Countrey, he should receiue al the kings reuennewes there, both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and casual, without accompt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he should bee supplyed also with treasure out of <hi>England,</hi> in this maner; he should haue four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Markes for the first yeare, whereof he should bee imprested 2000. li. before hand; and for the other nine yeares, hee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue 2000. li. <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That hee might Let to Ferme the Kings Landes, and place and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place all Officers at his pleasure.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That he might leuy and wage what numbers of men, he thought fit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That he might make a Deputy, and returne at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>We cannot presume that this Prince kept any great army on foote, aswell because his means out of <hi>England</hi> were so meane, and those ill paide, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his passionate letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9893:32"/>
to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> his brother in Law; the Coppy whereof, is Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the Story of this time: as also <note place="margin">Hollingshead in Henry the sixt.</note> because the whole Lande, except the English Pale, and some part of the Earledome of <hi>Vlster,</hi> vppon the Sea Coasts, were possest by the Irish. So as the Reuennew of the Kingdome, which he was to receiue, did amount to little. He kept the Borders &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Pale with much adoo; he held many Parliaments, wherein sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Lawes were made, for erecting of Castles in <hi>Louth, Meth,</hi> and <hi>Kildare,</hi> to stop the incursions of the Irishrie. And because the souldiers for want of pay were sessed and laide vppon the subiects against their willes; vpon the prayer and importunitie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, this extortion was declared to be <hi>High-Treason.</hi> But to the end, that <note place="margin">Rot. Parliam. in Castro Dublin</note> some meanes might be raised to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish some forces for defence of the Pale, by another Acte of Parliament,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9893:32"/>
euery twenty pound Land was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the furnishing and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of one Archer on horsebacke. <note place="margin">Archiu Tur. 17 Hen. 6. Claus. m. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, the natiue subiects of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> seeing the kingdome vtterly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, did passe in such numbers into <hi>England,</hi> as one Law was made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to transmit them backe againe; and another Law made heere to stop their passage in euery Port &amp; creeke. <note place="margin">Manuscript of Baron Finglas.</note> Yet afterwards, the greatest partes of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Meth,</hi> past ouer into England, and were slaine with him at <hi>wakefield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the State of England was so farre from sending an army to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Irish at this time, as among the Articles of greeuances exhibited <note place="margin">Hollingshead in Hen. 6.</note> by the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> against K. <hi>Henry</hi> the sixte, this was one; That diuers Lords about the King, had caused his Highnesse to write Letters vnto some of his Irish enemies; whereby they were encouraged to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9893:33"/>
of the said Land. Which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the same Irish enemies had sent vnto the Duke; maruailing greatlie, that such Letters should be sent vnto them, &amp; speaking therein great shame of the Realme of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, when this great Lorde was returned into <hi>England,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king claime to the Crowne, beganne the Warre betwixt the two Houses; It cannot bee conceiued, but that the kingdome fell into a worse and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker estate.</p>
            <p>WHen <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Edward 4</note> in the kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <note place="margin">How the war was maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the time of King Edward the 4</note> he made his Brother <hi>George</hi> Du. of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Prince was born in the Castle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> during the Gouernment of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of Yorke; yet did hee neuer passe ouer into this kingdome, to gouerne it in person, though hee held the Lieutenancie many yeares.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9893:33"/>
But it is manifest, that King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth did not pay any army in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land during his raigne; but the men of war did pay themselues by taking Coigne and Liuery vppon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: <note place="margin">

heere.

               </hi> These foure great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did take vp all the raign of this Prince. And therefore, we find not in any Record, that this King transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any forces into Ireland; but on the other side, wee finde it recorded <note place="margin">Archiv. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro Dublin.</note> both in the Annalles, and in the Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rolles of this kingdom, that three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall <note place="margin">Annales Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binae in Camde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> armies were raised of the Kings subiectes in Ireland, and transported one into <hi>Scotland;</hi> another into <hi>wales;</hi> and the third into <hi>Gascoigne;</hi> and that seuerall aydes were leuied heere, for the setting forth of those armies.</p>

And when the Scottish Nation had ouer-run all this land vnder the conduct of <hi>Edward le Bruce</hi> (who stiled himselfe King of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) England was not then able to send either men or mony to saue this Kingdome.

            <p>IN the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <note place="margin">Edward 3</note> the impediments of the Conquest of Ireland, are so notorious, as I shal not neede to expresse them; to wit, the warre which the King had with the Realmes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Fraunce;</hi> but especially the Warres of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which were almost continuall for the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9893:46"/>
space of fortie yeares. And indeede, <hi>France</hi> was a fairer marke to shoot at, then Ireland, &amp; could better reward the Conqueror. Besides, it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance newly discended vpon the King; and therfore, he had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to bend all his power, and spend all his time and treasure in the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thereof. And this is the true cause why <hi>Edward</hi> the third sent no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into Ireland, till the 36. yeare of his raigne, when the Lorde <hi>Lionell</hi> brought ouer a Regiment of 1500. men, as is before expressed: which that wise and warlicke Prince did not transmit as a competent power, to make a full conquest, but as an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable retinue for his sonne; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to enable him to recouer some part of his Earledome of <hi>Vlster,</hi> which was then ouer-run with the Irish. But on the other part, though the English Colonies were much degenerate in this kings time, and had lost a great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9893:47"/>
part of their possessions, yet lying at the siedge of <hi>Callis,</hi> hee sent for a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of men out of Ireland, which wer transported vnder the conduct of the <note place="margin">Annales Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANd now are we come again to the <note place="margin">Richard 2</note> time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second; who for the first tenne yeares of his raigne, was a Minor, and much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with popular Commotions; and after that, was more trobled with the factions that arose betweene his Minions, &amp; the Princes of the bloud. But at last, he tooke a resolution to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Conquest of this Realm. And to that end he made two Royall voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges hither. Vpon the first, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the faigned submissions of the Irish; but vpon the later, when he was fully bent to prosecute the warre with effect, he was diuerted &amp; drawn from hence by the return of the Duke
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9893:47"/>
of <hi>Lancaster</hi> into England, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall defection of the whole realme.</p>
            <p>AS for <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, he beeing <note place="margin">Henrie 4.</note> an Intruder vpon the Crowne of England, was hindered from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne actions, by sundry Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Rebellions at home, moued by the house of <hi>Northumberland</hi> in the North; by the Dukes of <hi>Surrey</hi> &amp; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceter</hi> in the South; and by <hi>Oxen Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> in Wales; so as he spent his short raigne in establishing and setling him selfe in the quiet possession of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and had neyther leisure nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to vndertake the final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Ireland. Much lesse could <note place="margin">Henrie 5.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift perfourme that worke: for in the second yeare of his raigne, he transported an armie into <hi>France,</hi> for the recouery of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and drewe ouer to the siedge of <hi>Harflew,</hi> the Priour of <hi>Kilmaincham,</hi> with 1500. Irish. In which great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Annales Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae in Camden.</note>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:9893:48"/>
this victorious Prince, spent the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>ANd after his death, the two Noble Princes his Brothers, the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> who during the <note place="margin">Henrie 6.</note> minority of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixte, had the Gouernment of the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> did employ all their Counsels and endeuors to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Conquest of <hi>France,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part whereof beeing gained by <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, &amp; retained by the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> was againe lost by K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the sixt; a manifest argument of his disability to finish the Conquest of this Land. But when the ciuill Warre betweene the two Houses was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were so farre from reducing al the Irish vnder their Obedience, as they drew out of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to strengthen their parties, al the Nobility and Gentry descended of English race, which gaue opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9893:48"/>
to the Irishry, to inuade the Lands of the English Colonies, and did ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the losse of the whole kingdom. For, though the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> did, while he liued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> carrie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Hollingshead in Hen. 6.</note> respectiuely towards all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to win the generall loue of all, bearing equall fauour to the <hi>Giraldines</hi> and the <hi>Butlers</hi> (as appeared at the Christning of <hi>George</hi> duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was borne in the Castle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> where he made both the Earle of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Gossips:) And hauing occasion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times to passe into <hi>England;</hi> hee left the sworde with <hi>Kildare</hi> at one time, and with <hi>Ormond</hi> at another: &amp; when he lost his life at <hi>wakefield,</hi> there were slaine with him diuers of both those families. Yet afterwards, those two Noble houses of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow the two Royall houses of <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Giraldines</hi> adhering to the house of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the <hi>Butlers</hi> to the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9893:49"/>
house of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Whereby it came <note place="margin">Manuscript of Baron Finglas.</note> to passe, that not onely the principall Gentlemen of both those Sur-names, but all their friendes and dependants did passe into <hi>England,</hi> leauing their Lands and possessions to be ouer-run by the Irish. These impediments, or rather impossibilities of finishing the Conquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did continue till the Warres of <hi>Lancaster</hi> &amp; <hi>Yorke</hi> were ended: which was about the 12. yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</p>
            <p>Thus hitherto the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were hindred from finishing this Conquest by great and apparant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments: <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, by the rebellion of his sonnes: King <hi>Iohn, Henry</hi> the third, &amp; <hi>Edward</hi> the second, by the Barons warres: <hi>Edward</hi> the first by his warres in <hi>wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland: Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the</hi> third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, by the warres of <hi>France: Richard</hi> the second, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt, and <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, by Domestick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9893:49"/>
for the Crowne of England it selfe.</p>
            <p>BVt the fire of the ciuil warre being <note place="margin">Edward 4</note> vtterly quenched, and K. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth setled in the peaceable possession of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> what did then hinder that warlicke Prince from reducing of <hi>Ireland</hi> also? First, the whole Realme of <hi>England</hi> was miserably wasted, depopulated &amp; impouerished by the late ciuil dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet assoon as it had recouered it selfe with a little peace and rest, this King raised an Army, and reuiued the Title of <hi>France</hi> againe: howbeit, this Army was no sooner transmitted and brought into the fielde, but the two Kings also were brought to an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. Whereupon, partly by the faire and white promises of <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11. and partly by the corruption of some of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Minions, the english forces were broken and dismissed, &amp;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9893:50"/>
King <hi>Edward</hi> returned into England, where shortly after finding himselfe deluded and abused by the French, he dyed with melancholy, and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p>I Omit to speake of <hi>Richard</hi> the Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <note place="margin">Richard 3</note> who neuer got the quiet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>England,</hi> but was cast out by <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, within two yeares and a halfe, after his Vsurpation.</p>
            <p>ANd for King <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth <note place="margin">Henrie 7.</note> himselfe, thogh he made that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py vnion of the two houses, yet for more then half the space of his raign, there were walking Spirites of the house of <hi>Yorke,</hi> aswell in <hi>Ireland</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> which he could not coniure downe, without expence of some bloud and Treasure. But in his later times, hee did wholly studye to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Reuennues of the Crowne in both Kingdomes, with an intent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9893:50"/>
to prouide meanes for some great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, if hee had liued, woulde rather haue improued a iourny into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> then into <hi>Ireland,</hi> because in the eyes of all men, it was a fayrer enterprize.</p>
            <p>THerefore King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, in <note place="margin">Henrie 8</note> the beginning of his raigne, made a Voyage Royall into <hi>France;</hi> wherein he spent the greatest part of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which his Father had frugally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued; perhaps for the like purpose. In the latter end of his raign, he made the like iourney, being enricht with the Reuennewes of the Abbey Lands. But in the middle time between these two attemptes, the great alteration which hee made in the State ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, caused him to stand vpon his guard at home; the Pope hauing sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited al the Princes of Christendom to reuenge his quarrell in that behalf. And thus was King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9893:51"/>
tained and diuerted from the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reducing of the kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LAstly, the infancie of King <hi>Edward</hi> 
               <note place="margin">K. Edward 6. and Qu. Marie.</note> the sixt, and the Couerture of Qu. <hi>Mary</hi> (which are both <hi>Non abilities</hi> in the Lawe) did in fact disable them to accomplish the Conquest of Ireland.</p>
            <p>SO as now this great worke did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <note place="margin">Quee E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth.</note> to be performed by Queene ELIZABETH; who though shee were diuerted by suppressing the open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the North; by preuenting diuers secret Conspiracies against her person; by giuing ayds to the <hi>French,</hi> and States of the Low-Countries; by maintaining a Nauall war with <hi>Spaine</hi> for many years together: yet the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry rebellions, ioyned with forraign inuasions vpon this Island, whereby it was in danger to be vtterly lost, &amp; to bee possessed by the enemies of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9893:51"/>
Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> did quicken her Maiesties care for the preseruation thereof; and to that end, from time to time during her raigne, she sent ouer such supplies of men and treasure, as did suppresse the Rebels, and repell the inuaders. Howbeit, before the transmitting of the last great army, the forces sent ouer by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were not of sufficient power to break and subdue all the Irishry, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and reforme the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but when the generall defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came, which came not without a special prouidence for the final good of that kingdome (though the second causes thereof, were the faint prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Warre against <hi>Tyrone;</hi> the practises of Priests and Iesuites, &amp; the expectation of the ayds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Spaine</hi>) Then the extreame perill of loosing the Kingdome; the dishonor &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that might thereby growe to the Crowne of <hi>England;</hi> together with a

iust disdaine conceiued by that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Queene, that so wicked and vngratefull a Rebell should preuayle against Her, who had euer been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious against all her enemies, did moue, and almost enforce her to send ouer that mighty army: and did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enflame the hearts of the Subiects of <hi>England,</hi> chearefully to contribute to wardes the maintaining thereof, a Million of sterling poundes at least: which was done with a purpose only to <hi>Saue,</hi> and not to <hi>Gaine</hi> a kingdom; To keep and retaine that <hi>Soueraignetie,</hi> which the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> had in <hi>Ireland</hi> (such as it was) and not to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a more absolute Dominion.<q>But, as it falleth out many times, that when a house is on fire, the Owner to saue it from burning, pulleth it downe to the ground; but that pulling downe, doeth giue occasion of building it vp againe in a better forme:</q>
So, these last warres, which to saue the Kingdome
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9893:52"/>
did vtterly breake &amp; distroy this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, produced a better effect then was at first expected.

            </p>
            <p>And thus much may suffice to bee spoken, touching the defectes in the martiall affayres, and <hi>the weake &amp; faint prosecution of the warre;</hi> and of the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Impediments</hi> or <hi>imployments,</hi> which did hinder or diuert euery King of <hi>England</hi> successiuely, from reducing <hi>Ireland</hi> to their absolute subiection.</p>

            <p>LIkewise, our Norman Conqueror, <note place="margin">William the Conquerour gouerned both the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and the English vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Law.</note> though he oppressed the English Nobility very sore, and gaue away to his seruitors, the Lands and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of such, as did oppose his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion, though he caused all his Actes of Counsel to be published in <hi>French;</hi> and some legall proceedings &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to bee framed and vsed in the same tongue, as a marke and badge of a conquest; yet he gouerned Al, both English and Normans, by one &amp; the same Law; which was the auncient common Law of England, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conquest. Neither did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie any English-man (that submitted himselfe vnto him:) The benefit of that Law thogh it were againsta Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the best ranke, and in greatest fauour (as appeared in the notable Controuersie betweene <hi>VVarren</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Sherburne</hi> of <hi>Sherburne</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in <hi>Norfolke;</hi> for the Conquerour had giuen that Castle to <hi>warren;</hi> yet

            </p>
            <p>THE like prudent course hath bin <note place="margin">King Edw. I. did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Lawes to the Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> obserued in reducing of Wales; which was performed partly by King

               <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and altogether finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. For, we finde by the Statute of <hi>Rutland,</hi> made the 12. of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, when the Welshmen had submitted themselus, <hi>De alto &amp; Basso,</hi> to that King, he did not reiect and cast them off, as Out-lawes and Enemies, but caused their Lawes and Customes to be examined, which were in many points agreeable to the Irish or <hi>Brehon</hi> Lawe. <hi>Quibus diligenter audit is &amp; plenius intellectis, quasdam illaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

After this, by reason of the sundry insurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Barons; the Warres in <hi>France;</hi> and the dissention betweene the houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the State of England, neglected or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9893:68"/>
the execution of this Statute of <hi>Rutland;</hi> so as a great part of Wales grew wilde and barbarous again. And therefore King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, by the Statutes of the 27. and 32. of his raign, did reuiue and recontinue that Noble worke begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first; and brought it indeed to ful perfection; For he vnited the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Wales, to the Crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and deuided it into Shires, and erected in euery Shire, one Borough, as in England; and enabled them to send Knights &amp; Burgesses to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; established a Court of Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and ordained that Iustices of Assise, and <hi>Gaol-deliuerie,</hi> should make their halfe yearly Circuits there, as in England; made all the Lawes &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>England,</hi> in force there; and among other Welsh Customes, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished that of <hi>Gauel-kinde:</hi> wherby the Heyres-Females were vtterlie exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Bastards did inherit, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9893:68"/>
as the Legimate, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Irish <hi>Gauelkinde.</hi> By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that entire Country in a short time was securely setled in peace and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and hath attained to that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility of Manners, and plentie of all things. as now we finde it not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the best parts of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore knit vp this point with these conclusions; First, that the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which in former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges attempted the Conquest of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being ill aduised and counselled by the great men heere, did not vpon the submissions of the Irish, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their Lawes vnto them, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the state and condition of Free-subiectes: Secondly, that for the space of 200, yeares at least, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the first arriual of <hi>Henry</hi> the secound in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Irish would gladly haue embraced the Lawes of England, and did earnestly desire the benefite and protection thereof; which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9893:69"/>
them, did of necessitie cause a continuall bordering warre between the English and the Irish. And lastly, if according to the examples before recited, they had reduced as well the Irish Countries, as the English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, vnder one forme of ciuil gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as now they are,) the Meres &amp; Bounds of the Marches and Borders, had beene long since worne out and forgotten, (for it is not fit, as <hi>Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> writeth) that a King of an Islande <note place="margin">Giraldus Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brensis. lib. 2. de Hiberniâ expugnata.</note> should haue any Marches or Borders, but the foure Seas) both Nations had beene in corporated and vnited; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had beene entirely Conquered, Planted, and Improoued; and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a rich Reuennew to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next error in the Ciuill polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">2. The Landes conquered from the Irish were not well distributed.</note> which hindered the perfection of the Conquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did consist in the <hi>Distribution</hi> of the Landes and

possessions which were woonne and conquered from the Irish.

them amesueable to the Lawe, which woulde haue abridged and cut off a great part of that greatnesse which they had promised vnto themselues: they perswaded the King of England, that it was vnfit to Communicate the Lawes of England vnto them; that it was the best pollicie to holde them as Aliens and Enemies, and to prosecute them with a continuall warre.

            <p>And for these two causes last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,

they were not willing to root out all the Irishry.

            <p>Besides, the English Lords to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their parties, did ally themselues with the Irish, and drewe them in, to <note place="margin">Sta. 10.

And truely, as these Graunts of little Kingdomes, and great Royalties, to a few priuate persons, did produce the mischiefes spoken of before: So the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9893:80"/>
true cause of the making of these <note place="margin">The first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained these liberal grants, because the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did not prosecute the warre at their owne charge.</note> Grants, did proceede from this; That the Kings of England beeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise employed and diuerted, did not make the Conquest of <hi>Ireland, their own worke,</hi> and vndertake it not royally at their owne charge; but as it was first begun by perticular Aduenturers, so they left the prosecution thereof, to them, &amp; other voluntaries, who came to seeke their fortunes in Ireland; wherein if they could preuayle, they thought that in reason &amp; honor they could doe no lesse, then make them proprieters of such scopes of Land as they could conquer, people, &amp; plant at their owne charge, reseruing only the Soueraigne Lordshippe to the Crowne of England. <hi>But if the Lyon had gone to hunt himselfe, the shares of the Inferiour Beastes had not beene so great:</hi> If the inuasion had been made by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my transmitted, furnished, &amp; supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only at the kings charges, &amp; wholy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:9893:81"/>
paid with the Kings Treasure, as the Armies of Queene ELIZABETH, and King <hi>Iames</hi> haue been; as the conquest had beene sooner atchiued, so the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitors had beene contented with les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser proportions.</p>
            <p>For, when <hi>Scipio, Pompey, Caesar,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">How the State of Rome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded their men of warre.</note> and other Generals of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as <hi>Subiectes</hi> and <hi>Seruants</hi> of that State, and with the publicke Charge had conquered many Kingdomes &amp; Commonweales, wee finde them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Honorable Offices and Triumphes at their returne; and not made Lords and proprieters of whol Prouinces and Kingdoms which they had subdued to the Empire of Rome. Likewise, when the Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">William the Conqueror.</note> had conquered England, which he made his owne work, and performed it in his owne person, hee distributed sundry Lordships and Mannors vnto his followers, but gaue not away whole Shires and Countreyes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesne
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9893:81"/>
to any of his seruitors, whom he most desired to aduance. Only, he made <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> County Palatine of <note place="margin">Camden in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> 
               <hi>Chester,</hi> and gaue that Earledome to him and his heyres, to hold the same, <hi>It a liberè ad gladium, sicut Rex tenebat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliam ad Coronam.</hi> Whereby that Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome indeed had a royal Iurisdiction and Seigniory, though the Landes of that Countie in demesne, were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed for the most part by the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Inheritors.</p>
            <p>Again, from the time of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Wales distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the L. Marchers.</note> Conquest, till the raigne of King Edward the first, many of our English Lords, made warre vpon the Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at their owne charge; the lands which they gained they held to their owne vse, were called <hi>Lords Marchers,</hi> and had Royal Liberties within their Lordshippes. Howbeit, these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Aduenturers, could neuer make a perfect Conquest of Wales.</p>
            <p>But when King <hi>Edward</hi> the first,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9893:82"/>
came in person with his army thither, kept his residence and Court there; made the reducing of <hi>wales,</hi> an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of his owne; hee finished that worke in a yeare or two, whereof the Lords <hi>Marchers</hi> had not performed a third part, with their continuall bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering warre, for two hundred years before. And withall we may obserue, that though this King had nowe the Dominion of Wales in <hi>Iure propriet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as the Statute of <hi>Rutland</hi> affirmeth; which before was subiect vnto him, but in <hi>Iure feodali:</hi> And though he had lost diuers principall Knights &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen in that Warre, yet did he not reward his seruitors with whol Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or Counties, but with particular Mannors and Lordships: as to <hi>Henrie Lacy</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> hee gaue the Lordship of <hi>Denbigh;</hi> and to <hi>Reignold Gray,</hi> the Lordship of <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and so to others. And if the like course had beene vsed in the winning and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9893:82"/>
of the Landes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Island had beene fully conquered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the continent of <hi>wales</hi> had beene reduced. But the troth is, when Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men attempt the Conquest of Countries at their own charge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their enterprizes doe perrish without successe: as when, in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> vndertooke to recouer the <hi>Ardes:</hi> and <hi>Chatterton,</hi> to reconquer then <hi>Fues</hi> and <hi>Orier.</hi> The one lost his Sonne; and the other, Himselfe; and both their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures came to nothing. And as for the Crowne of England, it hath had the like fortune in the Conquest of this Land, as some purchasers haue; who desire to buy Land at too easie a Rate: they finde those cheap purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses so full of trouble, as they spende twice as much as the Land is woorth, before they get the quiet possession thereof.</p>
            <p>And as the best pollicy was not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9893:83"/>
obserued in the distribution of the conquered Lands; so as I conceyue, that the first Aduenturers intending to make a full Conquest of the Irish, were deceiued in the choyse of the <hi>Fittest places for their plantation.</hi> For they sate downe, and erected their Castles and Habitations in the <hi>Plaines &amp; open Countries;</hi> wher they found most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and profitable Lands, and turned the Irish into the <hi>VVoods &amp; Mountains:</hi> Which, as they were proper places for Out-Lawes and Theeues, so were they their Naturall Castles and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; thither they draue their preyes and stealths; there they lurkt, and lay in waite to doe mischiefe. These fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places they kept vnknowne, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the wayes and Entries thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to impassable; there they kept their Creaghts or Heardes of Cattle, liuing by the Milke of the Cowe, without Husbandry or Tillage; there they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and multiplied vnto infinite
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9893:83"/>
numbers by promiscuous generation among themselues; there they made their Assemblies and Conspiracies without discouery: But they discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the weaknes of the English dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the open plaines; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made their sallies and retraites with great aduantage. Whereas, on the other side, if the English had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Castles and Towns in those places of fastnesse, and had driuen the Irish into the Plaines and open Countries, where they might haue had an eye and obseruation vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Irish had beene easily kept in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in short time reclaimed from their wildnesse; there they woulde haue vsed Tillage, dwelt together in Towne-ships, learned Mechanicall Arts &amp; Sciences. The woods had bin wasted with the English Habitations, as they are about the Forts of <hi>Maribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>Phillipston,</hi> which were built in the fastest places in <hi>Leinster,</hi> and the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9893:84"/>
wayes and passages throughout Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, would haue boene as cleare and open, as they are in England at this day.</p>
            <p>A Gaine, if King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, <note place="margin">The English Lords did not reduce the woodes and wasts in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests &amp; Parks.</note> who is said to be the K. that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered this Land, had made Forrests in Ireland, as he did enlarge the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests in England (for it appeareth by <note place="margin">Chart. de Forest. c. 2 &amp; 3.</note> 
               <hi>Charta de Foresta,</hi> that hee afforrested many woods and wasts, to the Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the Subiect, which by that Lawe were disaforrested,) or if those English Lordes, amongst whom the whole Kingdome was deuided, had beene good Hunters, and had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Mountaines, Bogges, and woods within the limits of Forrests, Chases, and Parkes; assuredly, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Forrest Law, and the Law <hi>de Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factoribus in parcis,</hi> would in time haue driuen them into the Plains &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries inhabited and mannured, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9893:84"/>
haue made them yeeld vppe their fast places to those wilde Beastes which were indeede lesse hurtfull and wilde, then they. But it seemeth straunge to mee, that in all the Recordes of this Kingdome, I seldome find any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of a Forrest; &amp; neuer of anie Parke or Free-warren; considering the great plenty both of <hi>Vert</hi> and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison within this Land; and that the cheefe of the Nobility and Gentry are discended of English race; and yet at this day, there is but one Parke stored with Deere in al this kingdom: which is a Parke of the Earle of <hi>Ormonds,</hi> neer <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> It is then manifest, by that which is before expressed; that the not communicating of the English lawes to the Irish; the ouer-large Grants of Lands and Liberties to the English; the plantation made by the English in the Plaines and open Countreyes, leauing the Woods and Mountaines to the Irish, were great Defects in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:9893:85"/>
Ciuill pollicy, and hindered the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Conquest verie much. Howbeit, notwithstanding these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Errours, the English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies stood and maintained themselus in a reasonable good estate, as long as they retained their owne auncient Lawes and Customes, according to that of <hi>Ennius: Moribus antiquis res stat. Romana viris<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>.</hi> But when the ciuil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment <note place="margin">The English Colonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the English lawes and customes, and embraced the Irish.</note> grew so weake &amp; so loose, as that the English Lords, would not suffer the English Lawes to be put in execution within their Territories &amp; Seigniories, but in place therof, both they and their people, embraced the Irish Customes: Then the estate of things, <hi>like a Game at Irish,</hi> was so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about, as the English, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to make a perfect Conquest of the Irish, were by them perfectly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely conquered; because <hi>Victi vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus leges dedere. A iust punnishment to our Nation, that wold not giue Lawes to the</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:9893:85"/>
               <hi>Irish when they might: and therefore nowe the Irish gaue Lawes to them.</hi> Therefore, this Defect and failing of the English Iustice, in the English Colonies; and the inducing of the Irish Customes in lieu thereof, was the maine impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that did arrest and stoppe the course of the Conquest; and was the only meane that enabled the Irishrie to recouer their strength againe.</p>
            <p>FOr, if wee consider the Nature of <note place="margin">The nature of the Irish Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</note> the Irish Customes, wee shall finde that the people which doth vse them, must of necessitie bee Rebelles to all good Gouernment, destroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth wherein they liue, and bring Barbarisme and desolation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the richest and most fruitfull Land of the world. For, whereas by the iust and Honourable Law of England, &amp; by the Lawes of all other well-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The Irish laws and Customs, differing from the Lawes &amp; Customs of al ciuill Nations</note> Kingdomes and Commonweals, Murder, Man-slaughter, Rape, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9893:86"/>
and Theft, are punnished with death; By the Irish Custome, or <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi> Law, the highest of these offences was punished onely by Fine, which they called an <hi>Ericke.</hi> Therfore, when <note place="margin">The Irish Law in Criminall causes.</note> Sir <hi>VVilliam Fitz-williams,</hi> (being Lord Deputy) told <hi>Maguyre</hi> that hee was to send a Sheriffe into <hi>Fermaunagh,</hi> being lately before made a County; your Sheriffe (saide <hi>Maguyre</hi>) shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, but let me knowe his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi> or <hi>the price of his head</hi> afore hand; that if my people cut it off, I may cut the Ericke vpon the Countrey. As for Oppression, Extortion, &amp; other tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, the weaker had neuer anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against the stronger: whereby it came to passe, that no man coulde enioy his Life, his Wife, his Lands or Goodes in safety, if a mightier man then himselfe had an appetite to take the same from him. Wherein they were little better then <hi>Canniballes,</hi> who doe hunt one another; and hee that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9893:86"/>
hath most strength and swiftnes, doth eate and deuoure all his fellowes.</p>
            <p>Againe, in England, and all well ordered Common-weales, men haue certaine estates in their Lands &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and their inheritances dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from Father to Son, which doth giue them encouragement to builde, and to plant, and to improoue their Landes, and to make them better for their posterities. But by the Irish Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of <hi>Tanistry,</hi> the Cheefetanes of <note place="margin">The Irish Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of <hi>Tani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</hi>
               </note> euery Countrey, and the chiefe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Sept, had no longer estate then for life in their Cheeferies, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance whereof, did rest in no man. And these Cheeferies, though they had some portions of Lande allotted vnto them, did consist chiefely in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Cosheries, and other Irish exactions, whereby they did spoyle and impouerish the people at their pleasure. And when their Chieftanes were dead, their sonnes or next heires
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9893:87"/>
did not succeede them, but their <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes,</hi> who were Electiue, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their elections by strong hande; <note place="margin">The Irish Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelkinde.</note> And by the Irish Custome of Gauell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, the inferiour Tennanties were partible amongst all the Males of the Sept, both Bastards and Legittimate: and after partition made, if any one of the Sept had died, his portion was not diuided among his Sonnes, but the cheefe of the sept, made a new partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Lands belonging to that Sept, and gaue euerie one his part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his antiquity.</p>
            <p>THese two Irish Customes made all <note place="margin">The mischiefs that arise by these two Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</note> their possessions vncertain, being shuffled, and changed, and remoued so often from one to another, by new elections and partitions; which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of estates, hath bin the true cause of such Desolation &amp; Barbarism in this land, as the like was neuer seen in any Countrey, that professed the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9893:87"/>
name of Christ. For, though the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishry be a Nation of great Antiquity, and wanted neither wit nor valour; and though they had receiued the Christian Faith, aboue 1200. yeares since; and were Louers of Musicke, Poetry, and all kinde of learning; and possessed a Land abounding with all thinges necessary for the Ciuill life of man; yet (which is strange to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) they did neuer builde any hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Bricke or stone (some few poor Religious Houses excepted) before the raigne of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, though they wer Lords of this Island for many hundred yeares before, and since the Conquest attempted by the English: Albeit, when they sawe vs builde Castles vppon their borders, they haue only in imitation of vs, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted some few piles for the Captaines of the Country: yet I dare boldly say, that neuer any perticuler person, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or since, did builde anie
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9893:88"/>
stone or bricke house for his priuate Habitation; but such as haue latelie obtained estates, according to the course of the Law of <hi>England.</hi> Neither did any of them in all this time, plant any Gardens or Orchards, Inclose or improue their Lands, liue together in setled Villages or Townes, nor made any prouision for posterity; which being against all common sense and reason, must needes bee imputed to those vnreasonable Customes, which made their estates so vncertaine and transitory in their possessions.</p>
            <p>For, who would plant or improoue, or build vppon that Land, which a stranger whom he knew not, should possesse after his death? For that (as <hi>Salomon</hi> noteth) is one of the strangest Vanities vnder the Sunne. And this is the true reason why <hi>Vlster,</hi> and all the Irish Countries are found so wast and desolate at this day; and so wold they continue till the worlds end, if these
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9893:88"/>
Customes were not abolished by the Law of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, that Irish Custom of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel-kinde, did breede another mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; for thereby, euery man being borne to Land, aswell Bastard, as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, they al held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> And though their portions were neuer so small, and them-selues neuer so poor (<hi>For Gauelkind must needs in the end make a poore Gentility,</hi>) yet did they scorne to discend to Husbandry or Marchandize, or to learn any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall Art or Science. And this is the true cause why there were neuer any Corporate Towns erected in the Irish Countries. As for the Maritime Citties and Townes, most certaine it is, that they were built and peopled by the <hi>Ostmen</hi> or <hi>Easterlings:</hi> for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of Ireland neuer perfourmed so good a worke, as to build a City. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, these poore Gentlemen were so affected vnto their small portions of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9893:89"/>
Land, as they rather chose to liue at home by Theft, Extortion, and Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, then to seeke any better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes abroad: which encreased their <hi>Septs</hi> or <hi>Syrnames</hi> into such numbers, as there are not to bee found in anie Kingdome of <hi>Europe,</hi> so many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of one Blood, Familie, and Syrname, as there are of the <hi>O Neales</hi> in <hi>Vlster;</hi> of the <hi>Bourkes,</hi> in <hi>Conaght;</hi> of the <hi>Geraldines,</hi> and <hi>Butlers,</hi> in <hi>Munster</hi> &amp; <hi>Leinster.</hi> And the like may be saide of the Inferiour Bloodes and Families; whereby it came to passe in times of trouble &amp; Dissention, that they made great parties and factions adhering one to another, with much constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; because they were tyed together, <hi>Vinculo sanguinis;</hi> whereas Rebels and Malefactors which are tyed to their Leaders by no band, either of Dutie or Blood, do more easily breake and fall off one from another. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, their Coe-habitation in one
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9893:89"/>
Countrey or Teritory, gaue them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity suddenly to assemble, and Conspire, and rise in multitudes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Crowne. And euen now, in the time of peace, we finde this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, that ther can hardly be an indifferenttriall had betweene the King &amp; the Subiect, or between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and partie, by reason of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kindred and Consanguinity.</p>
            <p>BVt the most wicked and mischee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <note place="margin">The wicked Customes of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</hi>
               </note> Custome of all others, was that of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuery,</hi> often before mentioned; which consisted in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Mansmeate, Horsemeat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Money,</hi> of all the inhabitants of the Country, at the will and pleasure of the soldier, who as the phrase of Scripture is, <hi>Did eate vp the people as it were Bread;</hi> for that he had no other entertainment. This Extortion was originally Irish, for they vsed to lay <hi>Bonaght</hi> vppon their people, and neuer gaue their Soldier
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9893:90"/>
any other pay. But when the English <note place="margin">The mischiefs that did arise by Coigne &amp; Liuery.</note> had Learned it, they vsed it with more insolency, and made it more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for this oppression was not temporary, or limited either to place or time; but because there was euery where a continuall warre, either Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, or Defensiue; and euery Lord of a Countrey, and euery Marcher made warre and peace at his pleasure; it became Vniuersall and Perpetuall; and was indeede the most heauy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that euer was vsed in any Christian or Heathen Kingdom. And therefore, <hi>Vox Oppressorum,</hi> this crying sinne, did drawe downe as great, or greater plagues vppon Ireland, then the oppression of the <hi>Isralites,</hi> did draw vpon the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though they were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, were but of a short continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But the plagues of <hi>Ireland,</hi> lasted 400. yeares together. This extortion of Coigne and Liuery, did produce
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:9893:90"/>
two notorious effects. First, it made the Land wast; Next, it made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ydle. For, when the Husbandman <note place="margin">The cause of Idlenesse in the Irish.</note> had laboured all the yeare, the soldier in one night, did consume the fruites of all his labour, <hi>Long<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> perit labor irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus anni.</hi> Had hee reason then to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure the Land for the next yeare? Or rather might he not complaine as the Shepherd in <hi>Virgil:</hi>
               <q>Impius haec tam culta noualia miles habebit? Barbarus has segetes? En quo discordia Ciues Perduxit miseros? En queis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sevimus agros?</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND heereupon of necessity came depopulation, banishment, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the better sort of subiects; and such as remained became ydle, and lookers on, expecting the euent of those miseries and euill times: So as this extreame Extortion and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, hath beene the true cause of the Idlenesse of this Irish Nation; and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9893:91"/>
that rather the vulgar sort haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <note place="margin">Why the Irish are Beggers in forraigne. Countreyes.</note> to be Beggers in forraigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, then to manure their own fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Land at home.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this oppression did of force <note place="margin">Why the Irish are reputed a crafty people.</note> and necessity make the Irish a craftie people: for such as are oppressed and liue in slauery, are euer put to their shifts; <hi>Ingenium mala saepe mouent;</hi> And therefore, in the olde Comedies of <hi>Plantus</hi> &amp; <hi>Terence,</hi> the Bondslaue doth alwayes act the cunning and Crastie part. Besides, all the Common people haue a whyning tune or Accent in their speech, as if they did still smart or suffer some oppression. And this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse, <note place="margin">Why the Irish are inquisitiue after Newes.</note> together with feare of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent mischiefes, which did continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hang ouer their heads, haue bin the cause, that the Irish wer euer the most inquisitiue people after newes, of any Nation in the world. As S. <hi>Paule</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe made obseruation vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens;</hi> that they were an ydle
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:9893:91"/>
people, and did nothing but learne and tell Newes. And because these Newes-Carriers, did by their false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, many times raise troubles and rebellions in this Realm, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> doth punish Newes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers (by the name of <hi>Skelaghes</hi>) with Fine and ransome.</p>
            <p>This Extortion of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,</hi> was taken for the maintenaunce of their men of warre; but their Irish exactions extorted by the Chieftanes and <hi>Tanists,</hi> by colour of their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seigniory, were almost as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a burthen as the other; namely, <hi>Cosherings,</hi> which were visitations and <note place="margin">Cosherings.</note> progresses made by the Lord and his followers, among his Tenants: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did eate them (as the English Prouerbe is) <hi>Out of house and home. Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sessings.</note> of the <hi>Kerne,</hi> of his family, called <hi>Kernety,</hi> of his Horses &amp; Hors-boyes; of his Dogges and Dog-boyes, and <note place="margin">Cuttings.</note> the like: And lastly, <hi>Cuttings, Tallages,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:9893:92"/>
or <hi>Spendings,</hi> high or low, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; all which, made the Lorde an absolute Tyrant, and the Tennant a verie slaue and villain; and in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect more miserable then Bonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues. <hi>For commonly the Bondslaue is fed by his Lord, but heere the Lord was fedde by his Bondslaue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, there were two other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes proper and peculiar to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishry, which being the cause of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strong combinations and factions do tend to the vtter ruine of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: The one, was <hi>Fosteriug;</hi> the other, <hi>Gossipred;</hi> both which haue euer bin of greater estimation among this people, then with any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Christian world. For <hi>Foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> I did neuer heare or read, that it was in that vse or reputation in anie other Countrey, Barbarous or Ciuill, as it hath beene, and yet is, in <hi>Ireland:</hi> where they put away al their children to Fosterers: the potent &amp; rich men
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:9893:92"/>
               <hi>Selling;</hi> the meaner sort <hi>Buying,</hi> the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terage of their Children; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because in the opinion of this people, <hi>Fostering</hi> hath alwayes beene a stronger alliance then <hi>Bloud;</hi> and the Foster-Children doe loue and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of their foster-fathers and their Sept, more then of their owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Parents and Kindred; and do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of their meanes more franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and doe adhere vnto them in all fortunes, with more affection &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. And though <hi>Tully</hi> in his Book of Friendship doth obserue, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Princes being somtimes in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of necessity for sauing of their liues deliuered to Shepheards to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and bred vp, when they haue bin restored to their great fortunes, haue still retained their loue and affection to their Fosterers, whom for manie yeares they tooke to be their Parents: yet this was a rare case, and few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to be found thereof.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:9893:93"/>
            <p>But such a generall Custome in a Kingdome, in giuing and taking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Foster, making such a firme Alliance as it doth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene or heard of, in any other Countrey of the world besides.</p>
            <p>THE like may be said of <hi>Gossipred</hi> or <note place="margin">Gossipred.</note> or <hi>Compaternitie,</hi> which though by the Canon Law, it be a spirituall affinity, and a Iuror that was Gossip to either of the parties, might in former times haue bin challenged, as not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by our Law, yet there was no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder the Sun, that euer made so Religious accompt thereof, as the Irish.</p>
            <p>Now these two Customs, which of themselues are indifferent in other Kingdomes, became exceeding euill and full of mischiefe in this Realm, by reason of the inconueniences which followed thereupon. For, they made (as I saide before) strong parties and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9893:93"/>
factions, wherby the great men were enabled to oppresse their Inferiours, and to oppose their Equals: and their followers were borne out and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced in all their lewde and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actions: For Fosterers &amp; Gossips by the common Custome of Ireland, were to maintaine one another in all causes lawful, and vnlawfull; which as it is a Combination and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy punishable in all well-gouerned Common-weales, so was it not one of the least causes of the common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I omit their common repudiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Wiues; their promiscuous generation of Children; their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of lawfull Matrimony; their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse in Apparrell, Diet, &amp; Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; and their contempt and scorne of all thinges necessary for the Ciuill life of man.</p>
            <p>These were the Irish Customes, which the English Colonies did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9893:94"/>
and vse, after they had reiected <note place="margin">How the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Colonies became dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</note> the Ciuill and Honorable Lawes and Customes of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they became degenerate and metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed like <hi>Nabuchadnezzar:</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had the face of a man, had the heart of a Beast; or like those who had drunke of <hi>Circes</hi> Cuppe, and were turned into very Beasts; and yet tooke such pleasure in their beastly manner of life, as they would not returne to their shape of men againe: Insomuch as within lesse time then the Age of a man, they had no markes or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences left amongst them of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nation, from which they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. For, as they did not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the English Language, &amp; scorne the vse thereof, but grew to bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their very English Names, though they were Noble and of great Antiquity; and tooke Irish <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names</hi> and <hi>Nicke-names.</hi> Namely, the two most potent families of the <hi>Bourks</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:9893:94"/>
in <hi>Conaght</hi> (after the house of the Red Earle failed of Heyres-males) called their Cheefes, <hi>Mac william Eighter,</hi> and <hi>Mac william Oughter.</hi> In the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, <hi>Bremingham, Baron</hi> of <hi>Athenrie,</hi> called himselfe <hi>Mac Yoris. Dexecester,</hi> or <hi>De'exon,</hi> was cald <hi>Mac Iordan. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> or <hi>de Angulo,</hi> took the name of <hi>Mac Costelo.</hi> Of the Inferior families of the <hi>Bourkes,</hi> one was called <hi>Mac Hubbard,</hi> another <hi>Mac Dauid.</hi> In <hi>Munster,</hi> of the great Families of the <hi>Geraldines</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there; One was called <hi>Mac Morice</hi> chiefe of the house of <hi>Lixnaw;</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>Mac Gibbon,</hi> who was also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>white Knight.</hi> The chiefe of the Baron of <hi>Dunhoynes</hi> house, who is a branch of the house of <hi>Ormond,</hi> tooke the Surnames of <hi>Mac Pheris. Condon</hi> of the Countie of <hi>waterford,</hi> was called <hi>Mac Maioge:</hi> and the Arch-Deacon of the County of <hi>Kilkenny, Mac Odo.</hi> And this they did in contempt and hatred of the English Name and Nation;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9893:95"/>
of these degenerate families became more mortal enemies, then the meere Irish. And whereas the state and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment beeing growne weake by their defection, did to reduce them to Obedience, grant them many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections and Pardons (<hi>The cheapenesse whereof, in all ages, hath brought great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor and damage to this Commonweal</hi>) they grew so vngratefull and vnnatural, as in the end they scorned that grace &amp; fauour, because the acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did argue them to be subiects, and they desired rather to bee accounted Enemies, then Rebels to the Crowne of England.</p>
            <p>Heereupon was that olde Verse <note place="margin">Alb. libr. Scacc. Dublin.</note> made, which I finde Written in the White Booke of the Exchequer, in a hand as auncient as the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</p>

            <p>And therefore, in a close Roll in the Tower, bearing this Title; <hi>Articuli in Hibernia obseruandi:</hi> we finde these two Articles among others. 1. <hi>Iusticiarius Hiberniae non concedat perdonationes de morte ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, nec de Roberijs, seu incendijs, &amp; quod de</hi>

Assuredly, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <note place="margin">When &amp; how the English Colonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> the ancient Annalles of <hi>lrelaud</hi> with the Records remaining heere, &amp; in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> I do find that this generall defection, fell out in the latter end of the raign of king <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and in the beginning of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9893:96"/>
the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the thirde. And all this great innovation, grewe within the space of thirty years: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of which time, there fell out diuers mischieuous accidents, whereby the whole kingdome was in a maner lost. For first, <hi>Edward de Bruce</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Scots o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrun <hi>Iceland</hi>
               </note> inuaded <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Scottish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and preuailed so farre, as that he possessed the Maritime parts of <hi>vlster,</hi> marched vp to the walles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> spoiled the English Pale, passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Munster,</hi> as farre as <hi>Limericke,</hi> and was Maister of the field in euery part of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>This hapned in the tenth yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, at what time the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> was weaker, &amp; suffred more dishonor in both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, then it did at any time since the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest. Then did the State of <hi>England</hi> send ouer <hi>Iohn de Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Annales Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in Camden.</note> to be Treasurer heere, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to call the great Lords of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9893:96"/>
to gether; and to take of them an Oath of Assoacition, that they should loyally ioyne together in life &amp; death to preserue the right of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to expell the commone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. But this Treasurer brought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, nor money, to performe this seruice.</p>
            <p>At that time, though <hi>Richard Bourk</hi> Earle of <hi>Vlster</hi> (commonly called the Redde-Earle) were of greater power then any other subiect in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet was he so farre stricken in yeares, as that hee was vnable to mannage the martiall affaires, as he had done du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first: hauing bin Generall of the Irish forces, not only in this kingdom, but in the Wars of <hi>Scotland, wales,</hi> and <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Maurice Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Desmond,</hi> beeing then the most actiue Nobleman in this realm, <note place="margin">Desmond cheefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in the warre against the Scots.</note> tooke vpon him the chiefe command in this Warre: for the support where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:9893:97"/>
the Reuennue of this Lande, was farre too short, and yet no supply of Treasure was sent out of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was there no mean to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">When &amp; how the extortion of Coign and Liuery-began among the English.</note> the Army, but by Sessing the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vppon the Subiect, as the Irish were wont to impose their <hi>Bonaught.</hi> Whereupon, grewe that wicked Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuerie</hi> spoken of before, which in short time banished the greatest part of the Free-holders out of the County of <hi>Kerrie, Limerick, Corke,</hi> and <hi>waterford;</hi> Into whose pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, <hi>Desmond</hi> and his Kinsmen, Alies, and Followers, which were then more Irish then English, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and appropriate these Lands vnto themselues, <hi>Desmond</hi> himselfe taking what scopes hee best liked for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesnes in euery Countrey, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an Irish Seigniory out of the rest.

of this wicked Extortion, called <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuery;</hi> and the manifolde mischiefes it did produce, I thinke it fit and pertinent to insert the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Statute of the 10. of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. c. 4. not printed, but recorded in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament Rols of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in these words: <hi>At the request &amp; supplication of the Commons of this Land of Ireland, that where of long time there hath bin vsed and exacted by the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of this Land, many and diuers damnable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes &amp; vsages, which bin called Coigne, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and Pay; that is, Horsemeat, and Mansmeat, for the finding of their Horsemen and Footmen; and ouer that, 4. d. or 6. d. daily to euery of them to be had and paide of the poore Earth-Tillers, and Tenants, inhabitants of the saide Land, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing doing or paying therefore.

            </p>
            <p>These possessions being thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully gotten, could not bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the iust and honorable law of England, which would haue resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true Owners to their Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

found no meanes to continue &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his ill-purchased greatnesse, but by reiecting the English Law &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and assuming in lieu ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the barbarous customs of the Irish. And heereupon, followed the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those foure shires, containing the greatest part of <hi>Munster,</hi> from the obedience of the Law.</p>
            <p>In like manner (saith Baron <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi>) the Lord of <hi>Tipperary</hi>) perceiuing how well the house of <hi>Desmond</hi> hadde thriued by <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Liuerie,</hi> and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Irish exactions) began to holde the like course in the Counties of <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> whereby he got great scopes of Land, specially in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> and raised many Irish exactions vpon the English Free-holders there; which made him so potent &amp; absolut among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as at that time they knew no other Lawe, then the will of their Lord.

            <p>This Lord also, in the third of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the thirde, obtained a Graunt of the like Liberty in the County of <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary;</hi> whereby he got the Lawe into his owne hands, &amp; shut out the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law and Iustice of the Realme.</p>

whereby their Houses were many times in danger of ruin, yet was there not euer any Noble house of English race in Ireland, vtterly destroyed and finally rooted out by the hand of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but the house of <hi>Desmond</hi> onely; nor any Peere of this Realme euer put to death (though diuers haue bin at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted) but <hi>Tho: Fitz-Iames</hi> the Earle of <hi>Desmond</hi> only, and onely for those wicked Customes brought in by the first Earle, and practised by his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though by seuerall Lawes they were made High-Treason.

At what time, among the meer Irishry, hee submitted himselfe to Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leger,</hi> then Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; tooke an Oath of Allegiance; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanted that he would suffer the law of England to bee executed in his Countrey; and assist the Kinges Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their Circuits: and if any Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

should be granted by Parlament, he would permit the same to be leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vppon his Tenants and followers. Which Couenants, are as straunge as the priuiledge it selfe, spoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But that which I conceiue most worthy of Obseruation, vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the house of <hi>Desmond,</hi> is this; that as <hi>Maurice Fitz-Thomas,</hi> the first Earl, did first raise the greatnes of that house, by Irish exactions and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; so <hi>Girald</hi> the last Earle, did at last ruine and reduce it to nothing, by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the like extortions.

the Crowne, and broght forth actuall and open Rebellion, wherein he perished himselfe, and made a final extinguishment of his house and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Oppression and extortion did maintain the greatnesse: and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and extortion, did extinguish the greatnesse of that house.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:9893:108"/>
he quieted the borders of the English Pale, and helde all Ireland in awe with his name and presence. The principall seruice that hee intended, was to reforme the degenerate Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Colonies, and to reduce them to obedience of the English Lawe, and Magistrate. To that end, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, he held that famous Parlament at <hi>Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> wherein many notable lawes wer enacted, which doo shew and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (<hi>For the Law doth best discouer enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>) how much the English Colonies were corrupted at that time, and doe infallibly prooue that which is laide down before; That they were wholy degenerate, and faln away from their obedience. For first, it appeareth by the Preamble of these Lawes, that the English of this Realme, before the comming ouer of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> were at that time becom meere Irish in their Language, Names, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9893:108"/>
and all their maner of liuing, and had reiected the English Lawes, and submitted themselus to the Irish, with whom they had many Mariages <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Archiu. in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro Dublin.</hi> Statutes of Kilkenny.</note> and Alliances, which tended to the vtter ruine &amp; destruction of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Therefore alliaunce by <note place="margin">C. 2.</note> Marriage, <hi>Nurture</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipred with the Irish,</hi> are by this Statute made High-treason. Againe, if anie <note place="margin">C. 3.</note> man of English race, should vse an Irish Name, Irish Language, or Irish Apparrell, or any other guise or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Irish; if he had Lands or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, the same should be seized, til he had giuen security to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, to conform himself in al points to the English maner of liuing. And if he had no Lands, his bodie was to be taken and imprisoned, til he found Sureties, as aforesaide.</p>
            <p>Againe, it was established and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <note place="margin">C. 4.</note> that the English in all their Controuersies, should bee ruled and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:9893:109"/>
gouerned by the common Lawe of England: and if any did submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the <hi>Brehon</hi> Law, or <hi>March</hi> law, he should be adiudged a Traitor.</p>
            <p>Againe, because the English at that <note place="margin">C. 10.</note> time, made warre and peace with the bordering enemy at their pleasure; they were expresly prohibited to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie warre vpon the Irish, without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall warrant and direction from the State.</p>
            <p>Againe, it was made paenall to <note place="margin">C. 12.</note> the English, to permit the Irish to Creaght or graze vpon their Landes: to present them to Ecclesiasticall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices; <note place="margin">C. 13.</note> to receiue them into any <note place="margin">C. 15.</note> Monasteries, or Religious Houses, or to entertaine any of their Minstrels, Rimers, or Newes-tellers: to impose <note place="margin">C. 17.</note> or sesse any Horse or Footvppon the English Subiects against their willes, was made felony. And because the <note place="margin">C. 22.</note> great Liberties or Franchises spoken of before, were become Sanctuaries
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:9893:109"/>
for all Malefactours, expresse power was giuen to the Kinges Sheriffes, to enter into all franchises, and there to apprehend all Fellons and Traitours. And lastly, because the great Lordes, <note place="margin">C. 24.</note> when they leuied forces for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick seruice, did lay vnequall burdens vpon the Gentlemen and Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it was ordained, that foure War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the peace in euery Countie, should set downe and appoint what men and Armour euery man should beare, according to his Free-hold, or other ability of estate.</p>
            <p>THese, and other Lawes, tending <note place="margin">The Statutes of Kilkenny, did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</note> to a generall reformation, were enacted in that Parliament. And the Execution of these Lawes, together with the <hi>Presence of the Kings Son,</hi> made a notable alteration in the State and Manners of this people, within the space of seauen yeares, which was the tearme of this Princes Lieutenancy.</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:9893:110"/>
            <p>For, all the <hi>Discourses</hi> that I haue seene of the Decay of Ireland, doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this; that the presence of the Lord <hi>Lionel,</hi> and these Statutes of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> did restore the English gouern ment, in the degenerate Colonies, for diuers yeares. And the Statute of the <note place="margin">Sta. 10. H. 7. c. 8</note> tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiueth and confirmeth the Statutes of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> doth confirme as much. For it declareth, that <hi>as long as these Lawes were put in vve and execution, this Lande continued in prosperity and honor: and since they were not executed, the Subiectes rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and digressed from their allegeance, and the Land fell to ruine and desolation.</hi> And withall, wee finde the effect of these Lawes in the Pipe-Rolles, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rolles of this Kingdome: For, from the 36. of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. when this Prince entred into his Gouernment, till the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the second his Raigne, we find the Reuennue of the Crowne both certaine and casuall in

               <hi>Vlster, Munster,</hi> and <hi>Conaght,</hi> accounted for; and that the Kings Writ did run, and the Common-Law was executed in euery of these Prouinces. I ioyne <note place="margin">The presence of the Kinges son, did much aduance the reformation.</note> with these Lawes, the personall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Kinges Son, as a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cause of this Reformation: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the people of this Land both English &amp; Irish, out of a naturall pride, did euer loue &amp; desire to be gouerned by great persons.</hi> And <note place="margin">Absence of our Kings and great English Lords, a chief cause why the Kingdom was not reduced.</note> therefore, I may heere iustly take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to note, that first the absence of the Kings of England; and nexte, the absence of those great Lords, who were inheritors of those mighty Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories of <hi>Leinster, Vlster, Conaght,</hi> and <hi>Meth,</hi> haue bin maine causes why this kingdome was not reduced in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages.</p>

               <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, King <hi>Iobn,</hi> and king <hi>Richard</hi> the second. And yet they no sooner arriued heere, but that all the Irishry, (as if they had bin but one man) submitted them-selues; tooke Oaths of fidelity, and gaue pledges &amp; hostages to continue loyall. And, if any of those Kings hadde continued heere in person a competent time, till they had setled both English &amp; Irish in their seuerall possessions, and had set the Law in a due course through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom; these times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we liue, had not gained the honor of the finall Conquest and reducing of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For the King (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>dissipat omne malum intuitu suo.</hi> But when <hi>Moses</hi> was absent in the Mount, the people committed Idolatry: &amp; when there was no king in <hi>Israel,</hi> euery man did what seemed best in his own eies.</p>
            <p>And therfore, when <hi>Alexander</hi> had conquered the East part of the world, and demaunded of one what was the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:9893:111"/>
fitest place for the seat of his Empire, he brought and laid a dry hide before him, and desired him to set his foote on the one side thereof; which being done, all the other parts of the Hide did rise vp: but when he did set his foot in the middle of the Hide, all the other parts lay flat and euen: Which was a liuely demonstration, that if a Prince keep his residence in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Dominions, the remoate parts will eafily rise and rebell against him: but if he make the Center ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his seat, he shall easily keepe them in peace and obedience.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9893:112"/>
make their personal residence in this Kingdom; but managed their estates heere, by their <hi>Seneschals and Seruants.</hi> And to defend their teritories against the bordering Irish, they entertained some of the Natiues, who pretended a perpetuall Title to those great lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships. For the Irish after a thousande Conquests &amp; Attainders by our law, would in those daies pretend title stil, because by the Irish Lawe no man could forfeit his Land. These natiues taking the opportunity in weake and desperate times, vsurped those Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories; and so <hi>Donald Mac Art Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Baron Finglas, Manuscript.</note> being entertained by the Earl of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> made himselfe Lorde of the County of <hi>Catherlogh;</hi> And <hi>Lisagh O Moore,</hi> being trusted by the L. <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who married the Daughter and Heire of the Lord <hi>Bruce,</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Lord of the Lands in <hi>Leix,</hi> in the latter end of king <hi>Edward</hi> the seconds raigne, as is before declared.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:9893:113"/>
            <p>Againe, the decay and losse of <hi>Vlster</hi> &amp; <hi>Conaght,</hi> is attributed to this; that the Lorde <hi>William Bourke,</hi> the last Earle of that name, died without issue Male; whose Ancestors, namely, the Red-Earle, and Sir <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> before him, being personally resident, helde vp their greatnesse there; &amp; kept the English in peace, and the Irish in aw: But when those Prouinces discended vppon an <hi>Heire Female,</hi> and an <hi>Infant,</hi> the Irish ouer-ran <hi>Vlster,</hi> and the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger branches of the <hi>Bourkes,</hi> vsurped <hi>Conaght.</hi> And therfore, the Ordinance <note place="margin">Archiu.

            <p>But now againe, let vs look back and see, howe long the effect of that reformation did continue, which was begun by <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> in the fortith yeare of K. <hi>Edw</hi> 3. and what
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9893:114"/>
courses haue bin held, to reduce and reforme this people by other Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Gouernors since that time</p>
            <p>The English Colonies beeing in some good measure reformed by the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> did not vtterly fal away into Barbarisme againe, till the warres of the two Houses had almost destroyed both these Kingdoms; for in that miserable time, the Irish found opportunity, without opposition, to banish the English Law and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of all the Prouinces, and to confine it onely to the English Pale: Howbeit, in the mean time, between the Gouernment of the Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and the beginning of those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Warres of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> we finde that the State of <hi>England</hi> did sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times resolue to proceede in this worke of reformation.</p>
            <p>For first, King <hi>Richard</hi> 2. sent ouer <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended by K. <hi>Richard</hi> 2</note> 
               <hi>Sir Nicholas Dagworth,</hi> to suruey the possessions of the Crowne; &amp; to call

to accompt the Officers of the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; <note place="margin">Archiu. Turr. 3 Rich. 2. cl. m 3.</note> Next (to draw his English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to manure &amp; defend their lands in <hi>Ireland</hi>) he made that Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">3. Rich. 12. Rot. Parliam. 11. 42</note> Absentees, spoken of before. Again, he shewed an excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iustice, vppon Sir <hi>Phillip Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">9.

            <p>After this, the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did resolue, that <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <note place="margin">Walsingham in Rich. 2. 349. a.</note> 
               <hi>Glocester</hi> the Kings Vnkle, should bee employed in the reformation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of that Kingdome: the Fame wherof, was no sooner bruted in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but all the Irishry were readie to submit them-selues before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: so much the very Name of a great personage, specially of a Prince
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:9893:115"/>
of the blood, did euer preuayle with this people. But the King and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who were euer iealous of this Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> wold not suffer him to haue the honor of that seruice. But the King himselfe thought it a worke worthy of his own presence &amp; pains: and thereuppon, Himselfe in person, made those two royall iournies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before: At what time, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the submissions of all the Irish Lordes and Captaines, who bounde themselues both by Indenture &amp; oath to become and continue his Loyall Subiects. And withall, laid a perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proiect, for a ciuill plantation of the Mountains and Maritime Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, betweene <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>wexford;</hi> by remoouing all the Irish Septes from thence, as apeareth by the couenants betweene the Earle Marshall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and those Irish Septs: which are before remembred, and are yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, and remaine of Record in the

Hillar. 18 Ric. 2</note> of the Kings Bench in England, by K. <hi>Henry</hi> 4.) and did withall, asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate vnto him, <hi>william Sturmy,</hi> a well Learned man in the Law; who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise came out of England with the K. that the legal proceedings (which wer out of order too, as all other things in that Realme were) might be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and made formall, according to the course and Presidents of <hi>England.</hi> But all the good purposes &amp; proiects of this King, were interrupted and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated, by his sodaine depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Ireland, and vnhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9893:116"/>
from the Crowne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>HOwbeit, King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended by Hen. 4.</note> intending likewise to prosecute this Noble worke in the third yeare of his raigne, made the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> his second sonne, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Who came ouer in person, and accepted againe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of diuers Irish Lords &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, as is before remembred; and held also a Parliament, wherein hee gaue newe life to the Statutes of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> and made other good Lawes tending to the Reformation of the Kingdome. But the troubles raysed against the King his Father in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, drew him home again so soon, as that seed of reformation, tooke no roote at all; neither had his seruice in that kinde, any good effect or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
            <p>After this, the State of England
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9893:116"/>
had no leisure to thinke of a generall reformation in this Realme, till the ciuill dissentions of England were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and the peace of that kingdom setled, by K. <hi>Henry</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>For, albeit in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> 6. <hi>Richard</hi> duke of <hi>York,</hi> a Prince of the blood; of great wisedome and valour, and heir to a third part of the Kingdome at least, being Earle of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Conaght</hi> and <hi>Meth,</hi> was sent the Kinges Lieutenant into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to recouer and reforme that Realme where he was resident in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the greatest part of 10. yeares, yet the troth is, he aymed at another marke, which was the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And therefore, he thought it no pollicy to distast either the English or Irish, by a course of reformation, but sought by all meanes to please them, and by popular courses to steale away their hearts, to the end, hee might strengthen his party, when he should
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9893:117"/>
set on foot his Title (as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.) Which policy of his tooke such effect, as that he drew ouer with him into England, the Flower of all the English Colonies, specially of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>Meth,</hi> whereof many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen were slain with him at <hi>wakefield</hi> (as is likewise before remembred.) And after his Death, when the warres between the Houses were in their heat, almost al the good English bloud which was left in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was spent in those ciuill dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: so as the Irish became victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ouer all, <hi>without Bloud, or Sweat.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that little Canton of Lande, called the English Pale, containing 4. small Shires, did maintain a bordering war with the Irish, and retaine the forme of English Gouernment.</p>
            <p>But out of that little Precinct, there were no Lordes, Knights, or Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, summoned to the Parliament; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Kings Writt run in anie
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:9893:117"/>
other part of the kingdome: and yet vpon the Marches &amp; Borders, which at that time were growne so large, as they tooke vp halfe <hi>Dublin,</hi> half <hi>Meth,</hi> and a third part of <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Lowth;</hi> there was no law in vse, but the <hi>March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lawe,</hi> which in the Statutes of <hi>Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> is said to be no Law, but a leud Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>
            <p>So, as vpon the end of these ciuill warres in <hi>England,</hi> the English Law &amp; Gouernment was well banisht out of Ireland, so as no foot-steppe or print was left, of any former Reformation.</p>
            <p>THen did King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. send ouer <note place="margin">The course of Reformation held by Sir Edward Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in the time of k. H. 7.</note> Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> to be his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, a right worthy seruitor both in war and peace. The principall end of his employment, was to expel <hi>Perkin warbecke</hi> out of this kingdome; but that seruice beeing perfourmed, that worthy Deputy finding nothing but a common misery, tooke the best

course he possibly could, to establish a Common-wealth in Ireland: and to that end, he held a Parliament no lesse famous, then that of <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and more auaileable for the reformation of the whole Kingdome. For whereas all wise men did euer concur in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the readiest way to reform Ireland, is to settle a forme of Ciuill Gouernment there, conformable to that of <hi>England:</hi> To bring this to passe, Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> did passe an Acte, whereby all the Statutes made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before that time, were enacted, established, and made of force in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Neither did he only respect the time past, but prouided also for the time to come. For, he caused another Law to be made, that no Act should be propounded in any Parliament of Ireland, but such as should bee first transmitted into England, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the King and Counsell there, <note place="margin">Poynings Act</note> as good and expedient for that Land,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:9893:118"/>
and so returned backe againe, vnder the Great Seale of England. This Act, though it seeme <hi>Prima facie</hi> to restrain the liberty of the subiects of Ireland; yet was it made at the Prayer of the Commons, vpon iust and important cause.</p>
            <p>For the Gouernors of that realm, specially such as were of that Contry Birth, had layd many oppressions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Commons: and amongst the rest, they had imposed Lawes vppon them, not tending to the generall good, but to serue priuate turnes, and to strengthen their particular facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This moued them to referre all Lawes, that were to be passed in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be considered, corrected, and allowed, first by the State of <hi>England,</hi> which had alwaies bin tender &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the good of this people, and had long since made them a Ciuill, Rich, and Happy Nation, if their own Lords and Gouernors there, had not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9893:119"/>
sent bad intelligence into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Besides this, he took special or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the summons of Parliament should go into all the shires of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to the foure shires only; and for that cause specially, hee caused all the Acts of a Parliament, lately before holden by the <hi>Viscount of Gormanston</hi> to be repealed and made voide. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that the Parliamentes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> might want no desent or honorable forme that was vsed in <hi>England,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a particular Act to passe, that the Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> should appeare in the like Parliament Robes, as the English Lords are wont to weare in the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments of England.</hi> Hauing thus establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all the statutes of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and set in order the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of that Realme, he did not omit to passe other Lawes, aswell for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Kings Reuennue, as the preseruation of the publick peace.</p>
            <p>To aduaunce the profites of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:9893:119"/>
Crown; First he obtained a subsidy of 26. s. 8. d. out of euery sixe score Acres manured, payable yearely for 5. years. Next, he resumed al the Crown land, which had been aliened (for the most part) by <hi>Richard Duke of Yorke:</hi> &amp; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he procured a subsidy of <hi>Pondage,</hi> out of all Merchandizes imported &amp; exported, to be granted to the Crown in perpetuity.</p>
            <p>To preserue the publicke peace, he reuiued the statutes of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> He made wilfull murther High-Treason; he caused the Marchers to book their men for whom they should answere; and restrained the making Warre or peace, without speciall Commission from the State.</p>
            <p>These Lawes, and others as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as these, for the making of a commonwealth in Ireland, wer made in the Gouernment of <hi>Sir Edward Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi> But these Lawes did not spread their Vertue beyonde the English
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:9893:120"/>
Pale, though they were made gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the whole <hi>Kingdome.</hi> For the <hi>Prouinces</hi> without the <hi>Pale,</hi> which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the warre of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> had wholly cast off the English Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, were not apt to receyue this seed of reformation, because they were not first broken and maistered againe with the sword. Besides, the <hi>Irish Countreyes,</hi> which contained two third parts of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> were not reduced to Shire-Ground, so as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be put in execution. Therefore, these good Laws &amp; prouisions made by <hi>Sir Edward Poynings,</hi> were like good Lessons set for a Lute, that is broken and out of tune; of which Lessons, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vse can be made, till the Lute bee made fit to be plaid vpon.</p>
            <p>And that the execution of al these <hi>Lawes,</hi> had no greater Latitude then the <hi>Pale,</hi> is manifest by the Statute of 13. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. c. 3. which reciteth, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9893:120"/>
at that time, the <hi>Kings</hi> Lawes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and executed in the four shires onely; and yet then was the <hi>Earle of Surrey Lieutenant of Ireland,</hi> a Gouernor much feared of the Kings Enemies, and exceedingly honored and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Kings subiects. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions giuen by the state of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <note place="margin">The Counsell Booke of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. 16.

Whereupon, grew that By-word vsed by the Irish, (viz:) <hi>That they dwelt By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west the Law, which dwelt beyond the Riuer of the Barrow,</hi> which is within 30. Miles of <hi>Dublin.</hi> The same is testified by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Finglas,</hi> in his <hi>Discourse of the decay of Ireland,</hi> which hee wrote about the 20. yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8.

            </p>
            <p>This preparation being made, he first propounded and passed in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment these Lawes, which made the great alteration in the State <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi> Namely, the <hi>Act</hi> which declared King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight to bee supreame Head of the Church of Ireland.

twentith part to be paid to the King: the <hi>Act</hi> for Faculties and Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And lastly, the <hi>Act</hi> that did vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abolish the vsurped Authoritie of the Pope. Next, for the encrease of the Kings Reuennew: By one Act, he suppressed sundry Abbeyes and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houses; and by another Acte, resumed the Lands of the Absentees, (as is before remembred.)</p>
            <p>And for the Ciuill Gouernment, a speciall Statute was made, to abolish the Black-Rents and tributes, exacted by the Irish, vpon the English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and another Law enacted, that the English Apparrell, Language, &amp; manner of liuing, should bee vsed by all such, as would acknoledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the Kings Subiects. This Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ended, the Lord <hi>Leonard Gray,</hi> was suddenly reuokt, and put to death in England, so as hee liued not to finish the woorke of Reformation which he had begun: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,

Archbishops and Bishops should bee permitted to exercise their Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in euery Diocesse throughout the Land: that tithes should be duely set out, and paide: that Children should not be admitted to Benefices: that for euery Manslaughter, and theft aboue 14 d: committed in the Irish Contries, the offender shold pay a fine of 40. li. twenty pound to the King, and 20. li. to the Captaine of the Country; and for euery thefte vnder 14. d. a fine of fiue markes should be paid, 46. s. viij. d to the Captaine, and 20. s. to the <hi>Tani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi> That Horsemen and <hi>Kearn</hi> shold not be imposed vppon the Common people, to beefed and maintained by them: That the Maister shold answer for his seruants, and the Father for his Children. That <hi>Cuttinges</hi> should not be made by the Lorde vppon his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, to maintaine war with his nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbors, but only to beare his necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expences, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:9893:124"/>
            <p>These ordinances of state being made and published, there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and appointed in euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, certaine Orderers or Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who instead of these Irish <hi>Erehons,</hi> should heare and determine all their Controuersies. In <hi>Conaght,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Clonfert,</hi> Captaine <hi>wakeley,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Ouing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> In <hi>Munster,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>VVater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Corke</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> the Maior of <hi>Corke,</hi> and Maior of <hi>Yough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> In <hi>Vlster,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> &amp; the Lord of <hi>Lowth.</hi> And if any difference did arise, which they could not end, either for the difficultie of the cause, or for the obstinacy of the parties, they were to certifie the Lord Deputy and Counsell, who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the matter by their authority.</p>
            <p>Heereuppon, the Irish Captaines of lesser Territories, which had euer bin oppressed by the greater &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier; some, with Risings out; others,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:9893:124"/>
with <hi>Bonaght,</hi> and others, with <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> and spendings at pleasure, did appeale for Iustice to the Lorde De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty; who vpon hearing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, did alwayes order, that they should all imediatly depend vpon the King; and that the weaker should haue no dependancy vpon the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he preuailed so much with the greatest of them; Namely, <hi>O Neale, O Brien,</hi> and <hi>Mac william,</hi> as that they willingly did passe into <hi>England</hi> and presented themselus to the king, who thereuppon was pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance them to the degree and honor of Earles, &amp; to grant vnto them their seuerall Contries, by Letters patents. Besides, that they might learne Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Ciuility of maners, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repairing vnto the State, the K. vpon the motion of the same Deputy, gaue each of them a house and Lands neere <hi>Dublin,</hi> for the entertainement
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9893:125"/>
of their seuerall traines.</p>
            <p>This course, did this Gouernour take to reforme the Irishry; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he did not omit to aduance both the honor and profit of the King. For in the Parliament which he helde the 33. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. hee caused an Acte to passe, which gaue vnto K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his heyres and successors, the name, stile, and Title of <hi>King</hi> of Ireland; whereas before that time, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were stiled but Lords of <hi>Ireland:</hi> albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it indeed, they were absolute <hi>Monarks</hi> thereof, and had in right all Royall &amp; Imperial Iurisdiction &amp; power there, as they had in the Realm of England. And yet because in the vulgar conceit the name of <hi>King,</hi> is higher then the name of Lorde. Assuredly, the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this title, hath not a litle ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the soueraignty of the K. of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the minds of this people. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this Deputy brought a great aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to the <hi>Kings</hi> Reuenue, by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9893:125"/>
dissoluing of all the Monasteries and Religious Houses in Ireland, which was done in the same Parliament: &amp; afterward, by procuring <hi>Min</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendish,</hi> two skilfull Auditours, to bee sent ouer out of England. Who tooke an exact suruey of all the possessions of the Crowne, and brought manie things into charge, which had beene concealed and substracted for manie years before. And thus far did Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Saint-Leger</hi> proceed, in the course of Reformation; which though it wer a good beginning, yet was it far from reducing Ireland to the perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Crown of England. For all this while, the Prouinces of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> and <hi>Vlster,</hi> and a good parte of <hi>Leinster,</hi> were not reduced to Shire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ground. And though <hi>Mounster</hi> were anciently diuided into Counties, the people were so degenerate, as no Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Assise, durst execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission amongst them. None of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:9893:126"/>
Irish Lords or Tenants were setled in their possessions, by any Graunt or Confirmation from the Crowne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the three great Earles before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; who notwithstanding, did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern their Tenants and Followers, by the Irish or <hi>Brehon</hi> Law; so as no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, murther, rape, or theft, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in those Countries, was inquired of, or punisht by the Law of England; and consequently, no Escheat, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, or Fine; no Reuenue (certain or casuall) did acrew to the Crowne out of those Prouinces.</p>
            <p>The next worthy Gouernor that <note place="margin">The course of Reformation prosecuted by Thomas Earl of Sussex, in the time of Q. <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </note> endeuoured to aduaunce this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of Sussex; who hauing throughly broken and subdued the two most rebellious and powerful Irish Septs in <hi>Leinster;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Moores</hi> &amp; <hi>O Connors,</hi> possessing <note place="margin">Leix &amp; Offa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made two Counties, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Phil. &amp; Mariae.</hi>
               </note> the territories of <hi>Leix</hi> &amp; <hi>Offaly,</hi> did by Act of Parliament, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Phil. &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> reduce those Countries into two
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9893:126"/>
seuerall Counties; naming the one, the <hi>Kinges;</hi> and the other, the <hi>Queenes</hi> County; which were the first two Counties that had beene made in this Kingdome, since the twelfth yeare of King <hi>Iohn;</hi> at what time the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possessed by the English Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, were reduced into 12. Shires, as is before expressed.</p>
            <p>This Noble Earle, hauing thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Iurisdiction of the English Lawe into two Counties more, was not satisfied with that addition, but took a resolution to diuide all the rest of the Irish Countries vnreduced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seuerall Shires; and to that end, he caused an Act to passe in the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, authorising the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, from time to time, to award Commissions to such persons, as the Lord Deputy should nominate and appoint, to viewe, and perambulate those Irish territories; and thereupon, to diuide and limit the same into such
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:9893:127"/>
and so many seuerall Counties as they should thinke meete; which beeing certified to the Lord Deputy, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by him, should bee returned and enrolled in the Chancery, and from thenceforth be of like force and effect, as if it were doone by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Earle of <hi>Sussex</hi> lay open a passage for the Ciuill gouernment into the vnreformed partes of this Kingdome, but himselfe proceeded no further then is before declared.</p>
            <p>HOwbeit afterwardes, during the <note place="margin">The course of Reformation followed by Sir <hi>Henry Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> in the time of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </note> raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sidney,</hi> (who hath left behinde him many Monuments of a good Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this Land) did not onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that course which the Earle of Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex began, in reducing the Irish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries into Shires, and placing therein Sheriffes, and other Ministers of the Law; (for first hee made the <hi>Annaly</hi> a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:9893:127"/>
Territory in <hi>Leynster,</hi> possessed by the Sept of <hi>Offerralles,</hi> one entire Shire by it selfe, and called it the County of <hi>Longford;</hi> and after that he diuided the whole Prouince of <hi>Conaght</hi> into sixe Counties more; namely, <hi>Clare</hi> (which containeth all <hi>Thomond</hi>) <hi>Gallaway, Sligo, Mayo, Roscomon,</hi> and <hi>Leytrim:</hi>) But he also had caused diuers good Lawes to be made, &amp; performed sundry other seruices, tending greatly to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Kingdome. For first, to diminish the greatnesse of the Irish Lordes, and to take from them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy of the Common people, in the Parliament which he held 11. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Hee did abolish their pretended and vsurped Captain-ships, and all exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and extortions incident thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Next, to settle their Seigniories &amp; possessions in a course of Inheritance, according to the course of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, he caused an Act to passe, whereby the Lord Deputy was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:9893:128"/>
to accept their Surrenders, and to re-grant estates vnto them, to hold of the Crown by English tenures and seruices. Againe, because the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or sort were loose and poore, and not amesnable to the Law; hee prouided by another Act, that fiue of the best &amp; eldest persons of euery Sept, should bring in all the idle persons of their sur-name, to be iustified by the Law. Moreouer, to giue a ciuill education to the Youth of this Land in the time to come, prouision was made by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Law, that there should bee one Free-schoole, at least, erected in euery Diocesse of the Kingdom. And lastly, to invre and acquaint the people of <hi>Mounster</hi> and <hi>Conaght,</hi> with the English Gouernment againe (which had not been in vse among them, for the space of 200. yeares before:) hee instituted two Presidency Courtes in those two Prouinces, placing Sir <hi>Edward Fitton</hi> in <hi>Conaght,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> in <hi>Mounster.</hi>

            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:9893:128"/>
            <p>To augment the Kings Reuennew in the same Parliament, vppon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of <hi>Shane O Neale,</hi> hee resumed &amp; vested in the Crowne, more then halfe the Prouince of <hi>Vlster:</hi> He raised the Customes vpon the principall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the Kingdome: He refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the abuses of the Exchequer, by many good orders and instructions sent out of <hi>England;</hi> and lastly, he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the composition of the <hi>Pale,</hi> in liewe of Purueyance and Sesse of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>These were good proceedinges in the worke of Reformation, but there were many defects &amp; omissions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for though he reduced all <hi>Conaght</hi> into Counties, he neuer sent any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Assize to visite that Prouince, but placed Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners there, who gouerned it onely in <hi>A course of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> part Martiall, and part Ciuill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in the Law that dooth abolish the Irish Captain-ships, he gaue waie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9893:129"/>
for the reuiuing thereof againe, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting such, as should be granted by Letters Patentes from the Crowne; which exception did indeede take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the force of that Law. For no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour during Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raign, did refuse to grant any of those Captain-ships, to any pretended <hi>Irish</hi> Lord, who would <hi>Desire,</hi> and with his thankefulnesse <hi>Deserue</hi> the same. And againe, though the greatest part of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> were vested by Act of Parliament, in the actuall and reall possession of the Crowne; yet was there neuer any seisure made thereof, nor any part thereof brought into charge, but the Irish were permitted to take all the profits, without rendering any dutie or acknowledgement for the same; and though the Name of <hi>O Neale</hi> were damned by that act, and the assuming thereof made High-treason; yet after that, was <hi>Tirlagh Leynnagh</hi> suffered to beare that Title, and to intrude vpon
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:9893:129"/>
the possessions of the Crown, and yet was often entertained by the State with fauour. Neither were these lands resumed, by the Act of 11. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> neglected onely (for the Abbaies and religious Houses in <hi>Tirone, Tirconnell,</hi> and <hi>Fermannagh,</hi> though they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued in the 33. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer surueied nor reduced into charge, but were continually possest by the religious persons) vntill his Maiestie that now is came to the Crowne: and that which is more stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Byshopprickes, being a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Crowne (which the Kings of England did euer retaine in all their Dominions, when the Popes vsurped Authority was at the highest.) There were three Bishopprickes in <hi>Vlster;</hi> namely, <hi>Derry, Rapho,</hi> and <hi>Clogher,</hi> which neither Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor any of her Progenitors did euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow, though they were the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Patrons thereof. So as King <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:9893:130"/>
was the first king of England that did euer supply those Sees with Byshops, which is an argument eyther of great negligence, or of great weaknesse in the State and Gouernours of those times. And thus farre proceeded Sir <hi>Henry Sidney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFter him, Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> who held <note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced by Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot.</hi>
               </note> the last Parliament in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did aduance the <hi>Reformation</hi> in three principall points. First, in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the great composition of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght;</hi> in which seruice the wisedome and industry of <hi>Sir Richard Bingham</hi> did concurre with him: next, in reducing the vnreformed partes of <hi>Vlster</hi> into seauen shires; namely, <hi>Ardmagh, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahan, Tirone, Coleraine, Deuegall, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannagh, &amp; Cauan;</hi> though in his time the Law was neuer executed in these new Counties by any Sheriffes or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Assize, but the people left to be ruled still by their own barbarous
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:9893:130"/>
               <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Lawes:</hi> And lastly, by vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Crowne, the Lands of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and his Adherents in <hi>Mounster,</hi> and planting the same with English, though that plantation were imperfect in many points.</p>
            <p>AFter <hi>Sir Iohn Perrot, Sir william Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>williams</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Seruice of <hi>William Fitz Williams,</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> did good seruice in two other points. First, in raising a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in <hi>Mounster;</hi> and then, in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the possessions both of the Lords and Tenantes in <hi>Monahan,</hi> which was one of the last Acts of State, tending to the reformation of the Ciuill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment that was performed in the raigne of Queene ELIZABETH.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, by what degrees, &amp; what pollicy and successe the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of this Land from time to time, since the beginning of the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3. haue endeuored to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and reduce this people to the perfect obedience of the Crowne of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:9893:131"/>
               <hi>England:</hi> And we find, that before the Ciuill Warres of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> they did chiefely endeuour to bring backe the degenerate English Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to their Duty and Allegeaunce, not respecting the meer Irish, whom they reputed as Aliens or Enemies of the Crowne. But after King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. had vnited the Roses, they labored to reduce both English and Irish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which worke, to what passe and perfection it was brought in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raign, hath bin before declared.</p>
            <p>Whereof sometimes when I doe consider, I do in mine owne conceit compare these later Gouernors, who went about to reforme the Ciuill Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> vnto some of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom it is saide; That they were good <hi>Kings,</hi> but they did not cut downe the Groues and High places, but suffered the people still to burne Incense, &amp; commit Idolatry in them:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9893:131"/>
so Sir <hi>Anthony Saint-Leger,</hi> the Earle of Sussex, sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> &amp; sir <hi>Iohn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot,</hi> were good Gouernours, but they did not abolish the Irish Customes, nor execute the Lawe in the Irish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but suffered the people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship their barbarous Lordes, and to remaine vtterly ignorant of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God and the King.</p>
            <p>AND now am I come to the happy <note place="margin">How the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects &amp; errors in the gouern ment of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, haue bin supplied and amended since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Maiesties Raigne.</note> raigne of my most Gracious Lord &amp; Maister K. <hi>Iames;</hi> in whose time, as <hi>there hath been a concurrence of many great Felicities:</hi> so this among others may be numbred in the first ranke; that all the Defects in the Gouernment of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> spoken of before, haue beene ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supplied in the first nine yeares of his raigne. In which time, there hath bin more done in the worke &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this <hi>Kingdome;</hi> then, in the 440. yeares which are past since the Conquest was first attempted.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:9893:132"/>
            <p>Howbeit, I haue no purpose in this Discourse, to set forth at large all the proceedings of the State heere in reforming of this Kingdom, since his Maiesty came to the Crowne, for the parts and passages thereof are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as to expresse them fully, woulde require a seuerall Treatise. Besides, I for my part, since I haue not flattered the former times, but haue plainely laid open the negligence and errors of euery Age that is past, woulde not willingly seeme to flatter the present, by amplifying the diligence and true Iudgement of those Seruitours, that haue laboured in this Vineyard since the beginning of his Maiesties happy raigne.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore summarily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any amplication at all, shewe in what manner, and by what degrees, all the defects which I haue noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Gouernment of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> haue bin supplied since his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9893:132"/>
happy raigne beganne; and so conclude these obseruations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the State of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FIrst then, touching the Martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, <note place="margin">Errors in the carriage of the martiall affaires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> I shall neede to say little, in regard that the Warre which finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was ended almost in the instant when the crown descended vpon his Maiesty; and so there remained no occasion to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the former errors committed in the prosecution of the warre. Howbeit, sithence his Maiesty hath still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Army heere, aswell <hi>For a Seminary of Martiall Men;</hi> as to <hi>Giue strength and countenance to the Ciuil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;</hi> I may iustly obserue, that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath not bin fed with <hi>Coigne &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,</hi> or <hi>Sesse</hi> (with which Extortions the souldier hath bin norished in the times of former Princes) but hath <hi>bin as iustly and royally paid, as euer Prince in the world did pay his Men of war.</hi> Besides,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:9893:133"/>
when there did arise an occasion of employment for this army against the Rebell <hi>Odoghertie;</hi> neither did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty delay the re-inforcing thereof, but instantly sent supplies out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> neither did the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall men dally or prosecute the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice faintly, but <hi>Did foorthwith quench that fire, whereby themselues would haue bin the warmer</hi> the longer it had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aswell by the encrease of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as by booties and spoile of the Countrey. And thus much I thought fit to note, touching the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the Errors in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires.</p>
            <p>SEcondly, for the supply of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects <note place="margin">How the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue bin supplied.</note> in the ciuil Gouernment, these courses haue beene pursued since his Maiesties prosperous raigne began.</p>
            <p>First, albeit vpon the end of the war, whereby <hi>Tyrones</hi> vniuersall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion <note place="margin">1. By establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke peace.</note> was supprest, the minds of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:9893:133"/>
people were broken and prepared to Obedience of the Law; yet the <hi>State</hi> vpon good reason, did conceiue, that the publicke peace could not be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, till the hearts of the people were also quieted, by securing them from the danger of the law, which the most part of them had incurred one way or other, in that great and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, first by a generall Act of State, called the <hi>Act of Obliuion,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Proclamation</hi> vnder the great Seale; Al offences against the Crown, and all perticuler Trespasses between subiect and subiect, done at any time before his Maiesties raigne, were (to all such as would come in to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Assise by a certaine day, and claime the benefit of this Act) pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, remitted, and vtterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, neuer to be reuiued or called in question. And by the same proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the Irishry (who for the most
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:9893:134"/>
part, in former times, were left vnder the tiranny of their Lords and Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, and had no defence or Iustice from the Crowne) were receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maiesties <hi>imediate protection.</hi> This bred such comfort and security in the hearts of all men, as thereupon ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the calmest, and most vniuersall peace, that euer was seen in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The publicke peace beeing thus <note place="margin">2. By establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Iustice in euery part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> established, the State proceeded next to establish the publick Iustice in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Realm: And to that end, Sir <hi>George Cary</hi> (who was a prudent Gouernor, and a iust, and made a fair entry into the right way of reforming this Kingdome) did in the first yeare of his Maiesties raigne, make the first Sheriffes that euer were made in <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> and <hi>Tirconnell;</hi> and shortly after, sent Sir <hi>Edmund Pelham</hi> Chiefe <hi>Baron,</hi> &amp; my selfe thither, the first Iustices of Assise that euer sat in those <hi>Countries:</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:9893:134"/>
and in that Circuit, wee visited all the shires of that Prouince: Besides which visitation, though it were some-what distastfull to the Irish lords, was sweet and most welcome to the Common people; who, albeit they were rude &amp; barbarous, yet did they quickely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the difference betweene the tiranny and oppression vnder which they liued before, &amp; the iust gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and protection which wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the time to come.</p>
            <p>The Lawe hauing made her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse into <hi>Vlster</hi> with so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, sir <hi>Arthur Chichester</hi> (who with singular Industry, Wisedome, and Courage, hath now for the space of 7. years and more, prosecuted the great worke of Reformation, and brought it well-neere to an absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) did in the first year of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, establish two other <hi>Newe</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits for Iustices of Assise; the one in <hi>Conaght,</hi> and the other in <hi>Mounster.</hi> I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:9893:135"/>
call them <hi>New</hi> Circuites, for that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee manifest by manie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes, that <hi>Iustices Itinerant</hi> haue in former times beene sent into all the shires of <hi>Mounster,</hi> &amp; some part of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght;</hi> yet certaine it is, that in 200. yeares before (I speake much within compasse) no such Commission had bin executed in either of these 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. But now, the whole Realme being diuided into <hi>Shires,</hi> and euerie bordering Territory, whereof anie doubt was made in what County the same should ly, being added or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a County certaine (among the rest, the <hi>Mountaines</hi> and <hi>Glynnes</hi> on the South side of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wer lately made a Shire by it self, and called the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>wicklow;</hi> wherby the Inhabitants which were wont to be Thorns in the side of the <hi>Pale,</hi> are become ciuill and quiet Neighbors thereof,) the streams of the publicke Iustice were deriued into euery part of the Kingdome; and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:9893:135"/>
the benefit and protection of the law of England communicated to all, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Irish as English, without distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or respect of persons; By reason whereof, the worke of deriuing the publick Iustice, grew so great, as that there was <hi>Magna messis, sed Operarij pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.</hi> And therefore, the number of the Iudges in euery Bench was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which do now euery halfe yeare (like good <hi>Plannets</hi> in their seuerall <hi>spheares</hi> or <hi>Circles</hi>) carry the light and influence of Iustice, round about the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> whereas the Circuits in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, went but round about the <hi>Pale,</hi> like the Circuit of the <hi>Cinosura</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Pole.</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>Quae cursu niteriore, breui conuertitur orbe.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>VPon these Visitations of Iustice, <note place="margin">The good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which followed the execution of the law tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the Kingdome.</note> whereby the iust and honourable Law of England was imparted and communicated to al the Irishry, there followed these excellent good effects.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:9893:136"/>
            <p>First, the Common people were taught by the Iustices of Assise, that they were free subiects to the Kings of England, and not slaues &amp; vassals to their pretended Lords: That the <hi>Cuttings, Cosheries, Sessings,</hi> and other Extortions of their Lords, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and that they should not any more submit them-selues thereunto, since they were now vnder the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of so iust and mighty a Prince, as both wold and could protect them from all wrongs &amp; oppressions: They gaue a willing eare vnto these lessons; and thereupon, the greatnesse &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of those Irish Lords ouer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so dainly fell and vanished, when their Oppressions and Extortions were taken away which did maintain their greatnesse: Insomuch, as diuers of them, who formerly made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Owners of al (by Force;) were now by the law reduced to this point; That wanting meanes to defray their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:9893:136"/>
ordinary charges, they resorted ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to the Lord Deputy, and made petition, that by License and warrant of the State, they might take some aid and contribution from their people; aswel to discharge their former debts, as for competent maintenance in time to come: But some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient of this diminution, fled out of the Realme to forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Whereupon, we may well Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue; That, <hi>as Extortion did banish the old English Free-holder, who could not liue but vnder the Law; So the Law did bannish the Irish Lord, who could not liue but by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, these Circuits of Iustice, did (vpon the end of the warre) more terrifie the loose and ydle personnes, then the execution of the martial law, though it were more quicke and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: and in a short time after, did so cleare the Kingdome of Theeues, &amp; other Capitall Offenders, as I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:9893:137"/>
that for the space of fiue yeares last past, there haue not bin found so many Malefactors worthy of death in al the six Circuits of this realm (which is now diuided into 32. shires at large) as in one Circuit of six Shires; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Westerne Circuit in England. For the troth is, that in time of peace, the Irish are more fearefull to offend the Law, then the English, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage that the Irish had of vs in all their Rebellions, was, <hi>Our Ignorance of their Countries, their Persons, and their Actions:</hi> Since the Law and her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters haue had a passage among them, all their places of Fastnesse haue been discouered and laide open; all their paces cleard; &amp; notice taken of euery person that is able to do either good or hurt. It is knowne, not only how they liue, and what they doe, but it is foreseen what they purpose or intend
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:9893:137"/>
to do: Insomuch, as <hi>Tirone</hi> hath been heard to complaine, that he hadde so many eyes watching ouer him, as he coulde not drinke a full Carouse of Sacke, but the State was aduertised thereof, within few houres after. And therefore, those allowances which I finde in the ancient Pipe-Rolles, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidagio, &amp; spiagio,</hi> may be well spared at this day. For the Vnder-Sheriffes and Bayliffes errant, are better guides and Spies in the time of peace, then any were found in the time of war.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, these ciuil assemblies at Assises and Sessions, haue reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Irish from their wildenesse, caused them to cut off their Glibs and long Haire; to conuert their Mantles into Cloaks; to conform themselues to the maner of <hi>England</hi> in al their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and outward formes. And because they find a great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in mouing their suites by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter; they do for the most part
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:9893:138"/>
send their Children to Schools, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to learne the English language: so as we may conceiue an hope, that the next generation, will in tongue &amp; heart, and euery way else, becom <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;</hi> so as there will bee no difference or distinction, but the Irish Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs. And thus we see a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, &amp; the <hi>Irish Game turned againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For heeretofore, the neglect of the Lawe, made the English degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and become Jrish; and now, on the other side, the execution of the Law, doth make the Irish grow ciuil, and become English.</p>
            <p>Lastly, these generall Sessions now, do teach the people more obedience, and keep them more in awe then did the general hostings in former times. These Progresses of the Law, renew and confirme the Conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> euery halfe yeare, and supply the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the kings absence in euery part of the Realme; In that euery Iudge sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:9893:138"/>
in the seat of Iustice, dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the person of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>These effectes, hath the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publicke <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> produced, since his Maiesties happie Raigne began.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, it was impossible to <note place="margin">3. The setling of the States and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishry, aswelas of the English</note> make a Common-weale in Ireland, without performing another seruice; which was, the setling of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and possessions, aswell of Irish, as English, thoroughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>For, although that in the 12. year of Queen ELIZABETH, a special Law was made, which did enable the Lord Deputy to take surrenders, &amp; regrant Estates vnto the Irishry (vpon signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her Maiesties pleasure in that behalfe;) yet were there but few of the Irish Lords that made offer to surrender during her raigne: &amp; they which made surrenders of entire
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:9893:139"/>
Countries, obtained Graunts of the whole againe to themselues only, &amp; to no other, and all in demesne. In passing of which Graunts, there was no care taken of the inferiour Septes of people, inhabiting and possessing these Countries vnder them, but they held their seuerall portions in course of Tanistry and Gauelkind, and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the same Irish Duties or exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they did before: So that vpon euery such Surrender &amp; Grant, there was but one Free-holder made in a whole Country, which was the Lord himselfe; al the rest were but tenants at Wil, or rather tenants in villenage, and were neither fit to be sworne in Iuries, nor to performe any publicke seruice: And by reason of the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of their Estates, did vtterly neglect to build, or to plant, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Land. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lorde were become the Kings Tenant, his Countrey was no
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:9893:139"/>
whit reformed thereby, but remained in the former Barbarisme and Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the same Queens time, there were many Irish Lordes which did not surrender, yet obtained Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of the Captaine-ships of their Countries, &amp; of all Lands &amp; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to those Captainships: For the Statute which doth condemn &amp; abolish these Captain-ries, vsurped by the Irish, doth giue power to the Lorde Deputy to graunt the same by Letters pattents. Howbeit, these Irish Captaines, and likewise the English, which were made Seneschalles of the Irish countries, did by colour of these Grants, and vnder pretence of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, claime an Irish Seigniory, and exercise plaine tiranny ouer the Common people. And this was the fruite that did arise of the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, granted of the Irish Contries in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where before
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:9893:140"/>
they did extort &amp; oppresse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, only by colour of a leud and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Custom; they did afterwards vse the same Extortions and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by warrant, vnder the great seal of the Realme.</p>
            <p>But now, since his Maiesty came <note place="margin">How the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions for Surrenders, and defectiue Titles, haue bin put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</note> to the Crown, two speciall Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions haue bin sent out of England, for the setling and quieting of all the possessions in Ireland; The one, for accepting Surrenders of the Irish and degenerate English, and for regran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Estates vnto them, according to the course of the Common Law; The other, for strengthening of defectiue Titles. In the Execution of which Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, there hath euer bin had a speciall care, to settle and secure the Vnder-Tennants; to the end, there might be a repose and establishment of euery Subiects Estate; Lord &amp; Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Free-holder and Farmer, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the Kingdome.</p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:9893:140"/>
            <p>Vppon Surrenders, this course hath bin helde from the beginning; when an Irish Lord doth offer to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his Country, his surrender is not immediatly accepted, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is first awarded, to enquire of three special points. First, of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and limits of the Land whereof he is reputed owner. Next, how much himselfe doth hold in demeasne, and how much is possest by his Tennants and Followers. And thirdly, what Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, Duties, and seruices, he doth yearly receiue out of those lands. This Inquisition being made &amp; returned, the Lands which are found to bee the Lords proper possessions in demesn, are drawne into a <hi>Particular;</hi> and his Irish Duties; as <hi>Cosherings, Sessings, Rents of Butter and Oatmeale,</hi> and the like; are reasonably valued and reduced into certaine <hi>Summes of Money,</hi> to be paide yearely in lieu thereof. This being done, the surrender is accepted; and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:9893:141"/>
thereupon a Grant passed, not of the whole Country, as was vsed in former times, but of those Lands only, which are found in the Lords possession, &amp; of those certaine summes of Money, as Rents issuing out of the rest. But the Lands which are found to be possest by the Tenants, are left vnto them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely charged with these certain Rents only, in lieu of all vncertaine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish exactions.</p>
            <p>In like manner, vpon all <hi>Grants,</hi> which haue past by vertue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, for defectiue Titles, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners haue taken speciall Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for preseruation of the Estates of all particular Tenants.</p>
            <p>And as for Graunts of <hi>Captaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">No Grant of Irish Captain ships, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neschalships, since his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties raigne.</note> or <hi>Seneschal-shippes,</hi> in the Irish Countries; albeit, this Deputy had as much power and authority to graunt the same, as any other Gouernors had before him; and might haue raised as much profit by bestowing the same, if
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:9893:141"/>
he had respected his priuate, more then the publicke good; yet hath he bin so farre from passing any such in all his time, as he hath endeuoured to resume all the Graunts of that kinde, that haue bin made by his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; to the end, the inferiour subiects of the Realme, should make their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and imediate dependancie vppon the Crowne. And thus we see, how the greatest part of the possessions, (aswell of the Irish as of the English) in <hi>Leinster, Conaght,</hi> and <hi>Mounster,</hi> are setled and secured since his Maiestie came to the Crowne: whereby the harts of the people are also setled, not only to liue in peace, but raised &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to builde, to plant, to giue better education to their children, &amp; to improue the commodities of their Landes; whereby the yearely value thereof, is already encreased, double of that it was within these few yeares, and is like daily to rise higher, till it
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:9893:142"/>
amount to the price of our Lande in England.</p>
            <p>LAstly, the possessions of the Irishry <note place="margin">The plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Vlster.</hi>
               </note> in the Prouince of <hi>Vlster,</hi> though it were the most rude and vnreformed part of Ireland, and the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Nest</hi> of the last great Rebellion, are now better disposed and established, then any the Lands in the other <hi>Prouinces,</hi> which haue bin past and setled vpon Surrenders. For, as the occasion of the disposing of those Lands, did not happen without the speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and finger of God, which did cast out those wicked and vngratefull Traitors, who were the only enemies of the reformation of <hi>Ireland:</hi> so the distribution and plantation thereof, hath bin proiected &amp; prosecuted, by the speciall direction and care of the K. himselfe; wherein his Maiesty hath corrected the Errors before spoken of, committed by K. <hi>Henry</hi> 2. &amp; k. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:9893:142"/>
in distributing and planting the first conquered Landes. For, although there were six whole Shires to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, his Maiesty gaue not an entire Country, or County, to any particular person; much lesse did he grant <hi>lura Regalia,</hi> or any extraordinary Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For the best <hi>British Vndertaker,</hi> had but a proportion of 3000. Acres for himself, with power to create a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and hold a Court Baron: Albeit, many of these <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> were of as great birth &amp; quality, as the best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers in the first conquest. Again, his Maiesty did not vtterly exclude the Natiues out of this plantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with a purpose to roote them out, as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish wer excluded out of the first <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Colonies; but made a mixt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Brittish &amp; Irish,</hi> that they might grow vp togither in one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Only, the Irish were in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces transplanted from the Woods &amp; Mountaines, into the Plaines &amp; open
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:9893:143"/>
Countries, that being remoued (like wild fruit trees) they might grow the milder, and beare the better &amp; swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit. And this truly, is the Maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and most excellent part of the worke of Reformation, and is worthy indeed of his Maiesties royall paines. For when this Plantation hath taken root, and bin fixt and setled but a few yeares, with the fauour and blessing of God (for the son of God himselfe hath said in the Gospell, <hi>Omnis Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, quam non plantauit pater meus, eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur</hi>) it will secure the peace of <hi>Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> assure it to the Crowne of England for euer; and finally, make it a Ciuill, and a Rich, a Mighty, and a Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I omit to speake of the increase of the Reuenew of the Crown, both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and casuall, which is raised to a double proportion (at lest) aboue that it was, by deriuing the publick Iustice into all parts of the Realm; by setling
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:9893:143"/>
all the possessions, both of the Irish &amp; English, by re-establishing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; by restoring and resuming the Customes; by reuiuing the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures in <hi>Capite,</hi> and <hi>Knights-Seruice;</hi> &amp; reducing many other thinges into charge, which by the confusion and negligence offormer times, became concealed and subtracted from the Crowne. I forbeare likewise to speak of the due and ready bringing in of the Reuenue, which is broght to passe by the well-ordering of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the Authority &amp; paines of the Commissioners for Accompts.</p>
            <p>I might also adde heereunto, the encouragement that hath bin giuen to the Maritime Townes and Citties, as well to increase their trade of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, as to cherrish Mechanicall Arts and Sciences; in that all their Charters haue bin renued, &amp; their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties more inlarged by his Maiesty, then by any of his Progenitors since
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9893:144"/>
the Conquest. As likewise, the care &amp; course that hath been taken, to make Ciuil Commerce and enter course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Subiects, newly reformed and brought vnder Obedience, by granting Markets and Faires to bee holden in their Countries, and by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of corporate Townes among them.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the clock of the ciuil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, is now well set, and all the wheeles thereof doemoue in Order; The strings of this Irish Harpe, which the Ciuill Magistrate doth finger, are all in tune (for I omit to speak of the State Ecclesiasticall) and make a good Harmony in this Commonweale: So as we may well conceiue a hope, that <hi>Ireland</hi> (which heertofore might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the <hi>Land of Ire,</hi> because the <hi>Irascible</hi> power was predominant there, for the space of 400. yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) will from henceforth prooue a Land of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concorde.</hi> And,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9893:144"/>
though heeretofore it hath bin like the leane Cow of Egypt, in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dreame, deuouring the fat of <hi>England,</hi> and yet remaining as leane as it was before, it will heereafter bee as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, in the 8. of <hi>Deutronomie,</hi> doth in euery part agree with <hi>Ireland;</hi> being, <hi>Terra Riuorum, aquarum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

            </p>
            <p>And thus I haue discouered and expressed the Defects and Errors, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>in the mannaging of the Martiall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,</hi> as <hi>Of the Ciuil;</hi> which in former Ages gaue impediment to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all Ireland, to the <hi>Obedience &amp; Subiection</hi> of the Crowne of England. I haue likewise obserued, what cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue bin taken, to <hi>Reforme the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Errors in Gouernment, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:9893:145"/>
               <hi>the People of this Land to Obedience,</hi> since the beginning of the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3. til the latter end of the raigne of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, I haue declared &amp; set forth, <hi>How all the said Errors haue bin cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the Defectes supplied vnder the prosperous Gouernment of his Maiesty;</hi> So as I may positiuely conclude in the same words, which I haue vsed in the <hi>Title</hi> of this Discourse; <hi>That vntill the beginning of his Maiesties Raigne, Ireland was neuer entirely subdued, and brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obedience of the Crown of England.</hi> But since the crown of this kingdom, with the vndoubted right and Title thereof, discended vpon his Maiesty; The whol Island from Sea to Sea, hath bin brought into his Highnes peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able possession; and all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in euery corner thereof, haue bin absolutely reduced vnder his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate subiection. In which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of subiects, they wil gladly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:9893:145"/>
without defection or adhaering to any other <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> as long as they may be <hi>Protected,</hi> and <hi>Iustly Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> without <hi>Oppression</hi> on the one side, or <hi>Impunity</hi> on the other. For, there is no Nation of people vnder the sunne, that doth loue equall and indifferent Iustice, better then the Irish; or will rest better satisfied with the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, although it bee against themselues; so as they may haue the protection &amp; benefit of the Law, when vppon iust cause they do desire it.</p>
