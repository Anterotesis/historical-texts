            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A LETTER From A Freeholder OF Buckingham-shire: TO A Friend in LONDON, CONCERNING The Election OF THE KNIGHTS of the said COUNTY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thank you for the Accompt you gave me of the Election of the Knights of the Shire for the County of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; It was very particular as I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, and shews an hopeful and forward Zeal in the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Pagett,</hi> and some others, to bring us again to the same happy Days which I remember from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98951:2"/>
the same beginnings in the same County, in the year 1640; and when Worthy Gentlemen of the very same Names were Chosen for the Representatives of that Shire, whereof one of them had the Honour of being one of the Five Members: I suppose these Noble Knights may be of the same Families, but cannot be their Sons, because the Fathers of those I mean hapned to be Traytors; which I perceive the Country would not endure, by their Crying so exceedingly, they <hi>would have no Traytors Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many things in your Letter I must pray to have explained; As who you mean by Sir <hi>Timber T.</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph V.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony C.</hi> Had it been Sir <hi>Anthony A. C.</hi> I should have understood you; though I should have wondred that he had no more of that Company for him.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear that the County (besides their good will for the <hi>Old Cause</hi>) is in so good readiness for it's Defence, as to have 6000 Horse, Drums, Trumpets, Waggons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so well Disciplin'd as I know they will be by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; but when there shall be any Military occasion for them, I shall rather advise our Country-men to make use of Sir <hi>Richard Ingoldsby</hi> for their Commander, both because he knows how to keep good Order at an Execution, and because his Grace is often ill of a Fall from his Horse by an accidental mistake of Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi> Besides his Grace is apt to Change his Mind out of good Nature: It was that which, when he had Killed the Husband, made him Live so kindly and publiquely with the Wife, to the Neglect of his own. It was an effect of the same Vertue that made him search the King's Cabinet in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for fear his Master should have left any Papers behind him which might have been Dangerous; And as his good Nature made him do these things for a Friend and a Master, so it made him do as much for his Country too, in being the Messenger to the <hi>French</hi> King for breaking the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> and making the War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by which he saved us from having our Trade destroyed by those Butter-boxes, and for which he had a Diamond Sword given him by the <hi>French</hi> King, although he has not had his Reward here as he deserves: <hi>I</hi> say, though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98951:2"/>
these be all very great recommendations and eminent Proofs of his abilities as well as his good nature, yet they are such over-Politick ways of proceeding for our Country under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that when I did read of such Numbers of Horse with Drums beating, and Trumpets sounding, led by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> methought I rather wished him at <hi>Colledge-Hill,</hi> where they know him so much better than we do in the Country: For I considered, That if we should have occasion to fight against the <hi>French,</hi> that Diamond Sword would be remembred; and if against — good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would Come in again, and he would either remember that his Father from a private Gentleman had been made a Duke; or that the King had forgiven him so many faults, and given him his life so often, that he would have found some odd way at last of saving <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> by giving us up to be Governed again by the Establisht Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I like well the Shouts and Crying out, <hi>One and all, One and all,</hi> round the Country, because you know what that signifies, both in Fleets and Armies; and if our Militia be not Trained to it before-hand, they will no more understand what that means when there is occasion, then they do the Words of Command. I like also extreamly those Names of <hi>Pensioners, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Betrayers of their Country,</hi> to be used upon these occasions, because they will serve very well to amuse the People, and may be applyed to whom we please. For the first will certainly serve to be imployed against all Courtiers; the second against all Conformists to the Church of <hi>England</hi>: and the third against all assertors of Monarchical (that is to say Arbitrary) Government.</p>
            <p>It was very well done to discountenance that Malignant Town of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who, as you say, have made so bad a Choice, that I hear they have Chosen two of the King's Servants, and one of them not only a Traytor's Son, but for ought I know, he may be as bad himself; for they say he is a Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber: But you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member either to keep that silly loyal Town down, now you have begun, or (if ever the King have power to shew it) 'tis
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98951:3"/>
two to one, but he will be kinder to them, then ever he was.</p>
            <p>We hear they have behaved themselves very well also in <hi>Essex,</hi> though not so well as by the Conduct of Major <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> it hath been managed amongst you, because Young Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> hath not yet the experience to advise my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> as the Major hath the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> But I assure you, Major General <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Head upon <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> had not a better Heart belonging to it, to do his Country Service, then this Young Gentleman; and the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> is as likely to inherit all his Grandfather's Talents and Principles: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess there was lately some danger of his being mis-led with too much fondness which he and some of his Relations had for a Certain Duke; but thanks be to God he has found it by experience to be but a Court Friendship, which too nearly touch't his Copy hold; and I hear, that as matters have faln out with his Lordship, (who is a true maintainer of Property) it will turn extreamly to the advantage of our Cause.</p>
