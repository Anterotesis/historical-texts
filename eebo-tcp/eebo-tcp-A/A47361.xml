         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſtian
Salutation.</head>

               <salute>Honoured, and Beloved;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT grieves me I have further occaſion to
trouble you after this manner: I know not
what ſhould move Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> to write
his <hi>Appendix,</hi> juſt at a time when he was told
I was writing an Anſwer to his firſt Diſcourſe:
he might have had a little Patience, and have
ſtaid till my Treatiſe was publiſhed, whereby
he might the better have perceived, whether
what he wrote the laſt Year would abide the
Teſt or Trial of God's Word or not: This is
therefore his ſecond Attempt in publick againſt
God's holy Ordinance of ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before any body appeared viſibly
to oppoſe, or put a ſtop to his undue Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
For what Call he had to begin this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
at ſuch an unſeaſonable time, I know
not; but ſince he has done it, certainly none
can ſee any juſt cauſe to blame me for ſtanding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38501:3"/>
up in the Defence of that Truth of Jeſus Chriſt,
which I am ſo well ſatisfied about, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in, and that too as it is practiſed by the
Church, to whom I am related as an unworthy
Member, and above twenty Baptized Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
beſides in this Nation. Tho before I went
about it, I offered my Brethren (him or any
other) a ſober and friendly Conference in the
Spirit of Meekneſs, which I could not obtain,
tho I did not give ſuch a publick Challenge as
my Brother intimates in that ſtrange Epiſtle he
hath wrote to me; but upon the coming forth
of his Book, I was troubled, and would have
had it been diſcourſed in the General Aſſembly,
but that was not conſented to; and then I
told my honoured and Reverend Brethren my
purpoſe was to give an Anſwer to his Book, but
did not enter upon it till I was urged by ſeveral,
and particularly by Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> himſelf, before
divers Witneſſes, in ſuch kind of words as theſe,
<hi>i. e. Anſwer me like a Man.</hi> Whether he is
anſwered like a Man, or but like a Child, is left
to your Conſideration, 'tis done according to
that Light and Ability God hath been pleaſed
to beſtow upon me.</p>
            <p>But if he, or any of his Helpers, do ſee
cauſe to reply, they muſt anſwer ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who have wrote upon this Truth, like
Men, and Men too of great Parts, Learning
and Piety, or let them not trouble me nor the
World any more. As touching his Epiſtle to
the Churches, I ſhall take but little notice
of it, nor of that he hath writ to my ſelf,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38501:3"/>
ſith in my Judgment, neither of them ſignify
much; you are Men of greater Wiſdom than
to be frightn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed out of an Ordinance, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
from ſeeking after the Knowledg of it,
with theſe ſcurrilous Names of <hi>Error, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Human Tradition, prelimited Forms, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Error, Carnal Forms, Carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
&amp;c. Theſe are hard Words, and do not
beſpeak a trembling Heart, nor a humble Spirit,
and better becomes a Man that pretends to Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
But what ſome Men want of ſound Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
they think to make up by hard Words
and Confidence; but this will never do with
you. How hath our Practice of baptizing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> been branded with the reproachful
Name of Error? and 'tis very obſervable how
ſome Men of far greater Parts and Ability than
my Brothers or mine, either have cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Reign of Chriſt, Converſion of the
Gentiles, and calling of the Jews, as a groſs
Error, as witneſs Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of late. 'Tis Arguments I know you
look for, and if you find thoſe of Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>'s
to prevail againſt what I have ſaid, do not
regard what I have wrote in the leaſt; for I
would have your <hi>Faith</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks)
<hi>to ſtand in the Power of God, and not in the
Wiſdom of Men.</hi> The ſmallneſs of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Churches who are in the Practice of
this Ordinance, I alſo know will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with you, provided it be proved to be
a Truth of Jeſus Chriſt: What tho there was
not one of our Churches that had Light in it,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38501:4"/>
it would certainly the more concern them to
enquire after it. And tho he hath ſo courſly
ſaluted me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet I am not concerned at it
further, than to bewail his Confidence and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
to ſay no worſe, I know no Men in
any Age, who appeared firſt to vindicate a
Truth, which others call an Error, but have
met with the ſame Uſage I meet withal from
our Brother; who, I hope, is a good Man, and
means well, yet is he ſtrangely beclouded. As
I have been a Preacher up of Spiritual Worſhip
(as he ſays) and that too more than thirty
Years (tho a poor and unworthy one;) ſo
through the Grace of God, I hope ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to do unto the end of my days; and 'tis
only Spiritual Worſhip, you may perceive, I
plead for, in contending for ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, none of which
three can be without their ſpecial and particular
form. But muſt they needs be therefore carnal
and humane Forms which appertain unto
them? I ſee 'tis time to ſtand up for the Form
of Ordinances, for the Form of Doctrine, and
for the Form of ſound Words; for if we muſt
part with ſinging of Pſalms, Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from
his pretended Arguments about Forms, all
external Ordinances muſt go as well as that of
Singing: In a word, we muſt give up our
whole viſible Profeſſion, and wait for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts of the Spirit that were in the
Primitive Time, if we muſt not ſing till
we have that extraordinary Gift to do it,
which ſome had in the Apoſtles Days, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38501:4"/>
like in diſcharge of every Goſpel-Ordinance,
which were to abide in the Church to the end of
the World.</p>
            <p>He may as well therefore ſay, I do but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
that excellent Gift in Preaching (when
I preach) which was in the Primitive Goſpel-Church,
as thus to charge me in the caſe of our
ſinging by the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit:
Read his Epiſtle to me, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me as if my Brother does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the nature of Moral Duties, or natural
Worſhip, but miſtakes, and thinks natural or
moral Worſhip muſt needs be carnal, tho we
never plead for the performance of any Duties
that are moral naturally in themſelves, without
the help and aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, and the
Graces thereof in our Hearts. Is it not part of
natural Religion and Worſhip, to fear God, to
love God, and truſt in God, and that too with
all our Hearts, and with all our Souls, and with
all our Strength, and love our Neighbours as
our ſelves? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Duties appertain to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion; yet without the divine Help and
Influences of the Spirit, we can do none of them
in a right manner; no more, ſay I, can we pray,
nor ſing the Praiſes of God, which are Duties
comprehended in our fearing, honouring, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping,
and loving of him. And whereas
Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> reflects on me, as if I ſingled out
my ſelf more than others in <hi>London,</hi> in puſhing
on this practice of Singing. I muſt tell him,
I have abundance of Peace in my Spirit in what
I have done therein: And if our People (I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38501:5"/>
mean, the Church to whom I belong) are one
of the firſt Churches of our Perſwaſion in this
City, found in the practice of this Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
I am ſatisfied it will be to their great
Honour, (and not to their Reproach) and
that not only in ſucceeding Ages, but alſo in
the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God, the greateſt number of
our worthy <hi>London</hi>-Elders are as well ſatisfied
in this Truth as my ſelf, and many of their
People too, and will generally, I doubt not,
in a little time get into the practice of it.
Our Reverend Brother <hi>Knowllys</hi> 'tis known is
clear in it, and has practiſed it for ſome Years,
though at preſent 'tis not uſed in his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
He told me lately, he is about to
write in Vindication thereof, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to publiſh in a ſhort time, if the Lord
pleaſe to ſpare his Life.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> affirms, as if I
had brought Singing into our Congregation,
to the grief and trouble of many of our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
it is falſe, for 'tis known the Church
hath been in this practice near twenty Years
after Breaking of Bread, and near 14 Years on
Thankſgiving-days in a mixt Congregation.
And what was done of late in bringing it in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon on the Lord's Days, was done by a
regular Act of the Church in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
And though ſome of our worthy Brethren
and Siſters are at preſent ſomewhat diſſatisfied
with it, yet I doubt not but will in a little time
ſee their Miſtakes, if ſuch buſy Men as he do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38501:5"/>
not in an undue manner blow up Coals of
Contention amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Can any ſober Chriſtian think he hath done
well to publiſh the Private Affairs of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church to the whole World? It ſeems
to ſome as if he has hopes there will be a Breach
in the Church, upon the Account of our Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Praiſes of God; but I hope he will
find our worthy Brethren underſtand themſelves
better than to go about to impoſe on the
Church or Conſciences of their Brethren, or to
ſtrive to pull down that which the Church
and themſelves too, have been a building for
ſo many Years. Can there be a Man
ſo left of God as to countenance any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to make a Schiſm in a Congragation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot forgo a Duty they have ſo
long been ſatisfied in the practice of, and ſo
the whole Body to ſubmit to the Sentiments of
a few Perſons, as if they had Power over our
Faith? We do not ſay our diſſatisfied Brethren
ſhall ſing with us, or we will have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with them; no, God forbid we ſhould
impoſe on their Conſciences. We do not look
upon Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an Eſſential of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
'tis not for the being, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and well-being of a Church. We have told
our Brethren (ſince we ſing not till after our
laſt Prayer) if they cannot ſing with us, nay,
nor ſtay with the Church whilſt we do ſing,
they may go forth, and we will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
            <p>Should any countenance, through a hot and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38501:6"/>
unaccountable zeal, ſuch a Schiſm, it would
make ſtrange Confuſion in our Churches. And
ſince he thus publickly hints at this private
Caſe amongſt us, I had I thought a clear Call
to open the matter plainly as it is, to clear my
ſelf and the Church, to all who may read his
Epiſtle and this my Anſwer, for we have done
nothing we have the leaſt cauſe to be aſhamed
of, or unable to juſtify in the ſight of God or
Man.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add one word to the conſideration of
the Brethren of our Church, I doubt not but
they will conſider it.</p>
            <p>1. If they look upon us as equal in Knowledg
and Uprightneſs towards God with themſelves,
they may ſee we have the ſame ground to be
offended with them in diminiſhing from God's
Word, as they may be with us, for adding (as
poſſibly they think) to God's Word.</p>
            <p>2. And let them conſider 'tis a horrid Evil
to break the Bond of Spiritual Union, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
to wound the Body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whoſe Work is it thus to do, but the Devil's?
and what a reproach doth it bring upon the
Truth? and how grievous is it to all truly
Godly Ones, and grateful to the Enemies of
our Sacred Profeſſion? Beſides, upon ſuch a
trifle, can it be ſo hainous a Crime to be found
often in that Duty, which they with us have ſo
often and long been in the practice of, and in
a mixt Aſſembly too, many and many times?
Beſides, brought in by almoſt an unanimous
Agreement in a ſolemn Church-Meeting, there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38501:6"/>
being not, above five or ſix that ſhewed any
publick diſſent, nor they neither ſignifying any
ſuch diſſatiſfaction, <hi>i. e.</hi> that if we ſang at ſuch
Times, they could not bear it; nor do I hear
they do deſire us now to decline the ſaid
practice. Love will cover a greater Fault than
this, for they may ſee cauſe to believe 'tis not
Self-Intereſt, but the Glory of God we wholly
aim at. But to return.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I wonder any ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with his Book, for I never ſaw any thing
come out in Print upon any controvertible
Truth, that has leſs of Argument in it, or
more of Confidence. And 'tis not my Thoughts
alone, nor more deſtructive Mediums made uſe
of to the whole of the external Parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Nay, one told me very lately, that one
of our diſſatisfied Members intimated to him,
as if our Bible was not truly or rightly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated;
and it ſeems to riſe from what Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
hath aſſerted in his Book about the word
<hi>Hymnos.</hi> I fear'd that would be the Effect
of his Attempt, if any Body regarded what he
hath ſaid upon that account.</p>
            <p>But, pray, what Call has he to rebuke me,
after this publick manner, eſpecially before the
whole World? If I had done any thing amiſs
in his Judgment in that Matter, I could wiſh
he had had more Wiſdom and Prudence, or elſe
leſt the Controverſy to ſome more diſcreet and
abler Pen.</p>
            <p>I cannot forget the two Brethren that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38501:7"/>
Singing the Praiſes of God, and would
not comply with the Church, (though they
did not ſeparate themſelves from the Church)
when firſt the practice of it was received
amongſt us near twenty Years ago. One
of them ſoon after brought a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon Religion by immoral Actions, and
came to nothing, and the other ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
turned <hi>Quaker,</hi> and to my Face denied the
Reſurrection of his Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to that way Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> ſpeaks of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God in Prayer, without ſinging of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as being more ſuitable (as he thinks) to
the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit. I muſt tell
him, God's Word is our Rule; and ſince God
doth require his People to celebrate his Praiſes
by ſinging <hi>Pſalms, Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> doubtleſs that
ſuits as well with the ordinary Gifts of the
Spirit, as ſuch Gifts ſuit with Prayer, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I fear one day he will not be
found able to give any good account of himſelf
in his bold Attempt, in ſeeking to rob God of
his glorious Praiſe by ſinging to him, as he hath
enjoined us to do; nor do I fear, but through
the Help and Authority of God's Word, I
ſhall, in the Day of Chriſt, ſtand with Joy
and Confidence before him, upon this reſpect,
when poſſibly he may be aſhamed, if he has not
ſincere Repentance for what he has done.</p>
            <p>Is it not a falſe Aſſertion for him to ſay as he
doth, (in his Epiſtle to me) That as to our
way of Vocal Singing together, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Command nor Example for it, either in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38501:7"/>
the Old or New Teſtament? I ſhall leave it
to the Conſideration of all wiſe and ſober Men.
Certainly all will conclude the Man is ſtrangely
left of God, eſpecially conſidering he builds his
main Confidence from a remote and indirect
ſignification of a Greek Word, and yet, as I
am told, underſtands not that Language nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>My Portion is, I perceive, to undergo hard
Cenſures from Men; but 'tis no more than my
Bleſſed Maſter met with; and what am I that I
ſhould complain? <hi>One ſaid, He was a good
Man: but others ſaid, Nay, but he hath a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,

            <head>AN ANSWER
To Mr. Marlow's APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt of all you tell us,</hi> That to praiſe God,
or praiſing of God, is not confined to Songs
of Praiſe; but that there are other ways
and manner of praiſing of him than ſuch melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Singing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We never yet aſſerted there was no
other way or manner to praiſe God, than by
ſinging of his Praiſe. Nor is there a Man who
affirms any ſuch thing that I know of; but it is
one thing to own thoſe other ways of praiſing
of God, and another thing for you utterly to
deny this way, or the way we uſe in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Praiſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell you, moſt Learned Men, nay,
all that I have met with, do conclude, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or thoſe Children you ſpeak of <hi>Matth.</hi>
21. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 37. did ſing thoſe <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi>
to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> as I have ſhewed in
the firſt Chapter of the foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I perceive you have now at laſt raiſed the
Auxiliaries againſt this Bleſſed Truth of Jeſus
Chriſt. But as a worthy Brother hinted the
other day, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is a preſs'd Man, and as
forced in ſo, he doth you no ſervice at all, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38501:9"/>
will appear by what follows; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by what my worthy Friend has wrote at
the cloſe of this our Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. from the
Greek word <hi>Hymneſo ſe,</hi> 
               <q>I will hymn thee,
<hi>i. e.</hi> I will praiſe thee; ſaith, (1.) what
Chriſt will do, <hi>viz.</hi> He will ſing Praiſe to
God. (2.) Where he will do it, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the
midſt of the Congregation. The expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of both theſe (he ſaith) is accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the Declaration of God's Name,
and praiſing of him in the Temple. The
ſinging of Hymns of Praiſe unto God in the
great Congregation, was then a principal part
of his Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>2. That chearfulneſs and alacrity of the
Spirit of Chriſt in this Work, <hi>he would do
it with Joy and Singing.</hi>
               </q> Theſe are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
words, as cited by you, <hi>Appendix,</hi> pag. 4.
And thus did Chriſt ſing with his Diſciples,
in that great Repreſentative Church, as our
<hi>Annotators</hi> call it.</p>
            <p>Now what is this to your purpoſe? the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
tells you, that <hi>Hymneſo ſe</hi> is Singing
Praiſes to God: And how do you know but
Chriſt might alſo often ſing in the Temple,
and in other great Congregations, though we
do not read of it, ſince 'tis ſaid, that <hi>many
other things did Jeſus that are not written?</hi> Joh.
21. 25.</p>
            <p>1. Eſpecially conſidering, ſince it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
of him, that in the great Congregation
he ſhould ſing God's Praiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:38501:9"/>
2. Becauſe, as the Doctor obſerves, Singing
in the Temple was one great part of God's
Worſhip; from whence 'tis not likely our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſhould neglect that part. Moreover, he
poſitively affirms, Chriſt did, with chearfulneſs
and joy, give Praiſe to God by Singing. 'Tis
well known Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> owned no other Singing
than what we do; he doth nowhere talk of the
Eſſence of Singing in our Spirit, and ſo exclude
vocal or proper Singing.</p>
            <p>1. He acknowledges Singing, is Praiſing of
God, ſo do we; and ſay, 'tis one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ways of Praiſing him too.</p>
            <p>2. He intimates there are other ways of
praiſing of God, beſides Singing his Praiſe;
though it clearly holdeth forth that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
would praiſe God that way, namely, by
Singing. And you would do well to obſerve
what our late Learned Annotators ſpeak upon
that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. theſe are their words.
<q>Chriſt and they are of one Father, (that is,
the Saints are here called his Brethren)
he by Nature, and they by Grace, and
from one Humane Parent, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23,
38. and both of one Fleſh; He ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſung and Praiſed his Father with them
(ſay they) at his Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30.
in that Repreſentative Church, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.
26.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we, as I ſaid before, do readily grant,
as the Doctor intimates, thoſe other ways of
Praiſing of God, and that Prayer, the <hi>Word of
Faith,</hi> and the Fruits of Obedience, hath a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38501:10"/>
tendency to the Praiſe of God: But if the
Doctor, and ſome other Learned Men, ſhould
intimate, that that Greek word <hi>Hymnos</hi> ſhould
in a remote ſence ſignify Praiſing of God
without Singing: we ask, Whether any of
them ſay thoſe ways of Praiſes, without Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is the immediate, <hi>genuine,</hi> direct and
primary ſignification of the word?</p>
            <p>All your Helpers will fail you here. There are
other Greek words to expreſs thoſe other ways
of Praiſe to God beſides <hi>Hymnos.</hi> You are
upon a dangerous Rock; you make it your
Buſineſs to trouble our People with the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Greek word <hi>Hymnos, a Hymn,</hi>
(though you underſtand not that Language)
juſt after the ſame manner that the <hi>Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
do with the word <hi>Baptizo;</hi> ſay they, it
ſignifies <hi>waſhing,</hi> as well as <hi>dipping,</hi> which
learned <hi>Fiſher</hi> grants. But how? Take his
words, <q>'Tis (ſaith he) ſo taken impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
indirectly, collaterally, by the by,
or remotely, it ſo ſignifys, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>waſhing:</hi>
But (ſaith he) the direct, immediate genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and primary ſignification of the word
<hi>Baptizo,</hi> is Immerſion, Dipping, or to dip,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> You, it ſeems, take the ſame way
to deſtroy the Ordinance of Singing God's
Praiſes, as they take to deſtroy the Ordinance
of Baptiſm: But this will do your buſineſs no
better than that will do theirs; Dipping is
Waſhing, but every Waſhing is not Dipping.
Theirs is (as Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> obſerves) an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
remote, or indirect Baptiſm, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38501:10"/>
from the improper Signification of the
Greek word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and ſo no true Baptiſm
at all. So you, aſſerting from thoſe Learned
Men, that the Greek word <hi>Hymnos</hi> ſignifies a
meer or common praiſing of God in Prayer:
'tis, ſay I, but an improper, indirect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
ſort of Singing of God's Praiſe, that the
Word will admit of in that ſenſe, and ſo no
Singing at all.</p>
            <p>If you diſcourſe with learned Perſons, they
will tell you, that ſome Greek words do,
in an improper or remote ſenſe, bear ſeveral
Significations; but the direct, genuine, and
proper ſignification of the Word is Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or, they ſung. And now do you not think
you are greatly to blame to make ſuch a ſtir
upon a word you underſtand not, after the
manner you have done, and thereby cauſe
Doubts to ariſe in the Minds of poor weak
Chriſtians about the Tranſlation of the Holy
Bible, and render our Famous and Learned
Tranſlators unfaithful? But I hope our People
will not regard or mind what you unadviſedly
have wrote and ſaid upon this Account. Have
not the Tranſlators, (who compared divers
Greek Copies together,) been more faithful to
give the proper, genuine and direct ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, they hymned, they ſung
an Hymn, than from the remote ſenſe, they
ſaid Grace, or gave Thanks? We read he gave
Thanks when he took the Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
word there in the Greek is, he Hymned. I have
often ſaid, to ſing to God in aright manner, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38501:11"/>
praiſing of God, but all praiſing of God is
not ſinging his Praiſes; therefore they that
tranſlate the word, <hi>they praiſed God,</hi> ſpeak the
Truth, but they do not ſpeak all the Truth.</p>
            <p>But if our Saviour and his Diſciples did no
more than in an ordinary manner give Thanks,
as we do after Supper, our Tranſlators do
affirm a falſe thing, to ſay they ſung an Hymn,
as elſewhere I have more fully demonſtrated;
becauſe Singing is more, and a different thing
from ſaying of Grace, as you hint an old
Dutch Tranſlation reads it.</p>
            <p>But not to muſter up a multitude of learned
Men, as I might do, who exactly agree with
our Tranſlators on that word, take (once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain)
what Dr. <hi>Du-Veil</hi> doth affirm, (who
underſtood, as I am informed, all the Oriental
Tongues) in his literal Explanation of the Acts
of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. (tho I quoted
him before) <q>citing <hi>Ruff Presbyter</hi> of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
in the Title of the <hi>72d</hi> Pſalm ſaith,
Hymns are Songs which contain the Praiſe
of God: If it be Praiſe and not of God, it
is not a Hymn; if it be Praiſe, and of God,
if it be not ſung, it is not an Hymn; it muſt
therefore (ſaith he) that it may be an Hymn,
have theſe three things [Praiſe] [and of
God] [and a Song]: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, ſung Praiſes to God
for the Honour put upon them, in that they
ſuffered innocently for promoting the Glory
of Chriſt.</q> Many of the Learned Men you
quote, ſay <hi>Hymnos</hi> is Praiſe, you need not ſay
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38501:11"/>
any more to that, we all own and grant it; but
yet alſo ſay the proper and genuine Signification
of it, is praiſing of God by Singing. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, you baſely abuſe the Tranſlators, (<hi>Append.</hi>
p. 12.) in ſaying, <q>Surely it muſt be granted that
the word <hi>ſung</hi> and <hi>ſing</hi> in thoſe four Scriptures
were imprudent Additions to thoſe ſacred
Texts.</q> Theſe are your words. 'Tis a ſhame
a Man of your Learning ſhould (to defend your
own Fantaſy) charge the faithful and renowned
Tranſlators after this ſort. Theſe things being
ſo, What Authority have you to ſay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Diſciples did not ſing? or, what
reaſon has any ſober or Godly Chriſtian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you, if you ſo boldly affirm it? Therefore
I, upon good Authority, in oppoſition to what
you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 12. that therefore from the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the word <hi>Hymnos,</hi> there is a good and
ſacred Foundation or Warrant for ſuch vocal
melodious ſinging at or after the Lord's-Supper,
ſeeing the word doth bear that as the direct
and proper Signification of it.</p>
            <p>And alſo we ſay that what Chriſt did was a
Rule for us in that of Singing, as well as in
taking the Bread and breaking it, and bleſſing
it, and taking the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Muſt not we
ſing the Praiſes of Chriſt who have the Spirit
but in meaſure, becauſe Chriſt had the Spirit
without meaſure?</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Primitive Goſpel-Church
had the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit in
Prayer, Preaching, and Singing alſo, muſt we
not pray, preach, nor ſing? if we muſt not do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38501:12"/>
one of them, we muſt do none of them:
And therefore in oppoſition to what you ſay,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 13. of your Appendix, If the Practice
of Chriſt and the Primitive Church, doth not
bind us to the Obſervation of one Ordinance,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of Singing, it binds us to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of none; 'tis time to look about us, for
your manner of arguing, I do declare, (as 'twas
intimated to me the other day by my Reverend
Brother <hi>Knowles</hi>) tends to the overthrow of
all Goſpel-Ordinances whatſoever; therefore I
warn all my Brethren to take heed how they
hearken to you in this matter, as they tender
the Glory of God, and the Eſtabliſhment of all
Goſpel-Worſhip and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: 'Tis an eaſy thing (for
any wary Reader, who is not willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
to perceive the Man hath a bad Cauſe
in hand, and that he reaſons not like a wiſe
and enlightned underſtanding Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Which doth fully appear, if we conſider
the falſe and prepoſterous Mediums or Ways
he takes to make out what he pretends to
prove.</p>
            <p>1. For one while he ſeems to aſſert, that
the Eſſence of Singing, which is (he ſays)
in our Spirit, that will ſerve our turn in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Duty of ſinging forth God's
Praiſes, without imploying our Tongues or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Organs in it, which, as I have again and
again ſaid, doth as well exclude vocal Praying
and Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Singing. See <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.
of his firſt Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:38501:12"/>
2. Then again at another time, becauſe there
are other ways to praiſe God beſides ſinging
of his Praiſes, we muſt not ſing his Praiſes at
all. <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>3. At another time he ſeems to exclude all
Singing out of the Bible, from an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Signification of a Greek word, and ſtrives
to make it out 'twas only common Praiſes or
Thankſgiving in Prayer. See the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to me,
and <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>And ſo quarrels with the Tranſlators of the
holy Bible, as if they wanted Skill in the Greek
Tongue, or elſe Faithfulneſs in rendring the
Word, <hi>they ſung an Hymn,</hi> which he tells you
they ſhould have rendered, <hi>they gave Thanks,
or ſaid Grace.</hi> But further, to clear our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Learned and Pious Tranſlators of the Bible;
let it be conſidered how carefully they were in
other Caſes, particularly in reſpect of the word
<hi>Baptizo,</hi> which they never ventured to tranſlate
<hi>Rantizo,</hi> ſprinkling, to favour their own Practice,
but rather choſe to leave the word in the Original
Tongue, and not tranſlate it at all, than to give
a falſe Signification of it.</p>
            <p>4. But leſt all theſe Tricks and Shifts ſhould
fail him, he flies to another broken Refuge, <hi>viz.</hi>
intimating that the Ordinance of Singing doth
not belong to us now, but may be practiſed
by the Saints hereafter in the thouſand Years
Reign, or ſeventh thouſand Years of this
World. Which is a very doubtful Point, I mean,
whether there will be ſuch a thouſand Years
Reign or not, in his ſenſe; and yet this Duty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38501:13"/>
lies amongſt other Goſpel-Ordinances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
given out by the Spirit, and enjoyned on the
Churches, which is enough to ſhake the Faith
of our People in reſpect of other Ordinances,
which they have as much reaſon to ſay, may not
belong to us, but ſhall be practiſed in time to
come, when the Church (as the Seekers ſay)
ſhall attain its firſt or original Purity. See
<hi>Pag.</hi> 27. of his Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>5. And laſtly, like a wary and fore-ſeeing
Man, to be ſure to carry his Cauſe, he retires
to his laſt Fort and Strong-hold, and affirms,
That the Ordinance of ſinging of Pſalms,
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was only in the Primitive Time
performed by an extraordinary Gift; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we have ſuch a Gift, we muſt not ſing
the Praiſes of God now in theſe days.</p>
            <p>Tho I have ſaid enough to detect this fond
Conceit, yet ſince he leads me in this Path, I
muſt, I perceive, reply again, as I have already
done, that this Objection lies equally againſt
Prayer, Preaching, and interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſith all theſe Goſpel-Duties and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
in the Primitive and Apoſtolical Days,
were performed by the ſaid extraodinary Gifts
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>If he could make this appear, there was no
need for him to trouble us with the Greek
word, nor with any of his other Mediums he
uſes to exclude Goſpel-Singing; it cannot but
appear by this laſt ſhift, he acknowledges that
Singing is ſomewhat more than that Praiſing of
God he ſpeaks of: But theſe things betray the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38501:13"/>
Man's Integrity, or rather his Weakneſs, and
ſhew he doth not argue, but plays the part of
a Sophiſter, though not a cunning One, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Nakedneſs plainly appears to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Capacity, through his pittiful threadbare
Covering. For if he had thought his other
Mediums would have ſerved his turn, or held
the Teſt, we ſhould not have, I am perſwaded,
heard any of this: But however, we will come
to examine his pretended Arguments he brings
to prove this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>His firſt Argument, to prove Singing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
performed from a ſpecial Gift, is in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi>
pag. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For as the Grace of Joy is the Fruit of
the Spirit, (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) and as God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Oil, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Joy for
Mourning; ſo the Primitive Church had ſome
earneſt of it, and did rejoice in hope of the
Glory of God; and through the abundance of
the Spirit wherewith ſhe was baptized, her
Miniſters delivered the Word of God in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ways and manners, <hi>viz.</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
Tongues, and melodious Singing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Have not Believers now the Holy
Spirit, as well as they had it then, though not
in ſuch an extraordinary manner? And have
not we the Fruit of it, <hi>i. e. Joy, Peace,</hi> &amp;c.
in believing? Alſo you miſtake your ſelf, Joy
doth not appertain to the Gifts of the Spirit,
but 'tis a Fruit of the Graces of the Spirit. Do
not the Saints now rejoice in hope of the Glory
of God, as well as they did then?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38501:14"/>
               <hi>There is no ſuch cauſe or ground from the
Reception of Tongues, or the extraordinary
Gifts of the Spirit, (as you intimate) to ſing
the Praiſes of God;</hi> For many (our Saviour
ſaith) ſhall ſay in that Day, We have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt
out Devils, and in thy Name have done many
wonderful Works. To whom he will ſay, Depart
from me, I know ye not. <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi>
Though I ſpeak with Tongues of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and have not Charity, I am become as
ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 1.</p>
            <p>From whence it appears that inward Joy and
Peace of which you ſpeak, as the Cauſe of
Singing in the Apoſtles Times, did not flow
from that extraordinary Gift of the Spirit, but
from the ſaving Graces of the Spirit; either it
flows from the conſideration of common or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Mercies and Bleſſings, wherein all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to ſing the Praiſes of God, who gives
them fruitful Seaſons, filling their Hearts with
Joy and Gladneſs; or elſe it flows from thoſe
ſpecial and internal Bleſſings which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> Union with God, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c. Tongues
were for a Sign, not for them who believe, but
for them who believe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 22. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts were to convince Unbelievers
of the Truth, and not for the Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſuch who did believe. Men that have the
Gift of Tongues, may be graceleſs, and ſo
without Chriſt, and periſh eternally in Hell;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38501:14"/>
therefore the extraordinary Gift of the Spirit
fits not, tunes not the Heart nor Tongue to
ſing the Praiſes of God. You may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Saints may not, ought not in theſe our
Days rejoice in God, nay, not praiſe him in
any other manner of ways, as well as not ſing,
from this Argument you make uſe of here on
this account.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows that you ſtrangely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<hi>pag. 15. Appendix,</hi> in intimating, when
<hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Saints to covet after the beſt
Gifts, he means the extraordinary Gifts of the
Spirit; for certainly thoſe are the beſt Gifts that
moſt tend to the edification of the Church,
which Tongues could not be ſaid to do. And
in the very next words he ſpeaks of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Charity or Love,
which refers to the Graces of the Spirit. And
of ſo little uſe were thoſe ſpecial or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Gifts to the Church, that if there were no
Interpreter, they were to be ſilent, and not uſe
them in the Church at all who were that way
gifted.</p>
            <p>2. You confound Tongues (which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to all ſorts of Gifts) with Prophecy and
Singing: He that had a Doctrine, might have the
Gift of Tongues to bring it forth; ſo might
he that had the Gift of Prophecy, and he alſo
that had the Gift to Interpret; and ſo might
he alſo that had the extraordinary Gift to
bring forth a Pſalm. And, pray, why muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
praiſing of God be now admitted? and
Preaching, Propheſying, and Interpreting the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38501:15"/>
Scripture by the ordinary Gifts of the Spirit be
ſtill allowed, and yet Singing by the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gifts muſt not be admitted? What Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
do you give for this? Is not this to darken
Counſel with words without Knowledg?</p>
            <p>I have demonſtrated, that the End of thoſe
extraordinary Gifts that were then in the Church
in the Adminiſtration of every Duty and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
was to confirm the ordinary practice of
all thoſe Ordinances, and ſo to continue them
in the Church to the end of the World. And
God hath equally honoured and confirmed Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. to continue, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
thereof to abide, as of any other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>You need not therefore ſpend your time to
prove the Apoſtles Prayed, Preached, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied,
and alſo Sung by an extraordinary Gift;
we acknowledg it, but ſay, this is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Singing, than againſt our Praying,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have not now thoſe ſpecial Gifts.</p>
            <p>2. He that had a Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi> might
bring it forth in an unknown Tongue, as well
as he that had a Doctrine, and ſo not to the
Edification of the Church: For if he brought
out a Pſalm of <hi>David</hi> in an unknown Tongue,
who could ſing with him? But if he had been
to ſing alone, the Melody might have refreſhed
thoſe who ſung not, as ſome ſay they have
been in hearing the French Proteſtants ſing,
who underſtand not their Language. But
to prevent this, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reſolved
when he ſung, he would ſing with the Spirit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38501:15"/>
and with the Underſtanding alſo, becauſe 'tis the
Matter ſung that is fruitful to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and what is the Melody without that?</p>
            <p>Your third Reaſon or Argument is taken
from that in <hi>Epheſ. 5. 18. Be ye filled with the
Spirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle pray that God
would fill all the Saints with Joy and Peace?
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. And pray, that they might be
filled with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs? Now
ſinging flows from that Joy that all the Saints
ought to labour after; and alſo from the Fruits
of Righteouſneſs, we have an equal need to be
filled with the Spirit, to pray, to meditate, to
praiſe God, and to preach and hear the Word,
as well as to ſing Pſalms and Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you ſay,</hi> pag. 18. <hi>That</hi> the Gifts of the
Holy Spirit were not given alike to every Member
of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis granted: But doth it follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome had the extraordinary Gift of the
Spirit to pray, muſt not the others who had not
thoſe Gifts, no more than we have them now,
not pray at all? Brother, I am grieved to ſee
how you are deceived, and would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But as they who had not the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gift of the Spirit to pray, were, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
to pray; ſo they who had not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
or ſpecial Gift to ſing, were, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
to ſing the Praiſes of God. What
you ſpeak, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. about the <hi>diverſity of Gifts,
but the ſame Spirit,</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. is rather
more againſt the performance of thoſe other
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38501:16"/>
Duties and Ordinances than Singing, becauſe
Singing is not there mentioned. But all that
you ſay there, has been anſwered already; ſo is
what you infer from <hi>Col. 3. 16. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 19.
For to think the Apoſtle refers to the ſpecial Gift
of Singing in thoſe places, is of a pernicious
tendency; for you may as well ſay the ſame of
all other Precepts enjoined on the Churches,
and ſo free us from all Goſpel-Obedience for
want of ſuch Gifts. Why muſt not Spiritual
Songs be allowed, as well as Pſalms and Hymns?
What do you mean in <hi>pag.</hi> 23?</p>
            <p>Brother, you were better be ſilent till you
can diſtinguiſh better between <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> and the manner of the
bringing of them forth by a ſpecial Gift. A
Doctrine may be as Spiritual that is precom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
as that which was brought forth by a
ſpecial Gift; ſo may an Hymn, or Spiritual
Song, though 'tis by the ordinary Gifts or
Help of the Spirit precompoſed; there cannot
be an Hymn, nor Spiritual Song, without its
Form; but if it be a Spiritual Song, it has a
Spiritual Form. The very word may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of your Error; if the Song be
taken out of Chriſt's Spiritual and Sacred
Word, the Form is Spiritual; and if it be
ſung with a gracious Heart and Tongue, 'tis
doubtleſs Spiritual Worſhip and acceptable to
God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Section of yours with
one honeſt and plain Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:38501:16"/>
That Aſſertion or Notion againſt Singing the
Praiſes of God, that hath a natural tendency
in it to overthrow the practice of all Goſpel-Ordinances,
as well as ſinging the Praiſes of
God, is a vile and pernicious Aſſertion or Notion.
But for a Man to aſſert, the Saints and People
of God now in theſe days, ought not to ſing
Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, becauſe
we have not that ſpecial or extraordinary Gift
of the Spirit to do it, hath a natural tendency
in it to overthrow the practice of all Goſpel-Ordinances
in theſe days. <hi>Ergo.</hi> That Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is vile and pernicious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed: the <hi>Minor</hi>
I have abundantly proved in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. You ſeem to Anſwer what we
ſay about Singing being a moral Duty. Which
you ſay, <hi>Is the refuge of ſome who cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their practice of formal Singing by Goſpel-Inſtitution.</hi>
Append. <hi>pag.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You miſtake; we need no Goſpel-Inſtitution,
'tis as clear a Precept in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Epheſ. 5. 19. Col.</hi> 3. 16. as any we
have in the New-Teſtament. But we ſay
Singing the Praiſes of God is more than a
mere poſitive Duty.</p>
            <p>What you further ſay under this Head, doth
but betrary your own Ignorance about moral
Precepts, and needs no Anſwer, I having fully
explained it in this Treatiſe. Is it abſurd and
irrational for us to make the Moral Law, or
Light of Nature, a Rule to exert the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38501:17"/>
of God? ſee <hi>Append.</hi> p. 28. 'Tis not ſo
much the matter of Moral Duties, as the manner
of the performance of them, that renders them
Spiritual; and for the more orderly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
performance of ſuch Duties, that are in
their own nature Moral, they are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Goſpel-inſtitution, as Prayer, Preaching,
and Singing the Praiſes of God are; and
therefore all Moral Duties muſt be diſcharged
by the help of the Spirit, and with Grace in
the Heart, if accepted of God.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 33. of your <hi>Appendix,</hi> you repeat
your former Objection againſt Womens Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Church, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith,
he <hi>ſuffered not a Woman to teach, nor uſurp
Authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>So that Chriſt (<hi>ſay you</hi>) makes it an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Authority, for a Woman to teach,
or to ſpeak, or any ways to break her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in the Church.</p>
               <p>But then (ſay you) 'tis objected, Theſe
Scriptures that forbid Womens teaching and
ſpeaking in the Church, do intend only that
they ſhould not be the Mouth of the Church,
as in Prayer and Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To this Objection againſt your Expoſition
of theſe Scriptures, you give your Anſwers.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That ſuch a ſenſe as this we ſpeak of,
is againſt the Letter of theſe Texts.</p>
               <p>2. By aſſerting that in Singing together,
there is Teaching, Inſtruction and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>pag.</hi> 34.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This kind of arguing againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38501:17"/>
Singing we have all ready fully refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but for the ſake of our good Women,
and to detect this falſity, I ſhall add a word
or two further in way of Reply. 'Tis a hard
caſe that Women ſhould be debarred to ſpeak
in any ſenſe, or any ways to Break Silence in
the Church, as you affirm through a miſtake of
the Text.</p>
            <p>1. For then they muſt not ask a Friend how
he or ſhe doth when in the Congregation.</p>
            <p>2. She muſt not be ſuffered to be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Church againſt any Offender, in
the caſe of Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>3. Then ſhe muſt not ask, where the Text
is, if ſhe comes too late, for that is in ſome
ſenſe a ſpeaking and breaking Silence.</p>
            <p>4. Nor muſt ſhe then ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe
of Prayer, for that's a breaking Silence.</p>
            <p>5. Which is worſt of all, ſhe muſt not in
the Church give an account of her Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or declare how the Lord was pleaſed to work
upon her Heart: for I have ſhewed in that Act
there is much inſtruction, nay, 'tis ſo full of
teaching to others, that what ſome pious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have spoke in the Church upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
God hath bleſſed to the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sinners, as well as it has refreſhed and
ſweetly comforted divers Believers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein you abuſe the ſenſe of the Holy
Ghoſt, and indeed are not, I fear, fit to be a
Teacher of others, but to learn in ſilence your
ſelf.</p>
            <p>2. The way therefore to underſtand this as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38501:18"/>
well as other Scriptures, is to have recourſe to
the main drift or purport of the Spirit of God
therein. And evident it is, the main thing the
Apoſtle drives at in both theſe places, or doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Women ought not to be
allowed to take part in the ordinary Miniſtration
of preaching the Goſpel, or miniſterially, or
authoritatively to preach the Word: becauſe he
that has received a juſt Call ſo to do, may and
ought to exhort and command in the Name of
our Lord Jeſus with all Authority, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15.
and this Work therefore Women ſhould not
take upon them, becauſe they muſt be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and not uſurp Authority over the
Man. To take the bare letter of the Text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing the ſcope and drift of the Spirit of
God in it, would make ſad work, as I might
ſhew from many Scriptures, and has occaſioned
many abominable Errors, any Hereſies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the World.</p>
            <p>3. As to that teaching which is in Singing,
it doth not lie in a Miniſterial way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not intended by the Spirit of God here;
Preaching or Teaching is not Singing, nor
Singing Preaching or Teaching, though there
is a Teaching in it. You muſt learn better
to diſtinguiſh between different Duties and
Ordinances, before you take upon you to
teach others. Read what I have before ſaid,
and alſo what Mr. <hi>Cotton, Sidenham,</hi> &amp;c. have
ſaid, as you will find it repeated in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
in reſpect of the Nature of Teaching and
Admonition that is in the Ordinance of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38501:18"/>
and you may further ſee how you miſs and
abuſe theſe Scriptures: for he or ſhe that reads
the Scripture may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to teach,
there is much teaching in it; yet ſure a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be ſuffered to do this, as a caſe may
preſent it ſelf, both in the Church, or at home
either, in her Husbands preſence, and not be
deemed to uſurp Authority over him: for the
Uſurpation the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, reſpects a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
own Husband (if not chiefly) as well
as others; and therefore if ſhe muſt not ſing in
the Church, ſo by your Argument ſhe muſt
not ſing nor read the Scripture at home in the
preſence of her Husband, becauſe there is a
kind of teaching in both thoſe Duties; and if
ſhe ſhould, as you intimate, ſhe would not
only break Silence, but uſurp Authority over
the Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> her Head and Husband, which
is forbid. The Lord deliver poor Women, and
Men too, from ſuch kind of Doctrine as this.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis evident the Apoſtle lays no other
reſtraint upon Women than what the Law laid
them under, they are <hi>to be ſilent,</hi> or 'tis not
(ſaith he) <hi>permitted unto them to ſpeak; but
they are commanded to be under Obedience, as
alſo ſaith the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 34. And 'tis as
clear, they were always under the Law ſuffered
to ſing in the Congregation as well as the Men,
therefore it was not ſuch a Speaking or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as is in Singing, that <hi>Paul</hi> intends in thoſe
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>5. Whereas you affirm, that Women were
not admitted to pray nor propheſy in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38501:19"/>
Church neither in the Old nor New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is doubleſs falſe, as our late Annotators
well obſerved on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. which is the
very Text you mention, take their words;</p>
            <q>
               <p>This Rule muſt not (ſay they) be reſtrained
to ordinary propheſying: for certainly, if
the Spirit of Propheſy came upon a Woman
in the Church, ſhe might ſpeak. <hi>Anna,</hi>
who was a Propheteſs in the Temple, <hi>gave
Thanks to the Lord, and ſpake of him to all
them that looked for the Redemption of</hi> Iſrael:
and I cannot tell how <hi>Philip</hi>'s Daughters
propheſied, if they did not ſpeak in the
preſence of many. The reaſon given why
Women ſhould be ſilent, is, becauſe they are
commanded to be in Obedience. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(ſay they) might ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to the
publick Prayers, and alſo ſing with the
Congregation to the Honour and Glory of
God, but for her to ſpeak in an ordinary
courſe of Propheſy to inſtruct People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſhe is forbidden. The Apoſtle, ſaith a
Friend (in a Manuſcript) doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
all manner of ſpeaking, for that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5, 6. where
Women are admitted to pray and propheſy:
for Prayer, <hi>they may ſay, Amen</hi> to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers of the Church: and for Propheſy
they may ſing Pſalms, the Apoſtle uſing the
Expreſſion according to the Ideum of the
Jews, 1 <hi>Sam. 19. 20, 21. 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 5. they
ſhall propheſy; and for <hi>they ſhall propheſy,</hi>
the <hi>Cald. Paraphraſ.</hi> reads, <hi>they ſhall ſing,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:38501:19"/>
and thou ſhalt praiſe with them. <hi>Vid. Wilſon</hi>'s
Dict. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotat. on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 5. and ſo it's uſed 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>The Prohibition, ſaith he, is not reſtrained
only to Church-Aſſemblies, but holds good
in all places, and at all times, and intends a
Subjection of Women to their Husbands, as
plainly appears by comparing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35.
with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12, 13. with the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſcope of the Text, and is of no
greater Reſtraint now, than lay on them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. where they
were permitted to ſing.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay you, If we ſhould ſay ſuch

where are the Hearers, if all be Teachers? <hi>&amp;c.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have ſhewed you Singing is a
diſtinct thing from that which is called Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Preaching, tho in Singing there is a
Teaching, but chiefly we ſpeak to our own
ſelves, as the Apoſtle exhorts, in Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the matter of the Pſalm or Hymn is full of
Teaching and Admonition, yet 'tis the Matter
ſung which teaches, rather than the Singers may
be ſaid to do it: nor is it any Contradiction to
ſay when I teach others, yet I am thereby taught
and admoniſhed my ſelf.</p>
            <p>So that if it were admitted to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or ordinary Teaching, which muſt not be
allowed, and all might be ſaid to teach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet nevertheleſs all are Hearers alſo, and are in
a ſweet manner taught, admoniſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38501:20"/>
in ſinging the Word of Chriſt, in
Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
I have ſhewed: Nor is it any Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſay, according to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle,
Women muſt keep ſilence in the Church, and
yet ſuffer them to ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no more than it
contradicts their Silence, when they ſpeak at
other times, which they are allowed to do.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. You ſpeak of thoſe prophetical
places of the Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> urged by us for
Singing under the Goſpel-days, where all the
Earth is exhorted to ſing unto the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
96. 1. <hi>Pſal. 95. 1, 2. Pſal.</hi> 100. 1, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. This you would have refer to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Apoſtles ſound went
forth into all the Earth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Preaching and Singing together one
time, and Prayer and Singing at another.</p>
            <p>2. You would have it chiefly to refer to the
ſeventh thouſand Years of the World, or Reign
of Chriſt; hinting in your firſt Part as if
then there ſhall be a Singing, beſides the Eſſence
of it in their Spirits: but if that thouſand
Years you ſpeak of, ſhall be before the end of
the World, or Goſpel-Diſpenſation, pray where
lie thoſe Precepts that will authorize them in
thoſe days to ſing, and yet do not authorize,
or warrant us to ſing now? Shall they have a
new Bible for thoſe Times? But if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
for Singing then are contained in our holy
Scripture, and yet do not belong to us; 'tis
good for us to conſider, whether other Precepts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38501:20"/>
written therein, do not wholly refer to thoſe
Times too, nay, all Ordinances, till the Spirit
comes down in an extraordinary manner; and
ſo now we muſt throw off all Goſpel-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
and turn Seekers. I am ſorry to ſee
ſuch Stuff as this publiſhed to the World. But
what I have ſaid or cited from the Writings
of other Godly Men, in reſpect of thoſe
Prophetical Pſalms, and other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that enjoin the Gentile-Churches to
ſing the Praiſes of the Lord, I would have you
and others conſider well of, before you write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. you heap up a company of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
words to no purpoſe, about premeditated
Matter for Prayer, to oppoſe premeditated
Hymns, <hi>&amp;c. Append.</hi> pag. 38, 39, 40, 41,
42, 43, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Form of Prayer Chriſt hath
left us, is a Rule for us in Prayer; and we may
premeditate what we intend to lay before the
Lord, it appears from thence; and ſo is the
Word of Chriſt our general Rule, by which
we muſt premeditate and precompoſe our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Hymns and Songs.</p>
            <p>2. But Prayer and Singing differ the one from
the other; we may uſe other words in Prayer
than what we premeditated, as the Spirit of
God may help us. But we are limited by God's
Word to ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or elſe Hymns and
Spiritual Songs, compoſed out of the Word of
God. Now let them be either, they muſt be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38501:21"/>
words and no more, or elſe none can ſing with
him that has the Hymn. Now we ſay, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Influences for Singing, Preaching,
Interpreting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are gone; therefore every
Ordinance muſt be performed by the ordinary
Gifts and Influences of the Spirit, or elſe we
muſt have none at all.</p>
            <p>Was Singing, or any other Ordinance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the Goſpel-Days by an extraordinary
Spirit, not performed then alſo, and afterwards
as well and as acceptable to God by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gifts? Shew, if you can, that other
Ordinances which had ſuch ſpecial Gifts
then to attend them as well as Singing, do
notwithſtanding remain Ordinances, and yet
Singing of Pſalms and Hymns doth not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
            <p>If therefore a Man ſhould premeditate every
word of his Sermon by the Aſſiſtance of the
Spirit, who dares to ſay he ſpeaks not by the
Help of the Holy Ghoſt, or that his Sermon
is not part of Spiritual Worſhip? 'Tis no
matter whether we have our Sermons or our
Hymns, mediately or immediately, compoſed
and brought forth, provided they be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and done by the help of the Spirit. But
to cloſe all, Are not <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms</hi> part of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Worſhip? and are not the Churches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to ſing them?</p>

In <hi>Sect. 8. Appendix,</hi> pag. 43, 44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
anſwer to what we ſay, That our Pſalms and
Hymns are Spiritual, though precompoſed, you
ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. That ſuch Forms are not Spiritual
Worſhip, becauſe Singing in the Primitive
Goſpel-Times, was from the ſpecial Gift of
the Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>2. Though <hi>(ſay you)</hi> the Matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
Forms of Singing be Spiritual yet
the Heart muſt be Spiritual too, or Grace
and Melody muſt be in exerciſe in performing
of them: The Grace of Joy muſt be raiſed
in the Soul to the heighth of Melody, and ſo
break forth;</q>
               <hi>Or to that purpoſe you ſpeak,</hi>
pag. 44, 45.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We need no more the ſpecial Gift
in Singing, to render our Singing Spiritual,
than thoſe ſpecial Gifts in Preaching to render
our Sermons Spiritual.</p>
            <p>2. As to have Grace in our Hearts, not only
in the Habit, but alſo in the Exerciſe in Singing,
we acknowledg it is neceſſary to a right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it: And ſo 'tis in Prayer, Preaching,
and all other Spiritual Duties of Religion. And
let me tell you, we need no greater aſſiſtance of
the Spirit in Singing, than in Praying or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing;
therefore what ſignifies that which you
ſay <hi>pag. 45. Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The leaſt exerciſe of true Grace in our
Hearts in Prayer, gives Eſſence or Being to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38501:22"/>
Prayer; ſo the leaſt exerciſe of gracious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
Joy, gives Eſſence to inward Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
And <hi>(ſay you)</hi> as we ought not vocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pray in the Publick Worſhip of God in
the Church, without a ſufficient Gift of the
Spirit; ſo alſo we ought not vocally to ſing in
the Church, unleſs it be by a ſufficient Gift
of the Spirit. And ſeeing we have not ſuch
a Gift, we are not capable of vocal Spiritual
Singing.</q> 
               <hi>And ſo we muſt be contented, as
you intimate in</hi> pag. 46. <hi>with the Eſſence of it
in our Spirits only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this way of arguing you may lay
Godly Chriſtians under Temptations about
Prayer, eſpecially in the Church, becauſe they
may plead they have not the Gift; whereas the
Grace of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> a broken Heart, is that
which God chiefly looks at, and ſo ſhould we
too. This makes no more againſt Singing, than
it doth againſt Praying. And thus I muſt argue
upon you, If I have not the ſpecial Gift of
Singing, I muſt content my ſelf with the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of it in my Heart, and yet (as I have
ſhewed) the eſſence of it is not in the Heart as it
is in the Voice; and ſo ſince if I have not the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Gift of Prayer, I muſt be contented with
the Eſſence of Prayer, only Heart-Prayer, and
not pray vocally at all.</p>
            <p>But you intimate, that none ought to ſing
but ſuch who are in the full aſſurance of the
Love of God. But you might as well ſay, none
ought to rejoice in the Lord, nor to praiſe
him, but ſuch only, as well as to ſay what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38501:22"/>
you do here againſt their Singing who want
that aſſurance.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>But you hint, in</hi> pag. 46. as if we muſt
be ſatisfied with your Eſſence of Singing,
<hi>viz.</hi> inward joy in the Heart, till we come
to the primitive perfection of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We doubt not, through Grace, but
we are come to ſuch perfection of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as to know what Goſpel-Worſhip is, and
alſo that we ought not to neglect one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
more than another; becauſe we are not
arrived to the height of Perfection. I am ſure
the way you would lead poor Souls in, is not
to bring them forward towards perfection in
Worſhip, but to keep them back, and hinder
them in preſſing on to that which ſome have
not yet attained unto.</p>
            <p>Moreover, your folly appears too much in
calling our Singing, an Irregular way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
unleſs you had more ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to convince your Reader what you ſay
is true. May be, if you had Truth on your
ſide, you might have anſwered like a Man:
But I am ſatisfied, all wiſe Men will ſay, there
appears nothing leſs than Argument. In both
parts of your Book there are many words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but little elſe as I can ſee.</p>
            <p>If what I have ſaid have no more ſtrength
of Argument and Scripture, and good Senſe
in it for Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. than appears in
your Book againſt it, I do intreat my Reader
to reject what I have ſaid, and eſteem it as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38501:23"/>
worth nothing; but if it be otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
upright, even words of Truth, O then ye Saints
receive this Ordinance, and let what I have
ſaid by the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, be as
Goards, and as Nails faſtened by the Maſter of
Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 10, 13.</p>
            <p>One word more to thoſe Texts in <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Epiſtles, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 19. Col.</hi> 3. 16. where he
enjoins thoſe Churches to <hi>admoniſh one another
in Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> &amp;c.
Can any Man ſuppoſe in theſe words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
exhorts Miniſters to preach, and ſo ſing in
Preaching, or to admoniſh one another to pray,
and ſo to ſing in Prayer?</p>
            <p>How abſurd would it be to affirm either?
Why then, ſay I, he can mean nothing elſe but
this Ordinance of Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object: <hi>But ſay ſome,</hi> Did not the Lord's
People of Old in their Captivity, ſay, How can
we ſing one of the Lord's Songs in a ſtrange
Land? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Under that Diſpenſation, the Lord's
People had a ſpecial and peculiar Right to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Bleſſings; and when they were deprived of
them, and in Exile, they might not ſee they had
that cauſe to ſing the Praiſes of God. But our
Promiſes and Privileges are better and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Spiritual: And therefore under the
Goſpel-Days, we find the Saints ſung in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38501:23"/>
midſt of their greateſt Sufferings; for as our
Sufferings do abound in us, ſo our Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alſo aboundeth by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>2. I know not but we nevertheleſs might
ſee cauſe to refuſe, as they did to ſing the Lord's
Song, at the taunting and reproachful Requeſts
of an inſulting Enemy; the Lord's People
are not to do the Lord's Work at the Devil's
Inſtigation.</p>
            <p>3. But bleſſed be God, we are not in Exile,
we are delivered like Men that dreamed; our
Liberty and Mercies are great, if we do not ſin
them away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the laſt place, conſider how acceptable and
well-pleaſing to God his Praiſes are in a Song;
read</hi> Pſal. 69. 30. I will praiſe the Name of
God with a Song; and will magnify him with
Thankſgiving. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 31. This alſo ſhall pleaſe
the Lord better than an Ox or Bullock that hath
Horns and Hoofs.</p>
            <p>Two things you may obſerve from hence.</p>
            <p>1. That to ſing God's Praiſes, is acceptable
to him.</p>
            <p>2. That 'tis no Ceremonial Rite, but in it
ſelf a Moral Duty.</p>
            <p>Sacrifices appertained to the Ceremonial Law,
and though acceptable to God in their Nature
and Deſign, yet Moral Duties have always had
the preference. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man,
what is good, (i. e.</hi> that excells, that which
God moſt delights in) <hi>to do juſtly, love Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. And this of praiſing God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38501:24"/>
in a Song, ſeems from hence to be a Duty of the
ſame Nature; 'tis not only acceptable, but very
acceptable, it pleaſes God better than ſhadowy
Ordinances, or the Offering of an Ox or
Bullock.</p>

there is no Truth of Chriſt but has
met with its Oppoſers; but though we can't as

yet let us love one another, and let not

undue Citations of ſeveral Learned

Signification of the word Hymnos.
By another Hand.</head>
            <p>THE Foundation of Singing Pſalms,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs in the
Publick Aſſembly of the Saints, is
too firmly laid in Scripture, and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Practice of Chriſtians in general, to
be ſhaken by the New Notions of ſome few
amongſt us, whom I hope the Lord in his time
will lead into the knowledge of this Truth,
and make them ſenſible of their injurous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to overthrow and remove it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> in his late Book and Appendix,
which are anſwered in the preceding Tract;
and no more is intended in theſe few Pages,
but ſome ſhort Remarks on the two firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Appendix. In the firſt whereof
he would not have Praiſing God, confined to
Songs of Praiſe, or Vocal and Melodious Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For my part I know not where he
will find an Antagoniſt in this Point; for
without Controverſy it will be generally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all Creatures, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Capacities, are obliged to praiſe their
great and bountiful Creatour; and the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38501:25"/>
hereof doth not in the leaſt injure the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which he ſtrenuouſly pleads againſt.</p>
            <p>As for his long Citation out of the Learned
Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. to me ſeems very
little for his purpoſe, for the Doctor, after he
had made ſome Reflections on the Tranſlation
of the former part of the Verſe, ſaith, in the

               <q>

<hi>i. e.</hi> in the midſt of the Church
I will ſing Praiſe unto thee: the Original
Heb. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 24. is expreſly render'd; for

                  </gap> be render'd ſimply to Praiſe,
yet its moſt frequent uſe, when it reſpects
God as its Object, is to praiſe by Hymns
or Pſalms, as the Apoſtle here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>ſibi hymnos canam,</hi> I will ſing Hymnes unto
thee; or, <hi>te hymnis celebrabo,</hi> I will praiſe
thee with Hymns; which was the principal
way of ſetting forth God's Praiſe under the
Old Teſtament.</q> Here the Doctor ſhews the
genuine and proper ſignification of the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and although the Doctor in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of this place, extends the ſenſe of the
word to its utmoſt latitude, that it might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all ways whereby our bleſſed Mediator was
to Praiſe the Father: yet certainly he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to exclude that particular way princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
pointed at both in the Hebrew and Greek
word, which we find in the evangelical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſo directly and expreſly accompliſhed,
<hi>Mat. 26. 30. Mark</hi> 14. 26. as were alſo all
other things propheſied concerning him; yet I
grant that the Prophecy had not its full and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38501:25"/>
compleat accompliſhment therein; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Chriſt in the whole Adminiſtration of
his Mediatorial Kingdom, is to ſet forth the
Praiſe and Glory of his Father; and every
Member of his Myſtical Body ſhould concur
with him in this Work, in all the Modes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it can poſſibly be performed; becauſe God
is to be ſerved with all our ſtrength and
might.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is evident that the Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to undermine or overthrow the
Duty of Singing; for herein he would have
oppoſed his own Judgment, which he hath
publiſhed to the World in the account he gives
of the ſeveral parts of Goſpel-Worſhip, where
he makes Singing one, though he terms it a
fond Imagination for any to think that God
cannot be praiſed in the Church without it;
and I doubt not but that all ſober Chriſtians
agree with the Doctor therein.</p>

word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which, whatever he pretends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the generality of its ſignification, moſt
properly denotes a Song of Praiſe; And what
he cites out of the Learned <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.
to favour his Purpoſe, will not ſerve it at all;
for he there intends nothing leſs than a Song
of Praiſe, which is fitly compoſed to be ſung,
as will appear to any one who conſiders the
whole Paragraph without Prejudice; and this
import of the word is agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38501:26"/>
ſenſe of Learned Men, notwithſtanding
what is cited to the contrary. His firſt Citation
is out of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s Lexicon, whence he tells
us that <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> is a Nuptial Song. And
what if it be, it is altogether impertinent in
the preſent Enquiry; for this is a word of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And if he conſults any of them, he may ſoon

cited by him, primarily and chiefly ſignify an
Hymn or Copy of Verſes, made to Praiſe, and
to ſing ſuch an Hymn or Verſe. And as for
the latter word, he ſays alſo, it is uſed for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or pronouncing ſuch an Hymn; and the
reaſon may be, becauſe ſaying or pronouncing
is neceſſarily included in Singing: for Singing is
but a particular Mode of ſaying or pronouncing.
And if it was not thus, I might ſay it is the
common fate of all Words to be ſtretched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their prime and moſt proper Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and who can help it, ſeeing that the Wit
and Fancy of Men, are ſuch luxuriant things,
that will make bold ſometimes, not only with
Words, but Perſons too. The Object of an
Hymn, and Hymning, according to their uſage
in prophane Authors, hath been extended, with
the like liberty, both to Men and Things,
though the primary Object was their Gods.

of this Author, and his Ignorance in

            <p>Next he comes to Mr. <hi>L.</hi> in his <hi>Critica

ſenſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

is agreeable to what was ſaid before from other
Authors. And further to confirm this ſenſe of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38501:27"/>
the word, I might here add, <hi>Zanch. Daven.
Beza,</hi> &amp;c. Then he proceeds to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which he renders <hi>Hymnum cano</hi> I ſing an
Hymn; this word is uſed <hi>Mat. 26. 30. Mark</hi>
14. 26. <hi>Acts 16. 25. Heb.</hi> 2. 12. and in all
theſe places is rendred by <hi>Beza</hi> (who was
eminently skilled in the Greek Tongue) after
the ſame manner, and on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30. he
commends <hi>Eraſmus</hi> for correcting the vulgar
Latin, in changing <hi>dicto Hymno,</hi> the Hymn
being ſaid, to <hi>cùm ceciniſſent Hymnum,</hi> i. e.
when they had ſung an Hymn. On <hi>ver.</hi> 20.
he gives an account out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> of the Jews
manner in eating the Paſſeover, and cloſing
it with an Hymn, conſiſting of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.
and the five immediately following, which the
Jews call their <hi>Magnum Hallelujah,</hi> their great
Song of Praiſe to God; and it is the Opinion of
many Learned Men, that Chriſt ſang this with
his Diſciples, tho <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that Chriſt made
another on that occaſion. Now as to the three
Authors Mr. <hi>M.</hi> mentions out of Mr. <hi>L.</hi> who
differ in their verſion of theſe words, we may
juſtly ſuppoſe that by Praiſes, they mean Praiſes
in Verſe, and by ſaying Praiſes, they mean ſuch
a ſaying as was accompanied with ſinging,
otherwiſe their rendering may be cenſured as
improper.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>M.</hi> proceeds to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 1.
which is derived of <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Hiphil,</hi> ſignifies <hi>hath praiſed,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed;</hi>
and, as it is in other words, the ſenſe
muſt be governed by the Context; and ſo in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38501:28"/>
this place the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> tho render'd by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Montanus,</hi> I will confeſs, yet if he doth
not mean ſuch a Confeſſion as was to be made
by ſinging the Song of Praiſe to God, for his
manifold Benefits beſtowed upon his Church,
his Verſion is not ſo agreeable to the Context,
as that of the Septuagint, who render it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
I will ſing Praiſe; and the like may be ſaid of
his Verſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid in the third Paragraph, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fourth, concerning the rendring
thoſe words before mentioned, and ſome others,
is of little importance in clearing the preſent
Controverſy, ſeeing it is granted already that
God may be praiſed without Singing, tho
Singing is a principal way of ſetting forth the
Praiſe of God, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith. And certainly
that which is the principal way of praiſing
God, ought not to be excluded by Chriſtians;
neither can we think that theſe Tranſlators had
any deſign to do it, ſeeing they uſe ſuch words
as include this as well as other ways of praiſing
God. And whereas Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thinks he hath
got clear and undeniable Evidence for his ſimple
praiſing God only, he hath got none at all,
unleſs <hi>three</hi> be not contained in the number
<hi>four,</hi> becauſe <hi>one</hi> is. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wringing
of the Noſe brings forth Blood;</hi> and ſtraining
the words of theſe Tranſlators, may bring forth
a ſenſe which they never intended. I ſee no
ſuch reſtrictive terms uſed by them, which may
reaſonably be thought to reſtrain the Duty of
Praiſing God to the particular mode of this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38501:28"/>
Author; but if they did intend it, I could (if
the Bounds of my Paper would admit it)
produce ſix or ſeven Tranſlators who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
eſteemed by learned Men very accurate,
who have render'd the words for that way
of praiſing God which is pleaded for in the
foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The Author which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> cites out of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorate</hi>
on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30. pretends it is uncertain
with what words they praiſed God; that is,
whether it was with the common Paſſeover-Hymn,
or ſome other of Chriſt's own, which
might be more ſutable to the occaſion; and
whether they ſang this Praiſe, or ſpake it ſimply,
the following words of the Author not being well
render'd by Mr. <hi>Tymme,</hi> I ſhall ſet down, they are
theſe, <hi>Graecum verbum laudem quidem, maxime
quae Deo debetur, includit; non autem neceſſario
evincit, quòd cecinerint,</hi> i. e. the Greek word
indeed includes Praiſe, chiefly that which is due
to God. But undoubtedly it doth evince, that
they ſang, 1. From the genuine Signification
of the Original Word. And, 2. From the
current of Learned Men who go this way.</p>
            <p>To conclude; I ſincerely deſire that the Lord
would make this Friend ſenſible of the Evil and
Vanity of this Attempt, to remove out of the
Church this part of Religious Worſhip, which
hath been kept up ſo many Ages, both under
the Law, and under the Goſpel.</p>
