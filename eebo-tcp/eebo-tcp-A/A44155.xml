            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. He endeavoured to cleere all doubts that were raiſed by the Letter ſent from his Maieſty to the Lord Maior, withall declaring that their Actions and intentions were imployed to advance his Maieſties Honour.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 92 -->the City requiring their advice, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled him firſt to acquaint the Houſe and to ſhow the ſaid Letter, which councell was approved of and the Letter preſented to the Parliament, who gave Order that a generall Councell ſhould bee held that night at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and that a Committee of Lords and Commons ſhould be there to conſult and determine what were moſt ſecure, and fit to be done, nevertheleſſe the manifold diſtractions and urgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greater importance tooke up ſo much time, that they were inforc't to put it off till a further time for a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, taking into their ſerious conſideration the deplorable eſtate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have by an Order from both houſes of Parliament, appointed that on the two and twentieth day of this inſtant: <hi>June,</hi> all the Commanders ſhould meet at St. <hi>Lawrence Church</hi> at nine of the clocke in the morning, where after a Sermon, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109112:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>Likewiſe an information was given concerning the Lord <hi>Paget's</hi> Iourney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, with the Coppie of a Letter ſent from him, wherein was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the reaſons of his departure, which Letter being read, it was Ordered that enquiry ſhould be made for the Printer, and that the ſaid printed papers ſhould be burnt.</p>
            <p>This day alſo a true intelligence was given, of certaine <hi>Jriſh</hi> Rebels, namely the Lord <hi>Maguieres,</hi> which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Rebellion kept Seven-ſcore Proteſtants two dayes in a Church, and afterward whipt them into a River, and drowned Men, Women and Children, in a moſt inhumane manner, with many more cruelties of the ſame nature, being ſent for by the Parliament, was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and now lyes in the <hi>Tower</hi> with his Comrades, waiting till <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſhall play the Midwife, and deliver them up to the gallowes.</p>
