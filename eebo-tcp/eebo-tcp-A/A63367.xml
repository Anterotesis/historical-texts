            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you of the Jury: The five Priſoners at the Bar; there is a clear proof againſt them, there are four Witneſſes againſt Mr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and they ſay he knew of the deſign, and contrived it, and ſaid he could ſecure <hi>Windſor,</hi> and would endeavour <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidences to like purpoſe: He conſulted about it in his houſe, and expected the word from <hi>Philips.</hi> What better proof than this? And then <hi>Philips</hi> he promiſed to betray the Artillery Arms, and to get the Word, and ſent notice to the meetings to be gone. And <hi>Stubbs</hi> was preſent at the diſcourſe of ſurprizing the Tower and the King, and asked Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> whether he had Arms; it ſeems he enquired about it what ſtrength there was; and when he was preſent it was ſaid the King ſhould have <hi>Ludlows</hi> Quarter, but they deny all. And <hi>Gibbs</hi> tells you, That God is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, and theſe Witneſſes are falſe. You heard the Relation about the Letter concerning the Papiſts, where they call God to witneſs it was true; and they will not ſcruple to tell as bad a lye at the Bar. <hi>Gibbs</hi> ſaith; He can give good teſtimony of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſaid he knew nothing. But this is the news after he had ſpoken with his Brother, the Councel was up, <hi>Ludlow</hi> was to be the General, and all was ready, <hi>Sallows</hi> he ſaith, the Witneſſes do not agree,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101883:11"/>
becauſe but one ſpeaks to the number, though they both agree in the matter. <hi>Riggs</hi> came to a very fit perſon to know about Arms, when he went to Mr. <hi>Sallows,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sallows</hi> told him before there were ſome delivered. You ſee there are four Witneſses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tongue,</hi> and two a piece againſt the reſt: We have cauſe to thank God it wens no further; it is plain that this evil ſpirit went through the Nation: You are to enquire about blood, and the blood of Princes, and of Religion. Put all together, and you have enough for a Verdict againſt them.</p>

               <p>You of the Jury, you underſtand the nature of this buſineſs, and the miſchievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; the Witneſses are unqueſtionable They all agreed to kill his Majeſty, and to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Theſe are boughs that muſt be cut off, for they are fit inſtruments to ſet up a <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and a <hi>Wat Tyler.</hi> One of their own company hath confeſsed the fact; but go together, and conſider of it.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury went together; and when they had ſpent ſome time in the debate, they brought their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the ſeveral Priſoners ſtanding at the Bar, were commanded to hold up their hands; and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being demanded, they ſaid, They were all guilty of the High Treaſon that they ſtood indicted for.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Tongue</hi> being asked what he could ſay why Judgement ſhould not paſs, onely ſaid he deſired the mercy of the King.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tongue, Philips, Hinde, Stubbs, Sallows,</hi> and <hi>Gibbs,</hi> you have been indicted for a very great crime, The ſin of High Treaſon, that is not to be equalled in the World: You have been arraigned, and your Countrey hath brought you in guilty. I find but little ſence of ſin in five of you. This came not from you your ſelves, and you would do good ſervice to diſcover the reſt. You deſire mercy, but what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would you have had, that would have killed ſo many ſouls? Be ſorry for your ſins; you know the good counſel, Fear God and honor the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change; but if you will commit ſin, you muſt expect puniſhment. There is nothing but the Judgement of the Court, and that is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101883:12"/>
                  <hi>That you all ſix be carryed back to the place whence you came, and from thence ſhall be drawn in a Hurdle to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and there you ſhall be hanged up by the neck, and your Members ſhall be cut off, and your Entrails to be thrown into the fire while you are living, and your Head to be cut off, and your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be divided into four quarters, and your Head and Body to be diſpoſed off by the King: And the Lord have mercy upon your Souls.</hi>
