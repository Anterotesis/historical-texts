            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by Our Proclamation of the Thirteenth day of <hi>September,</hi> in the Eighteenth year of Our Reign, for a General Faſt and Humiliation in reference to that Conflagration, We did earneſtly recommend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed eſtate of thoſe who had been undone by that Fire, to the Charity of all good and well diſpoſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Requiring Collections to that purpoſe to be made in all Churches and Chappels, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys Collected to be faithfully and entirely returned up to <hi>London</hi> to the Lord Mayor of that City, or as he ſhould appoint, to be diſtributed amongſt poor Sufferers by that Fire: And whereas We are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the ſaid City, That the Collections intended by that Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have not been ſo made or anſwered as they ought to have been, but in many places omitted and not made at all, and from many parts no Returns at all made: And although many Cities, Towns and places have expreſſed their forward ſenſe and compaſſion of the deplorable eſtate of the ſame Our poor Subjects, by Liberal Contributions, yet the Receipt in the whole falls ſhort of what hath been Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at other times upon like Loſſes in ſmall Towns and Villages; which doth manifeſt the remiſs execution of Our ſaid Proclamation. Therefore, to the end Collections may be made in places where they were omitted, although the time prefixed for making ſuch Collections by the ſaid former Proclamation be elapſed, and that juſt and regular Accompts may be taken, made, and publiſhed for general ſatisfaction, of all the Moneys Collected, and to be Collected, and of the iſſuing and diſtribution thereof to and for the ſaid Charitable uſes and intents; We are graciouſly pleaſed, and by Advice of Our Privy Council, Do hereby ſtrictly Charge and Command, upon pain of Our high Diſpleaſure, and ſuch other Penalties as may by Law be inflicted upon them, That where the ſaid Collections according to the Tenor of Our former Proclamation, have been omitted, All Miniſters, Parſons, Vicars or Curates, ſhall cauſe the ſame to be made in their reſpective Churches or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels on ſome Lords day forthwith after receipt hereof: And that all the preſent Miniſters, Parſons, Vicars or Curates, and Churchwardens, and all Officials, Regiſters, Officers of all Pariſhes and places within Our Realm, where any of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections have been, or ſhall be made; And all Officials, Regiſters, and other Officers concerned, who have received any Moneys for the uſes aforeſaid, ſhall before the Firſt day of <hi>February</hi> now next enſuing, deliver, or ſend in to the High-Conſtables of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Hundreds to which ſuch Pariſhes and Places do belong, a true and perfect Certificate in writing under their hands, and under the hands of the late Churchwardens who were in Office at the time of the ſaid Collections made, of the Total ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Collected, Given, or Contributed in every the ſaid Pariſhes or Places, and to whom the ſame was delivered or paid over to be returned or ſent up to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and how much thereof (if any) is reſting unpaid, and by whom, and in whoſe hands or charge the ſame is ſtill remaining. And that all Churchwardens, and others who have Collected or Received, and not paid, or ſhall Collect or Receive, or otherwiſe have in their hands or charge any of the ſaid Moneys, ſhall before the ſaid Firſt day of <hi>February,</hi> pay the ſame to the ſaid reſpective High-Conſtables of the Hundreds or Diviſions wherein they live; and the ſaid High-Conſtables ſhall and are hereby Required and Commanded to receive the ſaid Moneys, and ſend out their Warrants to the ſaid Miniſters, Churchwardens, and others, to bring in the ſaid Certificate, and to pay the ſaid Money accordingly. And that the ſaid High-Conſtables ſhall forthwith after the ſaid day, ſend or deliver the ſaid Certificates, together with what Pariſhes or Places have not certified, unto the Sollicitors appointed in the ſeveral Counties by the Lords Commiſſioners of Our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury for the Eleven moneths Aſſeſſment, from the Six and twentieth day of <hi>January,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred ſixty and ſeven: And that the ſaid Sollicitors ſhall and are hereby Required and Commanded without delay to tranſmit the ſame Certificates to the Chamberlain of the City of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, for and to the end a perfect Accompt may be thereupon ſtated and made up of the ſaid Receipts; and in the ſaid Certificates to return the names of the Pariſhes and Places that have neglected their duty: And alſo that the ſaid High-Conſtables ſhall with all expedition after receipt of the ſaid Moneys from the ſeveral Perſons, Pariſhes and Places within their Conſtableries, pay over the ſame to the General-Receivers of the ſaid Eleven moneths Aſſeſſment in their ſeveral Counties reſpectively; and the ſaid General-Receivers ſhall alſo forthwith after the receipt of the Moneys from the ſaid High-Conſtables, remit and pay the ſame to the Chamberlain of the City of <hi>London</hi> for the time being: And in caſe they cannot find ways ſafety to remit the ſame as aforeſaid, That they give notice thereof to the Chamberlain aforeſaid, that care may be taken for the ſpeedy bringing it into the hands of the ſaid Chamberlain, to be diſpoſed and imployed for Relief and Succour of the ſaid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Poor, as is intended and directed by Our Former Proclamation. And that all perſons concerned may take notice of this Our Royal Pleaſure and Command, It is Our further Will and Pleaſure, That the Sheriffs of Our reſpective Counties and Cities do cauſe this our Proclamation to be ſo diſtributed, as that it may be Read in all Churches and Chappels on the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which will be the Third Lords-day in the moneth of <hi>November</hi> next enſuing.</p>
