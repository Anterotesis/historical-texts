            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Church of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acknowledged and declared His Majestie's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in Causes Ecclesiastical,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 2.</note> to be of the same Nature and Extent with that Authority that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors claim'd and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the Primitive Church: I deem'd it no unuseful piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to my King and Country, to inform my self and my Fellow-Subjects out of the Records of those times of our true Duty to the Royal Supremacy. And to this end I have drawn up as exact a Chart, as my little Skill could reach, of the Primitive Practice of the
<pb facs="tcp:63060:3"/>
Three first Centuries after the Empire became Christian. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I only Surveyed and coasted the general History, but have sounded every part of it, and not only described the safe Passages and right Chanels through which the abler Pilots steer'd their Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: but the Shallows, the Gulfs, the Rocks, and the Sands, upon which the less Skilful or less For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Shipwrackt their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither have I presumed to make any Political Remarks of my own; but have only observed the Natural and Historical Events of Matters of Fact. And by the Experience of 300 years, in which all Experiments were tryed, we are fully instructed in all the right and all the wrong Measures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Christian Church. In the Reigns of the great <hi>Constantine, Jovian, Gratian, Theodosius</hi> the Great, <hi>Arcadius, Honorius, Theodosius</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:63060:3"/>
younger, <hi>Marcian, Leo, Justin</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> are exemplified the Natural good Effects of abetting the Power of the Church by good Laws, and their effectual Execution. In the Reigns of <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> we may observe the inevitable Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of Toleration and Liberty of Conscience. In the Reigns of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> but especially of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Anastasius,</hi> are to be seen the fatal and bloody Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of pretended Moderation, or (as we phrase it) comprehension, that indeed unites all Parties, but then it is like a Whirlpool, into one common Gulf of Ruin and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This is the short account of this Undertaking, and the Historical Events of things being withal so very Natural, they will of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves amount to a fair Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Necessity of Discipline in the Church and Penal Laws in the State. All that I can ensure for
<pb facs="tcp:63060:4"/>
the Performance, is its Truth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; I have faithfully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially perused all the most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and Original Records both of Church and State, and out of them, and them alone have Collected the ensuing History, and if that prove true, (and for that I stand bound) the Conclusion that I aim at will make it self.</p>

                  </note> as <hi>Sozomen</hi> suggests, the contentiousness of the Bishops, who, he says, under <hi>Julian,</hi> when the Christian Religion lay at stake, pieced together for the security of the common Cause, as 'tis the custom of all Men, to make peace and join forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a common Enemy, but as soon as the danger is blown over, to return to their old Fewds and Animosities. The observation in general is too true, but not rightly applyed to this particular case: for the ground of the quarrel here, was not the natural contentiousness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whilst in a condition of peace, as the Historian remarks; in that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox had never pieced with any of the other Parties, either <hi>Eusebians</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacians</hi> under <hi>Julian,</hi> but as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready seen casheir'd and condemn'd them both, and setled the Nicene Faith. So that under <hi>Jovian</hi> there was no new breach, but even according to <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s own account, the new contest was raised by the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Bishops, that had lost their Bishopricks under <hi>Constantius,</hi> after the Councils of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> when they were over-reach't by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacians.</hi> And that is the Argument of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63060:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Petition to this Emperor, that things might stand, as they were left by those Councils, and that all after acts might be null'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> that themselves might be restored to their Bishopricks. That was the present quarrel, and no dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the setled Faith, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared for the Nicene Confession. And therefore the <hi>Acacians</hi> upon their complaint against them for the <hi>Aëtian</hi> Heresy, immediately protest against it, to secure their Preferments. And that was all along the state of this Controversy, both before and after this time, the zeal of good Men on one side for the true Faith, and the Arts of ill Men on the other for Preferment and Court-favor. This is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto evident from the beginning of the quarrel of <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and will appear as clearly in all the same Contests as long as they last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under the succeeding Emperors.</p>

So that there is in reality no Government, and every-man does what is good in his own Eyes, wickedness is boundless, and the People stubborn, the Bishops trim and dare not speak out, for having acquired their Power by Men,

they are Slaves to all by whose help and Patronage they were advanced. With much more to the same purpose, from whence we fully understand the true Face of the Church, and the right State of the Controversie at that time, to displace ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men upon pretences of Religion, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get into their Preferments, as farther appears from their wild way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is there described.

This was the deplorable state of the Church at that time under <hi>Valens</hi> and his Eunuchs, for the redress whereof, not only <hi>Meletius,</hi> but <hi>Athanasius</hi> and St. <hi>Basil</hi> wrote to the Western Bishops, to implore the Assistance of the Western Church and Empire. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> his Letters are lost, <note n="(l)" place="margin">Epist. 70.</note> but that of St. <hi>Basil</hi> is very remarkable for its Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Ingenuity.

               <p>But among these various Transactions, the great <hi>Athanasius</hi> dies, about the year 371, or 372, perhaps sooner or later, for I am not concerned in Chronological Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, my Business is to trace the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Truth, not to turn Hour-glasses, or watch the Motions of Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums. But his Fall was the occasion of great stirs in the Church, both Parties being at such a time highly concern'd for a fit Successor to so great a Man, and so great a See: <hi>Peter</hi> a grave and ancient Presbyter of that Church, was by the dying recommendation of <hi>Athanasius</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously chosen, but <hi>Euzoius</hi> the Arian Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> upon the first News of the Vacancy flies to Court, to move for his Friend <hi>Lucius,</hi> who had been join'd in Ambassy with him to <hi>Jovian</hi> against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and by the help of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs succeeds, and is sent to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> with <hi>Magnus,</hi> a great Court-Trader in the Cause; but before they came the Praefect of the City, a zealous Heathen, had driven <hi>Peter</hi> into Banishment, and when they came, the People were so averse to the Intruder, that they were forced to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63060:24"/>
place him in the See by Military Power, upon which, what bloody Tumults and Disorders followed, may be seen in all the Historians, but most accurately in <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somewhat before this time arose the Heresie of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> consisting of a great many Prophane or rather wanton Novelties, the chief whereof was, That our Saviour had no other Soul, than the Divinity it self; and the Conceit, because it was a new one, began to take very much among the People, who naturally run after any thing that is strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual. But it is soon quasht by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Pastors of the Church; and that not only by Writing, though all the Learned Men of that Age appear'd against it, as <hi>Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyssen.</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>; but much more effectually by the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church.

But however the Heresie was soon quasht by that unanimous Agreement of all Churches to suppress it every where by executing the effectual Discipline of the Church upon all its Followers. In so much that I can not call to Mind more than one Imperial Law against them at that time, and that was enacted by <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> in the year 397. against their secret Conventicles at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

                     <hi>de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. l.</hi> 23.</note> by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script bearing date the year 376, that the same Custom should be observed in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Affairs, as was in Civil Causes, that Controversies belonging to Religion, should be judged by the Synod of the Diocess, but all criminal Causes should be reserved to the Audience of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Governors. Not to inquire at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent into the particular occasion of this Law, which <hi>Gothofred</hi> conjectures was made in the controversy of punishing the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> with the Sword, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the practice of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and so this learned Civilian divides all Controversies into Causes ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and political, the Ecclesiastical into Controversies of Faith or Discipline, these, he says, appertain to the Church. The political are divided into Causes pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Causes criminal, and these, he says, appertain to the Civil Power. This I know is the common state of the bounds of Jurisdiction, and has made great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions in <hi>Christendom,</hi> whilst both Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers contend to keep their own ground: and especially since the power over the Catholick Church was swallowed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the papal Omnipotency, what troubles have the Popes given the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, for daring to intermeddle with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63060:29"/>
Matters? But this Argument of the bounds of Jurisdiction I shall fully state, when I have first set down the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it in matter of Fact, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I need at present only say that it is a dangerous Mistake to divide them by the different Matters about which they are conversant, when they are both conversant about the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and unless they are so, both of them will be too weak to attain the ends of their Institution. Yet because it is the fundamental Mistake on both sides, and because I may never come to finish this wide undertaking, and lastly because I find it to be the great stumbling block to the wiser and more judicious Men of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I shall here a little briefly consider its consequence. <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                     <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. § 4.</note> The learned <hi>Petrus de Marca</hi> one of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Writers of that Church affirms, and believes the bounds of these two Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to be so plainly determin'd by the Matters themselves, about which they are imployed, that no Man can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly miss their true boundaries, that does not industriously over-look them, in that it is so evident that the regal Power extends only to things secular, and the Ecclesiastical to things spiritual. Whereas on the contrary nothing is more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63060:30"/>
evident, than that all Actions are both Secular and Spiritual, the same Action as it relates to the peace of the World, and the Civil Government of Mankind is of a secular Nature, and as it is a moral Vertue, and required by the Law of God as a duty of Religion, so it is of a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nature. And so on the other side, those things that are esteem'd Spiritual, yet as they have an influence upon the publick Peace (and nothing has a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) they must come under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the civil Government. So that these Jurisdictions are so far from being distinguisht by the Objects about which they are conversant, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways both equally extended to the same Objects, so as that if we limit either to one sort of Actions, we destroy both. For to take Matters spiritual in their strictest acceptation, and as they are vulgarly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, for the Offices of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and especially the publick Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are performed by the Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Order in the publick Assemblies, yet if the Sacerdotal Power reach not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this to secular things, it can never reach its end, for that is to procure the future happiness of the Souls of Men, and that very much depends upon their good or bad behavior in the Affairs of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63060:30"/>
this life; so that if their spiritual Guides and Governors are barr'd from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in all such Matters, they are cut off from the chief part of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and what remains, will be too weak to attain its end, for when Men have been never so careful in all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Religion, yet if care be not taken to regulate the Actions of humane inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, all their Devotion will avail them very little in the World to come. So on the other side, when the Civil Power has done all that it can, to settle and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the quiet of the Common-Wealth, by the wisest Laws of Justice and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, yet if they may not take notice of what Doctrins are instill'd into their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by their Teachers, or what divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or commotions are raised by them in the Church, they may soon be involved into disturbance or confusion, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Power to relieve themselves. I am not at present concern'd to prove that this is now actually done by any Party of Men, it is enough to my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that it is a possible thing to disturb the peace of Government, under Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or by Mistakes of Religion, or to pray and preach Men into Rebellion. And if it be so, then the consequence is unavoidable that it must be subject to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63060:31"/>
power of the Civil Magistrate, if that be any of its Office to take any care of the peace and quiet of the World. But in truth this distinction has been all along chiefly cherisht by the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> since the time of their Usurpation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when they had got all the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power of the Church into their own hands, their next care was to hug and keep it intire to themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they confin'd the Power of Princes wholly to Matters of State, but as for all things, that concern'd the Church, they were bound with all submission to resign themselves to his Holinesses Orders, and if they presumed to gain-say any of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, though never so prejudicial to their own Affairs, it was open defyance to Holy Church, and though the Popes never proceeded any farther against him, as none of them did, till <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> yet that alone was at that time a forfeiture of the Affections of his best Subjects, <hi>i. e.</hi> all those plain and good People, that have any real love or value for their Religion. And this one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone gave the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they had never proceeded to the scandalous boldness of deposing Princes, an absolute Empire and Authority over all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Christendom.</hi> And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63060:31"/>
that they were the high flying Popes, that were the chief sticklers for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this distinction, as appears not only from the Collection of <hi>Gratian,</hi> Distinct. 69. where it is largely exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but from <hi>Petrus de Marca</hi> himself, warranting the truth of this Doctrin from the Authorities of <hi>Gelasius, Symmachus, Gregory</hi> the second, <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the first, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> the third, who in their several high Contests with the Emperors, that indeavour'd to check and bridle their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Insolence, still bid them mind their own business, and not presum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to meddle with the Church, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof was intrusted to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors. But their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been even with them, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Erastian</hi> Hereticks (for what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heresy can there be in the Church, than to take away the very Being of the Church) by distinguishing between the sacred Function, which they grant to be the proper office of the Church, and the Power over sacred things, which they annex intirely to the Civil Power, by which distinction they leave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church no other Power, than to administer the Offices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any Power of punishing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders against the Laws of Religion, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63060:32"/>
then they have none at all, for there can be no power without a Power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Penalties. And there lyes the true distinguishing point between these two Jurisdictions, not in the Matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which their Power is imployed, but in the Penalties, by which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. Thus to be short and give one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for all, whereas <note n="(g)" place="margin">

                  </gap> or Sins against the Laws of the State. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is so far from being true, that both Powers are equally concern'd in both Crimes, for if any Clergy-man disturb the Government, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did by a Contest about a Canon of the Church, then though it were an Ecclesiastical sin, it concern'd the Civil Government to check the Mischief by the proper Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sedition, as <hi>Honorius</hi> drove them into banishment, and thereby restored the long interrupted Peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And on the other hand, if any Clergy-Man, let him be never so regular to the Laws and Rules of the Church, shall in a state-Faction ingage in a Rebellion against his Soveraign, that is properly a Political sin, the Church is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63060:32"/>
bound to inflict such Penalties upon him, as are denounced by the Laws of their Religion against all Traitors and Rebels, <hi>i. e.</hi> to cast him out of their Society, and the capacity of Salvation. And that is the only difference in the case, that when the King cuts a Traitor off for this life, the Church cuts him off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the next, and so it is in all other Crimes, where the Prince punishes for breach of the Laws of the Land, the Church puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes proportionably for breach of the Laws of Religion. And as by the Laws of the Land the Penalty is proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Crime, so is it by the Laws of the Church: for as some Offences are Capital, and some only Penal in the State, so in the Church, some are punisht by Penance, some by utter excision or cutting off from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the same thing in its kind, as cutting off life in this World. So that the same Crimes are so far from belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to different Judicatures, that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to both, the only difference is, that one punishes here, and the other hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And now this one observation of the difference of Penalties in the same cause being supposed, which cannot be be avoided, without destroying or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching upon the Rights of Church or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63060:33"/>
State, the bounds of Jurisdiction are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough without splitting of Causes, and it is easy enough to understand how the same Causes belong to both Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from their different ends, without setting any restraint to either Power. And thus having in this short digression, as briefly as I could, secured this point of the Controversy, which is the main Hinge upon which depends the disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Contention of both the extreme Parties, both Papal and <hi>Erastian,</hi> I now return to the course of the History, which was broke off at the year 376. <note n="(h)" place="margin">

Here I must confess that I <note n="(†)" place="margin">Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church § 20.</note> once thought this Law an invasion upon the Rights of the Church, by confounding the old bounds of Provinces, and destroying the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> because they were chosen without regard to either; but having now traced its history more accurately by comparing the Imperial Laws with the Records of the Church, (and indeed it is impossible to gain a full knowledg of either, without a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledg of both) and so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time and occasion of enacting it, it plainly clears it self from any such ill suspicion. For first, if it were made before the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as some will have it, it was then but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Provision, till a better settlement could be made by the approaching
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63060:36"/>
Council, and therefore if it had been an intrenchment upon the Church, it was not design'd to be perpetual, but was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as the best expedient, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Times would admit, and all necessity is its own dispensation. But if it were enacted after the Council, and if its Date be not mistaken, and so it was, for the Council sat in <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and this bears date <hi>August,</hi> then it is only a confirmation of the Decree of the Church, that had settled the Nicene Faith. But which soever it was, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Communicatory Bishops was no alteration either of the bounds or the Rules of Discipline, for the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Government of Provinces under <hi>Metropolitans</hi> stood as before, but it was only a Rule to his own Officers, not to deliver up Churches to any that did not bring Certificates from some of these Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but when they brought them, they were to be admitted after the usual manner; if Presbyters, by the Bishop and his Synod of Presbyters; if Bishops, by the Metropolitan and his Synod of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Neither can any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd for equalling Diocesan Bishops or preferring them above Metropolitans, by <hi>Nectarius</hi> his being made the first Man in the Instrument, for it was no
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63060:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
matter of power but of trust, the Emperor chose them not with any regard to their Authority, but from his knowledg of their Integrity in the Orthodox Faith, and therefore being best acquainted with <hi>Nectarius</hi> the Bishop of his own City, and his old Favourite, he naturally named him in the first place, and the rest proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the information of others. This is all that I can find intended by this Emperor's erecting this Committee of Communicatory Bishops, it was to guide himself and his Officers, not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Church. And now are we come to the great Council of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> whose main business it was to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Nicene Faith, and anathematise the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresy, and all the Sects that had been spawn'd out of it; but because the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had as we have seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, so often own'd the Nicene Faith, and particularly in the Council at <hi>Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacus,</hi> the good Emperor in hopes to bring them over, <note n="(c)" place="margin">

dissenters from it by name, make some Canons useful for the present settlement of the Church, and give an account of their proceedings to his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in these words. <hi>That meeting at</hi> Constantinople <hi>in obedience to his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they had preserved Peace among themselves, confirm'd the Nicene Faith, anathematised all Heresies, that had been raised against it, enacted divers Canons for the due settlement of the discipline of the Church, they now request his Majesty that he would be pleased to ratifie the Decrees of the Council, that as they were call'd together by his Imperial Letters, so he would be pleased to give an effectual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion to their Decrees.</hi> That was the true state of the Church under his wise reign, as it was under <hi>Constantines,</hi> to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them to Council by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and leave them to the liberty of their own determinations, and then if he pleased, to inforce them by his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Laws and Penalties. And that he did to purpose, for beside the former Law of Communicatory Bishops, that was most probably publisht at this time, he enacted <note n="(p)" place="margin">

particularly at that time great Tumults were raised by the <hi>Anthropomorphite</hi> Monks.

settled things in as good a posture, as he could in the East, prevails at the same time with the young <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who by the instigation of his Mother <hi>Justina,</hi> had been a great Patron of the Hereticks, to publish the same severe Rescript a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them in the West, that himself at his first coming to the Empire had ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the East, and to cancel the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Law, that he had two years before made in their behalf, <hi>viz.</hi>

And first of all <hi>Auxentius</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to a dispute before the Emperor then only a <hi>Catechumen</hi>; but the Bishop disdains the Motion, that when the Faith had been so fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by so many Councils, he should prostitute the divine Authority of the Church, by referring it to a secular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, but chiefly by making a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen</hi> supreme Judg of the Faith. But <hi>Dalmatius</hi> the <hi>Tribune</hi> is sent by the Emperor to command his appearance, upon which advising with some Bishops, that were then present with him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns his Answer in writing, in which with equal courage and modesty he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him for medling with things that did not originally belong to his Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so proceeds to state the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Emperors in Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from the practice of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. And it was then but time to be hot in the Cause, this being the first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen breach, that was made upon the Church; for though <hi>Constantius</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten done it underhand or rather unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, yet what he did, was by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Authority of Councils, but this is the first time that any Prince challeng'd a Power to judg of Faith by his Imperial Authority. And as it hapned, it was as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63060:40"/>
good a season as the Experiment could have been tryed in, when the Tryal fell upon such a Man as St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> a Man of infinite Courage and Integrity, and he has distill'd the very Spirit of both into his Reply, the short of it is this. <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. Epist. 32.</note>
                  <q>Sir I hope I return you a sufficient Answer, though I come not to Court upon the Errand that I am sent for, neither let any Man judg me contumacious, when I only maintain what your Father of blessed Memory was not only wont to say in discourse, but to enact by Law, That in Causes of Faith or Ecclesiastical Discipline, he alone ought to be Judg, who is qualified for it by Right and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. He would have Bishops judg of Bishops, nay if a Bishop were guilty of Crimes of any other nature, he was pleased to refer them also to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Judicature. But when, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Gracious Sir, did you ever hear, that Lay-men made themselves Judges of a Bishop in a Cause of Faith? No, Sir, I cannot crouch to so mean a Flattery, as to forget my Sacerdotal Trust, that I should part with it to any other, when God has committed it to my Charge. If a Bishop is to be taught by a Laick, let the Laick preach too. Believe me, Sir, it is certain both from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63060:41"/>
the Holy Scriptures, and the practice of the whole Church, that in matters of Faith, Bishops are to guide Emperors, and not Emperors Bishops. Execute, if you please, your late bloudy Law upon me, <hi>Ambrose</hi> is not so much worth, that for the sake of his own poor self he should prostitute not only his own Priest-hood, but the dignity of all the Bishops. If there be any Controversy of Faith, know, that it is their business to decide it, as was done under the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> who prescribed nothing to the Bishops, but left them to their own liberty of Judgment, and the same was the practice under his Son <hi>Constantius,</hi> thô what was well begun, was afterward perverted. For the Bishops agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Orthodox Faith, whil'st some few would have the thing determin'd at Court, whereby they at last imposed upon the Bishops, who as soon as they understood the cheat, recall'd their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ratified the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith. (This has a peculiar reference to the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi>) In short, Sir, if <hi>Auxentius</hi> desire a Council, though it is by no means fit that so many Bishops should be put to so much trouble by the petulancy of one Man, who though he were an Angel from Heaven, ought not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63060:41"/>
to be regarded, if he oppose the Peace of the Church, whenever a Council is call'd I shall not absent my self.</q>
This is the sum of his resolute Answer, as far as it concerns my Argument, where we see that the Power of Judicature in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith was always own'd to be an unalienable Right in the Governors of the Church, and was never challenged by any Emperor before this young Prince, who was boisterously thrust upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it by the importunity of a furious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her <hi>Scythian</hi> Priest. And they having now begun the Work, resolve to go through with open force, and for that end, procure a Law for the ejectment of Catholick Bishops out of their Churches, under Penalty of Death to all those that refuse to resign them, and for the first execution of it, send a Party to seize St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and take possession of his Church. But the People defend the Doors. The Officers command him in the Emperor's Name to deliver up his Church and the Goods of it. At this the People are afraid that he will comply. <hi>No,</hi> says he, <hi>fear not that, I cannot forsake my Flock, and deliver it up to the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anship of a Woolf. If they will dispossess me by force, they may carry away my Body, but not my Mind. I am ready to submit
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63060:42"/>
to any thing that the Imperial Power can inflict, but as long as I can, I must and will discharge the duty of my Priestly Office. Why then are you troubled, I will never willingly forsake you; if I am forced, I must not resist; I can mourn and weep and pray, my Tears are Arms against the</hi> Goths, <hi>these are our Priestly Weapons, any other way I neither ought nor can resist.</hi> And as for delivering up the Goods of the Church, he tells the Officers, <hi>Gentlemen, if the Emperor be pleased to command any thing that is my own, I would freely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And thus things stood three whole days; St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> would not deliver up his Church, nor the Emperor durst not take it by force. And when the Courtiers perswaded him to go in Person and turn him out, he replyed, <hi>I thank you for that, for if</hi> Ambrose <hi>should command you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me up bound into his hands, you would obey him,</hi> and therefore for fear of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63060:42"/>
farther mischief he was forced to desist, though by his proceeding so far, he brought great disgrace upon himself, in so much that the Tyrant <hi>Maximus</hi> wrote a smart Letter to him to upbraid him with the folly and dishonor of his Attempt; it is very well written, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this was done in order to his Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Italy,</hi> to ingage the Orthodox on his side, as if he had taken up Arms to vindicate their Cause, for the Rescript of <hi>Valentinian</hi> reacht not St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> alone, but all Churches under the Emperor's Jurisdiction, as appears not only by the Rescript it self, but by the Tyrants E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle. <hi>Audivi enim novis Clementiae tuae Edictis, Ecclesiis Catholicis vim illatam fuisse, obsideri in Basilicis sacerdotes, mulctam esse propositam, paenam capitis adjectam, et legem sanctissimam sub Nomine nescio cujus legis everti.</hi>

And so the next news we hear of the Tyrant, is his declaration of open War, by which the young unadvised Emperor being in a great distress, supplicates St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to undertake an Ambassy, to disswade the Tyrant from his Design, which he frankly and readily undertakes, <note n="(c)" place="margin">

And as for all Bishops that had own'd commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Tyrant, he disown'd and defyed all communion with them.

And here the Method of talking the People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tumults is very accurately described by the <note n="(i)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Soc. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> Historian. It is (says he) the natural Genius of some men to fain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and when there is any great Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saction upon the Stage, every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them as himself is inclined, and withal improves the Lye with some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessional Invention for the Advantage of his own Party; and so it was at this time at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there was a great War a great way off, about which every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented man divulged his own Tale, always hoping and presuming the issue of things on the worst side, and when the War was not so much as begun, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe all its turns and motions as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately as if themselves had been Spectators of the Battel, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Tyrant had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63060:45"/>
utterly routed the Emperor's Army, that such and such numbers were slain on both sides, and that the Emperor himself was taken Prisoner. Upon this the <hi>Arians,</hi> without any more to do, being enraged that their Churches, that they had so long possest, should be taken away from them by those Men that they had so long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, improve and aggravate the Story, and by telling it with so much assurance, perswade the first Authors of it, that it was really and indeed true. So that thô they received it only by the report that others had raised, they now make the first Founders believe their own Lye, by assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that it was true of their own knowledge. And upon this the <hi>Arian</hi> Rabble take Confidence, run into Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and burn down the Bishop's Palace. This is the natural way of talking People into Confusion. But the Emperor being inform'd of these Disorders, at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of his Son <hi>Arcadius,</hi> whom he left there in his absence, forgave the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, though as to their lying pretence of Liberty of Conscience, he publishes <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. l.</hi> 16.</note> an Edict to declare to all the World that he never granted any such indulgence, and to command them to be punisht ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his known Laws. And in the year 389, he publishes <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 17.</note> a Rescript par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63060:45"/>
to outlaw the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> that were boldest of all the Factions, by which they were made uncapable either of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their own Will, or receiving any benefit from another's Will, any manner of way, directly or indirectly, by Trustees, or any other Devices, but that the Estates of all such Persons should be immediately forfeited to the Crown. This Law has occasion'd great Disputes among the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Lawyers, being particularly made against the <hi>Eunomiani Spadones,</hi> the <hi>Eunomian</hi> Eunuchs, about the meaning of which words they cannot agree, and after a great Variety of Conjectures to be seen in <hi>Gothofred</hi>'s Notes upon it, he himself is confident that the word is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted for <hi>Histapodes,</hi> i. e. Men standing upon their Heads, it being one of the absurd Customs of that Sect, that when they rebaptized any Catholicks that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized to them, to Baptize them with their Heads downwards, and their Heels upward, whence they received the Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Histapodes.</hi> But it is strange that we should never hear of this word but in this Law, for he brings no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it, and though there is Evidence of such a Custom, yet there is none of such a Word, and therefore I think there is no need of any such far-fetcht Curiosity,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63060:46"/>
when the words are so intelligible in their natural sense against the Court-Eunuchs, that had been all along the Patrons of this Faction, and so were to be restrain'd by this Law of forfeiture of Estates, being generally Men of great Wealth; No, says <hi>Gothofred,</hi> that was only under <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>; yes, say I, they first set up their Trade of Simony under him, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it in all following Reigns, and did all that Mischief that was brought upon the Church under this Emperor's Predecessor <hi>Valens</hi>; and therefore for preventing this Disorder for the time to come in these great Courtiers, he forbids them to act at all for these Hereticks under the great Penalty of Confiscation of their whole Estate. Or rather it is most probable that <hi>Eunuch</hi> was become a Proverbial Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name to the whole Party, for the Trade between the Court Eunuchs and the <hi>Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> was so notorious under <hi>Valens,</hi> that it might in just derision be named the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchean Sect.</hi> This is, I fancy, the most easie sense of the words.

In the years 392 and 394, to all the former Edicts and Penalties he publishes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts against all Ordination by Hereticks under a severe Pecuniary Mulct upon the Persons both Ordaining and Ordain'd. The same Law that his Son <hi>Honorius</hi> at first executed against the Donatists, as we have seen in the History of that Schism. The last Law that he made about these Matters, was to abrogate the 17th Law that disabled the <hi>Eunomians</hi> from making Wills, and as he often, as well as all other Emperors, varied his Laws upon Reasons of State, so he had now some particular Reason that induced him to reverse this, and what that was, is not to be known but by Conjecture; he was then departing to the War against <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and so was willing to leave all People
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63060:47"/>
as easie and peaceable as he could, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Courtiers, if the Law referr'd to them, or the whole Party, whom its severity had made Malecontents. And therefore this Indulgence was in a short time after, taken away by his Son <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> this Emperor dying in his return home, and before he could reverse it. But the most usual reason of their altering their Rescripts, were the various Tempers of their Ministers of State. The former Laws were enacted when <hi>Tatianus</hi> was <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> a Vigorous and an Active and an experienced Man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted them with all severity. But this was made when <hi>Rufinus</hi> succeeded to the Office, who being at his first entrance upon it more wary, though otherwise of a bold Temper, advised the Suspension of that severe Law for those nice times, and as soon as they were over, again advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed its execution. And thus this great Prince broke the heart of the Faction by abetting the Sentence of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them with vigorous Laws: And that had been sooner done, had they been more vigorously executed by his Judges and Officers, whose Neglect or Connivance was the reason of his so often renewing the same Law. And there indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lyes the greatest Miscarriages of all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63060:47"/>
Governments. And of this his Son <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was so convinced, both by his Father's and his own Experience, that he made all his Laws effectual by annexing severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties upon their non-execution.</p>

But beside these Laws to back these new Decrees of the Church against Hereticks and Heresies, he enacted others by his own Authority to rescue the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rules of Discipline, that were grown obsolete by the abuses and corruptions of time.

Service but her own. And in the same Rescript commands, That all Women who shave their Hair upon pretence of Religion be cast out of the Church, which was done not only in pursuance of the rule of the Apostle, and the Canons of the Church, particularly the Council of <hi>Gangra,</hi> that was then taken into the Codex of the Laws Ecclesiastical, but of the Law of Nature it self to prevent the Confusion of Sexes, the distinction being chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by this Custom. This Rescript was publisht in <hi>July,</hi> but in <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clause disabling Deaconesses to dispose of their Moveables by Will to Pious and Charitable Uses, is reverst, provided the Will be made in time of Health, and not upon their Death-beds, when they might be too apt to be imposed upon by Superstition and the Frauds of Priests. At the first Law <note n="(q)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> takes fire, as if it were a violent restraint of Devotion to God, and Charity to the Poor, and an Abridgement of the Priviledges of Holy Church, which therefore, he says, was soon cancel'd by the Advice of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that great Assertor of Ecclesiastical Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> had any hand in reversing it, we have no Authority of any Historian that I know of but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal himself. But beside by his leave,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63060:48"/>
such restraining Laws are requisite, nay necessary in all Commonwealths; for there is nothing so Prodigal as Superstition, and wherever there is Religion, that will creep into great numbers of the People, and therefore it concerns the Government eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, to take care that Families and the Publick be not defrauded by Prodigal Zeal or under pretence of Devotion.

And in truth this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture (and so it is, when it is imposed by the Artifice of the Priests upon the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the People, (grew so exorbitant in the times of Superstition, that almost all the States of Christendom were forced to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63060:49"/>
make Statutes of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> as well as we in <hi>England,</hi> and it was such a Law, that was the ground of that famous Quarrel between <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But though former Ages were so wise as to stay their hand when they supposed the Church had enough for it self and the Poor (for in those days they were no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Charge, but were the care of the Church) yet they were never so Prophane and Sacrilegious, as to Strip and Plunder her, when they were pleased to imagine that she had too much. That is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Glory of our last worthy Age of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when some great Pretenders swept away its Abuses and Revenues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Reforming Rectories, that were a competent maintenance for Men of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, into Vicaredges, the meanness of whose Revenues cannot but expose the poor Incumbents to the contempt of the People; for be the Men what they will, or do they what they can, not only the Common People, but all men, will tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their Poverty. And when all is done, that is the true ground of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Clergy: Though there are many more Reasons for it, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness of the Age, and contempt of the Function it self, though that in a great measure first comes from the contempt of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63060:50"/>
the Men and their Poverty: The wicked licentiousness of the Schismaticks in venting perpetual Lies and Calumnies against all Men that are truly honest for the Church: yet the bottom of all other Contempts, and that which will make them everlasting, is this Remediless Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. And it is to be fear'd that the curse of God has, and does hang very heavy over this Nation for this wrong done to himself, and I doubt will never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, till some Publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But to return to the Series of the History, as this Prince reform'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the abuse of Widows and Deaconesses, so did he correct the disorders of Monks, or the Professors of solitary life (for the first Monks were properly Hermites) and enlarge or contract their Priviledges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Will or Pleasure, or according to the Temper of the Times.

               <p>But the most observable Act of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is his Law to restrain the abuse of Ecclesiastical immunity, or the Sanctuary of Christian Churches, where all sorts of Persons that escaped to them, were prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Clergy against the Execution of the Law, and they were grown so bold in the abuse of that Privilege, that they would not deliver them up till they had sued out their Pardon,<note place="margin">9 <hi>Cod.

Now as to such Laws as these, it is evident, that the Soveraign Power is enabled to enact them in both Capacities, both as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and as a Christian Sovereign; and therefore because it belong'd to him to punish all Principles and Practices of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, antecedently to his Christianity, he for that reason proceeded against them without any consulting with the Church, and that is the apparent reason why the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63060:52"/>
Laws of the Empire against this debaucht Sect of Men are enacted purely by the Imperial Authority; whereas all their. Laws concerning Matters of Christian Faith or Discipline, still warrant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the Judgment and Advice of the Church.</p>
               <p>But beside these Laws against these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Beasts, he enacted divers other Laws against Apostates, Pagans, and Jews, by his own Imperial Authority. His <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis l.</hi> 1.</note> first Rescript against Apostates to Paganism was published in the year 381, and it was the first, that was ever publisht against them. For under <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> vast numbers of Heathens turn'd or pretended to turn Christians for a very obvious reason, as too much appears through the whole train of the Story: And the same Men under <hi>Julian</hi> turn'd Heathens again, and so had the Liberty to continue under <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; so that this was the first Emperor that had occasion to give check to the Sin of Apostacy. And indeed he alone, had Power to do it at that time; for when they turn'd Apostates, they were out of the Churches reach, because the utmost Punishment that the Church can inflict, is to cast them out of its Communion, which is here done by the Crime it self.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63060:53"/>
And therefore such rank Offenders, are only obnoxious to the Civil Powers, for which reason, Christian Princes were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the more severe in their Penalties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and here the Penalty is, as the Lawyers Phrase it, <hi>Intestability,</hi> or disabling the Offenders from the Power of making a Will, which was under that Government in a great measure to outlaw them, or as it is express't in the next Law, <hi>ut sint absque Jure</hi> Romano, to deprive them of the <hi>Roman</hi> Rights and Liberties, of which this was the greatest branch. For, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire there was no settled Inheritance of Estates, but every man disposed of his own as he pleased, by Will; so that to deprive him of this Power, was in a great measure to dispossess him of the Power over his own Estate. And that was the proper Proportion of the Penalty to the Crime, that whoever cast himself out of the Christian Church, should be cast out of the Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire too.</p>

whereas the Catechumenes were not as yet admitted into the Society of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, but were only Candidates for it, and so they could not in any sense, be term'd Apostates from the Church, who were really never of it.

               <p>And lastly, as for the Jews, he by the same Imperial Authority without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Church, made some Laws in their favour, to protect and defend them in their Privileges. For all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors had all along indulged them the exercise of Discipline among themselves,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63060:55"/>
by the Power of Excommunication: which was chiefly put in Execution by their Primates or Patriarchs, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided over all the Synagogues within a Province, after the same manner as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans do over all the Churches. These were the Supreme Judges of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Offences, and beyond them, there lay no appeal to any other Courts. But it seems some of the Emperors, Judges, and Officers (and it is much more easie to bank out the Sea, than the covetous Encroachments of this sort of Men) had broke in upon their Privileges, and usurpt a Power to themselves of commanding the restitution of ejected Persons. But to restrain this disingenuous Abuse and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of their Discipline, the Emperor Publishes <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais, l.</hi> 8.</note> a Rescript to all his Officers, commanding them not to controul the Decrees of the Primates and Patriarchs, who were by the Imperial Law permitted to be the sole Judges in Matters of their Religion. And this was no more than a just and reasonable Civility after the grant of Discipline and Jurisdiction among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for that could be of no Effect, if once Offenders might gain Liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to foreign Judicatures. And because the Jews had never been forbidden the exercise of their Religion by any Law,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63060:55"/>
and yet were at that time disturbed in some Parts in the East by some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zealous Christians, to the spoiling and destruction of their Synagogues, he writes to the Governor to restrain these Disorders with all possible severity. And this was the occasion of that hot Contest between the Emperor and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> when he enjoyn'd the Bishop of the place to rebuild the Synagogue, because he had encouraged the People to pull it down. In which matter I cannot but think St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> was more busie and zealous than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, <note n="(q)" place="margin">

And therefore if any of the Christians in a violent and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary way, took to themselves the liberty of demolishing them contrary to the Imperial Charter, they stood guilty of a Scandalous Riot, both against the Laws of the Empire and the Sovereignty of the Emperor.

the inconveniences of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that place, which had they done, it is not to be doubted, but this great and pious Prince, would have given them both a wise and an obliging An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But when in a popular Tumult and out of intemperate zeal, they shall presume to take a liberty to themselves by force to controul the gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of their Prince, I think (by the good Fathers leave) that they deserved a more severe correction, then their Prince in his great Clemency was pleased to inflict upon them.</p>

about the same Matter, and given in their peremptory determination.

But they refuse both, and appeal to a General Council, but they are answer'd, That it is needless that all the Bishops of the Christian World should be forced to such tedious Journeys, to censure Men that had been already so often condemn'd in so many Councils. And withal, that this was a General Council, all the Bishops being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, who might have come if they pleased, that the Eastern Church had already given judgment against them in the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that all the Western Bishops were present in this Council, either in Person or by their Legates.

                  <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Jury for them.

                  <q>Although he be convicted of many Crimes, yet it puts us to confusion, that one who pretends to the Priestly Office, should choose to submit himself to the judgment of Laicks. For which alone he ought to be condemn'd, when as in such Matters as these, it is the peculiar Office of the Priest-hood to judg of Laymen, but these have no Authority to judg of them, and therefore according to this Profession of <hi>Palladius</hi> this day, and his refusal to condemn the Heresy, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him unworthy of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to be deprived, and a Catholick Bishop to be placed in his stead.</q>
Which sentence against him and his Accomplices being ratified by the Council, they broke

                  <q>That no body might be absent but by his own Will, no body might be forced against his Will. What an hard thing is it, that all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World should be deprived of their Priests for two or thre worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Hereticks? who though they could not come by reason of the tediousness of the Journey, yet almost all the Bishops of the Western Provinces were present by their Legates.</q>
And secondly they acquaint him with the reason of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Epistle of <hi>Arius. Eà videlicet gratiâ, ut quoniam</hi> Arianos <hi>se ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare consueverant, Arii blasphemiam aut incusando damnarent, aut astruendo defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent, aut certè non recusarent nomen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, cujus impietatem perfidiamque seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur.</hi>

the Blasphemy or to own it, and not refuse to be call'd after his Name, whom they followed in his Impiety.</q>

                  <q>In the Western Church we found not above two obscure Bishops in the remote Corners of the Empire that opposed the Faith, in the Eastern Church all the intruding <hi>Arians</hi> were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63060:59"/>
ejected, and the Churches fill'd with none but Catholicks.</q>
And thus we see from reign to reign, that the Heresy could never lift up its Head after the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council, and it was so far from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading the World at this time, that there were but two Bishops in all the Western Church that were tainted with it, and though there were some more in the East, yet they were Intruders, such as came in by Violence and Court-Power, as we have seen through the whole Series of the Story. But as for the Schisms in the three great Sees, that the Council Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Emperors to remove, they were at that time of a very fatal and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence over the whole Catholick Church, and therefore that I may satisfie the Reader with a compleat History of all passages in this remarkable Reign, I shall as briefly as I can, give a full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Relation of them.</p>
               <p>As for the Schism at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was kept up against <hi>Damasus</hi> by <hi>Vrsicinus,</hi> whose restless Spirit for a long time employed all the Power both of Church and State to suppress it. The Occasion of it was this, At the Death of <hi>Liberius,</hi> there were two Parties in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; his own, and the Party of <hi>Foelix,</hi> that had been substituted in his room by <hi>Constantius</hi> in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63060:59"/>
the time of his Banishment, and that was the bottom of this Schism, one Party choosing <hi>Damasus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 368.</note> and the other <hi>Vrsici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; but <hi>Damasus</hi> having the Majority of Votes, carried the Election, though <hi>Vrsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> and his Party will not yield it, till the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Elder writes to <hi>Praetextatus</hi> the Praefect of the City, to give <hi>Damasus</hi> possession of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral; and for Security of the Peace for the future, to drive the Schismaticks out of the City with Liberty to reside any where but at <hi>Rome,</hi> and with leave too, to continue in it upon promise and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of peaceable Behaviour. Upon this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 369.</note> they unanimously leave the City, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Suburbs, and there keep their Meetings and Conventicles under Bishop <hi>Vrsicinus,</hi> which makes great Tumults and Disturbances both in City and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs. Of which the Emperor being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he directs a Rescript to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, strictly charging and requiring of him, that no such Assemblies be kept within Twenty miles of the City. But the Schismaticks continuing turbulent, they are banisht into <hi>France,</hi> though in the year 371, the Emperor is graciously pleased to release their Confinement, and give them Leave to reside in any Part of the Empire, but the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63060:60"/>
Suburbicary Regions, with this Reserve, that if they transgress't their limits, they were to be punisht with all possible seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not at all as Christians, but meerly as Subjects, that were Factious and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the Commonwealth. <hi>Qui si in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratâ pertinacià Statutum mansuetudinis nostrae egrediendum putaverit; eundem non jam ut Christianum, quippe quem à com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione Religionis mentis inquietudo dister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat, sed ut hominem factiosum, pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batoremque publicae tranquillitatis, Legum &amp; Religionis inimicum juris severitas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequatur.</hi> And in the same Rescript the same Decree is made against his Followers, as <hi>Baronius</hi> gives it us out of his Vatican Manuscript.<note place="margin">

So that in the year 378 they are again Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>Baronius</hi> places it in the year 381, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is evident from the Inscription of the Letter of the Council to the Emperors, that it was in this year of 378, for it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected only to <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and therefore it must have been written after the Death of <hi>Valens,</hi> and before the choice of <hi>Theodosius</hi> to the Empire. Now <hi>Valens</hi> was kill'd in <hi>August</hi> 378, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63060:60"/>
chosen in the <hi>January</hi> following, and therefore it must have been transacted in that interval of time and no other. But they having done their part, they write to the Emperor <hi>Gratian</hi> to solicite him to do his, who as we find by this Letter had not been negligent in the Business, for that is the Contents of the first part of it, to return him thanks for his former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. When this former Rescript,<note place="margin">

But whenever it was Publisht, the Contents of it are evident from this Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> to drive <hi>Vrsicinus</hi> into Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Ecclesiastical Sentence against him.

some places (as the Council here inform the Emperor) to over-awe his Judges with Tumults, threatning them with no less than Death it self; and for that Reason they request his Majesty to renew his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rescript against them. Upon this the Emperor writes a very chiding and threatning Letter to <hi>Aquilinus, Vicarius</hi> of the City, complaining of the Negligence and Dishonesty of his Officers, <hi>qui priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae gratiae imperialia praecepta condonant,</hi> who sacrificed the Emperor's Commands to their own private concerns, and as he afterwards expresses it, Hactenus stertit iners dissimulatio Judicum, <hi>Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all our Commands hitherto, the Judges snore and counterfeit inadvertency.</hi> And therefore he requires him under high and unusual Threatnings, to put his Law in execution against them for their Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an Hundred miles from the City, and gives him this general Rule, <hi>Vt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnati Judicio rectè sentientium Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63060:63"/>
own Authority. What followed upon it I know not. For <note n="(g)" place="margin">

When they saw the Church defended by such an Emperor, they were content to sit still, for Men are not wont to make their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, where they have no hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. But still we see by the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of this <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Schism, that the Disorders of the Church proceeded not from it self, but the Dishonesty of the Court Eunuchs.</p>
               <p>The last great Schism of that Age, that the Council of <hi>Aquileia</hi> mentions in their Letter to the Emperor, was that at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> which began sooner, and lasted longer than either of the other. How the matter was composed between <hi>Paulinus</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:63060:64"/>
and <hi>Meletius,</hi> we have seen above, that upon the Death of one of them, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver should have the Government of the whole Church. But upon the Death of <hi>Meletius, Flavianus</hi> sets up against <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and his own Oath too, for he had abjured the Bishoprick as long as either of them should live. And he makes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends as to keep it till the great Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to him by the Authority of the Council, where the Business was transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a Seditious Party with such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Heats and Tumults, as almost put the great <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> out of love with Councils, whose angry words upon a particular occasion against the abuse of some in his time, are peevishly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly applied by our Innovators against the use of Councils in general. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Abridger almost runs mad for joy of his Satyrical Expressions, and though as an Orator the good Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented his Complaints and Invectives bigger than the life (for that is the use of that sort of Eloquence) <hi>R. B.</hi> has pretty well improved it with a scurvy Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made it look more like railing than handsom Satyr. But what would you have of a meer Abridger of <hi>Binius,</hi> poor Man, he never looks into the secret
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63060:64"/>
of the Story, and the connexion of things, but he finds in <hi>Binius</hi> that such a Council was held such a year, and out of him he gives a crude Epitome season'd with some malicious Reflections against the Bishops, and so has done. But alas, if he had but had any insight into the Series of the Story, and understood the Mystery of the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Faction, by whom all these Disturbances were raised in the Church, it would have spoil'd the Malice of all the Abridgment. For whereas his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to load the whole Body of Bishops with the Miscarriages of the Church in all Ages, it is evident all along, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Bishops labour'd against all those Miscarriages that he has ignorantly and maliciously charged upon them, and that all those Disorders committed in the Church from the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the time of this present Council, were the Acts and Contrivances of some wicked men that crept into the Church by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Court-favour, and were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do all that mischief that they did in it, in spite of the Opposition of the Good Bishops, by the Power of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs. So that all these Disorders were so far from being the Acts of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Power, that they were the meer effects of its Oppression. And such were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63060:65"/>
these very Men that labour'd to raise this Tumult in the Council, as is evident from <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s own account of them, and that in short is this. He at first earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to perswade them to acquiesce in the former Agreement, and to have but a little-Patience, in that <hi>Paulinus</hi> was a very old Man, had one foot in the Grave, and could not long stand in their way upon the other. But he is hiss't down by the factious Party, as a Betrayer of the Supreme Prerogative of the Eastern Church, that (they said) ought to be preferr'd above the Western, because our Saviour was Born in that part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. For that was the pretence of their Zeal in this foul Matter, that <hi>Paulinus</hi> had been ordain'd by <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> a Western Bishop, which they will needs have to be a dishonourable Intrusion upon the Eastern Church, and therefore in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite to that Usurpation, they will set up <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and by their noise and clamour tire the old Bishops into a complyance, but <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> quits the Council through meer indignation, and seeing how things were like to go, and what troubles he was like to encounter in that great See, he soon after resigns his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Of which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction make their advantage of playing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63060:65"/>
over their old Game for creating a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between the Eastern and Western Church. An Artifice, as we have seen, first started by <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and ever after kept on foot by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For the Western Church had been all along true and faithful to the Orthodox Faith, and happy in a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Orthodox Emperors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Easterling Merchants that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made a trade of their Religion, and changed their Faith with their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, greedily seized all Opportunities of breaking with the West, where the Faith was fixt and settled, because such a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement would break the Court-Exchange for Preferments upon every Turn of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And such <hi>Eceboliuses</hi> were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that raised and promoted this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. They had ever changed their Faith with the Times, and as they had bought their Bishopricks of the Courtiers under <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> so were they resolved to keep them under <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius.</hi> And therefore finding his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to stand by the Nicene Faith, they readily vote with the Council for its esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, but to prevent the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, they start this new and unseasonable Controversie about the Ordination of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> to keep up the

upon <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Resignation, every Man hoped for a good penny-worth, but the Courtiers were grown too cunning, and it being so valuable a prize, instead of sharing with the Church-men by <hi>Simony,</hi> seize the Bishoprick for themselves, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius</hi> an unlearned Man, but a great Courtier, I know not by what art, but I am sure by too much interposition of the Emperor, being against all the Canons of the Church hoisted into it.

in the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the first. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his account, who was an Actor in the business, the Story runs thus. The Emperor upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Siricius,</hi> that succeeded <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> against <hi>Flavianus,</hi> refers the Cause to a Council at <hi>Capua,</hi> but <hi>Flavianus</hi> refuses to appear, and moves for an Eastern Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.

But the Historian was led into his soft-natur'd Opinion by the Authority of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> a weak and unlearned man, of great devotion, but very little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63060:71"/>
who interceded with great zeal to save the Lives of the Malefactors, and if he had begg'd them of the Government as an Act of Mercy, it might not have been altogether unbecoming the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Religious man, but when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it as a duty of his Superiours to keep hands off from such vile Offenders, he only shewed the pertness of his humour and the weakness of his Understanding. But first of all, they are proceeded against by the Censure of the Church in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Caesar Augusta</hi> (i. e. <hi>Caragosa,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of <hi>Aragon</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) in the Year 380, in which the Bishops are deposed, and the Lay-men excommunicated, and the Sentence signified to all foreign Churches, to prevent their receiving them into Communion. And withal several Canons are enacted against the particular customs and practices of the Heretiques: As first, That Women be not permitted to preach in Publique, as <hi>Agape</hi> one of the first of the Sect, a wanton and immodest Woman had done, and others after her Example, and this priviledge no doubt was the great Lure that drew the talking Sex so thick into the Faction. The next Canon is made against fasting on the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals of the Church, and that cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd temper was common to all the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63060:71"/>
Fanatique Heretiques in all Ages, to do every thing in contradiction to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht Laws and known Customs of the Church, as we have seen above by the Canons of the Council of <hi>Gangra</hi> against the <hi>Eutactans</hi> or <hi>Eustathians.</hi> The next Canon is to anathematise those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Eucharist without eating it: For that was the common Practice of those prophane Wretches, that they might avoid discovery, to seem to communicate with the Catholiques even in this great Sacrament, but that they might not be guilty of joyning in true and real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, secretly to conveigh it away, and so turn it into <hi>occasional Communion,</hi> as we call it. And to the like purposes are the other Canons. The Heretiques being thus condemn'd in Council, they make <hi>Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Bishop of their Sect, upon which <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> apply themselves to the secular Magistrate, and at length gain a Rescript from the Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> to banish them, not only from all Citys, but out of the Empire it self. For the words in <hi>Sulpitius, extra omnes terras,</hi> can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no less, though <note n="(o)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Gothofred</hi> surmises that their meaning reaches no farther than the Territories belonging to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular City that they inhabited: As when any man was banisht from <hi>Rome,</hi> he was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63060:72"/>
banisht an hundred miles from it, because so far its Territory or Suburbicary Diocess extended. As in the case of <hi>Vrsicinus,</hi> who when he was driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> was confined to keep at that distance. But I would fain know of the learned Civilian, where he ever met with this sense and construction of <hi>extra omnes Terras,</hi> when put absolutely, though he knows it was a common phrase to express the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And so it must be taken here, for the men were condemn'd to banishment for propagating wicked and debauch't Principles; and if that were only out of the Province in which they lived, that would be but a means to spread the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion over all the Countrey. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> upon the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rescript were not only forced to quit their own particular Provinces, but <hi>Spain</hi> it self, and farther their Prosecutors were not concern'd to pursue them. But having quitted <hi>Spain,</hi> they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Italy,</hi> and there endeavour to clear their Innocence to <hi>Damasus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milain,</hi> but they are so wise, as to refuse so much as to see or hear them. Upon that they are forced to betake themselves to the standing shift of all Heretiques, to buy off the Laws of the Church with the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63060:72"/>
And to this end they bribe <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> the <hi>Magister Officiorum,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon prevails with the Emperour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse his Rescript against them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they return home with triumph, and rebribe <hi>Volventius</hi> the Governour so powerfully, that he forces <hi>Ithacius</hi> to fly his Countrey.

such things, as are too foul not only to be acted but spoken.

I am sure it was no more severe than what was done by the great <hi>Theodosius</hi> himself in his Laws against the <hi>Manichees,</hi>

And is withal so severe, as to appoint an Inquisition for their discovery; and in truth no care can be too great nor pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment too severe, when Men under pretences of a stricter Piety, bring in the practice of all sorts of uncleanness and immorality. And that was the case of these brutish Wretches, they pretended to singular mortification, and under it acted all the Wickedness, that humane Nature was capable of committing. And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63060:75"/>
therefore in such Cases as these it was a great mistake in St. <hi>Martin,</hi> to think a Censure of the Church sufficient punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to disswade the Prince from drawing the temporal Sword against them, when if ever it is necessary, it is certainly most so, when Men pervert Religion to the subversion of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And then if they are executed, it is not for their Heresie against the Faith, but their Treason against the State, and such Traitors all such Men are that teach such Doctrins, as destroy the Faith of Mankind, and the Peace of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And therefore how blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy soever <hi>Ithacius</hi> might be in his own life or manner of prosecuting, (and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> gives him a very ill Character as to both) no wise Man could ever have blamed him, so severely as he has done, as to the prosecution it self, and no good Man could have been too active in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such brutal Wretches to their due punishment. And therefore it was at best, but an indiscreet action (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the truth of the Indictment, which <hi>Sulpitius</hi> himself allows) in <hi>Theognostus</hi> and his Followers in separating Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from him for prosecuting, though in a cause of blood. When what he did in that case, he was obliged to do as a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63060:76"/>
Member of the Common-Wealth and antecedently to his holy Orders, which certainly to whatsoever degree of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness they may oblige a Man, they cannot cancel that duty, that by nature he owes to his Country. And it is no better than <hi>Julian</hi>'s Sarcastick Abuse of our Saviour's Laws to apply his Precepts of Mercy and Forgiveness against the just execution of Laws, as if his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were set up (as the Apostate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely objected to it,) only for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Civil Government. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he commands is a point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as well as Vertue, that Men preserve the temper of their Minds in all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourses of life: they may prosecute a Malefactor to the Gallows without strangling themselves with spite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but only for the same ends, for which the Government, that owes him no malice, inflicts the Penalty of the Law upon him. A Man may hang a Thief, and forgive him too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was no better than a rash and weak action of <hi>Theognostus,</hi> St. <hi>Martin</hi> and their Adherents in general to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Ithacius</hi> his prosecution of the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> as if it had been inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the meekness of a Christian, but much more the exemplary mercy of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63060:76"/>
a Bishop. It is indeed an Office that no good-natur'd Man can ever be fond of, and less becomes a Clergy-man than any other; but yet it is not unlawful, nor the breach of any Precept of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore he could not be justly condemn'd for it; nay it was so far from being a Sin, that it was a duty both in him and all other good Subjects to take care of the preservation of the Common-Wealth, by indeavouring to remove such plague-sores out of it. And therefore <hi>Maximus</hi> did but do him justice to call a Synod at <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At least I am sure it is much less decent for a Clergy-man to patronize wicked Men against the Laws than to prosecute them, provided they have reputation enough (which the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law requires, and all other Laws ought to do) to qualifie them for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. If indeed these had been Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors of an ordinary size, it might not have been unbecoming a Bishop to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for mercy, but Men that were made up of nothing but Villainy, were
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63060:77"/>
beyond the reach of compassion, and no Man, in whatsoever station he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ought to spare their prosecution. And therefore it was no better than Monkish stubbornness in St. <hi>Martin,</hi> to refuse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Prosecutors after the judgment of the Council; and though he was at last induced to communicate with the Council it self by <hi>Maximus,</hi> who bought that condescension of him, by giving him the Lives of two of his Friends, that had been loyal Officers under <hi>Gratian</hi> (though our crude Abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger says, that it was for the sake of a great <hi>Priscillianist</hi>) yet upon it he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Council, and could have no peace till he received absolution from an Angel, after which he would never more communicate with the Bishops, and that I take to be no better than Monkish <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm.</hi> These affectations of mercy are very popular things, and easily seize Men possess't and tainted with mortified Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for there is generally the height of pride and ostentation, under the pomps and shews of Humility. And this I doubt was St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s case, who though he was a devout Man, yet he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlearned and indiscreet and most miserably over-run with the Scurvy of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and not understanding the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63060:77"/>
true nature of Pride (as none of that sort of Men do) he was apparently acted by it in all his singularities to the very height of a Cynical vanity, that is the rankest sort of Insolence in the World. And this is too evident from his Story, as it is told by <note n="(q)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Sulpitius</hi> himself. To give one instance for all, when he was treated by the Emperor, who invited all his Nobles to the Entertainment, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one of his Presbyters along with him, and the Emperor being very proud that he had reconciled to himself and his ill Cause, a Man so much adored by the People, treats him with all the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Civility, seats him next himself, and places his Presbyter in the midst of his Nobles, that was the highest Place at the Table. A Cup is brought to the Emperor according to custom to drink in the first place, he commands it to be given to St. <hi>Martin,</hi> expecting at least that he would have return'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, but he without any farther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality very fairly takes off his draught, and so delivers the Cup to his Presbyter, as the best Man in the Company next to himself.

as far as I can discern, it seems very much to exceed the sawcy Answer of <hi>Diogenes</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when he offer'd him whatever he would ask, thrusting him aside with a <hi>Prethee friend stand out of my Sun.</hi> This Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vanity is very incident to Monkish Men, and there are few of them that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the itch, but when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant and meets with success and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause in the World, as it did in this good Man, it becomes down-right <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and perfect drunkenness, whence came his so frequent Visions, and converse with Angels, and incounters with Devils, and a great number of strange things that he told of himself, the poor Man serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing his own dreams and deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums for want of animal Spirits, to have been true and real transactions. But to let that pass, whether there were any touch of vanity in this intercession for the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> or not, I am sure there was very little discretion. <hi>Baronius</hi> would excuse him from the reason, upon which he proceeded, <hi>viz.</hi> the abuse that would follow upon an inquisition of the Hereticks, which <hi>Maximus</hi> intended in <hi>Spain.</hi> That I confess was one reason (and I think) a good one too, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the Emperor from sending the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors,

such Persons being so very apt to abuse their trust, as he had already found by experience, but the general ground that he stood upon was this, that they ought not to be punisht by imperial Laws, but only by the Censures of the Church, and that it was no less than an act of unheard of prophaneness in the Emperor to proceed against them. That reason is general, and extends to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings abstracting from the abuse, and so <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> confesses in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he gives that reason in the life of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> as well as in the history it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will venture upon strange and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant things, where they have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of impunity, yet when they find their lives at stake for the debaucht frolick, that quickly spoils the jest. And that was the case here, the leud Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was really chopt off with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. And though <hi>Sulpitius</hi> complains that it lasted 15 years, yet it lasted no longer, and was the most short-lived of all the Heresies, whereas the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> of both which it was compounded, continued some Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not prosecuted with the same seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

This is the true state of the case, and yet it is the only great instance of cruelty, that <hi>R. B.</hi> is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually bellowing out against the <hi>bloudy, the persecuting, the turbulent, the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the proud, the contentious, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63060:81"/>
the hereticating, the merciless, the furious, the confounding, and the God-damn-you Prelates, and fire brands of the World.</hi> For these are the most usual Titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that this Man of meekness and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is pleased to bestow upon the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishops of the ancient, as well as the present Church. But though he is pleased to throw them out at random a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the whole Order, yet when he comes to particulars, his whole Catalogue of <hi>Bonners</hi> and bloody Bishops is nothing but this story of <hi>Ithacius</hi> and the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scillianists</hi> continually repeated in his fourscore books and upwards, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating one tale so often has made it so many stories. But poor <hi>Richard</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes in so much hast, that he has not leisure to examine and weigh his Records, no nor for the most part (which is much worse) to construe them; for though he is very abounding with his <hi>in specie,</hi> he is very defective in his <hi>In speech,</hi> and has of late bless't and obliged the World with such heaps of historical Ignorance, as cannot but be a full satisfaction to the Age, that Presbytery and skill in antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are inconsistent things. But as for this particular out-cry about <hi>Ithacius,</hi> if he had but in the least understood the true state of the case, he could never
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63060:82"/>
have prevail'd with himself to triumph over its cruelty, with so much transport and insolence as he has done, in so much that he seems to be more pleased with their Execution, then the bloody Prelates themselves, only because it serves him for a Common Place of railing at them, and that is the sweetest gratification to his healing Spirit. But what were these poor silly harmless Hereticks that were so barbarously butcher'd by these inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prelates? Were they meer He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in a point of Faith, as the <hi>Arians</hi> were? Were they meer Schismaticks from the Communion of the Church, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> were? No, but they were a rout of Villains that under the pretence of a greater Purity, taught all the leud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wickedness that humane Nature could commit, and daily reduced their Doctrin to practice among themselves. So that their Crime was not any heresie against the Christian Faith, as this crude Rhapsodist supposes, but an Apostasie from humane Nature, and subversion of humane Society, and an utter debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of humane Kind. Now when such Monsters of Men, that were implacable Enemies to the Peace of the World, arose within the Neighbourhood of some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Bishops, I cannot see how they could
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63060:82"/>
any way have excused themselves to God and their Country, if they had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd a speedy stop of the Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For this concern'd them not as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Bishops, but as Men and Members of the Common-Wealth which it was apparent that these Mens Principles ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly subverted, and therefore for that very reason were they bound to let the Government know its danger. And though their Office as Christian Bishops obliged them to mercy, yet not to such foolish mercy as would undo the World. And that was their case, they did not prosecute Hereticks, but Rebels and Traitors. And that Office I think as much becomes a Bishop, if he loves his King and his Country as another Man. But it seems there is no cruelty so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Eye of a Presbyter, as to bring Rebels to their due punishment. And it looks like strange confidence that Men who have confess't themselves <hi>Men of Blood,</hi> and cut honest Mens Throats for their Loyalty, should complain of the cruelty of executing Villains for their Rebellion. So that in the Result of all, and granting the truth of the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the conclusion will amount to no more than this, That the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prelatical and Presbyterian <hi>Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:63060:83"/>
is, That the one is for gleaning up a few Malefactors to preserve a Nation, the other is for reaping the whole field, and that is the true thorough Presbyterian Reformation.</p>

<q>He was a Prince courteous, merciful and familiar, thinking himself to be distinguisht from other Men only by the Imperial Robe: bountiful to all Men, but to a degree of prodigality to good Men, he loved Men of Integrity, and honor'd Learning, if without craft, he bestowed his great bounty with a greater mind. He loved his Subjects, and loaded them with Honors, Wealth and Kindnesses, especially those that he had found faithful to him in any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. And yet he had so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of those Vices, for which <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> is blamed, luxury and love of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that he never raised Wars, but found them, and strictly forbid all luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and extravagance at his Table, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63060:84"/>
was so tender of continence and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, that he forbid the Marriage of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin-Germans as well as Sisters. He was competently learned, he was inquisitive and curious to know the Monuments and Actions of his Ancestors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press't an high indignation against such, who by their Pride or Cruelty had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing against the publick Liberty, as <hi>Cinna, Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulla,</hi> and all Tyrants whatsoever, especially if false and ungrateful. He was apt to be offended at a base Action, but soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and therefore in a little respite he would soften harsh Commands; and he had that vertue by Nature, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> learnt of the Philosopher, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving him to be somewhat too passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, advised him, that he might do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rash and cruel, whenever he found himself begin to be angry, to repete the Greek Alphabet, that his suddain Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being diverted, it would in a short time cool. But that which is more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and unusual, he grew better by his Prosperity and great Victories. For whereas the Tyrants had rob'd the Subjects of great sums of Money, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbursed them out of his own Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, whereas the most gentle Princes thought it enough to leave them their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63060:84"/>
bare Estates and harrass't Lands. But now as for smaller Matters, and things acted within the Court, which because they are more secret, more invite Mens curiosity: He honored his Unkle as a Father, his Nephews he loved as Sons, he was a Father to all his Relations: he loved neat eating, but hated extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. He was facetious in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but so as to keep up his gravity: a kind Father and a loving Husband: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his exercise which was chiefly in walking at leisure times, he govern'd his Appetite by his Health, and so dy'd in Peace at <hi>Milan</hi> in the 50<hi>th</hi> year of his Age.</q>
This is the Man that the rude Historian is not ashamed to accuse of destroying the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth by his Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Negligence and Oppression, both without giving any one instance of any of those Vices, and against his own hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, by which it is evident, that he was the Saviour of the Empire. But <hi>Theodosius</hi> was a true lover of his Religion, and that exasperated the Zeal and Malice of this bigotted Pagan. Insomuch that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the unparallel'd success of his Arms, the highest Character that he can give of him, is that only, that he was no <hi>ill Soldier,</hi> though this civility he soon after eats again, by saying that he destroyed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63060:85"/>
the military Forces and brought them to nothing, so that it seems he vanquisht all his Enemies without an Army, or which is as likely, as he reports it, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> by their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado's without any Order or Discipline.</p>
               <p>After him succeed his two Sons, <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> in the East, and <hi>Honorius</hi> in the West, who finding things so well settled by their Father, it was enough for them to preserve them in the same posture, in which they found them. But though he had pretty well quell'd all the other Hereticks, especially the <hi>Arian</hi> spawn, yet the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> had escaped his just severity, and therefore <hi>Honorius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes them, and how they were at last reduced and utterly destroyed, we have already seen in the history of that Schism. So that the main Transaction of this reign is already dispatch't, and what remains, will not require much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their other Ecclesiastical Laws being for the most part only ratifications of their Fathers Rescripts, and by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the same way of Government, and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger following in the same track, they brought the Church to a better settlement, than it ever attain'd in any other Age. And in the first place,<note place="margin">from the 24 to the 36.</note> there are 12 Laws of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63060:85"/>
                  <hi>Arcadius</hi> extant in the <hi>Theodosian Code,</hi> against Hereticks, enacted in the first five years of his Reign, that were nothing but Enforcements of former Rescripts, but chiefly his Fathers, that had not been executed through the negligence or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of Officers.</p>
               <p>His first Law was enacted in the year 394 in his Father's life-time, and when he was absent in the War against <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> and the occasion of it was the connivance of the Judges, as he declares in the Law it self, by which all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Constitutions were defeated and in effect evacuated. Against which abuse of Government, this Constitution is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enacted, and that was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the Church in all Ages, to be oppressed by the Courtiers at home, and betrayed by the Judges abroad. For as we have observed, that after the disposal of Preferments in the Church came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, the Eunuchs under careless Princes, turn'd the Church into an excise of <hi>Simony</hi>; so 'tis observable, that though Laws were continually enacted against all sorts of Dissenters and Recusants, yet it was the complaint of every Reign, that they lost their effect by the remisness or dishonesty of the under-Officers, who cared not to carry any thing thorough
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63060:86"/>
for the benefit of the Church, but when they saw it coming to any Degree of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, they let fall the execution of those Laws, by which it might have been brought to perfection. And till smart Fines and Penalties were set upon the heads of the Governors and Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Imperial Laws in behalf of the Church, lost the force of their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that was the true Reason why most of the Rescripts of the former Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors came to no more effect, because their Officers cared not to put them in effectual execution. And though they durst not at first, and whil'st they were fresh, wholly slite their Authority, yet in time, when ever the Emperors were diverted to other thoughts and cares, they let them sink into contempt and oblivion. And that was the true reason, why the same Emperors were forced from time to time to renew the same Laws, and of this <hi>Theodosius</hi> himself was at last sensible. But from this time forward that these young Emperors, made the Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Parties upon the Non-execution of any of their Laws, they had their true force and did their business, and by this method they vanquisht that stubborn Schism of the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis l.</hi> 25.</note> that had for so many years bafled all the Power of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63060:86"/>
Empire. The next Law of <hi>Arcadius</hi> was made at his first entrance upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by which he confirms all his Fathers Rescripts against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and cancels all private and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Indulgences to them, and particularly as to the <hi>Eunomians</hi> or <hi>Anomaeans</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the former Law of <hi>Intestability,</hi> which his Father a little before his death upon the streight of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, had revoked.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 27.</note> And so did this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himself in the very same year, by a Rescript to <hi>Caesarius,</hi> who was made <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> by <hi>Eutropius</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch after the murther of <hi>Rufinus,</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Councils with the change of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State. And that was another unhappy miscarriage of several of the Emperors, especially whil'st raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced at their first coming to the Government, that they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to themselves and their own Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; for that brought contempt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Laws, but upon their own Understandings, and frequent change of Opinion argues both fickleness of Mind and want of Consideration. And though when once a Law is made, though it may not be so convenient, as might have been expected, it is better to bear with it, than lightly to reverse it, the reverence that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63060:87"/>
Resolution brings to the Authority of the Government will be an ample compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for the inconvenience of the Law. His next Law is made to give force to all his Royal Fathers Laws against the Meetings of Hereticks,<note place="margin">

Upon this <hi>Aurelian,</hi> Pro-consul of the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Asia,</hi> where the Hereticks had always chiefly nested (though their swarms were never numerous) inquires of him in the case of <hi>Euresius,</hi> what his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty intended by the name of Heretick.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 28.</note> To which he returns this short and smart Answer, That it comprehended all that departed from the Catholick Church, thô in never so small a Matter. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Law has very much puzled the Canonists, or rather they have puzled themselves about it, it being their Trade,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63060:87"/>
because it is their gain, to create obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and raise variety of Opinions about all Laws. Otherwise the true meaning of this Law is sufficiently evident from the Words themselves and the occasion of its enacting, <hi>viz.</hi> that all departure from the Catholick Church as such, is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. The Hereticks even of the <hi>Arian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were subdivided into divers Parties and distinguisht by such Niceties, that it was hard to understand their different Metaphysicks, and therefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to make short work of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perplexing his Laws with Entities and Quiddities, plainly defines, that be they what they will, if they are not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to him they are Hereticks. The occasion both of the Inquiry and the Law was <hi>Euresius</hi> a <hi>Luciferian</hi> Bishop, who coming about that time out of some other Part of the World into the Pro-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular <hi>Asia,</hi> but not joining Communion with the Catholicks, nor yet holding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Opinion from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was, <hi>Whether he ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Catalogue of Hereticks. Yes,</hi> says the Emperor, <hi>if he be not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, that is enough: It concerns not us to inquire into his particular Fancy, his meer dissenting, be the difference never so small, is to us and in the Eye of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63060:88"/>
Law, Heresy.</hi> This was truly Imperial, and became the Greatness of a Sovereign Prince. He knew not what <hi>Euresius</hi> was, nor would he inquire, as long as he dissented from the Catholick Church, whatever was the ground of his Quarrel, it was all one to his Government. Now the singular conceit of the <hi>Luciferians</hi> was this, that they were over-zealous in the Catholick Faith to the subversion of Catholick discipline; and because the Catholick Bishops received the Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Clergy upon their repentance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in their Clerical Capacity, they broke off Communion with them. So that though they were in propriety of Speech only Schismaticks, yet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror will trouble himself with none of those Niceties, and be they what they will, they are in the sense of his Law, Hereticks. This is the plain meaning of this intricated Rescript, and though it may seem somewhat severe to punish all Opinions alike, and make no difference between the least and the greatest Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: yet if we consider the design of the Imperial Laws, they can make none, for it is the Church, that is the proper Judg of the Heresie it self, so as to proportion the Punishment to the Crime. But when that is done, the Civil Power only comes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63060:88"/>
in to abet its Sentence, for the settlement of Peace in Church and State. That is his proper care and province, so that if the peace of either be any way broke, that is the Crime that he is properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to punish. And indeed the less the difference, the greater the fault, for what it wants in pretence, it exceeds in peevishness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is of all others the rankest Affront to Government, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries open contempt in the Crime, 'tis disdain as well as disobedience, and a plain spitting in the very face of Authority.

unless the stubbornness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I know not, his next and last Edict against them commands their perpetual silence in all Places, and the burning of all their Books, and both upon no less Penalty than Death it self.

And there are many more Laws of the same strein in the Imperial Code, the meaning whereof is, not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to limit the Judgment of all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Causes to the Church, and of all Civil Causes to the Secular Courts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most Causes, as I have shewn above, appertain to both: But their plain inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that Causes purely Ecclesiastical, or Offences against the Canons, Rubricks and Orders of the Church, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Peace and Decency, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences against the Rule of Faith, shall be judged by the Church alone, and as for civil Controversies, they are to receive their decision only from Civil Courts. For the final power of Decision, is all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that can be used in that case, but though the Church has none of that, yet it has a Power to judg of the same Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as far as they concern the Laws of their Religion, or as <hi>Theodosius</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger expresses it, <hi>Christianam sanctitatem.</hi> And though when one Man stands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of having defrauded another, they

have not Power to right the Person wronged, or to inforce a Restitution, yet they have a Power to pass sentence upon the injury as a breach of the Christian Law, and that sentence will have its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. So that though they have not a Civil Authority in Civil Causes, yet they have an Ecclesiastical, that is distinguisht not by the Matter, but the Penalty of the Law. But the true and proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Laws is best understood by the occasion upon which they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, and the occasion of this was, that the Emperors had impowr'd Bishops to decide Controversies by arbitration and the consent of Parties, which they in process of time challenge as their right, and derive their Authority for it, from Apostolical Law, as was done by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Fathers at this time, petitioning the Emperor, That if any Persons will choose to have their Controversies deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Church,<note place="margin">

And we have seen through the whole series of this History, that from the very time that Princes took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the protection of the Church, the only thing that debaucht and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Efficacy of its Discipline, was Church-mens taking sanctuary at Court against the Authority of their Superiors.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63060:94"/>
high time to take it quite away, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Emperor was pleased to tye up his own hands from untying any sentence of the Church. As for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Law, there are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about it, but I think the most probable is that of <hi>Gothofred,</hi> that it was made at the Petition of the <hi>African</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were actually sitting at that time to restore the ancient and effectual discipline of the Church, and reform the Abuses and Corruptions that were crept or were creeping into it, and so among others, implore the Emperor that he would be pleased to stop all ways of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Persons that stood legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the sentence of the Church, and to injoin this to all his Officers, as they word it, <hi>interpositâ poenâ damni pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniae atque honoris.</hi> And this Petition the Emperor grants with that frankness, as to take away this abused Power of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, not only from his Judges, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and damn their Authority by this Rescript once for all and for ever.

This Law was made at the Petition of the <hi>African</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the fourth Council of <hi>Africa,</hi> and is extant in their Code Canon 97. And it was done for this end, that the Clergy might not be forced to appear in Law-Courts, and leave their Functions to follow Law-Suits. And this is the first time that Lay-men were taken into the concerns of the Church, and that not to intermeddle with any thing of its disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and jurisdiction, but only as their Stewards and Solicitors. And this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was so kind to them, as to follow this Rescript with another,<note place="margin">

The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges he enumerates are these six,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Exemption from Offices.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) From repairing of High-ways.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) From extraordinary Taxes.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) From building of Bridges.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) From maintaining the publick Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) From the Gold-Contribution, which was a particular Tax imposed at that time. In short they were excused from all Payments but their <hi>Canonical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi> the rate of which was known, and customary. For their Lands were never exempt from Taxes, and the proportion that they paid was call'd the Canonical Contribution, and whatever Officer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded more than their standing rate, he was by this Rescript banisht for ever as a sacrilegious Person. In the same year he publishes another Rescript, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the accusation of Clergy-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Judg but the Bishops,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. l.</hi> 41.</note> and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person of what degree and quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, shall bring an Indictment against
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63060:96"/>
them, and be not able to make it good, he shall be branded with publick Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as the Person accused must have been, if found guilty. This Rescript not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding its general words that the Clergy ought to be accused before the Bishops and not else where, the Lawyers will have to be understood of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and not Civil Crimes, but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their common Prejudice, that I have noted above, that only Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Offences fall under the Judicature of the Church, but Civil and Political Crimes are restrain'd to the cognisance of the State, whereas both are punisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by both, with those different Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are proper to the different Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions. And as for this Law in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it cannot be understood of any other but Civil Crimes, and this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved by those very Arguments, that are alledged by <hi>Gothofred</hi> himself to appropriate it to Ecclesiastical Miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. First that they are such Crimes as are punisht by the shame of Deposition, and therefore most properly Civil Crimes, for there were very few Ecclesiastical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences so great, as to deserve so high a Punishment, and those few that did so, as in the case of Schism and Heresy, were always appropriated to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63060:96"/>
Judicature, before this Rescript, and therefore not by it. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more pregnantly from his second reason, the cause of enacting this Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that Lay-men and even Persons of the greatest Quality, being apt upon slite provocations to bear spite to the Clergy, would be apt enough to way-lay their Reputation with popular defamations and false reports. So that the apparent design of the Law was to prevent these scandalous Informations, before the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judges, and restrain them from so much as taking them, till they had been first examin'd by the Ecclesiastical Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature. And in the last place this is still more evident from the particular occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Law, that <hi>Heros</hi> a worthy Man Bishop of <hi>Arles</hi> had been thrust out by <hi>Constantius</hi> a great Court-Officer there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards Emperor for six Months, upon a tumultuary Accusation and <hi>Patroclus</hi> an infamous Person placed in his stead, and therefore to prevent the like Disorders for the time to come, it was but seasonable to enact this Law, to restrain Secular Governors from receiving accusations against the Clergy, till they have been first heard by the Provincial Synod. So that this Law does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the criminal Actions of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63060:97"/>
from the Civil Courts, as <hi>Gothofred</hi> imagines, when he objects that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Jus Commune,</hi> but only limits the exercise of their Jurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that they neither receive nor proceed in such Causes, till the Judgment of the Church had been pass't upon them, and after that, they were at liberty to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish them according to Law. This is the fairest and most ingenuous sense that I can make of this Law.</p>
               <p>These are the chief Laws of these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in the Church, the Penal Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Hereticks, and the Laws of Priviledg to the Catholicks.</p>

Reason he had to enact this Law at that time I know not, but it looks very odd and severe, that every Village must be supplied with a Pastor out of it self; and not very wise, when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's observation is so very true, <hi>That a Prophet has least honor in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and it is evident that every Preacher has least Authority in his native Place, where the Vices and the Follies of his youth are remembred.

But though this seasonable Banishment of the forrein Clergy slaked, yet it broke not up the fury of the Tumults, that were partly kept up by the Inhabitants of the City, and partly by the expulsed Mutineers in other Parts of the Empire, and therefore it is followed with other Laws to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press both.

Now what these <hi>Caelicolae</hi> were, or why so named, 'tis difficult to find, because we no where meet with any

mention of them but in this Emperor's time, nor any description of them, but in this Rescript, unless once in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> as <hi>Gothofred</hi> observes, and though it is found in <hi>Justinian</hi> in the Law of <hi>Constantius</hi> against the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet as he observes, it must have been foisted in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward from this Law, because we hear of no such Sect any where else till this time, and <hi>Honorius</hi> never mentions them but with the Title of a new up-start Sect. And as for the other two Laws in which they occurr, <hi>viz.</hi> 43<hi>d</hi> and 44<hi>th de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis,</hi> he only names them in the rout of other Hereticks, and therefore all that can be guessed at them, is from this Law, where they are described to be pretenders to Christianity, but <hi>Jews</hi> in reality. So that they seem'd to have been a sort of Mongrel Christians, such as the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were of old, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Religions together, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacraments of both, <hi>i. e.</hi> they were both circumcised as <hi>Jews,</hi> and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised as Christians, being such another hotch-potch out of both Religions, as was afterward made by <hi>Mahumetanism.</hi> But how the name of <hi>Caelicolae</hi> came to be appropriated to them, I cannot find the least foot-step for a probable conjecture.

Times given to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I am pretty well satisfied, <hi>viz.</hi> not allowing any Images and Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Deity, they were Sarcasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally represented by the heathen Poets, as if they had address't all their Devotions to the Clouds and Sky. But how it came to be appropriated to this particular Sect as distinct from the other <hi>Jews,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is scarce capable of a guess, there being no other Record of them, than what I have mention'd, in which we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find the Name, but no reason of it, and as the Sect began, so it ended under this Reign; for we hear no more of it, whether it sunk by its own absurdity, or the severity of the Law against it.</p>

And indeed this Reformation of Laws when they grow numerous, intricate, and perplexing, is one of the noblest acts of Government: for all Laws in process of time natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63060:108"/>
degenerate into so much niceness and curiosity, as to be of no use, at last, than only to defeat the very end for which they were instituted at first, <hi>viz.</hi> the security of Mens Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. And when they are come to that pass, as to perplex and involve, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fix and clear their Titles, they are then, nothing but snare, cheat and vexation, which of all Governments is incomparably the most intollerable. The most heavy Arbitrary Government is much more easie to the Subject, than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Oppression; for when Men oppress without Law, they are usually restrain'd within some bounds by Modesty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then the whole blame of it must light upon themselves, but when they have Law or pretence of Law, to abet their Oppressions, then is the Abuse both boundless and shameless, and how barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously soever the poor People may be opprest, the Law must bear the blame of all, whilst the Oppressor runs away with all the profit. And therefore it is but a weak distinction that is vulgarly made between Arbitrary Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Law, for either may or may not be arbitrary as they are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A Government without Law may tye it self to the Rules of Justice, and a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63060:108"/>
Government by Law may turn all the Laws into fraud and oppression, and when they do so, they are guarded and fortified in their Tyranny by the Law. So that whereas there are two sorts of Arbitrary Government, one without Law, another with it, the case of the first is very hard and deplorable, when Men have no security from the Government for their Rights beside its own good Will. But the case of the second is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, both because it takes off the grand restraints of modesty and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which all Men are under that have no other rule to justify their Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Justice and Equity of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themselves, and withal because it leaves Men at liberty under the shelter and formality of Law to do all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest things in the World with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and a good grace. And therefore the wisest Princes in all Ages have not been more careful to make good Laws for the security of the Subjects Rights, than to see to their fair and easie execution. For when Suits are made tedious, difficult and chargeable, and Men are generally forced to pay more for Justice than Justice is worth, the Law serves no other end than to rob them of their Rights, and

when my neighbor has taken away one half of my Estate, if I will seek to right my self by Law, I must spend the other, so that if I get the Victory, and that is uncertain, I get nothing, if I lose it I am utterly undone. The removing of this great Abuse, which length of time had brought upon the Imperial Law, was the Emperor's great design in this magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Work, which though it have its defects, is yet an excellent and useful body of Laws, and has met with great acceptance in all Ages and civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

There is no one piece of Antiquity that has been more canvassed and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted than this Law among learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, and yet to this day it lyes undiscover'd in the dark, and no wonder, whilst the Records of it lay buried in Rubbish. It were tedious to recite the several Conjectures of <hi>Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Baronius, Perron, de Marca, Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, Gothofred,</hi> and divers others, because they are all but meer Guesses without any bottom to support them. But since their time, the Records have been brought to light by the learned <hi>Holstenius,</hi> who first publisht them to the World out of a <hi>Vatican</hi> Manuscript in the year 1662. And they agree so punctually with all the Records of that time, as by it, setting
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63060:111"/>
aside the Authority of the Manuscript it self, to justifie and in reality demonstrate their own Credit. Now the short of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is this, That the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> were at that time contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Supremacy of Jurisdiction, and <hi>Illyricum</hi> being situated in the Confines of both Empires, was naturally the Seat of War. For though all <hi>Illyricum</hi> had in former times belonged to the Western Empire, yet it was divided by <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great, and one half of it laid to the Eastern, and upon that, the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> claims Jurisdiction over it, <hi>Constantinople</hi> then pretending to the same Prerogative in the East, that <hi>Rome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the West. This pretence was set up immediately after the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that only gave it prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of honour next to old <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they fairly construed Equality of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, whereas on the other side the Romanists challenged Supremacy of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over those Churches, by prescription from the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the first,<note place="margin">

Now the point of War, as it was managed by the Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was this, that <hi>Illyricum</hi> ought to be wholy governed by its own Synod of Bishops. But as by <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> ought to have, and exercise a Supremacy of Jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. And so it stood at the time of this Rescript, <hi>Boniface</hi> the first, then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year 419, which was but two years before the date of the Rescript, commending his Courage and great Service to the Apostolick See; and this Victory was so great, that as <hi>Boniface</hi> himself attests, the greatest part of the <hi>Illyrican</hi> Bishops came over to his side. But <hi>Atticus</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> more a Lawyer then a Divine, and therefore chiefly governed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63060:112"/>
the Church by Imperial Authority, who had bafled an Excommunication of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> with the Emperors Rescript, and by it seised a Jurisdiction over the Province of <hi>Hellespont,</hi> as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where shewn, finding <hi>Illyricum</hi> in danger to be lost, procures this crafty Rescript from the Emperor against <hi>Rufus,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of asserting the Laws and Liberties of the Church, by preserving the Supreme Power of Provincial Synods, takes the Supremacy of all to himself, in that nothing was to be done or concluded by them without his consent. And here the confidence of these men is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in pleading Antiquity on both sides, notwithstanding the Innovation of both, was so very notorious: But this served the turn well enough against the Adversary, as here by this Rescript to Abolish all Innovation, the Power of the Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and when that was done, <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> having gained the Bishops to his own side by it, knew how to do his own work. This fires Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> for as the Rescript was publish't in <hi>June,</hi> so in the <hi>March</hi> following he sends a Letter to <hi>Rufus</hi> full of Thundering and Lightning,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 9.</note> And beside this, he writes a threatning Letter to the Bishops to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Rufus</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi>; and so he has the confidence to tell them, that he was Constituted Head of the Catholick Church by our Lord, and so acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and therefore whoever divides from him, is thereby cut off from the Communion of the Church. And yet for all that, it grieves him to hear of some, that have contrary to the Law of God and the Church forsaken the Apostolical See, to joyn with a pittiful Somebody, that has no Power at all, as they will find by searching the Records of former times. And so commands them to repent and return for fear of what may follow, and submit themselves to

                  <hi>Rufus,</hi> whose Power was no new thing, but as it had been granted by the Ancients, so it was to remain for ever, or in short, as he concludes, <hi>Cesset novella praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> And this is seconded with a longer Epistle to the same purpose. And thus did these bold Usurpers with equal impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lay claim to antiquity on either side, when all the World knew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of both; but that was all one to them, because it would beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from setling in the Possession, and then themselves might gain an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of leaping into it. Neither did Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> think it enough to make use of his own Authority in the Case, but he engages the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi> on his side, and prevails with him to write a smart Letter to <hi>Theodosius</hi> for reversing the late Innovations in <hi>Illyricum.</hi> And that he promised to perform, but of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it came to nothing; for when two Parties, that are both in the wrong, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a right, it cannot be adjudged to either without injustice to a third Party, whose real Right it is; And thus when these Emperors went about to remove Innovation on either side, it lay in both their ways, which way soever they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And how they went on to wrangle from Age to Age, for the Usurpation on

both sides, with the confident Plea of Antiquity and the Precedents of their Ancestors, may be seen more at large in <hi>Holstenius</hi> his Collection, my present Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is to discover the true meaning of this hidden Law, from the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test between <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> which as without it, it is not to be understood, so by it, we understand not only the sense of the Law it self, but the foul sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptions of both the Usurpers.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63060:114"/>
is such a Contradiction to all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Fathers, and to all the Laws of the preceding Emperors, who in all their Rescripts declared all such Grants of Priviledge to be meer Acts of Grace and Favour, that this Rescript could be nothing else then the subreption of some Clergy-man, who taking advantage of the times, the Child-hood of the Prince, then not above 7 years of Age, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Woman his Mother <hi>Placidia,</hi> who then Governed all, but chiefly from their fears under their late great distress to which they were reduced by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, took this opportunity of enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Priviledges of his Order to the claim of a Divine Right. I know <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thofred</hi> would soften this Law as if it referr'd only to Ecclesiastical, not to Civil Causes, first because in his 12th Novel afterwards he made that distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That is to say, as he grew older he grew wiser, and so corrected this childish Over-sight, but otherwise the reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this Law is general, that it is not fit that the Ministers of God should be answerable to Secular Powers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Tyrant had remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all Causes, Ecclesiastical as well as Civil, from the Church to the Secular Courts, which he infers from the

               <p>All the Laws of these Emperors under the following Titles are scarce any thing else then the Ratifications of the Rescripts of former Emperors, especially of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> the Great, and his Son <hi>Honorius,</hi> against the small Remainders, that were left of Hereticks, Jews, and Heathens.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63060:115"/>
And as for the Hereticks in particular, they were reduced to an inconsiderable handful of Men, never able to make any Head against the Catholick Church, that was never after this time troubled with any of the old Schisms and Heresies. Though it was assaulted with new ones, and so it must be, as long as the Taint of Vanity is left in Humane Nature; but as fast as it sprung up, they were cut off by the same Method of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. So that by the reiterated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of so many Emperors here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in this Code, we find the true Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Penal Laws against all the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant wantonness of Schism and Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Under the Title <hi>de Haereticis,</hi> there are ten Laws of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger, beside two other under the Title of <hi>Ne sanctum Baptisma iteretur,</hi> and three of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third, but they are only Recapitulations of former Laws, to glean up the small scatterings that were left of the Ancient Schisms and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. The most remarkable of them all is the 65th Law by <hi>Theodosius</hi> in the year 428, that is an Epitome of all the former Laws, by which he sweeps away at once 23 Sects, by enjoyning the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the former Laws against them, upon the Judges under the same Penalty that the Law inflicts upon the Offenders.

But it seems they had at this time changed the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for a Cross, thereby to reflect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon our Saviour and his Religion: And for that very reason are they forbid that Custom under Penalty of forfeiting all their other Liberties. The following Laws under this Title, <hi>viz. l.</hi> 21, 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>25, 26, 27. were only enacted to defend

And so ended the succession of <hi>Jewish</hi> Patriarchs, that had continued from their dispersion to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, by what accident, 'tis uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but it was probably occasion'd by the great Misdemeanors of Patriarch <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> who as we find by the 22<hi>d</hi> Law had highly abused the Emperor's favor to the Oppression of the Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

               <p>Under the Title <hi>de Paganis,</hi> there are only five Laws of <hi>Theodosius</hi> to renew the Laws in force against them, upon supposition that there are any <hi>Pagans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

This, after all the Experiments that were tryed by several Emperors, was found the only proper Remedy against all the Distempers of the Church, as <hi>Theodosius</hi> himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves in his third Novel concerning all sorts of Dissenters. <hi>Quos si ad sanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem mentis egregiae lege medicâ revocare conemur, severitatis culpam ipsi praesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt, qui durae frontis obstinato piaculo locum veniae non relinquunt.</hi>

That is the true state of the Case, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a natural stubbornness mixt with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63060:117"/>
Schism, and nothing but smart can cure it. And this is the thing, that makes it so necessary to add Penal Laws to the Discipline of the Church, thereby to stanch that peevishness, that without it will naturally fly out into all the follies and wildness of humane Nature. And all Princes, that either out of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Curiosity to try the experiment, or being forced by the necessity of the times, have taken off the Penal Laws, or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their execution, have soon been convinced of their mistake by the fatal Consequences, that it has brought upon their Government.</p>
               <p>As for the Laws that were enacted by these Emperors after the sealing of the Code, and for that reason call'd Novels or new Laws,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> there are two of <hi>Theodosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and three of <hi>Valentinian.</hi> The first of <hi>Theodosius</hi> is only a revival of his own 56<hi>th</hi> Law <hi>de Haereticis,</hi> commanding the execution of all Laws against <hi>Jews,</hi> Heathens and Hereticks.<note place="margin">Tit. 21.</note> His next Law takes away all manner of exemptions from Publick Taxes, and among others those granted to the Clergy by his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, which the Emperor excuses by the pressing difficulty of the present time, though it is evident that granting or withdrawing such favors, are meer Acts
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63060:118"/>
of the Prerogative Royal. The third Law placed in the Novels of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> belongs not to him but to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, directed to his Prefect in <hi>France,</hi> and is of a peculiar Nature from all the other Laws in the whole Code, being indeed not so properly an Imperial as a Papal Rescript, and extorted by the Importunity of an assuming Pope to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his own Proceedings. There had been an old Contest between the Bishops of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> for the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Superiority, for though it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways belong'd to <hi>Vienna,</hi> yet <hi>Patroclus</hi> a very ill Man getting into the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Arles</hi> by Court-tampering, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surps it to himself, and is backt in it by Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> with the pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ancient Canons. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by his two next Successors, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> and <hi>Celestine</hi> upon the very same Plea of ancient Canons: And that was the custom of all Popes at that time, following the dance of <hi>Innocent</hi> the first, to make the Canons speak what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves pleased, and when they pleased to speak Contradictions. But in the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the great, <hi>Hilarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> and a mettlesom Man, would not be content with his Metropolitical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but sets up for a Patriarchal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63060:118"/>
over all <hi>France</hi> and Independency upon <hi>Rome.</hi> This transports that proud and jealous Pope beyond all bounds of revenge and outrage, and upon it he writes in great fury to the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> to depose him from his Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political Authority, and cancels all Acts of his Government in that capacity. And as for the Grant of his Predecessor <hi>Zosimus</hi> to that See, he has the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to pretend that it was only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and personal, though by it he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as grosly upon <hi>Zosimus,</hi> as <hi>Zosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> himself did upon the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; and to ratifie all, he procures this Imperial Rescript commanding absolute Obedience to all his Commands, and in effect erecting an universal Supremacy for him. But the matter, the stile, and the spirit of the Rescript, too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the rough hand of <hi>Leo</hi> himself in it. And it was no hard Matter for so bold a Man to extort what he pleased from such a softly Prince. And yet this very same Man, when <hi>Hilarius</hi> dyed, got <hi>Ravennius</hi> a very weak Man to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, and then restored the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political Authority to him and his See: and thus did these Men set up and pull down as served the ends of their own Ambition, and all out of pure Reverence
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63060:119"/>
to the ancient Canons. And to speak a plain truth plainly, they meerly lyed themselves into their universal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as I shall shew more at large not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this instance of <hi>Arles,</hi> but from two other great transactions on foot at the very same time, that is, their Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation over the Churches of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Illyricum.</hi> And though in the first, they were shamefully baffled by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans,</hi> who exposed their gross and scandalous Forgeries to the World, yet it shews that they trusted to nothing so much at the time of their usurpation as the Sovereign Power of lying. But to keep to our present business. His next Law is to confirm all the Rescripts of former Emperors <hi>Pagan</hi> as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> to out-law the <hi>Manichees.</hi> This Law was made upon the discovery and confession of some very foul matter by one of the Ring-leaders of that Sect, what the Fact was, it was not thought decent to express, and it is only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thus described. <hi>Quorum incesta per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitas Religionis nomine Lupanaribus quoque ignota vel pudenda committit,</hi> such a foul incest under pretext of Religion that it was not so much as named in the publick Stews. His next Law is against the Robbers of Tombs and Sepulchres, it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63060:119"/>
is a very severe one, and one of the most eloquent for the stile in the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Servants and poor People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of it are punisht with death. Men of fortune with forfeiture of half their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and all their Honors, Clergy-Men with deposition from their Orders, and perpetual banishment. And as for all Governors, that shall neglect the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Law, they forfeit both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and Honor. His last Law is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Bishops Courts, and to revive some Laws of former Emperors relating to the Clergy, it gives the Bishops power of Judicature, <hi>praeeunte vinculo compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missi,</hi> by way of Arbitration, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. It allows Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to appear in the Civil Courts by their Proxies for all Causes unless Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Crimes, and lastly it prescribes what Persons may, or may not be received into Holy Orders, according to several fore-mention'd Rescripts of former Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

               <p n="15">§. XV. But the most material Law of this reign is still behind, and that is the Law to confirm the Decrees of the great Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that was both call'd and ratified by <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger, which I have reserved to this place, to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63060:120"/>
treat of it by it self, because as it is the greatest transaction of this Reign, so is it another eminent Instance of the right Concurrence of the Powers of Church and State in the determination of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Controversies, and enacting of Ecclesiastical Laws and Canons. All the old Schisms and Heresies being vanquisht by the Methods already described, such is the wantonness of Humane Wit, that it fell upon contriving new Conceits, for its own sport and entertainment. There is such a natural Vanity in some Mens Tempers, that they can scarce live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out singularities and innovations; from whence comes that necessity of Heresies, that St <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of; they are the certain effects of Pride and Pedantry, and as long as there are and will be born in all Ages Men of that Complexion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder them from venting their own novel and home-spun Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks. And therefore it cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that the Church should be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from Heresies, for that cannot be done without an alteration of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, it is enough that it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht with means to stop and cure the Disease, whenever it breaks out in the body of the Church, as we have seen great numbers of Botches dispersed and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63060:120"/>
reduced to nothing by the right exercise and concurrence of the Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Jurisdiction. And after this time it is observable that Heresies were not so long-lived, for now the Method of their cure being understood by experience (which when all is done, is the best Art of Physick) it was so soon dispatch't, that they rarely survived their Author; and after one sentence effectually execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they scarce ever put the Government to a second trouble, as will appear by the following History.<note place="margin">

with Complaints of their unjust Sentence, and daily soliciting both the Emperor and himself for restitution, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to let him know their Crime, that he may rid both his Royal Master and himself from their Importunity. After this his own Controversie is brought in as it were by way of Postscript, to prevent false Reports against him, and soon after he sends him larger discourses in his own Justification. Upon which he returns him a very stately and supercilious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (as if he were particularly pleased in insulting over a Bishop of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>) cutting him off from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Catholick Church,<note place="margin">

And as for the Cause of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> he rates him very smartly for giving them any Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Entertainment, and reflects sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of that Heresie upon him for his presuming to interpose in their behalf, however it is not time for him to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for others, but to take speedy care of himself.<note place="margin">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63060:125"/>
they should no longer own him for their Bishop. And the same thing is done by his several Epistles to the forementioned Bishops, all which is seconded by <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was glad to fortifie himself with the Authority of the Apostolick See, and therefore he sends by the same Messenger that first brought <hi>Celestine</hi>'s Letter to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a particular account to them and to <hi>Acacius</hi> of <hi>Beraea</hi> of all the fair means that had been used for reclaiming <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> before they proceeded to this severity, who all agree with him against <hi>Nestorius,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">

And withal tells him, that if he would suffer himself to be perswaded to disclaim the Controversie, it would be so far from the dishonour of a Recantation, that it would be an eminent Act of Wisdom and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, to forego Contentions and his own Opinions, that were not necessary to the Faith, for the Peace of the Church, and this he writes as the unanimous
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63060:126"/>
sence of divers Bishops that were his Friends. This Letter might probably have made some impression upon his great Spirit, had not <hi>Cyril</hi> spoyled all by his own over eagerness, for now finding himself so well back't, he would not be satisfied with the meer quitting his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he must be obliged to anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it too, and accordingly tenders him 12 Anathema's to subscribe, which though they were Theological Verities, were, I think, too nice to be imposed as Articles of Faith and necessary conditions of the Peace of the Church. And I am withal very apt to think, that if this new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position had not made the breach wider, it might have been made up, for both <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Anastasius</hi> seem'd by this time not to have been very fond of their Cause, if they could any way have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with honour. But this new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Cyril</hi> so enflames his Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Nature, that he now forgets all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and encounters Anathema's with Anathema's, and throws himself into an utter incapacity of Reconciliation upon the Terms of Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> and that which is worse, it gave him the advantage and reputation of a Party, for <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was so offended at their rigour,<note place="margin">

Eight Commissioners are sent on each side, and the Legates of the Council are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in their Instructions to insist upon the deposition of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and nothing else, as the Article of Peace. And the Legates from the Conventicle on the other side are commanded to insist upon the abolition of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Anathema's as Heretical, Schismatical, and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Additions to the Nicene Faith. But when they came, they were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the City for fear of Tumults by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63060:132"/>
the Monks, the Schismaticks were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss't to <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and indeed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was over eight days before their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, when the Emperor understanding the Cheat that had been hitherto put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, condemn'd <hi>Nestorius</hi> to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Banishment, and set <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Memnon</hi> at liberty. And though the Legates of the Conventicle press't him with three Petitions, one upon the neck of another for a Conference, he would not for a long time grant it. But at last their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity prevails, and as themselves boast, they shock the Emperor, for thô he would hear nothing in behalf of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius,</hi> yet he was offended at <hi>Cyril</hi>'s <hi>Anathema's,</hi> that were represented with too much advantage by the adverse Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as unwarrantable additions to the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Faith, of which the Emperor was very jealous, and that was the point that put him upon some Demur. <hi>Nestorius</hi> stood condemn'd by him from the first sentence of the Council, but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Anathema's were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, as his own private additions to the settled Faith. And therefore <hi>Nestorius</hi> his Friends let fall his Cause, and only pursue the condemnation of the Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, and that Plea was too plausible with the Emperor, for though they might
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63060:133"/>
be Theological Verities, they were no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, not being express't in the Nicene Creed, and yet so they were made by being imposed upon the Church under the Penalty of an Anathema. And here stuck the pinch of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie all the time that it depended at Court, that the <hi>Nestorians</hi> press't for the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Anathema's, which the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillians</hi> at last endeavor'd to baulk, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist only upon the Heresie and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and having the Emperor sure on their side in that point, they were sure to carry the Cause at last, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tired with the Disputes about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema's, lets that Controversie fall, and only abets the Sentence of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil against <hi>Nestorius</hi> with his own sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of banishment, and commands the Bishops to choose a Successor into the See, who electing <hi>Maximianus</hi> are dismist without any determination of the other Controversie.

               <p>In all this Contest the greatest Looser next to <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who lost all, was <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who being run down in Council, his confining Adversaries take that advantage to beat him out of his late Usurpations. The Bishops of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> over whom he had extended his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, make their Complaints to the Council, by whose Decree he is expell'd the Island. And whereas he had usurpt over the Provinces of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> upon which <hi>Juvenal</hi> the new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a brisk and ambitious Man had cast his Eye and made some inroads of Usurpation, he now thinks by the advantage of the animosity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> to have it confirm'd to him in Council, and this was the thing that made him so active there, for which reasons he was nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated one of the eight Commissioners to the Emperor. Which Design is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suggested to the Emperor, by <hi>John</hi> and his Party in their first Petition from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi>
                  <q>It is evident, Sir, (say they) that some among them have contrived and carried on this wicked design for their own ends, and your Majesty will see them, when they have carried
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63060:134"/>
through their Treachery, to divide the Spoils of the Church among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And though <hi>Juvenal</hi> of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> took upon him to ordain some of of us, we held our peace, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we ought to have contended for the Canons, lest we should have seem'd to contend for our own Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither are we ignorant of his Designs and Devices at this very time upon the second <hi>Phaenice</hi> and <hi>Arabia.</hi>
                  </q>
So that it seems he had made some overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts of his design in Council, but <hi>Cyril</hi> detested and damn'd the Motion, as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in his 16<hi>th</hi> Epistle tells us, That <hi>Cyril</hi> himself inform'd him by Letter. But though he could not carry it in Council, he got at last both those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and the three <hi>Palestines</hi> beside, and kept them till the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when both Parties, being conscious to themselves of their having no right to the whole Child, consent to its divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the three <hi>Palestines</hi> falling to <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; Phaenice</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> to <hi>Maximus</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi>

               <p>But though the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was ended, the quarrel was not, that run very high between those two great Prelates, <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and their greatness drew

Upon this a Council meets at <hi>Beraea,</hi> and agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Proposal, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Nestorius</hi> upon condition, that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> would call in all his own Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Controversie.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63060:135"/>
and to salve the dishonor of an absolute submission, he sends <hi>Paul</hi> Bishop of <hi>Emesa</hi> as his Legate to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to treat with <hi>Cyril</hi> about terms of Peace, and sends by him a Confession of Faith, which if <hi>Cyril</hi> would accept, he was his humble Servant. Now the Confession being Orthodox, and having nothing in it of his own, but only the form of Words, it was as easily accepted as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd: and so after all this contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nothing but mutual misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

But though they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, the Contest is still kept up by some Mens zeal, and other Mens malice. The <hi>Nestorians</hi> finding themselves every where excluded the Church by this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 35.</note> spread abroad reports that <hi>Cyril</hi> had imbraced the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Faith, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are forged in his name condemning the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and some new fanatick Hereticks plead his Authority for their own foolish Novelties. And some over zealous Men of his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accuse him of too much complyance with the Hereticks, and this cost <hi>Cyril</hi> some trouble and time to clear himself as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63060:135"/>
well from the jealousie of his Friends, as from the spite of his Enemies. And so was the Catholick Church at length restored to Peace and Unity, and as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> relates,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 44.</note> most of the <hi>Nestorians</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Heresie, were upon their submission restored to the Catholick Communion.<note place="margin">

But why no sooner, says <hi>Gothofred?</hi> Because, says he, the Emperor might suppose that the Hereticks had been reclaimed by the sentence of the Council, but now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they continued to spread abroad their Books and Opinions, he thought it high time to stop the mischief by this severe Rescript. This may be true, though it is meer guess, but if this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man had observed the contest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that it was 2 or 3 years after the Council before the Emperor could gain <hi>John</hi> and his Eastern Bishops intirely from the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63060:136"/>
Party of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> he would have found a very good reason why this Rescript was not sooner publisht, <hi>viz.</hi> because till then, Affairs were not ripe for it, and if it had been publisht before this strong Party had been taken off, it might have tempted them to join with the Heresie in good earnest. But now when they had declared against it, and <hi>Nestorius</hi> his own small Party was left alone, it was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to prevent its growth by the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this smart Law, and it did the work effectually, for though for a time the Ghost of the Heresie skulkt up and down in other shapes and other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet it could never after get so much courage or confidence, as to appear in its own form in publick. The Rescript consists of three Parts. First it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, That the followers of <hi>Nestorius</hi> should be call'd by no other name than the nick-name of <hi>Simonians,</hi> from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as if he were the Author of their Sect, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great named the <hi>Arians Porphyrians.</hi> Secondly, that all his Books and all other Books whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contrary to the Decrees of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> Council should be brought in, and publickly burnt. Thirdly, that they should be debarr'd of all Meeting Places either in Publick or Private, with the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63060:136"/>
Penalty of Proscription of Goods upon all Offenders against any branch of this Law. And because after this, some Men publisht the same Opinions in new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and ambiguous Terms, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to revive them under the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some of the Ancients,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Liberat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus ended the Council and the Heresie together. And things might have been much sooner and much more easily setled, had they not been perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly by the over-eagerness of <hi>Cyril</hi> in imposing his Anathema's as Articles of Faith, which made <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and his Party fly off, so that he was forced to quit that imposition, before they could be reconciled. But chiefly by the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the Courtiers, who took part with the Hereticks against the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and abused the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with false tales and reports, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise all the proceedings in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Upon this <hi>Eutyches</hi> flies a second time to his friends at Court, and complains that the Acts of the Council had been falsified by <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and upon that the Bishops that were present at the Council, were re-summoned, and are required to give in their Answer to the Interrogatories upon Oath, but this they unanimously refuse as an affront to their Order, because, as <hi>Basil</hi> Bishop of <hi>Seleucia</hi> replyed, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet heard of that an Oath was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Bishops, and therefore upon their word they vouch the truth and sincerity of the Record, and declare that <hi>Eutyches</hi> never made any offer of Appeal to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in his Bill of Complaint.

And to confirm all these unpriestly and unchristian Enormities, <hi>Chrysaphius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures an Imperial Rescript, which we shall find afterwards reverst by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Marcian.</hi> But within three days after the Scuffle <hi>Flavianus</hi> dies in Goal of the Wounds given him by <hi>Barsumas</hi> and his Mirmidons, and to him succeeds <hi>Anatolius,</hi> though he cannot pass at <hi>Rome</hi> without absolute submission to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Epistles, and the Catholick Church, as if they were the same thing. But <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus</hi> having carried things with so high an hand and bold success, returns home flusht and drunk with Victory, and in one of his Fits excommunicates Pope <hi>Leo</hi> himself. But the only effect of all these disorders and disturbances in the Church at that time, was the advancement of the Papal Greatness, for as this Pope never failed to exert his Power to the utmost, so every success raised his Throne to a greater height, and he so managed this advantage, as to bring the design of the Papal Supremacy, as it was laid by <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the First to its full perfection. For though the Title of Head of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church was not gain'd till <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>

the Third, yet Pope <hi>Leo</hi> went away with the Power, and as will appear by the Event, exercised a real Supremacy over the Catholick Church. For being informed of these wild disorders, he immediately calls a Council, and writes to the Emperor to Conjure him by the Holy Trinity, and as he will answer it at the Divine Tribunal, to null all the Acts of that Prophane Council, and by Vertue of an Appeal, that <hi>Flavianus</hi> made to himself before his death, demands a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council to be held in <hi>Italy.</hi> And this he seconds with another to his Sister <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> begging her intercession with the Emperor. And the Emperor <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> with his Mother <hi>Placidia,</hi> and his Queen <hi>Eudoxia</hi> hapning to visit <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, <hi>Leo</hi> so plyes them with ruful Stories of the late <hi>Ephesine</hi> Persecution, that he dissolves the Women into Tears, and engages all their Zeal to intercede with <hi>Theodosius</hi> for an <hi>Italian</hi> Council, and this they all do out of that dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Supremacy of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom <hi>Leo</hi> tells them, that our Saviour and all Antiquity had ever given the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotii Principatus,</hi>

                  </gap>, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it in their several Epistles. But the Emperor was so prepossest by his Eunuchs,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63060:142"/>
and his Zeal against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> that no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity could prevail upon him, the thing being already Canonically deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as he replyes to the Empress in answer to her Letrer of Intercession, and by an Imperial Rescript ratifies the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Flavianus</hi> as guilty of the <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Heresie, and justifies all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings against him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but if we may relye upon the Crude Reports of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> and some later Writers (which I never do) he repented before his death and sent <hi>Chrysaphius</hi> into Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however that was, no publick sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction was made to the Church till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, when <hi>Marcian</hi> reverst all the Acts of the Council together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of <hi>Theodosius</hi> by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, restored the banish'd Bishops, and removed the Body of <hi>Flavianus</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and for the complete settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church summoned a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of 630 Bishops in the Year 451, first at <hi>Nice,</hi> and afterward at the request of the Fathers, at <hi>Calcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these being sensible of the Abuses that had been put upon the Church, by the Imperial Delegates in several Councils, they were desirous that the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self might, if there hap'ned any Contest about their Proceedings, interpose by his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63060:143"/>
own immediate Authority; he being then detein'd by urgent Affairs of State at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Calcedon</hi> being no more then a Miles distance on the other side the <hi>Thracian Bosphorus.</hi> And by this putting themselves into his Imperial Majesties own Protection, they in a great measure secured the Liberties of the Church, and rescued it from the long continued Abuses of the Court-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees; insomuch that though the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror sent many of his Chief Officers of State to manage and moderate in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, yet they never presumed to conclude any thing, till himself was present at the 6th Session. But the Council being met at the Emperor's Summons, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> sends his Legates and his Letters, in which he is pleased to take notice of his Majesties particular Respect to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See, in that he did not Summon, but only invite him to the Council, when he was not obliged to appear in Person, or as <hi>Hilarus,</hi> one of his Delegates, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pleads in the Council it self, that it was without Precedent and against all Prescription for a Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Council.<note place="margin">

And the Council being opened, <hi>Pascha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinus,</hi> that was the Fore-man of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy, moves in his Masters name, <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>the head of all Churches,</hi> that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> may be call'd to the Bar, and not suffer'd to sit as Judg in Council, otherwise himself and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were commanded by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to remonstrate. Here the Judges require his Accusation. To this <hi>Lucentius,</hi> another Legate, replys, That his Crime was too evident, in that he had presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to assume to himself the Authority of a Judg, and pass't sentence, not only without, but against the judgment of the Apostolick See, which as it never ought to be done, so it never had been done; and for this reason he is not admitted to sit upon the Bench, but is turn'd down to the Bar, and his Indictment is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Dorilaeum.</hi> But its Prosecution was at present superseded by <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s appearing in Council, that occasion'd a Tumult of the <hi>Egyptian, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrican</hi> and <hi>Palestine</hi> Bishop, against him, and the Eastern, <hi>Pontick, Asiatick</hi> and <hi>Thracian</hi> Bishops for him, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Animosity between him and <hi>Cyril</hi> about the Anathema's. From hence they fall to the Examination of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63060:144"/>
the Acts of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, where the forgeries, the frauds, the violent and illegal Proceedings of <hi>Dioscorus, Juvenal,</hi> and their Associates against <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> are at large most shamefully expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the World, but their punishment is referred to the Emperor, and so ends the first Action.</p>
               <p>In the second they proceed to treat of the settlement of the Faith, where they establish the Nicene Faith against <hi>Arius,</hi> the <hi>Ephesine</hi> against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and the Epistle of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Flavianus</hi> against <hi>Eutyches,</hi> as necessary Expositions of the Faith. In the third Session (which <hi>Valesius</hi> says ought to have been the second) comes on the Tryal of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus,</hi> who upon divers Accusations brought into the Council against him, and after three Citations refusing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, is deposed. It is pretty to observe in this sentence, how under this swelling Pope the Acts and Forms of Court were innovated for the advantage of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power. The Libels or Petitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Offender are addrest in the first place to the Oecumenical Arch-bishop and Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then to the Council it self. And then none must denounce the Sentence, but his own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and that too must be done, not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63060:144"/>
in the name of the Council, but in the Name and by the Authority of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and this being done, the Council signifie their sentence to the Emperor and Empress, where again they give all the glory of the Action to Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> In the fourth Action, beside repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the former Decrees, a Committee is appointed to debate farther concerning the Faith, and <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle, which they represent to the Council as agreeable in all particulars to the Nicene Faith. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the Judges acquaint the Fathers that the Emperor is pleased to refer back the sentence against the Accomplices of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> to themselves, but they tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, and following the dance of that shameless <hi>Ecebolian Juvenal</hi> of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and subscribing the Epistle of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> are reconciled and admitted to sit. In the next place the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops refuse to subscribe either the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> or the confirmation of <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle, during the Vacancy of the Arch bishoprick of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> upon the deposition of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> it being both against the Canons and the Custom of their Church, to act any thing without the consent of their Arch-bishop. But this the Council interpret a meer shift and tergiversation, to escape the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63060:145"/>
subscription to their Decrees, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore insist upon it before their dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And tell them withal, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was valid as to the ordinary Affairs of their own Province, but ought to be anticipated and superseded by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of general Councils, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and over-rule all Provincial Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. In answer to this they declare their own readiness to subscribe, but dare not for fear of the People when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, who they knew would lay violent hands upon them, for betraying the Rights of the great <hi>Alexandrian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.</hi> And after long drawing on either side, the matter is adjusted by the mediation of the Secular Judges, that their subscription should be respited till the election of a new Arch-bishop, which was accepted by <hi>Paschasinus</hi> the Popes Legate, upon this condition that they would give Security by Oath or Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to depart the City till that was done, which being readily perform'd it ended the Controversie. After this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Petition of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Monks of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the Emperor, which he referr'd to the Council, as he did all other Addresses, but it being in behalf of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> against the Council, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly their own Bishop <hi>Anatolius,</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:63060:145"/>
from whom they threaten to divide Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if they persist in their Sentence against <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> they are taught by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ëtius</hi> the Arch-deacon of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in a <hi>Premunire</hi> against the 4<hi>th</hi> and 5<hi>th</hi> Canons of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Presbyters are actually excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, that presume to separate from their own Bishop. But before they can be farther heard in Council, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to subscribe the Epistle of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> against <hi>Eutyches</hi> and his prophane Novelties, which refusing they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from their Orders and expell'd their Monasteries. The Imperial, or (as the Council phrases it) <hi>the external Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the holy Laws of their Ancestors, backing their Decree against the Contumacious.</hi> This Action is shut up with a very fair decision of a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie between <hi>Photius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Eustathius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Beryte,</hi> who being a subject Bishop to <hi>Photius</hi> had <gap reason="foreign">

But this great Council now sitting, <hi>Photius</hi> Petitions the Emperor to write to the Council to redress his wrong,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63060:146"/>
which is easily granted, where the cause being debated, <hi>Eustathius</hi> confesses the Canon against him, but pleads the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Rescript against that.

               <p>In the 5<hi>th</hi> Action after many Debates, the Judges having no mind to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistle, the Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the settlement of the Faith, and having first approved the Creeds of the three other general Councils, they add a 4<hi>th</hi> of their own framing against <hi>Eutyches,</hi> not that they intended to make a new Creed; but as a necessary decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ancient Faith against his upstart Heresie.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63060:147"/>
in all the Histories of it. For the Council being fully agreed about the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Faith in the last Session, in this the Emperor with his Empress at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a great Train of Nobles, comes to confirm their Decrees, as he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in his Speech to the Holy Fathers. <hi>Nos enim ad sidem confirmandam, non ad potentiam aliquam exercendam ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore having the Acts of the last Session read before him, with the Subscriptions of all the Bishops to the Confession of Faith, he there imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enacts this Penal Law to inforce the observation of their Decree.
<q>The Catholick Faith being declared by the holy Synod according to the Tradition of the Fathers, we think it both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and our duty to cut off for the time to come all farther Debates about it. If therefore any private Citizen, Soldier or Clergy-man shall hereafter make any disturbance by attempting any publick Disputation about the Faith, the Citizen shall be banisht, the Soldier disbanded, and the Clerk depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and be obnoxious to further pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment

For having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served some defects in the Clergy, both against the ancient Canons and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Laws, he propounds it to the Council that they would take care to provide for their Reformation. And this, he declares, he does out of meer Respect and Honor to their Function, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more decent that they should be canonically determin'd in Council, then enacted and inforced by his own Imperial Laws. And as it was a civil Decency, so it was no more, for the Abuses that he complain'd of, were such as concern'd the Peace of the Empire, as well as the Church, as the Tumults and Disorders of the Monks, frequent Instances whereof as we have met with through the whole progress of this Story, so were they the Masters of these present Revels. And certainly such Disorders concern'd his own Imperial Power, if the Peace of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63060:148"/>
Empire did so. As for his other two Proposals, the first against the trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the second against the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the Clergy, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly subject to the Imperial Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though these and the like irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities were first forbidden by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Canons, yet they had before this time been often restrain'd by the Imperial Laws, as we have seen above out of the <hi>Theodosian Code.</hi> After this the Emperor in Complement to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Holy Martyr St. <hi>Euphemia,</hi> in whose Church the Council was held, gives the City of <hi>Calcedon</hi> the honor of a Titular Metropolis, securing all the Rights of Metropolitical Power to the Metropolitan of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> And here some say the Council ended, the Fathers having dispatcht the whole work, for which they were summon'd, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sessions being only taken up with casual and personal Controversies, and therefore by some of the Ancients they are made distinct Councils, and this latter part in some of their Writings goes under the name of the 5<hi>th</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>The seventh Session is spent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Agreement or Concordate between <hi>Juvenal</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:63060:148"/>
of <hi>Antioch</hi> about dividing their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations. How <hi>Juvenal</hi> that had been all along such an active Confederate with <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> and stood guilty of the same Crimes, came to meet with so much favor, is easie enough to conceive, being a great Court-Parasite, and Church-trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and so by his cringings and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had wrigled himself into the good Opinion of the Fathers. In the 8<hi>th</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>Theodoret</hi> is restored to his Church, upon his anathematising <hi>Nestorius</hi> and his Heresie; and that was a very easie matter for him to do, when he had all along done the same, having only oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the unseasonable imposition of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Anathema's. The 9<hi>th</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Actions were taken up with the case of <hi>Ibas</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Edessa,</hi> who had been accused to the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> by some <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi> as guilty of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie, and by him the cause was referr'd to a Synod at <hi>Beryte,</hi> in which he anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised <hi>Nestorius</hi> and all his Doctrines, and was cleared of his Indictment. But in the violent Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain accused by <hi>Eutyches</hi> himself, and without being heard, deposed and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd. But now upon his Petition is heard in this Council, and after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of all Records and Witnesses,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63060:149"/>
he is again found clear of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, all the Accusation being grounded upon his opposition to <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Anathema's. And the true State and Account of that Controversie between <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and the Eastern Bishops against both, is best described by <hi>Ibas</hi> himself in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Epistle to <hi>Maris Persa,</hi> recorded among the Acts of the 10th Session. The subject of the 11th and 12th Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was a Contest between <hi>Bassianus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> for the Bishoprick of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but they being both uncanonically ordein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are both deposed. Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> move that the new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop may be Consecrated at <hi>Ephesus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons. No, say the <hi>Constantinopolitans,</hi> but in this City ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Custom, as they falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for all their Usurpations, to do illegal things, and then make them a Precedent to warrant their illegal doings. This occasions a new Contest about the Prerogative of the Bishop of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to ordein other Metropolitans; but he and his Party being conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the weakness of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they let fall the Controversie. The most observable passage in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, next to the Contest it self, and the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Plea to justifie their
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63060:149"/>
Usurpation by illegal Custom against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, is the Plea of <hi>Bassianus</hi> to make good the Title to his Bishoprick, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was Consecrated by the Bishops of the Province, and his Consecration allowed and confirmed by the Emperor, and that is an instance of the Custom of those times, that the Princes Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was necessary to the Instalment of a Bishop, though the Power of Election was placed in the Provincial Synod. Upon what reason of State this Power of the Prince was grounded, I shall shew, when I come to argue the reason of the thing, at present I only alledge this as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the practice. And of the same nature is the next Action, of a Case set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a new Custom and the pretence of an Imperial Rescript against Canon and Ancient Practice. For whereas <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia</hi> had ever been the Metropolis of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> the Emperors <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> had conferred the Title and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Metropolis upon the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> reserving the Metropolitan Power to <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> Upon occasion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this Grant <hi>Anastasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nice</hi> usurps to himself the Power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over some part of the Province, and particularly <hi>Basilonopolis</hi>; of this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63060:150"/>
of <hi>Bithynia</hi> makes his Complaint to the Council: and they to adjust the Ecclesiastical Canons and the Imperial Rescript, grant the Honour of a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis to <hi>Nice,</hi> but so as to reserve the Power entire to <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Aëtius</hi> the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> (who lay at catch for all opportunities to advance the Grandeur of that See,) interposes a provision that this Decree may not be interpreted to the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of whose Power to ordain the Bishops of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silonopolis</hi> he was ready to produce divers Precedents. But this was rejected by the Fathers, as being, whether true or false as to matter of Fact, contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, so that hitherto they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fasten any of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Usurpations upon the Authority of the Council.</p>
               <p>The next Transaction is to correct and rectifie another Irregularity of that pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring See in the Controversie between <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Sabinianus,</hi> for the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Perrha.</hi> For whereas <hi>Athanasius</hi> had been Canonically deposed by his own Metropolitan, he repairs to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> and makes his Complaints to <hi>Proclus,</hi> who according to his Custom greedily embraces his Appeal, and writes to <hi>Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:63060:150"/>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> in his behalf, who upon it calls a Council to review the former Judgment; which he had in great kindness committed to <hi>Panolbius,</hi> that was an intimate friend to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and upon enquiry finds that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was so conscious to himself of the Crimes laid to his Charge, that he never durst stand his Tryal, and to avoid it, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd his Bishoprick, and withal was so diffident of his Cause at the second hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he durst not so much as appear, under pretence that <hi>Domnus</hi> his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan was his Enemy, and so is again depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And yet for all this he is so restless as to bring his old Complaints even to this Great Council, and they taking a full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of all the former Proceedings, find that they can afford him no Relief, and yet because he had an excuse for his Non-appearance at his last Tryal, <hi>viz.</hi> The enmity between him and <hi>Domnus,</hi> they were so tender as not to give final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against him, but refer the effectual Judgment of the Cause to <hi>Maximus</hi> the present Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> against whom he could make no Exception.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the Proceedings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were fair and regular enough, but in the next Session, in which they draw up their Canons, the Clergy of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:63060:151"/>
with some others that they had pack't together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being not above a third part of the Council, put a slur upon the whole Council, for whereas 27 Canons were Voted and Subscribed by all the Fathers, after the rising of the Council, the Judges, and the Legates, they Vote another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non granting an exorbitant and illegal Power to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Metropolitans of three whole Diocesses, and clap that to the Canons of the Council; but with what ingenuity it was done, and how worthily defended, when the Abuse was complained of in the next meeting, and how slitely the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was carried by the Judges, and what fierce and bloody Wars it occasioned in the Church between the two Great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I have already elsewhere represented, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall forbear any farther Account of it here, where my main design is to give an account of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>story of the right Concurrence of the distinct Powers of Church and State in its Government. And setting aside this last Action, that was carried by fraud and stealth, this Council seems to have been more decent and regular in its Proceedings then any other whatsoever since the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and had this advantage above the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63060:151"/>
rest, that it was not left to the superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of one or two Courtiers, but was committed to the Care and Conduct of a great number of Persons of Honour and Quality, who behaved themselves with all the decency of temper, prudence, and civility. For as they managed the order of proceedings and interlocutions with great Art, cutting off all impertinency and unnecessary talk; so they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed the Authority of their own Judgment in any matter, but entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred every thing little or great to the determination of the Bishops, and were so complemental in their respect to the Church, that they would not presume to be so much as present at those Sessions, in which the Confession of Faith was drawn up, that being only a work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to those who were Commissionated to it by our Saviour himself. And when it was finisht the Emperor declares, That it was not establisht by his own, but by the Councils Authority, that he came to own and confirm what they had Enacted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so requires all his Subjects to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in what was settled by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, under severe Penalties to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ates were guilty of great and shameless disingenuity in the last Session, not only breaking, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and falsifying the Canons of the Church, yet the Emperor and Judges cannot be very much blamed, who were Strangers to these matters, and took the motion to be nothing else then a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of particular respect and honour to the Imperial City, and as such they pass it, that as the Ancient Canons had given pre-eminence to the Bishop of old <hi>Rome</hi> out of respect to the dignity of the head City, so new <hi>Rome</hi> being now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to an Equality with it in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it was but fit to raise it to the same degree of honour in the Church. And that had been no great harm, had it been done without robbing other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of their just Rights and Priviledges, which though the Clergy understood, the Laicks did not, because what was here settled by Law, they had always seen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by Custom, and therefore had no reason to look upon it as an Innovation. But as for the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63060:152"/>
was the proper business of this Council, it being so fairly Condemned by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Judgment, they according to Form and Custom send the Relation to the Emperor for his Royal Confirmation, wherein they do not so much acquaint him with their Decree, (with which he had been before acquainted, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it in the 6th Session) as justifie their Authority to make it, and it is a very rational discourse of the true use of Councils and their Authoritative deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in the Christian Church. It is not (say they) to make new Doctrines of Faith, but to protect the old Truths against the wantonness of Innovators; so that if all men would be content with the Ancient Faith, it would be needless for the Church to make any new Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but when men leave the old Track of Religion, to loose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their own new contrived Labyrinths, and corrupt the plain and simple Truth with over nice and curious Inventions, it is then necessary for the Church to stop their Vanity, by its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Declaration of the Truth it self. Not as if there were something de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the Faith, and the Church were always adding to it, but to make such wholesome Provisions, as it judges most
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63060:153"/>
convenient against all Innovated Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. And this they exemplifie by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And much more to this purpose, and it is the true State of the Authority of Councils, to make Decrees, to stop the vanities and singularities of Innovators; and when they are made, they become obligatory by their own Authority, and nothing can hinder or take off their Obligation, but an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent contrariety to the Divine Law. So that it neither concerns nor becomes the Subject to make a strict and Philosophical search after the truth of the Decree, it is enough to him that it is not apparently false. In all other Cases the Authority of the Church is sufficient to justifie his Obedience before God, by whose Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they were placed under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And the want of this just Civility to Superiors has in all Ages been

condemnation of the <hi>tria capitula</hi> after they had been tryed and acquitted by the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> with this remark upon it.
<q>The Emperor <hi>Marcian</hi> judged it no less than Prophaneness and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to review the Sacerdotal Judgment, and therefore that being once pass't, it was an end of all Controversie. Here behold a Prince indeed, a true Father of the Common-Wealth, and a true Son of the Church, that does not dictate, but follow Ecclesiastical Decrees, declaring by his Edict, That whoever after the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the truth, shall pretend to make any farther inquiry, can seek for nothing but Error. For this saying forever blessed be his Memory all the World over, who not only recover'd the sinking Empire, but also restored last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace to the poor distracted Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Edict was reinforced by a second a Month after, and Copies of it sent to all the several <hi>Praefecti-praetorio</hi> for its more effectual Execution. And they are both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in a third Rescript, published the year following, in which this Heresie, and all the ways of propagating it, are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by all the punishments against all other Heretiques: So that it is in reality a neat Compendium of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63060:154"/>
all the Laws under the Title <hi>de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis</hi> in the <hi>Theodosian Code.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the bastard Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> in which <hi>Flavianus, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Theodoret,</hi> and many other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bishops were condemn'd, had been ratified by a Rescript of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> he here cancels its full force as to all the Sufferers that were surviving. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Itch was got among the Monks of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> to the raising of botches and tumults, especially at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the disorderly behavior of one <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who made himself Bishop of the place, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Empress write to them to desist at their farther peril. But it seems some were stubborn and irreclaimable (and no sort of Men so obstinate as those that live remote from the Conversation of the World) and therefore in the year 455 the Emperor renews his former Rescript, particularly to be put in Execution at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the Heresie most reign'd, and that is the last time that he appear'd against them. And thus in four years time by protecting the Church in its due Authority, and by abetting their Decrees with Penal Laws, and by seeing his own Laws put in effectual Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he put an end to this powerful and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63060:155"/>
prevailing Heresie, though it had gain'd both the Eunuchs and the Empire to its side.</p>

Neither did he suggest any thing of his own thoughts, lest it should be suspected that their Answer was suited to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Will, and this he did, not only out of respect to the Discipline of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, but because he very well knew that no forced Decrees were of any Authority in themselves, for when a Sentence is forced, it is not his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by whom it is pronounced. And the cause that carries it, gains nothing by it, but the advantage lies on the side of the Party condemn'd, for it is evident, that he was not at liberty to judg aright, whose Judgment is forced, for a forced Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63060:157"/>
is none at all. And therefore this Emperor of blessed Memory preserved the Peace of the Church, because he would not presume to establish any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins by his own Authority, and usurp that Power that is proper to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood alone. Whereas had he prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Council, and they meerly lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quied to his instructions, it is evident that one Lay-man, that was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judg of those Matters, really pass't the judgment, and not those who were the only proper Judges of the Cause. And withal he very well understood, that forced Councils never came to any good effect, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ariminum</hi> under <hi>Constantius,</hi> and the false Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> under <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus.</hi> And therefore though himself could have pass't a right sentence, yet he would not, because he would not render the Sentence of the Church sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and by that means evacuate its Authority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But as the whole Eastern Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this business, so no Man was more active, not to say more imperious, in it than Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who was ever for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things through with an high hand, and having raised himself to the height of Authority, resolved to keep it up. For
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63060:157"/>
it was no small point of Grandeur that he gain'd, when he procured that his own private Epistle should be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Catholick Church, and made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Decrees of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. But that which advanced him to the top-round of Power, was his signal Victory over <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Bishops, when he forced them to eat and reverse their 28<hi>th</hi> Canon, made <hi>Anatolius</hi> submit and beg his pardon, brought the Emperor <hi>Marcian</hi> himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most upon his Knees, and forced him to renounce his own Imperial Rescript, thô made in favor of his own Imperial City. This great success could not but swell his mind, that was already but too great of it self, and thereupon he takes the supreme and indeed single manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things into his own hands. And when no Man, no not the Emperor himself dares withstand his Commands, so severe and peremptory were they, that for a good time he kept the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Cause sufficiently low and humble. And to say the truth, setting aside his by-design of advancing the Grandeur of his own See, he acted nothing, that was not only warrantable but justly praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. For when once a Controversie is decided by the Authority of the Church,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63060:158"/>
no Christian Bishop can be too vigorous in his proceedings against all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t refuse submission to the Decree. Here Peace and Government lye at stake as well as Truth, and unless they are preserved, the Church is lost, and the Society dissolved into meer Tumult and Confusion. Whilst Controversies are on foot and have not received the Judgment of the Church, we may allow Men to be moderate or eager in their Disputes about them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or natural Tempers. But after the Church has interposed its Authority, there all moderation is at best but Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and the Reverence due to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands will call forth every honest Mans utmost zeal in its defence. And that was the case here that the <hi>Eutychians</hi> moved for a review by a new Council: No, says Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> that were to offer an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Authority of the Church in the great Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of putting an end to Schisms and Contentions, to make them perpetual for the humor and pleasure of every peevish talker.<note place="margin">Epist. 25.</note>

                  <q>Your Majesty cannot but observe the crafty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Hereticks, that there should be a farther Debate between the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and us, as if there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing already determin'd, and the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement made by the Holy Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> to the great joy of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church all the World over, should be slited to a dishonorable refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it self.</q>
And whereas the Emperor desired him to send Commissioners, he offers to send
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63060:159"/>
them, not to dispute with the Hereticks, that he scorns, but to put the Sentence of the Church in effectual execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Which was accordingly done, and <hi>Timotheus Aelurus</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, banisht and imprison'd, and when he petition'd for leave to come to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> there to make a publick declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie, to this Pope <hi>Leo</hi> says No again, for though that may set him right as to his Faith, yet it can never wash away the guilt of his wicked and bloody Actions, the Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof requires some other expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than fair Confessions, and therefore he enjoins <hi>Gennadius</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> not so much as to admit him into his presence at his peril, as he had not long before school'd his Predecessor <hi>Anatolius</hi> for being too remiss against the Hereticks, and suffering one <hi>Atticus</hi> a Presbyter publickly to dispute the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychian</hi> Controversie, after the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the great Council. The sum of all is, that the matter was already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Authority of the Church, and after that there remains no liberty of Dispute. And therefore instead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging that, he advises the Emperor to exert his Imperial Power in defence of the Faith, and that when the Church had
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63060:160"/>
done its part in declaring it, it was now his duty to maintain it against the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of restless Spirits. <hi>Cùm enim Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiam tuam Dominus tantâ Sacramenti Illuminatione ditaverit, debes incunctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advertere, Regiam Potestatem tibi non solùm ad Mundi regimen, sed maximè ad Ecclesiae praesidium esse collatam: ut ausus nefarios comprimendo, et quae bene sunt statuta defendas, et veram pacem his, quae sunt turbata, restituas,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Seeing your Majesty is, by the Grace of God, endued with so good an Understanding, you ought out of hand to consider that Your Royal Power was given you from above, not only for the Government of the Empire, but chiefly for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church, that by suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing seditious Attempts, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what is already establisht, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Peace, where things are in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q>
That is the true state of the use of Regal Power in the Government of the Church, to protect and assist it in the free exercise of its own legislative Authority, not to assume and annex it to the Imperial Crown. It would be an endless thing to transcribe all the Passages to the same purpose, out of the several Returns made to the Emperor from the Eastern Bishops, they all move upon this
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63060:160"/>
one hinge, that what was determin'd by the Church was Sacred Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no review or farther dispute of the Resolution of the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Council. And thus was this stubborn Controversie laid, and the Church settled in Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity all this Emperor's Reign. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these Laws of Discipline to enforce the Authority of the Church, he made divers other Laws in behalf of the Church, that were meer acts of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace and Favor, bestowing several Priviledges and Immunities upon Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Church-men.

Imperial Constitutions he might have found enough to ratifie the Sentence of the Church, but for an Emperor to pass an Anathema by his own meer Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon any Opinion, much more against a solemn Decree of the Church, was a rudeness and presumption without Precedent as well as Law, and no man that was not a Clown as well as a Tyrant would ever have attempted it. But as prophane a piece of Buffoonry as it was, it is own'd by the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Faction in a Council at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and that too under the prophane Title of a Divine and Apostolical Epistle. But it is as vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently opposed by <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Monks of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> till the People tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in defence of their Bishop against the Tyrant, so as to force him to quit the City, who in revenge takes away all the Priviledges of the Church and City. But being informed of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s marching
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63060:162"/>
from <hi>Isauria</hi> in the Head of an Army, he begs pardon, and to appease <hi>Acacius</hi> and the Clergy of the City, he publishes his Antencyclical Epistles, as they are call'd, to reverse and cancel the former, and restore the Authority of the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> (And what will not Usurpers do to keep possession?) but all in vain: for at <hi>Zeno</hi>'s approach to the City he is utterly deserted, and deposed with more ease then he had usurped, is put to death at <hi>Acusus</hi> or <hi>Cucusus</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and his Encyclical Epistle cancell'd and burnt. Upon this the very same Bishops of the <hi>Eutychian,</hi> or rather the then thriving Party, that had subscribed it at the late Cabal or Conventicle at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be their own voluntary Act without any force or compulsion, are now most forward to write to <hi>Acacius</hi> to condemn it, and protest before God and the World, that what they had done was forced upon them against their own Judgments.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63060:162"/>
and for the satisfaction of all Parties, publishes by the contrivance of <hi>Petrus Moggus</hi> and his <hi>Eutychian</hi> Friends at Court, and some say of <hi>Acacius</hi> himself, an healing Instrument of Union or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, commonly known by the name of <hi>Henoticon,</hi> designed to please all Parties, and couch't in such compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive and ambiguous terms, that they might all challenge it to themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst each other: <hi>viz.</hi> Setting up the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith as the only condition of Church-Communion, and thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly but effectually condemning the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> without taking any notice of it. So weak was this Prince as to flatter himself, that this slender Artifice was a Cement strong enough to repair all the Breaches in the Christian Church, when it really served no Bodies turn but <hi>Petrus Moggus</hi> and his <hi>Eutychians,</hi> for he having a strong Inclination to the rich Bishoprick of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of which he could not be capable till the terms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that were settled by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> were taken off: which being done by this slite, the Church Doors were again left open to the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian</hi> Hereticks, and all things reduced to the same disorder and confusion that they were in, before they were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63060:163"/>
by the Authority of the Church.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> And so <hi>Facundus</hi> here argues upon it with his usual acuteness:
<q>Who can endure the Arbitrary Proceedings of the Emperor <hi>Zeno</hi> to Enact in Contempt of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Church, in which Action his precipitate Power did not consider what it ought to do, but what it was able to do; neither did he understand that confusion never makes Unity. For if Unity be to be compast, not by the Conversion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, but mixing their Contagion with the Communion of the Church, why are the <hi>Acephali</hi> alone, and not all the other Parties of Hereticks recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church without renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their errors, and submitting to the Churches Sentence against them? But the Emperor when he invites them to return to the Communion of the Church, he gives them the Title of Orthodox. But this becomes the wisdom and circumspection of that man, that can be so insipid as to think of invading the Office of the Priests. He calls them Orthodox, when at the same time he confesses them to be separate from the Communion of the Church. If they continue Orthodox after their separation, to what purpose does he exhort them to return to their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63060:163"/>
Mother the Church. But he would have them unite Communions. But he understands not that there can be but one Communion. And if they are not of one Communion with the Church, they are of none at all. I pray for what advantage should they return to the Church, when they are of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Communion without it? But what an abuse of Secular Power is this, and worse then all the rest, that the Holy Catholick Church and those that preside over it, should every where be obliged to believe only as he believes, as if the Faith of all Churches depended only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his pleasure, and it were not lawful for any man to believe any thing than as the Emperor commands? It were much better that he would contain himself with in his own Limits, then to transgress them to the ruine of many without the gain of any. For we know that even Mechanicks have their Shops and Ware-houses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their own Trade. We never hear the Anvil beating or the Fire glowing in the Weavers Work-house, nor the Tailor taking measure of the height and proportion of Buildings, because they very well know that those things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belong to those that are instructed in those Trades. What is the Divine Law only to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63060:164"/>
and prophaned, so as not to need its proper Schools for instruction, but that every man should pretend to understand it, without any competent Education in it. In short, the only effect of all these disorderly Proceedings is, that these Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Churches Peace divide among themselves as well as from the Church, as in this particular Case we have by sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found a long and fatal Schism, till the Divine Providence cured the wound by your Majesties Care and Power (spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to <hi>Justinian</hi>) and therefore great Sir in the name of God persevere in so good a work, that has been accepted with the joy of the whole Christian World, and blot not out its glory by deserting it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
And that is the natural and inevitable Event of all trimming tricks, that instead of reconciling Parties, as 'tis pretended, it only lets them loose to worry one another. And withal, first adds to the insolence of that Party that had been tyed up, the contempt of that Authority that restrain'd it, and then kindles the rage and indignation of the other Party that had gained the upper-hand, and lastly, that which is worst of all, it makes breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for new Divisions And so it hap'ned here, <hi>Peter Mongus</hi> having by this device got possession of his Bishoprick, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63060:164"/>
to trim and comply with both Parties, and by it incurs the hatred of both, loosing his own without winning the other: And they communicating neither with the Catholicks nor with their own Bishop, became a new Sect, called <hi>Acephali,</hi> i. e. Men without an Head, so natural is it for all shufflings in Government to end in Anarchy and Confusion: It was this wise way of quacking to cure the wounds of the Church by <hi>Irenicum</hi> Plaisters and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Weapon-salves, that brought the breach between the Eastern and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches to an incurable <hi>Eresipulus,</hi> or Fire of Contention over the Face of the Christian Church. For <hi>Petrus Mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> being by that means received by <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> not only to Catholick Communion, but advanced to a Top-Bishoprick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary not only to the ancient Canons, but to the late Decree of the Council of <hi>Calcedon: Acacius</hi> is upon it call'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by Pope <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and persisting in his Treachery, is excommunicated in a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that laid the ground of all those Contests, that followed after upon the <hi>Acacian</hi> Schism (as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> stile it) to the final Separation of both Churches. And what else can be expected from such a daubing Cement
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63060:165"/>
of Peace, to unite men in the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as leaves them under all their differences and contrarieties of Opinion, a contradiction in the nature of the thing; for if they are in good earnest, they will pursue their differences, if they are not, indulgence is needless, and they are to be reclaim'd another way: but whether they are, or are not, if they are allowed their liberty, every man will be of his own mind, and an enemy to every man that is not, and the result of all is, that how much soever they dissent among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they shall be forced to counterfeit an agreement, but dissembling is no Tye. And therefore after such devices the next thing that we always hear of, is, that the breach is made much wider. And thus here beside the Contest between <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Simplicius, Petrus Moggus</hi> falls out with both, and instead of taking the Catholicks into his comprehensive Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, in a short time, finding they would not quit their Principles and the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> raises a severe Persecution against them, and peremptorily refuses all Communion to all that adhere to the Council, and upon it the Church of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> continued in a State of Schism through a long Succession of Bishops into the next Century, till the Pacisicators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63060:165"/>
fell out among themselves, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into new and fiercer Factions and Animosities. And not only that Church, to which the healing <hi>Henoticon</hi> was particularly directed, but the whole Catholick Church was every where dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into irreconcileable Wars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions. But as sad as the event of the <hi>Henoticon</hi> proved, there is one pleasant Passage to be observed about it, that whereas before there were but two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a third, call'd the <hi>Haesitantes</hi> or <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that were neither for, nor against the Council, and as both Parties hated these more than they did one another, as Traitors to both; so they again under pretence of indifferency and moderation, requited them with all the violence of Persecution, and when they had got the Emperor <hi>Anastasius,</hi> a serious Prince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, they stir'd him up to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute both the extreme Parties with a more than ordinary severity, as we shall see more at large when we come to his Reign. But first let us take a view of the particular Mischiefs, that it soon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under <hi>Zeno</hi> himself, who too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his trimming was forced at last to turn Persecutor.</p>
               <p>

But though there is no clear Evidence that it was his contrivance, yet it is undeniable that he gave it too great acceptance, and by that means gave too just advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> to insult over him. For though their private Design was to beat down the growing greatness of the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the utmost severity, that they could use against him, by betraying the Discipline and Authority of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church so dishonorably, as to receive such Persons into its Communion, that had been cast out of it by no less Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the Sentence of a General Council, and that upon no better War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant than a <hi>Mandate</hi> from Court. And that I take to be the Shop in which the wise Contrivance was forged between the Courtiers, out of an Itch to be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with Church-work, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Eutychians</hi> either to recover their Preferments, or usurp other Mens; and through the whole sequel of the Story we shall find the old <hi>Eusebian</hi> Game

But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was big with his new Project of comprehension, and was deaf to all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice against it, and <hi>Acacius</hi> being secure of him, he slites <hi>Foelix</hi> his Letters, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisons his Legates, and draws them in, to join Communion with himself and <hi>Moggus.</hi> Upon the news whereof ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Council is immediately summon'd at

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> where the sentence of Deposition and Excommunication is denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.

               <p>This was the effect of this shrewd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Comprehension, in these three head Churches of <hi>Rome, Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> nothing less than a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal breach of Communion, and one of the fiecrest Schisms that ever befel the Christian Church, and though the Peace between them was patcht up about 34 years after, by the Power and Activity of Pope <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> yet they were never heartily reconcil'd to this very day. As for <hi>Acacius</hi> it is a dispute what he was, some indict him of Heresie or Church-treason, others only of high Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, though as for my own part after all streins of Candor, I cannot but think him guilty of both, or I fear something worse, the want of a serious sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. To free him from the high charge of Heresie, it is pleaded that he never in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63060:171"/>
the least own'd the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Faith, that he ever declared against it, that he was never charged with it by the Ancients, and that in the Sentence against him at <hi>Rome,</hi> where all his Crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s were strictly enough enumerated, this is no Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. But yet for all this I see not how he can be absolved from it, for in the Eye of the Law, and indeed the common sense of the World, all Commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on with Hereticks is and ought to be judged He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, as in all Civil Laws all consulting with Traitors is deem'd Treason. For it concerns not the Government to fish out every Man's Opinion or motive of his Practice, that can judg only by overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts, and then to communicate with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks is Heresie, and to consult with Traitors Treason. But much more in this particular Case, in which all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Hereticks had been Canonically declared Heresie by the Church in the great Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and without it the sentence of the Church had been of no force, for that can reach no farther than their outward Communion. So that after all, the <hi>Henoticon</hi> was so far from compromising the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, as it pretended, and I believe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, that it only reverst and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Decree of the Church, and by
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63060:171"/>
an Imperial Rescript declared that to be no Heresie, that had been judged so by the Council, and that I take it, is plain bidding defyance to it and its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>As for the other Crimes charged upon him, they are enormous enough, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendship with such ill Men as <hi>Mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and <hi>Fullo,</hi> shews he had but very little sense of Honesty, or indeed of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, otherwise he would have loath'd and defyed Men of such rank Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. But the leading Sin, that betray'd him into all his other Miscarriages was his Pride and Ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that, it is plain that he stuck not to subvert all the Discipline of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. For finding the Emperor <hi>Zeno</hi> fond of his <hi>Henoticon,</hi> he at least frankly complyed with it, to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the first and fundamental Law of all Church-Communion, in receiving Hereticks into it without Canonical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Satisfaction. And this is suggested in the Decree of the Council at <hi>Rome</hi> against him, that he preferr'd the Emperor's favor above his own Faith; and then it is no matter to what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such perfidious Men pretend, when it is too apparent that they have really none at all. And the case of the Church
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63060:172"/>
at this time was much the same, as it was under the Reigns of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi>: ill Men got into the Court, and from thence crept into the Church, and to gain Preferments for themselves flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Prince into an exorbitant use of his Power, against the true and regular Discipline of it. And that would at once give them interest at Court, and make vacancies in the Church for themselves, and this weak Prince was so drunkenly fond of this little Project, that he would throw away the best Preferments in the Church upon any Parasite, that would but seem to hugg his fondling-Ape, by which means great numbers of very bad Men came into the best Churches. But one of the greatest Instances of it is the great Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy seen the other three leading Churches brought into a Civil War among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but here it came to blows and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Throats, that I shall very briefly describe as another observable Example of the good Effects of this gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Accommodation. <hi>Petrus Fullo</hi> a Monk had been expell'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery for the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie in the time of the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> flies to <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and being a talkative Man is soon driven thence for the same Cause, and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63060:172"/>
so takes shelter at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there insinuates himself into the favor of the Princess <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and by her recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himself to the Patronage of her husband <hi>Zeno,</hi> and having gain'd that, he endeavors to dis-place <hi>Martyrius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Antioch, Zeno</hi> being then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Place, but <hi>Martyrius</hi> making his Application to the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> he is restored, and an Edict publisht against the tumults of Monks. But the Monks so little regard the Emperor's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that upon it they increase their fury against the good Bishop, till at length he being quite tired out quits his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, into which <hi>Petrus Fullo</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaps, and is as soon thrust out by the Emperor, but is restored by <hi>Basiliscus,</hi> and again displaced by <hi>Zeno,</hi> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by <hi>Acacius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> chosen to the See, who being barbarously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, another <hi>Stephanus</hi> is chosen, and contrary to the Canons consecrated by <hi>Acacius</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> the Author of all these Dis-orders is banisht into <hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> dying <hi>Calendio</hi> succeeds with the same illegal Consecration, but falling into dis-favor with <hi>Acacius,</hi> partly for siding with Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> against himself and <hi>Petrus Moggus,</hi> and partly for being too stiff for
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63060:173"/>
the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> he procures his ejectment by Imperial Power upon an Accusation of Treason, and <hi>Petrus Fullo</hi> after all these turns is placed by <hi>Acacius</hi> his own Interest in that great See. And thus we see both the old Trade of Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sequestrations return'd by prostituting the Discipline and Authority of the Christian Church to the Power of Court-Favourites, and the whole World shatter'd into numberless Schisms and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. For when once the Authority of the Church and the Law is trodden down, there is no other effectual stop aganst the rovings of fancy and wantonness, and it is certain that men who differ in Opinion will never agree, as long as they have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to differ. And thus was it here, when this unskilful Prince had once broken up the Pale of the Church as it was fixt by the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> and fenced by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, he could never after restrain the People from running into all the wild Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that Frenzy and Madness could blow into their Heads. And whereas he only design'd to unite the <hi>Eutychians</hi> to the Communion of the Church, he divided the Communion of the Church into a thousand new Factions. The <hi>Acephali, Severiani, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paschitae, Currupticolae, Phantasiastae, Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nóetae, Tritheitae,</hi> beside the horrible fewds
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63060:173"/>
between the <hi>Scythian</hi> and <hi>Acaemetan</hi> Monks. The <hi>Acephali</hi> began at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> being <hi>Eutychians</hi> that separated from <hi>Moggus</hi> uyon his owning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> out of these were spawn'd the <hi>Severiani</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> so call'd from <hi>Severus,</hi> who had ravish't that See, and made himself Captain of the <hi>Acephali</hi> by Anathematising the Council, but of him we shall give an Account under the next Reign, as under the Reign of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> they sub-divided into the Factions of the <hi>Gaianitae</hi> and <hi>Theodosiani,</hi> and the Heresie being transplanted by <hi>Jacobus Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> into <hi>Armenia,</hi> thence came the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitae.</hi> The <hi>Theopaschitae</hi> were the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Petrus Fullo,</hi> who to the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie added, that the Divinity in our blessed Saviour was Crucified and Buried. The <hi>Corrupticolae</hi> were the followers of <hi>Severus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> after his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Antioch,</hi> affirming our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Body liable to decay, and therefore to have been really repair'd by nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this was opposed by <hi>Julianus</hi> of <hi>Halicarnassus,</hi> a Bishop of the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and flying to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for the same Cause, who affirm'd that our Saviour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took any sustenance, but only seemed so to do, and therefore were called <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasiastae,</hi> and between these two the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63060:174"/>
of the City were disputed into Tumults and Out-rages. And out of the <hi>Corrupticolae</hi> sprang the <hi>Agnoitae,</hi> that from the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility</hi> of our Saviours Body, were pleased to infer some ignorance in his Soul. The <hi>Tritheitae</hi> were the followers of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponus,</hi> who was so far transported in the heat of disputation, as to assert three distinct Natures peculiar to each Person in the Holy Trinity, and one common to them all, to which he was betrayed by his <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian</hi> Philosophy, of which he was an extravagant Admirer, that teaches that there is one and the same general humane nature really common to all men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother particular nature appropriated to each individual. And thus when all the Lords People were permitted the liberty of Prophesying, every man took up his own Parable and believed his own Dream, the Ass as well as the Prophet, till the Church was shatter'd into so many chips and fragments, that it was never after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, as we shall see by the Progress of these Mischiefs, that I have here only briefly represented. And thus this luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince having ruined the Church by so many years licentiousness, only because his laziness would not be at the pains to see it governed, after he had Reign'd 18 years dies of a Debauch.</p>

This was by immemorial Custom (though <hi>Zosimus</hi> is pleased to impute its Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great) collected every fourth year, and being a Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impost without any Formality of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63060:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Law to warrant it, it was no doubt with severity enough exacted by the Officers, not so much for the profit of the Crown as their own. And this made it extreme heavy to the Subject, but that which made it Scandalous was its being a Rent-Charge upon the Stews and publick Houses of Debauchery, granting (as <hi>Evagrius</hi> describes it) a Licence to all their wickedness upon a certain Rate of Excise.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 39.</note> And for that reason it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Aurum paenosum,</hi> the Syntax or Commutation Money, which being so offensive to the People, and so foul in it self, as seeming to grant a Liberty to all manner of wickedness upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve of a Pension to the Government; upon that account as it was a just, so was it a plausible Action in this Emperor to contrive its Abrogation. And he did it with that Art and Diligence as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy not only the Exchequer-Records, but the Collectors Books; For counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting a Repentance of his Folly in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with so fair a Revenue, he Summons in all the Collectors to bring in their Court-Rolls for retrieving a new Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster out of them, this they greedily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with in hopes to recover their several Offices in the Collection, which being done he consumes all their Books in a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:63060:175"/>
publick Bone-fire, to prevent his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors from ever recovering any of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires, and so ended this barbarous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, unbecoming, as the Historian observes, not only any Christian but any Heathen Common-wealth. But soon finding this too great a retrenchment of his Revenue in Money, he is forced to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it another way as heavy upon the Subject. That whereas the Provinces had hitherto paid their Tribute in kind, he exacts it by way of Composition in Money, and whereas hitherto it had been managed by the Magistrates of Cities, who used their Neighbours kindly, he farm'd it out to his Collectors, and they to be sure would loose nothing that was to be got, but setting aside their oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it proved a very great oppression in it self to the poor Farmers, for though they might have plenty enough of Corn and Cattel to spare, yet they had scarcity enough of Money, and for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of meer humanity and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this way of Taxing had been often forbidden by divers of the preceding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</p>
               <p>As for the State of the Church under his Reign, it gives us a true Character of the Conequences of Comprehension, as it is described by <hi>Evagrius.</hi>

excessively desirous of Peace, he would permit no Innovation, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd all manner of ways that the Church should every where remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbance, and that all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should enjoy perfect Peace without brawling and contention. And for that end the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> was in those days neither openly abetted nor rejected. But every Bishop followed his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; some stickling with all their might for all the determinations of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, not allowing the alteration of the least Syllable in its Decrees, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the greatest disdain to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with any that rejected any part of it: others on the contrary did not only reject but anathematised the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and all that adhered to it; others again cryed up <hi>Zeno</hi>'s <hi>Henoticon,</hi> and though these two Parties differed among themselves about the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, yet both Parties agreed against the Council, some being seduced by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Letters, others by the pretence of Peace. So that all the Churches in the Christian World were rent into number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Schisms and Factions, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Bishops shattered all in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Hence arose infinite Quarrels between the Eastern, Western and <hi>African</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63060:176"/>
the Eastern refusing Communion with the Western and <hi>African,</hi> and they on the other side denying them the same Civility. And not only so, but the business was carried on to an higher degree of folly, for none of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among themselves, the Eastern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops breaking Communion at home, neither did the Western and <hi>African</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, though they both joyn'd against the Eastern, communicate themselves, or with any other Forraign Churches what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. All which the Emperor perceiving he deposed all Innovating Bishops, all that stuck to the Council, and all that Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematised it, and so cast <hi>Euphenius</hi> and after him <hi>Macedonius</hi> out of the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> out of the See of <hi>Antioch.</hi>

A goodly Account this of the natural effects of this wise Project of Peace and Moderation, to set all the World in a flame without redress, till at last the Peace-maker himself is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to quit his own pretence, grows angry, and violent in proceeding against all that refuse to comply with his own Will, and it is a very obvious observation of this sort of men, that when they are disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their Project, they grow moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and sullen, and are of all others the most revengeful and implacable to all
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63060:177"/>
that differ from them. And as for these dire effects of love and meekness no Man need to wonder at them, because the design it self is no better than casting away all manner of Discipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without which all Societies soon fall into War and Anarchy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do these Mischiefs end in the Church, but they break out into Tumults and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in the Common-Wealth, as we shall see anon in the Rebellion of <hi>Vitalian.</hi>

               <p>And the same Method of Moderation was put in practice every where in the Eastern Church, and among the rest the great <hi>Flavianus</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was banisht, and <hi>Severus</hi> the Monk, that mortified Man, who had long watcht for the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> placed in his stead.

He was first bred to the Law, where he might, if he would but give his Mind to it, learn all the shifts of fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, from thence he betook himself to a Monastery, to accomplish himself with all the slites of Hypocrisie, being expell'd thence, he at last betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Court, to make all his other good Qualities useful and practicable by a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient stock of Impudence, and what cannot that Man do, that is made up of so good a warp of knavery, so well wooft with Hypocrisie, lin'd through with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty? Thus accoutred to Court the demure Man comes, and finding which way the Weather-cock of Preferment stood, soon insinuates himself into the favor of the Religious Empress, and that was an easie passage to the Emperor, whom he soon got into his possession, and put him upon his severe Courses in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of moderation, only to make some good vacancy for himself.

him by Oath never to anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it, yet he could not forbear doing it publickly in the Church at the very time of his Consecration. Neither does his zeal and fury confine it self to his own Church, but he vents it in other Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and particularly procures the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Elyas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who had with many Conflicts and for many Years weather'd it against the Emperor's own folly.

               <p>But things being every where in such confusion, and the People under such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, this gives both a pretence and an opportunity to <hi>Vitalian</hi> General of the

Army to revolt, and he (God knows his heart) takes up Arms only to right and restore the banisht Bishops, and at last yields to a Peace upon condition that the Emperor would call a free Council at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> for the settlement of the Church and the restitution of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and the Emperor to make good the Article summons about 200 to the place appointed, but dismisses them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Debate.

And now the Emperor finding at last into what streights he had brought himself and his Government by his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent moderation, he grows weary of it, and writes to Pope <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Symmachus,</hi> to request his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for the resettlement of the Church. But this Pope was both a stout and a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Man, and would hear of no other terms of Peace but entire submission to the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the condemnation of <hi>Acacius:</hi> And the poor tired Emperor is ready to yield all except the last, and by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in defence of <hi>Acacius</hi> luckily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the love of his Citizens, among whom there was none of their Bishops whose Memory was more valuable than

that of <hi>Acacius.</hi> And therefore in that point he begs his Pardon, and having by that Artifice secured the People to himself, he now ventures to disband <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian,</hi> and puts <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in the head of his Army. And the Pope sending a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Embassy to him the year following against <hi>Acacius,</hi> the Emperor now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him, charges him with rudeness and incivility, and tells him, that for the time to come he will have no intercourse with a Man so utterly void of good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as to yield nothing to his Royal Will.

And in the same manner are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Addresses and Petitions brought

from all parts in behalf of their Bishops, that had been of the <hi>Acacian</hi> Faction (who by the Terms of the Concordate between the Pope and the Emperor were all Condemned Men) to keep those that were dead in the <hi>Dyptichs,</hi> and those that were living in their Sees: in short, that Peace may be settled without too much triumph over the condescending Party. This so perplexes the Emperor that he refers it wholy to Pope <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> who was now grown to that Authority in the Christian Church, that he alone trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted all things in it.

His in robore suo omni cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectione servatis, remedia sperantibus conferantur.</hi> And writing to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he begs that his Majesty would not think him more austere than his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for standing upon higher terms, they insisting only upon the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacius,</hi> and assures him that it is not stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness, but the sad experience of those grievous Scandals, that had followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the unhappy rupture, that made him the more severe. At the beginning of the Schism there might have been room
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63060:186"/>
for some condescension, but the mischiefs, that have followed by so long and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born a continuance of it, especially their affront to the great Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> cannot be pardoned or expiated without some publick satisfaction. But yet that he may not be too hard-hearted, he leaves it to the Conscience and Discretion of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to receive such as he believes true Penitents, or seduced out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Simplicity, but so as to oblige him to return all their Libels of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himself at <hi>Rome.</hi> And as for the Cause of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Monks, he will by no means admit their Proposition because of its Novelty; and when the same thing was less ambiguously expressed by the Scriptures and the Ancients, as that <hi>the Son of God suffered in the Flesh,</hi> he would allow of no new Phrases, that would but give occasion to new disputes and farther divisions. <hi>Haec si quemadme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum a Patribus constituta sunt, servent, credant, non definita transcendant, à quo tramite qui decli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:63060:186"/>
over curious Novelty. And here the Modern Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are at a great loss how to reconcile this Sentence of <hi>Horm s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>as</hi> with that of Pope <hi>John</hi> the Second, who expresly anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matised the <hi>Acaemetan</hi> Monks for denying it, and voucht it for an Article of the Christian Faith, and constant Tradition of the Christian Church. But the present Historian <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi> thinks he clears the difficulty by proving against <hi>Baronius</hi> that <hi>Hormisdas</hi> did not condemn the <hi>Scythian</hi> Monks of Heresie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Saec. Sext. diss.</hi> 2.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>John</hi> the Second past that Sentence upon the contrary Opinion, it was no contradiction. The observation is good, but the Evasion bad; for <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> as his manner is, here stretches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Records, when he endeavours to draw them into the List of Hereticks; and yet for all that the Contradiction is as palpable, as if their Sentence had been for Heresie. For when one Pope shall Condemn a Proposition as a needless and prophane Novelty, and another shall abet it as a constant Tradition of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, and so much an Article of Faith, as to anathematise all that oppose it, is I think a contradiction too tough to be reconciled by infallibility it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:63060:187"/>As for the behaviour of <hi>Hormisdas</hi> in this whole business, it may seem too stiff and rigorous, but setting aside his design to trample down his Rival at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and taking upon himself the single Authority of governing the Christian Church, his severity was but seasonable and necessary at that time. For ever since the unhappy Publication of the <hi>Henoticon,</hi> and the Schism of <hi>Acacius,</hi> the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church was wholy laid aside by the <hi>Acacian</hi> Party, and that could not be restored to its effectual exercise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing the Offenders against it to a publick Confession of their fault. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed without that, was it lawful by the Canons of the Church to receive any man, that had been Canonically judged a Schismatick, to Communion. And as for the <hi>Scythian</hi> Monks, though their Proposition were true, as in one sense it might be, when they applyed the Crucifixion not immediately to the Divinity it self, but to the flesh in which the Divinity resided. Yet however it was in the first place as they express it in general terms, capable of too harsh a sense. Secondly, it was without Authority, when private Persons will take upon themselves the confidence to impose upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. Thirdly, it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63060:187"/>
reflection upon the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> as if that had not made suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient provision against the late Heresie, but stood in need to be patcht out by this new Addition. And for these reasons I cannot see but that it was justly censured and rejected by this Pope, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise and in most other Cases he was a man of much too stiff and unyielding a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The rest of the Acts of his Reign are lost, for tho he lived two years after, yet after this time we have no remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Records of his Transactions.</p>
               <p>But the Emperor having cleared the Church of these wanton Schisms, that owed their Birth meerely to the liberty granted by his Predecessors, he now proceeds to root up all the ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that it seems had peep't above ground again by having been so long neglected. And it is certain that there is no setting limits to liberty of opinion, for if men are once allowed the wantonness of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophising as they please, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so absurd that somebody will not assert. And here from this particular Case we may observe the woful effects of a few years indulgence and licentiousness, when all these wild Heresies that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Emperors had from time to time rooted up by effectual Laws, now take
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63060:188"/>
root and spring up again, and probably had they not been timely prevented by this Emperor and his Successor, they might have grown to as great an head as ever they did in former times. But they are cut up all together at one blow by one Law,<note place="margin">

                  <q>That the <hi>Manichees</hi> be every where destroyed and put to death, and that the rest of the Hereticks (and an Heretick is every man that is not Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox) together with Heathens, Jews, and Samaritans, bear no Office in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And if any shall presume to do it, he is to be severely fined, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the Gothick <hi>Arians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are our Confederates.</q>
Where we may observe, that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Manichees</hi> is Capital, but that of the other sort of Hereticks Pecuniary, because Manicheism was not meer Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, but down-right Debauchery, and that of the blackest Dye, teaching men the practice of all wickedness from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion. And therefore this Heresie was as severely proceeded against by Heathen as by Christian Emperors, as we may see by a Rescript of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian</hi> in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Code against the <hi>Manichees,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And as for the exception of the <hi>Arian Goths,</hi> it could not well be avoided at that time, both because the Emperor was Confederate with their Powerful King <hi>Theodorick,</hi> whose displeasure would then have been very dangerous to the State of the Empire: and because he would not provoke him to use any Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Catholicks in the West, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and had hitherto been so far from all thoughts of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he protected the Church in all its Rights and Liberties, and abetted its power with as Religious care and respect as any Emperor had ever done. It is reported by <hi>Baronius</hi> and those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him that <hi>Justin</hi> afterwards reverst this Indulgence to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and put the Laws against the <hi>Arians</hi> so severely in Execution, that <hi>Theodorick</hi> forced Pope <hi>John</hi> the First to go his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to take him off from his severity, and because he did not, or would not effect it, cast him into Prison at his return home, where he died. This is the common Tale, but I doubt it wants Authority.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63060:189"/>
For as for <hi>Anastasius</hi> the <hi>Librarian,</hi> who is the chief Author upon whom the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Annalist relyes, he is a very late and fabulous Writer, living in the 9th Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and that under Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the first, that great Father of Lyes, whose whole business it was to corrupt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church for the advancement of his own See, and as he for that reason imposed upon the World the forged De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals of the Popes from <hi>Clement</hi> down to <hi>Cyricius,</hi> so his <hi>Librarian</hi> extracted the History of that Interval out of those Forgeries. And though he had or might have had better Records of the following Popes, yet I know not by what fate it comes to pass, his Story is altogether as ill-told, and is no better then rank Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend. But so it was that he lived in a dark and barbarous Age, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church were buried under heaps of Tales and Fables, and men only studied to out-stretch one another in the strangeness of their Reports. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but wonder that a man of <hi>Labbés</hi> Learning and Judgment should follow him as the best Author of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal History, when it is so inconsistent with all those Records, that himself has examin'd and published, of every Popes Actions. As for the Letters of Pope <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:63060:189"/>
to the <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops about this business, they are apparently spurious. <hi>Gregory Turonensis</hi> indeed tells a Story somewhat like it, but then he has it only upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, at a great distance of place, and that a very crude one, and different from other Records, for he says nothing of the Embassy to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was the only considerable transaction of this Popes Reign, but only says that he was told that the cause of his Imprisonment was that <hi>Theodorick</hi> putting all the Catholicks in <hi>Italy</hi> to the Sword (it is strange that no Historian of that time should make any mention of it) Pope <hi>John</hi> went to him to perswade him from so bloody a Persecution, for which in a rage he threw him into Prison. As for the Story of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, it is so childish and such meer <hi>Legend,</hi> that out of respect to so great a man, I will not recite it. All that certainly appears is this, that there was at that time some misunderstanding between <hi>Justin</hi> and <hi>Theodorick,</hi> for that was the Accusation upon which the Great <hi>Boëtius</hi> was then put to death, that he held correspondence with <hi>Justin.</hi> And that Pope <hi>John</hi> was sent by <hi>Theodorick</hi> to treat with the Emperor, but what was his particular Errand is not recorded, but whatever it was, it seems he managed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63060:190"/>
it so as to fall into the King's displeasure, and this is all that we have of that Popes Actions, and this Emperor's reign.</p>

            <div n="21" type="section">
               <p n="21">§. XXI. For he dying, after he had reign'd nine years, in his extreme old Age, before his death saw his Nephew <hi>Justinian</hi> fixt in the actual possession of the Imperial Throne by the choice of the Senate, one of the greatest Princes in the whole Succession, whether we regard the Success of his Arms, the Magnificence of his Buildings, or the Wisdom of his Laws, the three greatest Ornaments of any Princes Reign. And yet Envy, and one ill-natur'd Libel of a malecontent Courtier (if it be his) has been able (such is the ill-nature of Mankind) to slur all the Miracles of his reign. But I find that the ground of all the late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against this great Prince was (as some Men suppose) his too busie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in Church-Matters: this is the thing that is taken unkindly by the Church-Men at <hi>Rome,</hi> as an invasion of their Province. But others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary top him up for a Pattern to all Princes to keep the Jurisdiction of the Church in their own hands against all the pretences of Ecclesiasticks. But as
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63060:190"/>
it falls out, and ought so to do, they are both equally mistaken; for <hi>Justinian</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted any thing in the Church, that was not warranted by continued Precedents of his best Predecessors. He only protected the Power of the Church in the exercise of its Jurisdiction, as they did, but never claim'd it to himself, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he might err (as sometimes he did) in the execution of his Office. And whereas they load him so severely for presuming to make so many Novels, or Laws of his own about Religion, the whole charge is founded meerly upon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and mistake, they being all known Canons of the Church, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he enacted them into Laws. And therefore he is no more to be blamed than the best of his Predecessors, unless it be for his too pious and watchful care to preserve the Discipline of the Christian Church. So that it is no less than high ingratitude in the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite so great a Benefactor to the Cause of Religion, with nothing but unkind Censures and foul Calumnies. But the ground of all their present Quarrel is his taking down the pride of one of their most haughty Popes, <hi>Vigilius,</hi> though by their own confession one of the worst of Men, and that too was done at a time,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63060:191"/>
when their <hi>Holinesses</hi> had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to trample upon the state of the Imperial Majesty it self. And if in these contentions the Emperor fell into any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies, that cannot be justified, yet he ought not only in good Manners, but in justice, to be excused, because it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Design of his whole Reign, that his only aim was to resettle the long-disturb'd Peace of the Church, and if at any time he fail'd in his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, his Integrity ought by all the rules of Candor to attone for the defect of his Politicks. But whether all his Acts of Government in the Church are justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or not, I dare insure for all his Laws, and for that I shall here account, to finish the parallel between the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical and Imperial Laws in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; because by this Prince the Imperial Law was brought to its full Perfection. And after that it will be needless to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the practice of succeeding Princes, who received either the <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> or <hi>Justinian</hi> Body of Laws, as the sixt and standing rule of the Imperial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Though of the two the <hi>Theodosian Code</hi> met with much the better Fortune, for that having had ninety Years possession both in the Eastern and Western Empire,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63060:191"/>
it was not easily removed, especially when it had been received by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People that invaded and conquer'd some Parts of the Empire, as the only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht Law of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And so it was by that great, wise and prosperous Prince <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> who ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted its obligation upon his own People in a compendious Edict drawn out of it, consisting of 154 heads, extant in <hi>Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> But <hi>Alaric</hi> his Successor and Grand-child by his Daughter <hi>Amalesun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> that greatest of Women, made a new body of Institutes out of it, vulgarly known by the name of the <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Anianus,</hi> not that <hi>Anianus</hi> composed it, but because he by his Office compared and examin'd the Original Copy that was laid up among the Crown-Records, and subscribed his Approbation, from thence in after-Ages it came to bear his Name. But after the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> the <hi>Franks,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and other People of <hi>Germany,</hi> over-run the Western Empire, and these when they came to settle, blended the <hi>Theodosian</hi> Laws with their own ancient Customs, from whence came the Feudal Law, that to this day carries the greatest sway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Government of all the <hi>European</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions. But as for the <hi>Justinian</hi> Law, that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63060:192"/>
was received only in the Eastern Empire, and there it had scarce reign'd 300 years, when it was thrust out of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the <hi>Basilica</hi> of <hi>Leo</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who added to the <hi>Justinian</hi> Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Novels of all the succeeding Emperors down to his own time. But in the West it was never so much as heard of for 600 years after the death of <hi>Justinian</hi>; there are not so much as any footsteps of it in the Capitulars of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, or any other <hi>European</hi> Laws.

               <p>But as for the Law it self, it consists of two parts, the Code and the Novels, that is, Laws made by himself after the publication of the Code, and these are again to be subdivided into Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, and Laws concerning Discipline, in both which he has behaved

himself with as much decency and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Church, as any of his most admired Predecessors.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63060:193"/>
of the <hi>Triboniani Facinora,</hi> that himself has here given in the Laws rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Subject of Religion. His first instance is in the 6<hi>th</hi> Law under the <hi>Title de Haereticis,</hi> and that is the Law of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger against the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> that they should be call'd <hi>Simonians,</hi> as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Arians</hi> to be stil'd <hi>Porphyrians.</hi> And the Original Law it self runs thus. <hi>Quemadmodum Ariani Lege divae memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae Constantini ob similitudinem impieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Porphyriani à Porphyrio nuncupantur; sic ubique participes nesariae sectae Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii Simoniani vo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63060:193"/>
Cases learned Men are always wont to impute such Mistakes of Ignorance ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the misfortune of the Copy, than to the fault of the Author himself, if a Man of known learning, especially when it might be corrected by other authentick Copies, that met with better fortune, as this is both by the <hi>Theodosian Code</hi> it self, and <hi>Photius</hi> his <hi>Nomocanon.</hi> But in the times of Ignorance, it was but any ignorant hands clapping either into the Text, or rather the Margent, the word <hi>ab Ario,</hi> and there is the whole mistake. And after all I see not why it might not be done by the first Publisher <hi>Irnerius</hi> himself, who, as <hi>Vrspergensis</hi> informs us, corrected the Copy and interposed some Words of his own, and in that dark Age it was very easie for a Man very learned, as the times went, to fall into such a Mistake, when all the Ancient Records of the Imperial Law had lain so long neglected.</p>
               <p>And the same easie mistake is his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Instance in the Law of <hi>Valentinian</hi> concerning the Age of Deaconesses, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should not be admitted into that order till they were 60 years of Age ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Precept of the Apostle, whereas in the <hi>Justinian Code</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is sunk from 60 to 50. But the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63060:194"/>
of figures by Transcribers is so very easie, that it ought to be supposed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is discover'd, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that <hi>Irnerius</hi> his own hand was in this too, for he finding the time set by <hi>Justinian</hi>'s own Novel to be but 50 years, it was natural for him, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Theodosian Code,</hi> to conclude that it ought to be so here. The third and last instance of <hi>Tribonian</hi>'s prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a much leaner exception then either of the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Younger against Apostates, which <hi>Gothofred</hi> says reacht only Apostates from Christianity to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, whereas <hi>Tribonian</hi> has perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sense of it by foisting in those words, <hi>de Haereticâ superstitione,</hi> as if the Rescript aim'd at all sorts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that deserted the Catholick Church. But that these words were foisted in, I see no ground to suspect, or if they were, they might come in from other hands as well as <hi>Tribonian</hi>'s. But however the meaning of the Law is so plain, that I cannot but wonder how so accurate and diligent an Observator, and one of such exquisite Learning as <hi>Gothofred</hi> was, should over-look it; for the Law it self expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refers to a former Rescript, enacted by the same Emperor, and that is the Law
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63060:194"/>
immediately preceding in the <hi>Theodosian Code,</hi> and the only Law made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this by this Emperor, in which he explains what is here meant by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, of which he there makes three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> to Heathenism, to <hi>Judaism</hi> and to <hi>Manicheism,</hi> and therefore this Law that was enacted eight years after in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to that, must be understood of those three several sorts of Apostates and none other. And it was no impropriety to call the <hi>Manichees</hi> Hereticks, for though they were worse than <hi>Jews</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yet they were only accused of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, because they pretended to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither was it any Solecism to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute heretical Superstition to the other two Sects, for though they were not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually accused of Heresie, yet when the word <hi>Superstition</hi> was join'd with it, by which they then vulgarly understood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false Religion, it comprehended <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> as well as Christian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. These are all the Instances that this diligent and learned Man has alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Argument in his Chapter <hi>de Triboniani Facinoribus,</hi> and I think I may now safely leave it to the Reader to judg, Whether the Proof be not very much too slender to fill up the Body of the Charge. But when I have vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63060:195"/>
the faithfulness of this great Man in this great Work, it will not be altogether improper to do that right to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who has deserved so highly of all Posterity, as to clear him from a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or two, that have been so unjustly dasht upon his Reputation.<note place="margin">

And as for <hi>Suidas,</hi> that is the only Man that has blackened his Memory, as he is a Writer of very mean Authority of himself, so his Story here is plainly <hi>felo de se,</hi> when he says, that <hi>Tribonian</hi> was a zealous <hi>Pagan,</hi> a tale so improbable in it self, against a Man that has taken so much faithful pains to do service to Christianity, that it would require some very strong proof to make it but meerly credible.</p>

               <p n="22">§. XXII. But now having vindicated the Integrity of the <hi>Justinian Code,</hi> as to the Laws of his Predecessors, we may proceed to the examination of his own. And his Laws of Religion take up the first thirteen Titles of the first Book, and are of two sorts, concerning Faith, and concerning Discipline. His Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith are far from being nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63060:195"/>
only three of his Predecessors and three of his own, and all in pursuance of the Decrees and Definitions of the Church, and those of his own are not so properly Laws, as Confessions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of his own Faith sent to some Christian Bishops for their satisfaction, and are nothing else than an owning or ratification of the four General Councils, by whose Authority (as he declares) the Apostolical Faith was conveyed down through all Ages to his own time, and for that reason he receives both the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Faith, because it was deliver'd down from the Apostles, and the several Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of it by the following Councils. Not as if that had been defective in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, but because the Enemies of the truth had endeavor'd to subvert it, some one, and some another way, therefore it was necessary for the Church in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Councils to explain and defend its truth by Testimonies of Scripture, and to anathematise all the Authors of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Novelties. And for this very reason he lets all his Subjects know, that there is no living for any Man within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that does not submit to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of these Councils. In all which he expresses so much Civility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Jurisdiction of the Church,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:63060:196"/>
that there is not an higher declaration of it in all the Imperial Laws, so free is he in this matter from that imputation so confidently charged upon him by the <hi>Italians,</hi>

In the three following Titles <hi>de Sacrosanctis Ecclesiis; de Episcopis et Clericis; de Episcopali Audientiâ</hi>; all the Laws enacted by himself are only so many Charters of Priviledg to the Church, that express an high sense of Piety and Devotion, and are withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with so much prudence, that whoever would go about to find fault with them, must lay aside his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding as well as his Integrity. And yet these are all the Laws of his own enacting in the Code, for under all the following Titles he has only col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Laws of his Predecessors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding any of his own.</p>
               <p>In his Novels, as mighty and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Legislator as he is taken to be, his Laws of Religion are not so very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63060:196"/>
and those that are, only revive Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Canons or Ecclesiastical Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, but are no new Institutions. And any attempt of that kind was so far from finding any entertainment in his thoughts, that he ever shun'd it with all manner of tenderness, and declares upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that his Laws only wait (as he is pleased to express himself) upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church. The first Novel upon this Argument is the Third, Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anno</hi> 535<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the 9th Year of his Reign, where he Enacts that in all Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches the Clergy be stinted to a certain number, but I hope no man can be so weak as to think that this was never Enacted before that time. The next is the 5th, <hi>de Monachis,</hi> in which he only keeps the Monks to the Rules of their Institution, but makes no new Rules of his own: The 6th regulates the other Clergy according to the Canons of the Fathers, as he declares in the Preface to it, and there occurs nothing in it, but what had been often commanded both by the Ecclesiastical and Imperial Law. The 7th forbids all Alienations of the Goods of the Church. The 9th gives the Church the Priviledge of prescribing for one hundred Years, whereas the Plea of Possession against all other Prescription was limited to 30, and this he presents as
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63060:197"/>
a Religious Oblation to Almighty God. These were all publish't in the same Year. In the 11th he raises the place of his birth to the honour of an Arch-Bishoprick or Patriarchate, to which he subjects Six Provinces, that had hitherto belonged to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and justifies his Power of doing it, because the dignity of the Church naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that of the State, and therefore his Imperial Majesty having establisht a new Civil Prefecture in that City, that gave it a new Prerogative in the Church: for as in former times when the Prefecture of <hi>Illyricum</hi> was fixt at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> then the Episcopal Primacy resided there, but when afterward those Parts were invaded and laid wast by <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns, Appennius</hi> the Prefect was forced to retire to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> the Archiepiscopal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity followed him thither, <hi>Et Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis Episcopus non suâ Authoritate, sed sub umbrâ praefecturae meruit aliquam praeroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivam, i. e.</hi> And the Bishop of <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> obtained the Prerogative not by Vertue of his own Authority but under the shelter of the Civil Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And therefore the Emperor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving instituted a new <hi>praefectus praetorio</hi> in his own City, upon the Recovery of that part of the Empire that had been lost, it was but fit and decent that upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63060:197"/>
it should be made an Archiepiscopal See: And to it he subjected all <hi>Dacia</hi> and <hi>Pannonia; Dacia</hi> then containing <hi>Transilvania, Valachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia: Pannonia</hi> the lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> the upper <hi>Austria, Carinthia</hi> and <hi>Carniola,</hi> as they are now divided. And this being done he obtains of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> to grant the new Arch-Bishop his Legantine Dignity in those Provinces. But here <hi>Baronius</hi> storms, and says he extorted it by force and cruelty after the great falling out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and that it was not honest to rob other Churches to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and advance his own. But his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has run him into a continued Train of mistakes. For first the Grant of <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was made at his first coming to the See, as appears by <hi>Justinian</hi>'s 131<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> Novel, in which it is mentioned, that bears date in the Year 541, whereas there was no Quarrel between the Pope and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, till after <hi>Vigilius</hi> his Journey to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was not till the Year 547, neither did he suffer any force till the Year 551, as <hi>Baronius</hi> himself ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knows, who has placed the Story of that Persecution in the History of that Year. Neither secondly did the Pope grant the Metropolitical Dignity, but only the Legantine Power, the first was

stablisht before by the Emperor, and more then that, an Archiepiscopal or Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supremacy, for at that time those words were synonymous to express the new Jurisdiction above Metropolitans. Nor Thirdly, were the Ancient and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Rights of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> defrauded, but only that part of the Empire that was newly Recovered, and formerly belonged to <hi>Sirmium,</hi> was settled in its Ancient State under the Metropolis of <hi>Justiniana.</hi> But lastly, the Cardinal has little reason to complain of robbing <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> if he would but reflect upon the Actions of the Popes about that time, who with Force and Arbitrary Power both against Canons and immemorial Custom trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Metropolitical Power from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> to <hi>Arles,</hi> and that without any other reason, then to make a Precedent and give a cast of their absolute Supremacy, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Affairs of Christendom not by the Laws of the Church, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Arbitrary Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Whereas the Law of <hi>Justinian</hi> was sounded upon the universal Practice of the Church, as it was settled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves, by whom its Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was every where accommodated to the convenience of Civil Governmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Priest-hood by the Sacerdotal Sentence, the Royal Power should joyn with the Authority of their Decree: that so both Powers, Divine and Humane, agreeing, a good correspondence might be kept between both, and so the World be well govern'd. The Forty Third is a revival of a Rescript of the Emperor <hi>Anastasius,</hi> to limit the Exemption of Taxes upon the Revenues of the Church, which grew so very great, as to defraud its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the Civil Government, and to that purpose he excuses only one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Tenements in the City of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> belonging to that Church, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all other Estates that were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased since the Edict of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> to contribute in their just proportion to the publick Burthens of the Common-wealth.

The 56<hi>th</hi> is a revival of the Laws and Canons against <hi>Simony,</hi> of which it seems there were great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints at that time. The 57<hi>th</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of a Law of the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting that if a Clerk forsake his Cure, the Bishop take care to have it supplyed, and that no Patron or Founder of a Church present his Clerk to it without the Bishops approbation.

This is a Law that the Ecclesiasticks had no reason to complain of as a diminution of their Authority, when in effect it put the whole Government of the Empire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands: Though the Judges had but too much reason to take offence at it, in having spies set over all their Actions, and all spies are apt to be too busie and officious.

And thus having vindicated his Laws from the Cavils of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratful Men, I come now to vindicate his Person and his Actions from their more disingenuous Aspersions. And here lies the main ground of the Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, not his medling too much with Church-Matters but with Church-Men. He would not suffer himself as some of his Predecessors did, to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hufft by the Papal Insolence, but brought <hi>Vigilius</hi> one of the proudest of them all to complyance and submission, and that is a Crime never to be forgiven. And for want of better or rather worse Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation against him, they are content to take up with a scandalous Libel, <hi>i. e. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi>'s <hi>Anecdota. Baronius</hi> was grieved to the heart, that he could not find it, because from thence, he says, it would appear, what the Humor, what the Wisdom, what the Piety of <hi>Justinian</hi> was, when his sauciness against Ecclesiasticks was such, as no good or pious Prince could be guilty of. But <hi>Alemannus</hi> a Convert from the poor Greek Church, and one of the Cardinals Successors (as he proudly intitles himself) in the Office of <hi>Apostolical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian,</hi> chancing it seems to light upon it as he was brushing the old Manuscripts in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> is transported with joy,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63060:203"/>
and is all on fire to oblige holy Church with the publication of so useful a Work, that the World might now see what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Man this same <hi>Justinian</hi> was, who treated a Bishop so rudely as he did the good Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and not only so, but he has helpt out the original Copy in his Latin Translation, and what <hi>Procopius</hi> relates only as a flying Report, he makes bold to set down as a known and certain truth. And among many other strong strains of disingenuity, he has been so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, as to undertake to make out the truth of this Libel by <hi>Procopius</hi> his own History, that was publisht to the World in <hi>Justinian</hi>'s own time, approved of by himself, and the Author advanced for it to the highest Preferments in the Empire. Now that Man that will seriously go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove a Panegyrick to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, only shews that he is a little too much in good earnest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But before I prove the false-hood of these Slanders, it will be convenient to shew the occasion of raising them, and that was the great heats in the Controversie about the <hi>tria capitula,</hi> in which the Emperor created to himself a great number of Enemies by his zeal and resolution on that side that he unhappily took to. I shall therefore first set down the progress of that Story,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63060:203"/>
that was the only false step of his Reign, but so unluckily made, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wholly recover himself again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ingage the <hi>Librarian</hi> and his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Author. This Emperor then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appear'd so zealously in behalf of the Orthodox Faith, having declared so severely against all Hereticks by several Edicts, and particularly publisht a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script against the singularities of <hi>Origen</hi> upon complaint of the <hi>Palestine</hi> Monks, set on by <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Popes Legate at the Court of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in spite to <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> his Rival in Court-favor, but a great Admirer of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> having appointed a Conference at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the year 533 to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the <hi>Acephali</hi> to the Church and the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> in which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses a very high Passion for the resettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace and Unity. Having been so bold as to consent to the deposition of <hi>Anthimus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the Queens Favourite, at the instigation of Pope <hi>Agapetus</hi> for suspicion of the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian</hi> Heresie, and after that to confirm the Decree of the Council under <hi>Mennas</hi> against him by adding Banishment to his Deposition.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63060:204"/>
the Emperor into his snare, that he might secure him from a Relapse, prevails with him in the absence of his Rival <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> to publish an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of Condemnation by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but drawn up, as <hi>Facundus Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anensis</hi> tells the Emperor, not by himself, but <hi>Theodorus</hi> and his Accomplices, that so having once publickly appear'd in the Cause, that would be an obligation upon him to persevere in it against all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwise he understood the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Temper so well, that when he saw the Mischiefs and Inconveniences that follow'd upon it, he would quit the Cause, and leave them in the lurch to answer for their Affront to the Council of <hi>Calcedon.</hi> And the better to secure themselves, the Edict was as craftily composed as it was contrived. All the Councils were confirm'd, all the Heresies of all denominations condemn'd, only in the tail of all, these three particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were apocryphised. And that the good Emperor's design was meerly Peace and Concord, is very observable from the conclusion of all. <hi>Si quis igitur post e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi rectam confessionem, et haeretico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum condemnationem, salvo manente pio intellectu, de nominibus, vel syllabis, vel dictionibus contendens, separat se à sanctâ

Dei Ecclesiâ, tanquam non in rebus, sed in solis nominibus et dictionibus positâ nobis pietate: talis utpote dissensionibus gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, rationem pro semetipso, et pro de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis et decipiendis ab eo reddet magno Deo, et Salvatori nostro Jesu Christo in die Judicii.</hi> By which it is evident that the Emperor accepted the Model, after the security and settlement of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith against all sorts of Hereticks, as the only remedy expedient at that time against contention and curiosity, without any design against the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> or any other determinations of the Church, but on the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a religious and intire submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to their Decrees; and for this reason it is approved and subscribed, though not without reluctancy, by all the four Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Patriarchs, and most eminent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Eastern Church.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other side the Western and <hi>African</hi> Bishops concluded it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reflection upon the Wisdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council it self, to condemn those Writings of Heresie, that it had upon a fair Trial acquitted. And thus by this unhappy Legerdemain of that false and jugling Man <hi>Theodorus,</hi> under which the Emperor suspected no ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, instead of finishing the settlement
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63060:205"/>
of the Church, after so fair a progress that he had made in it (for it was he that govern'd and manag'd all things in his Unkle <hi>Justin</hi>'s reign) he brings all things back into the same Tumult and Confusion, into which they were brought by the <hi>Henoticon.</hi> It was but a slite and a very remote breach, as one would think, upon the Churches Authority, yet it broke down all Bounds of Discipline and Government, that it seems is a thing so tender, that it can endure no tampering, and unless it be made sacred and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it loses all its force: And so this great Emperor after this slite Wound, in a matter in which it was so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, could scarce make it up again by the Authority of a General Council. Though I must confess that the occasion of raising the Quarrel so high was the turbulent spirit of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> who as he was guilty of all other Wickedness, exceeded in Pride, as appears not only from the Historian, but the Sentence of Excommunication against him by Pope <hi>Silverius</hi> in the time of that Popes ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment.<note place="margin">

This is the substance of the Letter, but <hi>Baronius</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Writers suspect it to have been forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because in all his following scuffles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>tria capitula,</hi> he was never up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with it.

by promise to give sentence against the <hi>Capitula,</hi> and designing to excuse himself with pretence of Ignorance, shamelesly refuses the proffer, cuts off all farther proceedings, and desires the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that sat with him to give in their Answers singly in writing. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly come to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with his Holiness, and being not pre-engaged by any subscription, were by this Artifice over-reacht to give in their Answer against the <hi>Capitula</hi> and the Council. And to prevent their drawing back, they are obliged to do it, not by Vote, but by Writing. And when he had received their several Answers, away he carries them to Court, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them into the hands of the <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phali</hi> to be laid up among the former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions that had been made against the Council. And that he might not be thought a Traitor by his own Party (for he hitherto pretended to side with the Orthodox) he pretends that he would not keep them himself, lest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there should be found in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions against the Council.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63060:208"/>
he ought never to have received, much less to have extorted them, if he had been at all concern'd that nothing should be done in prejudice of the Council. And thus (says he) by this his customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dissimulation, counterfeiting a zeal in behalf of the Council, he effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the designs of its Enemies.

But what ever Apology this may be for his change of mind, it is no excuse for his jugling and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealing; and withal as for his change of mind, by the Cardinals good leave, to condemn writings of Heresie by an Imperial Rescript, that had been
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63060:208"/>
clear'd of the Charge by the Sentence of a General Council, is plainly to subvert, not the Authority of that Council alone, but of the whole Catholick Church. This was the blot of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Reign, that no Candor can cover, nor Excuse wipe off. And his Holiness by his time-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complyance with it, did but give a cast of his old dishonesty, when by the Cardinal's own account he exceeded all Mankind in Wickedness, and proves that he was still acted by his six-fold Female Devil <hi>Theodora,</hi> (as he calls her) who was the great stickler in the design in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the <hi>Eutychians</hi>; because whether the condemnation of the <hi>tria capitula</hi> were in it self any direct reflection upon the Council or not, those that promoted it, were resolved to make that use of it.

And that was the reason that the <hi>Africans</hi> were so resty, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> finding, and withal his own Clergy offended, he again shrinks back, and in a Consult with <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Mennas</hi> suspends all disputes and determinations to the Summary of a General Council, which they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

But this continual shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and prevarication provokes the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party beyond all bounds and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and they now unanimously discard him for a man of no faith and honesty, that chopt all points of the Compass, as the Weather-cock stood for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, now standing point blank for the Council, then veering to the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary point for the <hi>Acephali,</hi> and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain standing neuter, and wavering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both.

I will grant that both Parties might be too blame. But what can we think of him that is first furious on one side, and then turns Traitor to his own Party, and then when he sees that will not pass, quits both? If this be Ecclesiastical Prudence, I would fain know what is Ecclesiastical Honesty. And therefore it is no wonder that his own Clergy, and particularly his own Favourites, that he chose for his Companions to <hi>Constantinople, Rusticus</hi> and <hi>Sebastianus,</hi> were so offended at the gross dishonesty of his Proceedings, as to

But now the Empress be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> finding himself deserted by his own Clergy, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops dissatisfied in all parts, revives his old Expedient of a General Council.

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63060:211"/>
the wonder that I can discern in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, that the Emperor had manners, though the Pope had none. But behold a wonder indeed, his Holinesses Return to the Imperial Civility, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Lords only to court him home, he clings about the Altar, as if they had come to cut his Throat, there declares that he will trust neither their own nor their Master's Oath, and that he will never condescend to enter into any Treaty, till his Majesty has revok't his Rescript, and all other Acts about the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and sends an <hi>Encycli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Epistle into all Parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> to inform them what violence had been offer'd to his Person by the Imperial Power, and by it raises such Tumults and Commotions every where, that the Emperor is forced to submit, suppress his Edict, and leave the whole business to the determination of a General Council. And so <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Mennas</hi> finding themselves deserted by the Emperor, they are forced to tack about, and with all humility tender their Submissions and Protestations to his Holiness, to sue out his pardon, and upon it this goodly <hi>Trium-virate</hi> are once more pieced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And at this the good Cardinal cryes out, the Finger of the Lord in defence of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63060:212"/>
the Apostolick Rock. It is true indeed that the divine Providence co-operates with us in all our Actions in order to its own ends, but the whole mystery of this great business is no more than this, that some Knaves that had crept into the Church by Court-favor, fall out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for Court-factions, till at last one side finding it self to be forsaken, sues to be reconciled to the prevailing Party, and that is all the Miracle that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal has magnified at so high a rate, as to apply to it all the Prophesies of the Old Testament concerning our Savior's being a Rock and a Corner-stone.</p>
               <p>But here <hi>Mennas</hi> dyes, and one <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> a Monk, that had insinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Court by great shews of Mortification, succeeds. He was a Man, that of all things defyed all ambitious thoughts and designs of Preferment, and yet was perpetually dreaming that he should one day be the great Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and by vertue of his own real dreams, and one pretended by the Emperor, who knew him to be zealous in his Cause, and withal very managea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he is advanced to that high dignity. And so it is that none gallop so fast to Preferment in the Church, as those that creep to it. And after his Instalment the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63060:212"/>
first thing he does is to submit himself to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and so does <hi>Apollinaris</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> upon the death of <hi>Zoilus,</hi> whose Bishoprick he had usurpt, and thus are Hypocrites and ill-Men always on the right side. But <hi>Vigilius</hi> finding himself Master of the field, and having forced all his Enemies, even the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to submit, is resolved to shew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity. And in the first place he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with the Emperor about the place of the Council; one will have it in the East, and the other in the West, but at last they agree upon <hi>Constantinople,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that an equal number of Eastern and Western Bishops be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd. But before the Council meets the Emperor desires the Pope to give his own Opinion, and that was an hard task to put him upon declaring himself, and therefore he desires to be excused, but the Emperor presses so importunately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as to provoke his Choler, and to be revenged he turns cross-grain'd, and so affronts his <hi>tria capitula,</hi> and when the Council meets, is sick and sullen, refuses to join with them, and no Courtship ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Council or the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can draw him to any compliance, but on the contrary he commands the Council not to presume to determine any
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63060:213"/>
thing, till he had declared his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that he does at large in an Instrument sent to the Emperor, that he calls his <hi>Constitutum,</hi> in which though he condemns and confutes the Writings themselves, yet he will allow no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against the Persons, because they dyed in the Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and had been absolved by the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this peremptory threatning. <hi>His igitur à nobis cum omni undique cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telà atque diligentiâ propter servandam inviolabilem reverentiam praedictarum Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorum et earundem venerabilia consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta dispositis, statuimus et decernimus, nulli ad ordines et dignitates ecclesiasticas pertinenti licere quicquam contrarium his quae praesenti asseruimus vel statuimus constituto de saepe dictis tribus capitulis aut conscribere, vel proferr, aut compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, vel docere, aut aliquam post praesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem definitionem movere ulteriùs quaestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> &amp;c. But the Council regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him nor his threatnings, and so condemn the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and to expose him for an egregious Prevaricator, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to the World his own several Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations against them. Upon which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> has a very pleasant observation, that this they were forced to, because
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63060:213"/>
they knew their Decree would be of no force without the Authority of the Pope. What Inferences will not Zeal and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality make, when they produced his own testimony against himself, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him of manifest prevarication, to conclude that this was done out of duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful respect to his Authority, by which, if they had regarded it, they stood all at this very time deposed from their Holy Orders. But things being carried so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly on all sides, the Council came to nothing, and the Emperor after he had once made a breach upon the Authority of the Church, could never heal it again, for the Hereticks instead of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, made advantage of it against the Authority of the Church it self (as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius</hi> a Writer of that Age informs us) who argued thus upon it,<note place="margin">

But the Emperor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proceeded so far in the business, is now resolved to carry it through his own way, and all that will not comply, are deposed and banisht, and this lights chiefly
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63060:214"/>
upon the <hi>Illyrican</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Bishops, but they were soon reduced by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's severity, whereas the Bishops in the Western Empire, that was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Franks, set up a form'd Schism, especially in the Parts about <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Istria,</hi> that lasted for many years, and cost both the Church and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire a long train of trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But as for Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> when he saw there was no way of escape but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, though he loved his Will too much, yet he loved his Bishoprick much more, therefore after all his stubbornness he comes in, and fairly subscribes, and approves the Decree of the Council. But here the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers are again at a great loss to salve his Reputation, but I think it would be more for their own to let him alone. For before he was in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful possession of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair they own him to have been a Villain, and withal confess that he got into it by <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Sacriledg and Murther. But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, out of duty and gratitude to his Patroness <hi>Theodora,</hi> he beats down the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi>; but seeing the Emperor resolute in his Design, he turns a fury on that side, and publishes his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatum</hi> to damn the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:63060:214"/>
then in a little time suspends his own Sentence till the meeting of the Council; when the Council meets he contradicts them in his <hi>Constitutum</hi>: But because he saw the Emperor in good earnest against him, and the <hi>African</hi> Bishops beginning to scowr out of their Bishopricks, he fairly comes in and renounces the <hi>Constitutum,</hi> yet after all these turns of prevarication since the time of his sitting in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, we must have him to be a very honest Man, notwithstanding that he all the while stands guilty of the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties that he did before. In my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they would much better consult the honor of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair by confessing him so ill a Man, that even his sitting in that could not mend him, or rather that he never had legal Possession of it, but was all his life-time a meer Usurper, for by the Canons a Man that comes into a Bishoprick by <hi>Simony,</hi> renders himself uncapable of it forever. So that if they would leave him under his own disgrace, it would be no dishonor to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, but when they are at such mighty pains to prove that it was not defil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:63060:215"/>But however the discovery of his last Conversion which was first brought to light by <hi>Petrus de Marca,</hi> and was dated within six Months after the rising of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, clears that great and enormous diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that has so long puzled us to make out, how this Council should be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church among the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils without the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But whether the Recantation were spurious or genuine (and that is still in the dark) it will not salve the business, for if it were genuine, it is only a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his old Wickedness, and that he was managed in it by the Devil after he sat in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, but what the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Devil was, that tempted him, is too evident from his shifting sides, as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest lay. Though the greatest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it is his Plea, that he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto erred for want of information and right understanding of the Controversie: whereas it is too notorious from the whole progress of it, that no Man could be better acquainted with it than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and whoever reads his <hi>Judicatum</hi> upon it at the conference at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and his <hi>Constitutum</hi> sent to the Council seven years after, will never of all Excuses allow that of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. If it be spurious, then if the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63060:215"/>
Apology were good for any thing, 'tis lost. And I must confess it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what incredible to me, that so publick an Instrument concerning so great an Affair should be altogether unknown to his immediate Successors, that were so deeply ingaged in the Controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Schismaticks, especially <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> the second and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, who never produced its Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but most of all <hi>Gregory,</hi> who transmitted the Acts of the Council to Queen <hi>Theodelinda.</hi> But though the writing be forged, it is plain enough that he actually complied as <hi>Eustathius</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Writer affirms in the life of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> and <hi>Liberatus</hi> broadly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests, when he says that <hi>Vigilius</hi> suffer'd much in the Cause, though he were not crown'd, which was then the proper Phrase for Apostasie. But that he was received into the Emperor's Favor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Imperial Grant of certain Priviledges to the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was sent by <hi>Vigilius</hi> to endear him to the City, though in his return home he dyed of the Stone in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and is suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by <hi>Pelagius</hi> the first, who though he had been banisht by <hi>Justinian</hi> whilst he was Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> yet before he is admitted to the Papacy he both owns the Authority of the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and condemns the <hi>Capitula,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incites <hi>Narses</hi> then Governor of <hi>Italy,</hi> to reduce the Schismaticks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Istria</hi> by the Secular Power, and the same was done by all his Successors till the Schism dyed. So that in short it was not the Pope that determin'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but the Council that determin'd the Pope: and if it was confirm'd by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as that does not make the Council good, so it is only another proof of the shuffling dishonesty of the Man.

Though when all is done, the Notion of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council is but a Notion, for there was never any such thing in reality, and all those that bear that name were more properly Councils of the Eastern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, there being very few Western Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops present at them. And they were only call'd General Councils in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63060:216"/>
to Provincial, and ought rather to have been stil'd Imperial, as summon'd by the Emperor himself, whereas other lesser Councils were summon'd by the Bishops themselves. And that places this Council in the same rank with the other four, because it was summon'd out of all parts of the Empire, and not confin'd to Provinces and Diocesses, as the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical or Patriarchal Councils were. But that the Summons of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was necessary to the calling of a General Council, and his confirmation of their Decrees necessary to their Validity is one great branch of the Papal Usurpation, as I hope in its due place to prove at large against <hi>Petrus de Marca.</hi>

               <p>But to proceed in the business of this present Council, all Parties concern'd in it labor to clear themselves of all blame, and lay all the burthen of these Disorders upon other Mens shoulders, but though it may seem a severe, yet it is an impartial Judgment, that they were all too faulty. As for the Emperor's own part, it is evident that the publication of his Imperial Edict was an illegal act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause against the Authority of a Council owned by himself, though had he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it so, he would never have done it, but he was perswaded that it was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection

upon the Council it self, because it was no contradiction to any of their own direct Decrees, but only concern'd the Opinions of some private Persons, that the Council thought not fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn at that time, though seeing what use the <hi>Eutychians</hi> made of it, he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it now useful to the settlement of the Church without any Affront to the Council, it being only to change Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels with change of Affairs. This was all the Emperor's meaning, and it could have done no great mischief, had it not been abused by the craft of <hi>Theodorus</hi> and his <hi>Acephali,</hi> who perswaded him that it could be no abatement to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council, and yet when it was done, used it as an Argument to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it.</p>
               <p>And then as for those that fought so furiously as the <hi>Africans</hi> did for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Council against the <hi>tria Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> though the honor of the Council was remotely concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

caught them in a snare of their own set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and they must either have own'd the Council, or put off their Vizard. So that which side soever was in the right, they were all in the wrong, when they made a Schism in the Church about it, for the thing was not <hi>Tanti</hi> in it self as to warrant the breach of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Though at last the bottom of all these unhappy Quarrels was founded in St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s over-doing Anathema's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> that yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to impose upon the Catholick Church, as so many Articles of Faith: Which because <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be too hard an Imposition, the <hi>Eutychians</hi> took advantage of, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them as Favourers of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie, though it is plain from the tenour of all their Writings, that they were as little guilty of that as <hi>Cyril</hi> himself, but were cautious of spoiling the Cause by too much niceness of Speculation, and thought it sufficient to condemn the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie it self, without imposing his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Anathema's as necessary Conditions of Peace and Articles of Christian Faith upon the Catholick Church. And this was, if we pursue it to its head, the true Case of the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> was so well convinced of it at last, that

And in real truth Church-men were by this time (as <hi>Baronius</hi> himself complains in this very case) grown too nice and speculative in Matters of Faith, and were not content with the simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the old Tradition, but were every day starting new Points of subtilty, in so much that it was a very difficult thing for a Man to express himself so warily, as to avoid the exceptions of one or other Party.

But more particularly when he has written so many learned and accurate Books in defence of <hi>Theodorus</hi> and his Writings, and the several Passages objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him by his Adversaries, I must confess it looks somewhat odd that this Writer should over-look all these large Discourses,<note place="margin">

The only proof against <hi>Theodoret</hi> is taken from his Writings and Actings against St. <hi>Cyril</hi> in opposing his 12 <hi>Anathema's</hi>: But this, as I have shewen above, is founded upon meer mistake, as if his Zeal in the case
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63060:219"/>
had been ingaged in behalf of the <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Heresie, whereas it was only levell'd against the Bigotry of <hi>Cyril</hi> in imposing his own nice Propositions upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. And when <hi>Cyril</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd them or rather let them fall, they were friends, and <hi>Theodoret</hi> was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anathematise the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as himself ever was in the greatest heat or huff of the Controversie. And the case of <hi>Ibas</hi> was the same, nothing but his zeal against the rigor of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>'s Anathema's, as is evident from the whole Tenor of the Epistle it self. And therefore in the Result of all, I cannot but think that this packt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (and so it was) would have done better to have let these Men lie quiet in their Graves, when they had been Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically discharged upon fair Trial by the great Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> though they had been guilty of those mis-prisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heresie, for which their Ashes were now arraign'd and condemn'd. But yet when a needless Decree was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, I cannot but think too that the dissenting Bishops would have been much better advised to let it pass, rather than to have raised a Schism in the Church about it. And so, as far as we can find by the Records of the Church,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63060:220"/>
the <hi>Illyricans</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> did in a short time, though the Schismaticks in the Western Church kept up the separation with great zeal and fury into after-ages: And thus having given a true and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial account of this Transaction of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> that created him so many enemies both in his own time, and afterward as long as the unhappy Schism lasted, I now come to a particular Examination of the several Accusations against him by the supposed <hi>Procopius,</hi> but real <hi>Alemannus.</hi> And when I have vindicated this greatest of Princes from their unmannerly slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it will be time to put a Conclusion to this work, and to end it with his life, because with it ends the Body of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Law.</p>

And if any man may challenge this respect, it is <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinians</hi> right, who as will appear by his Story, was as great, not to say a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (only to avoid envy) a Benefactor to Mankind, as any Prince in the whole Succession.

His next Improvement of the Creation were his numberless and prodigious Buildings, by which he lest the World more habitable then he found it: neither do I speak meerly of that vast number of great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he built, but of his great care to make Commerce easie and pleasant, and remove the difficulties of travelling, by building Bridges, making High-ways, founding Publick-houses for the reception

of Strangers in all convenient places; in these kind of works he was so munificent in all places, that he might not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be stiled the Founder of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that as it were turned those vast Dominions into one City. A Third Benefit to Posterity is his excellent Body of Laws and Rules of Government ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Records of that wise State for about 1300 Years.

Now for all these good Deeds that he has done to all Posterity, I think no man, that pretends to any thing of gratitude or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, can excuse himself from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation

of doing honour, but much more right to his Memory. But beside all this his Cause is become the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of all Christendom, because the Power that he challenged and exercised in the Christian Church, for which he is so much condemned by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> is one of the inseparable Branches of Soveraignty, and was always chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by all Christian Emperors, so that if the Princes of Christendom should suffer themselves to be stript of it, they are thereby outed of one half of their Empire. And the true rise of the Court of <hi>Romes</hi> displeasure against him, was not upon the account of any of his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but a late Contest; <hi>viz.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Quarrel between <hi>Paul</hi> the 5th and the State of <hi>Venice</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> has very well observed) about these three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;<note place="margin">

Now the reason why the <hi>Venetian</hi> Advocates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted so stubbornly upon the <hi>Justinian</hi> Code, was not only for the advantage of those several Precedents, that we have seen above to warrant the proceedings of the State in the several matters of the present Controversie; but chiefly because the Code of the Canons of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church were taken into the <hi>Justinian</hi> Code and made part of the Imperial Law; and if they could but bring the Pope any way under the Canons, that would carry their Cause, for it not only proved in behalf of the State, that the power of prohibiting Ecclesiastical Laws to be imposed upon their Subjects without their Consent, was a right challenged by all Christian Princes, but own'd by the Church in the General Councils, it being the known Custom of the Fathers to send their Decrees to their Imperial Majesties for Approbation, before they presumed (to publish them) to the World or impose them upon the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:63060:222"/>This is the Argument insisted upon by <hi>Jacobus Leschasserius</hi> a Learned Civilian at <hi>Paris</hi> in his Apology in behalf of the Senate, who recommends the <hi>Justinian</hi> Code as the Bull-wark of the Liberties of Christendom. And this little Treatise first gave the hint to <hi>Christophorus Justel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> to publish the Code of the Canons of the Universal Church. Now when the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had for so many Ages been used to an absolute and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Authority, it could not but gawl and fret their proud Spirits, to hear of being brought into subjection to Imperial Laws, and for that reason they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with all the Arts of Malice to beat down the Credit and Reputation of the <hi>Justinian</hi> Code, till at length from his Laws they proceeded to vent their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon his Person: and that was the thing that gave so much joy and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to <hi>Alemannus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: that now the World might see what kind of man this <hi>Justinian</hi> was, who was so prophane as to take upon him a power of medling with Sacred Things, and controuling Popes themselves. But the indignity of so base a design soon provoked Learned Men to expose it to the World with that scorn, that it deserved. The first that appeared in the Cause (that I know of)
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63060:223"/>
was a Learned Man of our own Nation in the Year 1626, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Rive</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to his late Majesty, a Gentleman e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually eminent both for Learning and Loyalty, in a little, but a very ingenious Treatise upon the Argument, Entituled <hi>Imperatoris Justiniani desensio adversus Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannum.</hi> The Book, which is great pity, is hard to be procured, neither indeed had the Learned Author the advantage of some considerable Records, that are now brought to light, and though he was a Learned Man not only in his own Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but all other Polite Learning, yet I find that he was not so well acquainted with the Records of the Church, as to be able to state that matter aright. And therefore he is altogether mistaken in that part of his defence, especially as to the Controversie of the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> but he followed the common opinion as it was stated by the <hi>Romanists</hi> against the <hi>Africans,</hi> as I think all Writers have done to this very day.

And such are in the Age that we are now treating of, <hi>Procopius</hi> himself, <hi>Agathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Marcellinus Comes, Facundus Hermia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis, Liberatus Diaconus, Cassiodorus, Jornandes, Victor Tunonensis, Gregorius Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronensis, Evagrius Scholasticus</hi> under <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi> and the <hi>Chronicon Alexandrinum</hi> under <hi>Heraclius.</hi> And from them, though the greatest part of them were either enemies or disobliged Persons, I doubt not but to shew the falshood of the Libel it self and the Malice of its Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>In the first place we have all the reason in the World to reject the Book it self as a spurious Pamphlet dishonestly fathered upon <hi>Procopius,</hi> when we find it never so much as mention'd by any of the Ancients, or by any Writer whatsoever for many Ages after his own time. And yet it is
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63060:225"/>
next to impossible but that they must have taken notice of a work of such a peculiar stre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In short the first Author that makes any mention of it, is that crude and injudicious <hi>Rhapsodist Suidas</hi> who lived not till the 11th Century, 500 Years after <hi>Procopius,</hi> but he comes too late, not being vouch't by any more Ancient Testimony, and then his own can be of no Cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63060:225"/>
time he imbraces it, contrary to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law of the Criticks without any ancient Testimony to certifie its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy. <hi>Alemannus</hi> pleads that the reason why it was so long unknown, was because <hi>Procopius</hi> was forced to suppress it for the security of his own life. That might be a good reason for <hi>Procopius</hi> his own time, but certainly not for the long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of so many Ages, as from the sixth Century to the eleventh. And to give any credit to a Book, that never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd once in the World till 500 years after the death of its pretended Author, is a Civility that the Criticks would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow in any Case, neither do I know it ever challenged unless in this. I know indeed Books may have been buried five hundred or a thousand years, but then they have always had some ancient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies that there were once such Books written by such Authors, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other terms were they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and this was the case of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s Epistle. But however this <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Plea for suppressing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Procopius</hi> his Book for his own safety may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with it self, I am sure it is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the pretence that he has undertaken to make good, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be all proved out of <hi>Procopius</hi> his
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63060:226"/>
other Writings, in which he tells many more and many worse Stories than in this little Epitome: And yet they were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen but approved by the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But if so, he ought either to have suppress't all or none, and not to have publisht the sharper Invective to gain the Emperor's favor, and keep back the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to avoid his displeasure. These are pretty consistent Dreams, that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come into any Man's head, but in a <hi>Vatican</hi> Nap.</p>
               <p>But beside the want of sufficient Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to warrant the reception of the Book, the thing is so very unlikely in it self, that <hi>Procopius</hi> should write so dirty a Libel both against <hi>Justinian</hi> and <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarius,</hi> that it would require very strong proof only to make it a thing credible. For when he had through his whole life been so infinitely obliged by both; when he had been raised by <hi>Justinian</hi> from a low Condition to the highest Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Empire; when he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept the most entire and intimate friendship with <hi>Belizarius;</hi> and lastly when he made it the great work of his life, both before and after the writing of this Book to consecrate their Fames, and conveigh down the glory of their Actions to all future Ages, who can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63060:226"/>
suffer himself to believe that the same Man should endeavor to spoil all this by a railing Lampoon? Though whenever or by whomsoever it was forged, it is no wonder that it was laid to <hi>Procopius,</hi> according to the custom of all Lampoons, to fasten them upon Authors, that of all Men living were most unlikely to write them. To these we may add some other unlucky Objections suggested by <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus</hi> himself in his Preface. As that the Glory of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Actions is so bright in it self, as to be able to out-shine all detraction. For what Man can believe that he ruin'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that recover'd so many Cities, Provinces and Kingdoms to it, that conquer'd so many barbarous Nations, and plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Empire, that had been almost lost and tottering for many years, to its full force and Power? One would think that the Man who makes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, should be concern'd to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self some way or other of it, and yet he fairly dismisses it with all Civility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (he says) it is at this time a thing only existing in History An admirable <hi>Vatican</hi> reason this! but so it is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men are over-seen and eager in their pursuit of Revenge, that they always leave their Sense and Understanding behind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:63060:227"/>And whereas some Men conclude <hi>Procopius</hi> to be Father of the Bastard, from the likeness of its features to his other Books, I should from the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument draw the contrary conclusion. For though it is no hard matter for any Man to imitate or rather steal another Man's stile as to forms and schemes of Speech, by making it familiar to himself with constant reading. Yet the Spirit and the Genius of an Author is a thing very rarely imitable, and that too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovers it self in this counterfeit <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius;</hi> for if we compare the Anecdota with his other Books, and observe what perspicuity and neatness of Method, what gravity, what candor, what ingenuous freedom runs through all his other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: And on the contrary in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and indigested heaps things are laid together in this Libel, with what silliness and malice, with what buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and affected rudeness the whole work is contrived, it seems to me impossible that they should both be the Off-spring of the same Man. And therefore it is but a true and a sharp censure, that is given of it by <hi>Balthasar Bonifacius</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Molinus. In summâ sic statuo esse in hâc, cujuscunque illa sit Auctoris, rhyparographiâ, loquentiae satis, licentiae
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63060:227"/>
nimis, insolentiae plus nimio, multum livo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, plus odii, plurimum inscitiae, pa um ordinis, minus facundiae, minimum judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii, nihil memoriae, minus nihilo sincerita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
                  <q>In fine, my Opinion is, that in this rhapsody, whosesoever it is, is to be found babble enough, rudeness too much, arrogance more than enough, much spite, more hatred, but most ignorance, little order, less eloquence, least judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing of memory, but less than nothing of honesty.</q>
From all which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous defects, it is but reasonable to conclude with him, that the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> so eminent for all the contrary perfections could never be the Author of the Libel. And indeed the folly of the design makes it no less incredible than the meanness of the performance, for if <hi>Procopius</hi> upon some affront at Court resolved to revenge himself by this Libel, yet to own it and publish it to the World in his own name, was a ranker piece of spite against himself, than against his Royal Master; for it not only blasts the Credit of all his other Writings, but it leaves himself a base and unworthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite upon Record, who spent all his Wit and Life, in magnifying the Vertues of a Man, whom himself knew to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all Mankind in the studious practice
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63060:228"/>
of all wickedness: For that is the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Libel. Neither is it to be less suspected from the time in which it pretends to have been brought forth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 32 year of the reign of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> as the Author often declares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Procopius</hi> his Books <hi>de aedificiis</hi> that are all panegyrick and abound with quite contrary Characters, were not written till the 36<hi>th</hi> year. Now is it not very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that when <hi>Procopius</hi> was fall'n out so bitterly with his great Patron after all the Obligations in the World, as he is in this Libel, he should afterwards be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into so much kindness as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses in those books, without blasting and retracting his own slanders. Or if we can reconcile the possibility of the thing, yet however the books <hi>de aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis</hi> are an unanswerable confutation of the <hi>anecdota,</hi> and not only convict the characters of Malice, but the Matters of Fact of false hood. So that granting <hi>Procopius</hi> to be the true Father, I will prove him guilty of rank falshhood through the whole tale both from his own Writings before and after, from the testimony of his co-temporaries, but most of all from the nature and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Actions themselves. And as for the <hi>Librarians</hi> spiteful endeavors
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63060:228"/>
to improve the malice of the Libel, I shall discover so much baseness in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as to leave him under that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that is due to such ill-natur'd Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, that will be gnawing at the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of great Men. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I shall reduce this confused heap of Calumnies to certain heads as the most easie way of confuting them, for whilst they lye confused together they are not so easily discern'd or exposed, but when parted, like false Witness, every Lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays it self.</p>

The first crime that he lays to the Emperor's Charge, is the worst that a Sovereign Prince can be guilty of, and that is cruelty, which the Author of the Libel aggravates in every Page, at that extravagant rate, as if he had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done all the Tyrants that ever were,<note place="margin">

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63060:229"/>
out-stript all the villainy that Mankind is capable of acting. For thô there have been divers Tyrants in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, that were cruel beyond all bounds of Barbarity, that dispeopled whole Cities, Provinces and Kingdoms, yet these were the first that utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the Race of Mankind, and laid wast the universal World.</q>
And once more (not to be too tedious, this Story of mowing down the Inhabitants of the whole World, being the Subject of every Page)
<q>That <hi>Justinian</hi> was in reality no Man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 18.</note> but the Devil in the shape of a Man, is evident from those unparallell'd Mischiefs that he brought upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: for the height of all Wickedness is to be taken from the depth of it Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Villainy. But for that it were more easie to compute the Sand upon the Sea-shore, then all the Nations destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Justinian.</hi> And as for my own part, I am able to reckon up two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten Millions of Men, that were offer'd Victims to his Barbarity.</q>
A very fair reckoning this, were the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars well cast up, for by the summ total one could expect to hear of no less than the old Pranks of <hi>Caligula, Nero</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> of <hi>Phalaris</hi> his ten thousand bulls, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ten millions of Brick-Kills,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:63060:230"/>
of the out-rages of the thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and the fury of the ten persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: of firing the City, assassinating the Senate, putting whole Provinces to the Sword? but what do I speak of all these trifles of Cruelty, if compared to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the whole habitable World? for that is the Chorus to all our Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that he did not only cut the throats of all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but buried the whole World in one common ruin. What not one Man left alive? the whole Race at once destroyed? How then came the face of the Earth to be peopled again? by <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Stones, or <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Teeth? Oh no, says <hi>Alemannus,</hi> these are only certain Schemes of Speech, that the learned call hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Expressions. It may be so, but we, that are unlearned, cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from impudent Lies and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities. For if every Man living were not destroyed, then the tale, as it is told, is all fable, but if the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were universal, then the question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns how the Earth ever came to be re-inhabited, without those Absurdities that we commonly call poetical <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles.</hi> But not to be too severe upon the licence of Lampoons, we will grant that possibly the <hi>Hydra</hi> or the <hi>Dragon</hi> might
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63060:230"/>
spare some few alive; but in compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion let us compute how many millions of his Subjects he devoured at every meal. Where lay the Cities? where the Provinces? where the Nations, that he so universally dispeopled? How great a part of the Empire he recover'd, we know from his Wars with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> but that he ever destroyed any one Province, is news to this very day. How many stately Cities he built is recorded by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> but if he ever reduced either any of them or any other to Ashes, he would have done well to have told us in his own defence, if he could but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged any one Example. What strange way of writing history is this to tell us of such vast numbers of Cities, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Nations destroyed, without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying but one Village? But though he might not mow down whole Cities and Provinces at a stroak, yet he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such vast numbers of out-rages at divers times and in divers places, as might amount to the two hundred and ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of lives. That may be, but as vast as the Empire was, I doubt it would scarce afford pasture enough for so great a Butchery. But if it would, I would only know where, when and by whom
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63060:231"/>
these vast Oceans of blood were shed. He reign'd 39 years by himself, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd nine years more under his Unkle <hi>Justin,</hi> in all which time if we inquire of our Libeller the Catalogue of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Why, to be short, <hi>Amantius</hi> and <hi>Vitalvanus</hi> were put to death. They were so, but what are two Men above two hundred millions of Men! This is the priviledg of hyperbolical Historians. But seeing this is all our Martyrology, let us inquire into the merits of the Cause, for it is that, they say, and not the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that makes the Martyr, and by that we shall easily discern that these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Cruelties were so far from that, that they were not only necessary Acts of Government, but of common Justice too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amantius</hi> had been the Author of all the Severities against the Catholicks under <hi>Anastasius,</hi> insomuch that at the Coronation of the Emperor <hi>Justin</hi> the People cryed out for his blood. But that was not the cause of his death,<note place="margin">

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:63060:231"/>
himself to be no true <hi>Procopius</hi>; for first he says that <hi>Amantius</hi> was put to death by <hi>Justinian,</hi> whereas he was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately executed by <hi>Justin</hi> at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown, as appears not only from all the co-temporary Historians, <hi>Marcellinus Comes, Jornandes, Evagrius, Victor Tunonensis,</hi> but from the matter of Fact it self, he being taken off for setting up <hi>Theocritus</hi> for the title of the Crown against <hi>Justin.</hi> But when he farther adds the Cause of his death, he utterly betrays the Imposture of the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had been too saucy in his language to <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> whereas there was no such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that name in all the long Reign of <hi>Justinian,</hi> till the last year of his life. But here for a Reconciler commend me to the Apostolical <hi>Librarian,</hi>

                     <hi>Praefat.</hi>
                  </note> that when there were two Patriarchs of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> one that dyed in the first year of <hi>Justin</hi> surnamed <hi>Cappadox,</hi> and another that came to that See in the last year of <hi>Justinian</hi> surnamed <hi>Scholasticus</hi>; to make sure of a <hi>John</hi> in his reign, he pieces up one Bishop of these two Men, and says that <hi>Procopius</hi> meant <hi>Johannes Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cappadox,</hi> though <hi>Cappadox</hi> was dead near 50 years before <hi>Scholasticus</hi> was consecrated, and four Bishops of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And indeed the Author has every where betrayed so much of that, as plainly discovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be no true <hi>Procopius.</hi> And such is his story in his 6<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Justin</hi>'s being <hi>analphabetus,</hi> void of all Learning, not able to write his own name, which
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63060:232"/>
he proves from the invention of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Plate with his name in it, that he stampt upon all his Commissions, because he could not write.

And
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63060:233"/>
as for <hi>Justin</hi>'s acting so little, and <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s acting so much in the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>Procopius</hi> himself in his first Book <hi>de Bello Vandalico,</hi> imputes it to no other cause then his extreme old age, and not to any want either of natural Parts or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Education, as this malicious and ignorant Libeller has done, who sticks not to call him a fool and a blockhead. And it was no doubt a sign of his being so, when he raised himself from so low a fortune into the Imperial Throne, and when he was in it, govern'd so well, as we have seen in the History of his Reign. But here again commend me to the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of <hi>Alemannus,</hi> that cites the very passage in the Book <hi>de bello Vandalico,</hi> which imputes <hi>Justin</hi>'s inability for busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to nothing but his extreme old Age, to confirm this passage that lays it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his natural incapacity and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness.</p>
               <p>But having convicted this story of the Murder of <hi>Amantius</hi> for an unmannerly word, of extreme malice and ignorance, let us now examine the other hundred Millions of instance in the death of <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and there we shall find as strong streins of the same malice and ignorance as in the <hi>Amantian</hi> Fable. For first he is so miserably inform'd as to place this

transaction immediately after the death of <hi>Amantius,</hi> whereas he was for a good time one of the greatest Favourites of the Emperor <hi>Justin,</hi> and kept up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friendship with <hi>Justinian,</hi> and joyn'd with him in transacting that great Business of uniting the Eastern and Western Churches with Pope <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misdas,</hi> as appears by <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Epistles to that Pope; and therefore the death of <hi>Vitalian</hi> did not follow the Execution of <hi>Amantius</hi>

But the true Story of <hi>Vitalian</hi> is this, That he had often stein'd himself with Rebellion against his Master <hi>Anastasius,</hi> and had caused the slaughter of many Thousands of Citizens for his own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but the Emperor was at last too hard for him, so that whil'st he reign'd the Rebel lived in Exile,<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63060:235"/>
is so far from being put to death, that he is only put into a Monastery, and that with such vast wealth, and so many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of life, that as <hi>Procopius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, if he had been endowed with Wit enough to estimate his happiness by the measures of Reason, not of Ambition, he would have valued his Misfortune, as the most happy thing that ever befel him. But now to compare the truth and the ingenuity of the open and the secret Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories concerning this unhappy man, by the first it is proved that he was guilty of all manner of wickedness and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an Atheist and a Villain, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the Crown for his own Head by the Murther of his Royal Master, and that certainly is enough to put any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject out of all capacity of mercy. And yet in the <hi>Anecdota</hi> his fall is imputed meerly to <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Revenge, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to alienate the Emperors Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from her. And if it were so, that was so ill an Office, that (if any thing could) would warrant the lawfulness of it. But whether there were, or were not any thing of Pique in the Case, it is certain that he had discovered his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to supplant his Master, and if after that the Empress by slite over-reach't him, whatever private design she might
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:63060:236"/>
have in it, it was in it self an eminent act of duty. And by this we may judg both of the Wisdom and the Petulancy of this Libeller, when he snarles at an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction so commendable in it self, and so commended by <hi>Procopius</hi> himself in his relation of it. In short, when <hi>Procopius</hi> had painted this Man in such black Characters, in common discretion he ought not, he could not have made his Prosecution a Crime; for setting aside the Empresses disgust, by <hi>Procopius</hi> his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the deposition of the Witnesses, he deserved death for his Treason, and then after that, what ever motives she might have to prosecute, no Man could have any just ground to blame the Prosecution. And yet after all the good Emperor spared the Traitors blood, and only condemn'd him to say his Prayers, and sue out his pardon in Heaven, as he in great mercy had granted it here on earth. But so blind was the importunity of the Man, that he rusht into farther Disorders, till he was at last turn'd loose to beg Bread and Farthings, which story was in the Legend Age of Christianity fastned I know not by whom upon the great <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizarius.</hi> But now considering the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of this unhappy Man's Offences, <hi>Theodora</hi> and <hi>Antonina,</hi> who entrapt him,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63060:236"/>
as great Furies as they are represented for it by the Libel, are not less to be commended for their honesty in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, then the dexerity of their Wit in its management. Neither upon the whole Matter do I find them to have been such instruments of Cruelty, as they are made not only by this Libel, but the common vogue. It is evident that they were Ladies of great Art and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, that had great power over their Husbands, and by that means great share in the Government, in which as they had opportunity of doing many other good Offices, so the discovery of this Traitor was none of the least. And as for <hi>Theodora,</hi> how black soever she is painted in this Libel, I cannot find but that she bears a very fair Character in all other Writers both for Wisdom, Piety and Charity. <hi>Procopius</hi> himself gives an high commendation of her Wisdom in his first Book <hi>de bello Persico</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> And in his Books <hi>de Aedificiis</hi> reckons up many of her foundations for pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Uses, especially that of destroying the publick Stews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and building and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing religious Houses for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of lewd People taken out of them, there to repent of the Wickedness of their former lives, and sequester them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:63060:237"/>
to Prayer and Devotion. And as for her good-nature he has left this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of it upon Record,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Bello Gothico, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 31.</note> that it was in her temper to relieve and protect the oppressed, and therefore she forced <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes,</hi> a great favourite with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to receive his injured Wife, a piece of Justice that laid the foundation of a Conspiracy against the Emperor's life, as we shall see afterward. And as much as that Age abounded with Writers, none of them have left any ill character or ill story of her upon Record, unless in the point of Religion, that she favour'd the <hi>Acephali</hi> and the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> So that whereas this Libel reports that she was at first a Player, a common Strumpet, the most infamous Prostitute of the City, 'tis as probably true as the other tale of her being a Witch, and having carnal copulation with the Devil. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely that so wise a Prince should take a Woman of such publick infamy into his Bed and his Bosom, but if he did, it is much more so, that when the thing was so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally known in the whole Empire, and out of it too, (for such Reports stop no where) that yet not any the least foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of it should appear in any Writer either of the same or the adjoyning Ages. There were at that time several Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63060:237"/>
that lived out of the Dominions of <hi>Justinian,</hi> as <hi>Jornandes, Cassiodorus, Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Diaconus,</hi> who might have spoke out with freedom and without danger, and yet they are altogether silent. There were many angry and disobliged Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as all the <hi>Africans,</hi> who suffer'd in the Cause of the <hi>tria capitula,</hi> and their <hi>African</hi> Blood would have been tempted at least to make some remote Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon a thing so foul and foolish. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius</hi> did not write till the <hi>Justinian</hi> Family was extinct, and it is too evident, for what reason I know not, unless it be that he followed an <hi>Eutychian</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that he had no kindness for it, and yet he knows nothing of the matter. Now that a thing of so strange a nature, of so great concernment, so known, so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in all parts of the World should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so much as mention'd or intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in such a great variety of Writers, it must require a very greedy Faith to swallow it. But <hi>Alemannus,</hi> as his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is, vouches the story out of <hi>Almoin</hi> a <hi>French</hi> historian, that lived not till near three hundred years after the death of <hi>Justinian,</hi> and accordingly he gives such a false and fabulous account of the whole reign, as only proves his barbarous ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of all the transactions of that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:63060:238"/>As for the treatment of Pope <hi>Silverius,</hi> it was foul enough, but as far as the Empress was concern'd in the Plot, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, that she was farther chargeable with any thing than the <hi>Eutychian</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Acephalan</hi> Heresie. She was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troness of the Party, and as most Women are, zealous to advance her own Sect, and that no doubt made her willing to be rid of Pope <hi>Silverius,</hi> who would not be wrought to any compliance with her or condescension to her Faction. But as for the forging of Letters in his Name to the <hi>Goths,</hi> if there were any truth in the story, it was none of her Action, <hi>Rome</hi> being the Scene of it, whereas she always resided at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But for my own part I care not to be too credulous in the Reports of those times, when Men were so factious and partial in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Though that such Letters there were either true or counterfeit 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but whether, uncertain. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi> affirm that they were forged, and that is easily said, when Men are wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a baffled Party, but upon what ground they say it, 'tis utterly in the dark, and will now never come to light, <hi>Silverius</hi> dying before it ever came to Tryal. Neither is it so improbable that he should side with the King of the <hi>Goths,</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:63060:238"/>
for the sake of his great Master <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> by whose favor he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Papal Chair.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>C.</hi> 14.</note> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of fear or favor, was known to himself alone. Though the first motive of fear is most probable, as <hi>Procopius</hi> tells the story,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 25.</note> that <hi>Belizarius</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his entrance into <hi>Rome</hi> strictly besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Goths,</hi> he sent away all that were useless or suspected, and among these <hi>Silverius</hi> himself. And that I take to be all the mystery of his Banishment, and all the black circumstances added by the <hi>Africans</hi> to be their own cholerick Surmises, out of whom this malicious Rhapsodist borrowed most of his Fables, and then improved them with his own Venom.</p>
               <p>And lastly as for the barbarous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great Queen <hi>Amalasuntha,</hi> which this Author says, was contrived by <hi>Theodora</hi> to prevent her design'd Journey to <hi>Constantinople</hi> out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63060:239"/>
to <hi>Theodatus,</hi> to perswade him to put her to death. But beside that this story has the ill fortune to have no Vouchers, and that on the contrary 'tis cross't by all co-temporary Writers, it is here told so awkerdly, as plainly to give it self the Lye. And if the Pamphleteer had consulted <hi>Procopius</hi> himself,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Bello Goth. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> he would have told him, that though the Queen had once design'd for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet at this time she was so very far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thought, that she had taken the whole burthen of the Government upon her self, and though she had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Kinsman <hi>Theodatus</hi> to a partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Pomp and Title of Majesty, she by an Oath of Allegiance from him reserved all the Power to her self. And as for <hi>Peter</hi> the Ambassador, he had so little hand in perswading the Tyrant to the Villainy, that he had not so much as ever seen him, when it was committed, being at that time on his Journey, and staying at <hi>Apollonia</hi> for farther Orders from his Master: by whose command, when he came to <hi>Rome</hi> he declared an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal War against the <hi>Goths</hi> in revenge of her Majesties de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:63060:239"/>
and their Nation. We see here how hard a thing it is to file a Lye so square, as that it shall light even on all sides, for this Libeller is so unfortunate, as to cross with <hi>Procopius</hi> himself in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and circumstance of his story; and to betray his Forgeries as much by his innocent as malicious Mistakes, and what could be more unhappy than for the same Man to tell us that <hi>Peter</hi> after his Arrival at <hi>Rome</hi> perswaded <hi>Theodatus</hi> to murther <hi>Amalasuntha,</hi> and yet tell us that she was murther'd before he set foot upon <hi>Italian</hi> Ground.</p>
               <p>So much for <hi>Theodora,</hi> the next Fury is <hi>Antonina,</hi> the inseparable Companion of all her Wickedness, who therefore ought to be clear'd and acquitted by her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; but for her commendation I must add, that she is every where celebrated by <hi>Procopius</hi> for a Woman of prodigious Wit, to which he very much ascribes <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizarius</hi> his success in his Wars, in which she never left him, but when she stayed at Court to watch the Motions of <hi>Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Cappadox,</hi> who out of meer malice and envy lay at catch for his destruction, and how neatly she tript up the great Statesman, we have seen above, though the Reader may see it more largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Procopius</hi> himself. So little

And as for those many and shameless Adulteries, that the Pamphlet loads her with, it is but a single testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of we know not whom, no such thing being in the least suggested against her by any other Writer. But this sort of tales are proper materials for Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons, for as it is hard to prove them, so is it as hard to disprove them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they take most easily with the Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind, though without unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable proof they ought to be rejected as the standing Topicks of Calumny. But that <hi>Belizarius</hi> should imprison her for her Lewdness, and yet be so very strangely fond of her, as this inconsistent Scribler tells the Tale, is a thing so incredible in it self, that scarce any Testimony can have credit enough to give it reputation.

For

this was no part of secret History, no closet- or bed-chamber Transaction, but all such publick shew as was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be be-lyed.

               <p>And lastly as for the ill-success of his second Expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> which the Libel lays intirely upon his ill Conduct, he has here some little truth to help out his malice: For it is true that his second expedition was not so successful as his other Wars, but whose fault was that?

                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:63060:244"/>

And it is not to be doubted, but that the Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Inhabitants must have been very heavy. But it was not in <hi>Beliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his power to ease them, for he came to defend their Country, and having no other Supplies, they must either main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Charges of the War or submit to the Enemy.

to recover it, and therefore supplies he must have, particularly the Souldiers, that were immediately under his own Command. For that was his custom in all his Wars to lead 7000 of his best Horse in Person,<note place="margin">

But no relief coming, <hi>Totilas</hi> carries all before him, and lays siege to <hi>Rome</hi> it self, till <hi>Narses</hi> came with new Forces: At whose arrival <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizarius</hi> had raised the siege with 500 Men, had he not been betrayed by <hi>Bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> the Governor of the City, who when the whole <hi>Gothish</hi> Army was put into disorder within his sight, refused to sally out, though he had 3000 Men in the Garrison. Upon this <hi>Belizarius</hi> moves forward with his whole Army, and being much inferior in force, he made it up with Art and Stratagem, and managed his first On set with that Conduct and Dexterity, that he had given an utter Defeat to the <hi>Gothish</hi> Army, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Governor never sallied out in all the Engagement: though he could not compleat his Victory, being forced to make a suddain Retreat by the rashness of one of his Commanders: who being left behind to secure the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Ammunition, and hearing of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:63060:245"/>
the great Victory, he resolved to have a share in the honor of it; and so leaves his Post, falls upon a Party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, is routed, and not only the whole Baggage is in their power, but the security of <hi>Belizarius</hi> his retreat is cut off. And for that reason he was forced to leave his Victory unfinished; and the City being very ill defended by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and betrayed by some of the Guards, who in the Night set open the Gates to the Besiegers, it became an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Prey to the Enemy. And yet <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> was so shockt with this rough En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, that he dispatches to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Letters to request Peace. In the mean time <hi>Belizarius</hi> goes on with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and upon it <hi>Totilas</hi> in a rage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to destroy <hi>Rome,</hi> but desists upon a Letter from <hi>Belizarius</hi> partly civil and partly threatning, and marches away with the Body of his Army towards <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Belizarius</hi> surprises <hi>Rome,</hi> and makes all possible hast to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Fortifications, but before he could set up the Gates. <hi>Totilas</hi> returns with all his Forces, and in two general Assaults is beat off with prodigious Slaughter, and forced to retreat with great fear and consternation; in so much that the <hi>Goths</hi> broke down-all the Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

over the <hi>Tiber,</hi> lest the <hi>Romans</hi> should pursue them, and so <hi>Belizarius</hi> went on to repair the Walls and the Gates, and when he had finisht, sent the Keys of the City for a Present to the Emperor.

Upon the news of this irreparable loss he sails for <hi>Sicily,</hi> there receives some Recruits, and attempts to raise the Siege of <hi>Ruscia,</hi> but is again defeated by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther storm, upon which he changes his Councils, and new Models his Army,<note place="margin">

This is all the ill conduct that this great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was guilty of in this Expedition; it was not indeed so honorable as his other Wars, because not so successful, but where the Miscarriages lay we have seen in the Premises, from whence it appears that <hi>Belizarius</hi> was so far from committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Faults, that it was his greatest work through the whole War to retrieve other
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:63060:246"/>
Mens losses.<note place="margin">

And that was the only true reason why he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not in the third Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Goths,</hi> because the Emperor could not part with him from his own Person, and so he continued at Court all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life in the height of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and glory, till in his extreme old Age he rescued the Empire from the <hi>Huns,</hi> and set in that glorious Action. So dull a Fable is this of our Rhapsodist, that he was the object of publick contempt ever after his return from <hi>Italy.</hi> But though to blast a Mans good Fortune be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on barbarous enough, yet to blot out his Vertues, and place the blackest Vices in their stead, so as to turn a Man of the greatest Honor in the World into a false and perjur'd Villain, is a depth of malice below (if it were possible) the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pit it self. And among all the Evils under the Sun, I think this a deplorable one from this Example, that the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the greatest Men lye so much at the mercy and in the power of every ill-natur'd Pedant, to dispose of them as
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63060:246"/>
they please to Posterity. Though it is some comfort again, that the Actions of great Men are too big and bright to be eclyps'd by the interposition of every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Meteor. And that is ours in the case of <hi>Belizarius,</hi> whose Glory will for ever out-shine and baffle all the Attempts of Envy and Malice both in figure and brightness. And if we compare the true story of <hi>Belizarius</hi> his Actions with the little blind tales of this barbarous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, it must for ever leave the Author of it under the most scornful indignation of all Men that have any regard for Worth or Honor.</p>

<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63060:247"/>
Empire upon that Prince, whom he had before represented as immediately raised up by the divine Providence for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery? Whether it were a true or a <hi>Perkin Procopius,</hi> he must rave and not know what he says, when he talks of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s losing the Empire, that Charge being the most unluckily fastned upon him, of any one Prince in the whole Succession. I may safely challenge any Man to produce me any three Men either of the old Common-Wealth or the new Empire, that did more service to their Country than this Prince alone. The other great Men that were honor'd with the Titles of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Protectors of their Country, only saved it from the Invasion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Enemy, or perhaps two or three, but he beat back the incursions of the whole barbarous World from all Points of the Compass, and recover'd the greatest part of the Empire long since lost: And thô it were over-whelm'd with Multitudes of Enemies on all sides, yet he left it in a greater and a much firmer state than ever it was before at its greatest glory. In short, let any Man read <hi>Procopius</hi> his eight Books of the success of his Wars, and parallel the undenyable greatness of those Actions, if he can, out of all
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63060:247"/>
the Records even of the <hi>Roman</hi> State it self. If any Man can equal the Fortune of his Arms, it is <hi>Caesar,</hi> but as for the glory of their Wars, there is this one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy difference, that all <hi>Caesars</hi> aim'd at the subversion of the settled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all <hi>Justinians</hi> at its Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather Restitution. So that as <hi>Agathias</hi> observes towards the conclusion of his History,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 157.</note> he was the first Man of all the Emperors that reign'd at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> that could in good earnest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the stile of King of the <hi>Romans</hi> both in Title and Reality. But seeing this <hi>Procopian</hi> Libel is pretended by its Author to have been written in the 32 year of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Reign, pray let us take a short view of his great Actions for the Empire both before and after that time. And this is best done out of <hi>Procopius</hi> himself, the first from his eight Books of History, that were finisht in the 26<hi>th</hi> year of that Reign: the second out of his Books <hi>De Aedificiis,</hi> that were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the 36<hi>th</hi> year. To these if we add <hi>Agathias,</hi> who continues <hi>Procopius</hi> his History to the end of the Reign, we shall then have a complete Prospect of that universal Desolation, that <hi>Justinian</hi> brought upon his Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:63060:248"/>The greatest Match for the <hi>Romans</hi> in the World were the <hi>Persians,</hi> upon whom, though it was often attempted by the Ambition of their greatest Captains, they could never make any considerable Impression; but rather were for the most part sent home with loss and shame. And yet this powerful and war-like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Justinian</hi> at the entrance upon the Government, so amazed with the Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess of his Arms, Conduct of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Courage of his Soldiers, that even after a great Victory on the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> side,<note place="margin">

This gave the Emperor opportunity to imploy his Arms in <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with what success we shall see when we come to those Wars, but it was so great that it provoked <hi>Chosroes</hi> the great King of the <hi>Persians,</hi>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> out of pure Envy to the glory and fortune of <hi>Justinian,</hi> to break the Peace, as <hi>Procopius</hi> relates it, to which he subjoins this Remarque: That <hi>Chosroes</hi> and his Consederate Kings were angry at that, which of all good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was most commendable in a gallant Prince, his care to enlarge the bounds
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:63060:248"/>
and the glory of his Empire. They might as justly have blamed <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> for their great Actions. And yet this was the very same man, that our ingenious Author says was sent into the World for the destruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 9.</note> But <hi>Chosroes</hi> being a Man of a false Nature, crafty, apt to make Promises and seal them with an Oath, which for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest he would as readily break as take; he contrary both to his Faith and the Law of Nations, surprizes the <hi>Romans</hi> though his Confederates with an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed War; so that the Emperor being unprepared for a speedy resistance, and his Armies being then employed in <hi>Italy,</hi> he was for the present forced to buy Peace upon dishonourable Terms. But the next Campaign having finisht the War with <hi>Vitigis,</hi> he sends <hi>Belizarius,</hi> though with no great Army, and after several Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Chosroes</hi> his proud Spirit is so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, as to condescend to sue for Peace, and upon it sends his Ambassador to <hi>Belizarius</hi> with a further design to discover what Captain he was, and what strength he had. But <hi>Belizarius</hi> only returns him this resolute and careless An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That <hi>Chosroes</hi> did by no means treat like a Prince with his Imperial Majesty; for Princes, if they have any Quarrel
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:63060:249"/>
with their Neighbours, are wont first to send their Complaints and Demands, and if they can obtain no satisfaction, then to betake themselves to Arms, whereas <hi>Chosroes</hi> had contrary to his Faith broken into the Heart of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions, and therefore it was too late for him to offer at any Treaty of Peace. And with this short and peremptory Answer, and with some Stratagems of flight he dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Ambassador, who upon his return perswades <hi>Chosroes</hi> to be gone with all speed, it being a vain thing to think of fighting a Captain of that Conduct and Courage. Upon this <hi>Chosroes</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately steals away, and when he was got over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pretty secure from the <hi>Romans,</hi> he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain sends his Ambassadors to <hi>Belizarius</hi> to move for Cessation of all farther Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility, which upon Hostages given was at length granted, and he suffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home without any Pursuit, <hi>Beliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> not having Forces enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept his passage. This Action, as the Historian affirms, was so prodigious, that it exceeded all his former Victories, and his bringing those two mighty Kings, <hi>Gilimer</hi> and <hi>Vitigis,</hi> Captives to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> appeared not so glorious as this brave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. And it looks like Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:63060:249"/>
that when the <hi>Romans</hi> were skulk't within their own Fortresses, and <hi>Chosroes</hi> with a numerous Army had over-run their Dominions, <hi>Belizarius</hi> as it were riding Post with a small Body of Men should so suddainly stop the Cariere of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and force <hi>Chosroes</hi> out of fear either of the great Courage or good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the man, to retire with a pretence of Peace, but in good earnest to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And yet this Prince, as we have his Character from <hi>Agathias,</hi>

And what is as considerable, beside his own Forces he had the Assistance of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the revolted <hi>Armenians,</hi> but most of all the <hi>Moors</hi> in the West, and the <hi>Huns</hi> in the East, who at that time and in divers places broke into the Empire like violent Land-floods, and were as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously driven back into their Dens and lurking Holes. But <hi>Chosroes</hi> his great Spirit could not digest this dishonourable Repulse, and therefore he makes a fourth Invasion, though as he pretended, not upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> but the Christians of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:63060:250"/>
the City of <hi>Edessa,</hi> to revenge the Affront that they had put upon him in his second Expedition when he carried all before him. The Story is very remarkable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially out of the mouth of a man so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inquisitive as <hi>Procopius. Chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> being informed that it was a received Opinion among the Christians, that our Blessed Saviour had fore-told in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Agbarus,</hi> that the City of <hi>Edessa</hi> should never be Conquered; for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his Triumphant Return home he resolves to take it, only to prove him a false Prophet. And here the Historian relates the Correspondence between our Saviour and <hi>Agbarus</hi> out of the Records of the City agreeable to the Story of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> and in farther Confirmation of of it, adds that this Prophesie, That the City should never be vanquish't, was not to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Morning, and so a second time, but when at last he came to the City, he was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly struck with a Rheumatism, and is so scared with it as to raise the Siege upon it. But being a Bigotted Pagan he was prevailed upon by his Priests and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to wipe off this Dishonour, as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Gods had been Conquered by the God of the Christians, and therefore he vows to plow up the City, and make Slaves of all its Inhabitants, but all in vain, he is bafled in every Skirmish, and is so shamefully beaten in a general Assault, that neither himself nor his men had any heart to make any farther Attempt, and though he had often refused any Terms of Treaty, yet now to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And from thence he turns his Forces upon the <hi>Lazi</hi> that were under the protection of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but is in all Engagements so soundly beaten, that he is at last forced to sue for Peace, and so we hear no more of him till we hear of his inglorious end, which hapned not till after the death both of <hi>Justinian</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Justin,</hi> and it hapned thus as <hi>Agathias</hi> relates it:<note place="margin">

Country, and bearing all before him with Fire and Sword, and <hi>Chosroes</hi> beholding the sad spectacle, but not being able to make timely resistance, bursts with grief, after he had reign'd 42 Years. This short Epitome I hope is sufficient to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Impartial Reader, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire lost neither Power nor Honour in this <hi>Persian</hi> War.</p>
               <p>Now let us take a short view of the <hi>Vandalick</hi> and <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars, by which our <hi>Pasquil</hi> affirms, that he ruined both <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and we shall find that he lost those Countries just as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Army lost the Christian Empire last Campaigne, or rather as we hope they may this, by recovering all <hi>Europe</hi> out of the Enemies hands. For that was all the loss that <hi>Justinian</hi> brought upon the Empire by those two Wars, that he entirely restored those two great Branches to it, that had for many years been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It was lost by that weak Prince <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third to <hi>Gizerichus</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi>

And what was the Success of this War is vulgarly known, the <hi>Vandals</hi> that had kept <hi>Africa</hi> 45 years, were utterly beat out of it in 3 Months, and their King carried Captive to <hi>Rome.</hi> And if the Reader would know <hi>Procopius</hi> his own Judgment of it, it was plainly this.
<q>All past Ages have seen many things come to pass beyond Humane Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so will all Ages to come, as long as the State of Humane Affairs continues in the same posture. And some things have been brought about, that were supposed impossible, and when they have been so, they have astonish't the undertakers themselves. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing hap'ned like this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action I remember not. For what a
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:63060:252"/>
Prodigious thing is it, that 5000 Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (that was the Number of all the Horse that <hi>Belizarius</hi> brought with him, by whom alone the <hi>Vandals</hi> were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish't) when they had not one Port to land in, should in such a Moment of Time over-throw the Grand-Child of the Great King <hi>Gizerick,</hi> and make an entire Conquest of a Kingdom of so great Wealth and Strength?</q>
And this in my weak Opinion may very well pass for a Miracle both of Fortune and Vertue. And as for the <hi>Gothick</hi> War in <hi>Italy,</hi> as it had the same Cause, so had it the same Event: It was undertaken in defence of a Confederate Prince, and ended in the Conquest and Captivity of the Usurper. But of this we have given an Account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as far as <hi>Belizarius</hi> Acted in it, but because the War was not ended, when he was recall'd, let us now see its last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which our Author says was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter devastation of <hi>Italy. Belizarius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recall'd, the War is Committed to <hi>Narses,</hi> the only Captain equal to him for Conduct, Courage, Bounty, Justice, and Clemency; and so he made as quick a dispatch in <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Belizarius</hi> had done in <hi>Africk.</hi> He vanquish't that Great Captain <hi>Totilas</hi> in one pitch't Battel, and <hi>Teias</hi> his Successor in another, though
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:63060:252"/>
they had call'd in the <hi>Franks</hi> to their Assistance, and made such incredible slaughters of them, that both the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were almost utterly extinquish't, and at last condescends to grant Peace to the small Remainders, upon condition of quitting <hi>Italian</hi> Ground forever, and so drove them out of the Country like a Flock of Sheep: so far <hi>Procopius</hi> to the 26th year of the Reign of <hi>Justinian.</hi> But the <hi>Goths</hi> unwilling to lose their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessions in <hi>Italy,</hi> (as <hi>Agathias</hi> continues the History) draw in the <hi>Franks</hi> and the <hi>Almans</hi> to joyn Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Romans,</hi>

                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:63060:253"/>This is the true Relation of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Wars, which whether we consider their Cause, their management, or their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, were the most justifiable and most glorious Wars that were ever waged from the beginning of the World. They were not wantonly undertaken, but either in defence of himself or his injured Allyes, whom he was bound to assist in Justice as well as Humanity. They were managed with all the strictness of Discipline, and by all the Rules of Mercy and Clemency no Plunder committed, no Violence offered to any of the Inhabitants, no not to an Enemy unarmed; insomuch that when <hi>Gilimer</hi>'s Ambassadors, that were sent to the King of the <hi>Vice-Goths,</hi> fell unawares into the Power of <hi>Belizarius,</hi> he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Civility, and sent them home with safety. And lastly, as for their success, no Reign can equal them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he only stop the War for the present, but for ever, by rooting up as well as cutting down-all the Enemies of his Country. In short, when a very great part of it had for many years groan'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored it entirely to its Ancient Liberties. And yet this is the Devil, the Plague, the Fury, that was sent into the World in an Humane shape, for the utter destruction
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:63060:253"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And thus having justified <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Wars from all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of injustice or cruelty, let us briefly consider those other Actions, by which he laid wast and depopulated the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that is best described in his Books <hi>de Aedificiis,</hi> that were written four years after this counterfeit Libel, and that is a very unhappy stumble of this barbarous Writer, the ill timing of his Libel. If he had written it after all the other Books of <hi>Procopius,</hi> it might have had some seeming pretence to a secret History. But a Libel placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Panegyricks looks very awkerdly, and gives it self the Lie. Now the Character, that is given to <hi>Justinian</hi> in the Introduction to the Books <hi>de Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificiis,</hi> is but an Epitome of his eight Books of History: that he recover'd the shatter'd Empire to its ancient splendor and greatness from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and whereas <hi>Themistocles</hi> could only boast that he could make a little City great, he added great and vast Kingdoms to his Dominions, and divers large Provinces that were cut off from the Empire, he re-united to it, and built numberless new Cities. And whereas the Church was torn in pieces with infinite Schisms and Factions, he settled it in Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63060:254"/>
He freed the Laws from confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obscurity, and made the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice plain and easie: he was merciful to his Enemies, bountiful to all Men, as much solicitous to preserve happiness of life to his Subjects, as the Government of the Empire to himself. He every where guarded the Frontiers, and compass't in the whole Empire with new Fortifications, to fence out the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People that he had driven out. Among the Princes of old <hi>Cyrus</hi> bears one of the greatest Names for his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but whether <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s description of him be altogether real or in a great measure Poetical I know not; But as for <hi>Justinian</hi> I am sure he was a Father to his Country indeed, and if we observe the course of his Reign, that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> will appear but a trifle to it. And this is best proved by his Actions, for who can doubt of his Greatness, when he sees the Empire so vastly enlarged, or of his Clemency when he sees so many of those very Men, that had conspired against his life, not only to enjoy their own Lives and Estates, but to be advanced to the greatest Commands in the Imperial Army, and to no less than Consular Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the State? A pretty Character this of an humane Devil, that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:63060:254"/>
the World to eat up all Mankind. But if we take a view of all his Buildings, useful or stately Structures, he will seem to deserve under God, the Title of the Founder of the habitable World. And indeed his Foundations were so magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and so numerous, that it is scarce credible that they should all be the works of one Man, neither were they Designs for Pomp or Pleasure, but for the use and convenience of Mankind. He wasted not his Money upon <hi>Pyramids</hi> or <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheaters,</hi> but laid it out upon Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Hospitals, Monasteries, Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Castles, Bridges, High-ways, Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, Sea-Moles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These useful Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures our Libeller blushes not to stile mad and extravagant Buildings. Though beside his prodigious Works for Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Devotion, the greatest part of his Structures were upon the Confines, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Empire against future Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. On the <hi>Persian</hi> side he fortified the frontier and important City of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> repair'd the Walls of <hi>Amidas,</hi> wall'd about <hi>Rhapdium,</hi> so as to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, and built so many strong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles at all convenient Passes, as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every where to stop the Impressions of the <hi>Persians,</hi> he re-edified the Walls of <hi>Theodosiopolis, Constantina</hi> and <hi>Circesium,</hi>

all strong Garrisons, and every where planted Castles at a convenient distance between his Garrisons: he repair'd the Walls of <hi>Edessa,</hi> and fenced it in against the Inundations of the River <hi>Scirtus,</hi> he built divers Cities and Castles in <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesia,</hi> he rebuilt and fortified the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that had been demolisht by <hi>Chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> in his base second Expedition, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd the Cities of <hi>Calcis, Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra.</hi> All which were in effect one entire Fortification against the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; and as he wall'd in the Empire on that side, so he did on all other Parts, especially about <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> that were the common Inlets of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi> Where the number of Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Castles either newly founded or rebuilt is scarce to be computed. It would amaze a Man only to read the Catalogues of the Names as they are set down by <hi>Procopius</hi> in his third and fourth Books.

               <p n="28">§. XXVIII. The next grand Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this Princes Government was his siding with the Faction of the <hi>Venetae,</hi> not only not punishing their Murthers and Acts of Violence, but encouraging them, insomuch that they every where committed all kinds of Villainy with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impunity, to the endangering of the Empire it self by Tumults and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is the sum of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But to traverse it home, we must know that there was an old Game derived from the <hi>Grecians</hi> representing a Contest between the Sea and the Earth for Victory, they that plaid on the Earths side wore green Colours, representing the Verdure of the Fields, they that wrastled for the Sea wore blewish; if the green Ribbon-Men overcame, that was an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a plentiful Crop for the ensuing year: if the blew Men were Masters of the Field, that was a fore-boding of good Weather at Sea, and good Success in Merchandize. This trifling in process of time came to too much good earnest in the Common-Wealth, and the Parties became dangerous state-Factions, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten imbroil'd the Government. In the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63060:256"/>
time of the Emperor <hi>Anastasius</hi> they burnt down the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; but the most famous Tumult that they ever raised, was under <hi>Justinian,</hi> and it endanger'd his Crown much more than the Attempts of all his foreign Enemies put together.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Bello Persico lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.</note> The Factions were come to the utmost out-rage of Hostility, and it was now a kind of an open War through the whole Empire, it was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing to stab one another in the Streets, though he that escaped in the duel was certain to be punisht with death. And they were so barbarous in their folly, that it extinguisht all natural Affection, and the nearest Relations would not scruple to cut each other's Throats, it was perfect and down-right madness, though if the Government went about to suppress them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the rage of their Animosities, they would then unite and join Forces against it. And therefore <hi>Justinian</hi> at his first coming to the Crown resolves to bridle these insufferable Tumults and Affronts to Authority, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he publishes very severe Laws against all Disorders at the publick Games,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chronicon Alex.</hi>
                  </note> which for some considerable time over-awed their fury; but it hapned in the 6<hi>th</hi> or 7<hi>th</hi> year of his reign, that as
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:63060:256"/>
some of the Officers were carrying some Offenders of both Factions to the Jail, the People fell into a Tumult for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue, in which some say both Parties were engaged, and no doubt but it was, as all Tumults are, a mixt multitude, but the chief Actors were the <hi>Prasini,</hi> and therefore the Author of the <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Alexandrinum,</hi> who is the most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Writer in this story, makes it the action of that Party, and ascribes the Emperor's deliverance from their fury to the loyalty of the <hi>Venetae,</hi> and if so, the Emperor could not owe them too much kindness, to whose Loyalty he owed both his Life and Empire. But the Rabble being embodyed together took for their Word <hi>Victory,</hi> put to the Sword all that will not join with them, set the City on fire, and industriously destroy the most stately Buildings in it, besiege the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Palace, and demand Justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst evil Counsellors, and after five days fury set up <hi>Hypatius</hi> Nephew to the Emperor <hi>Anastasius</hi> in the Imperial Throne, assault the the Emperor's Palace, and put him into that danger, and his Friends into that consternation, that he was advised by his Privy Council to fly by Sea for his own security, but the Council was over-ruled by the courage
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:63060:257"/>
of <hi>Theodora,</hi> and because the Speech ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses an extraordinary and more than masculine greatness of mind; I will set it down.
<q>It is not (my Lords) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial at this time, whether it become the modesty of a Woman to act the Man's part amongst Men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when things are reduced to the utmost extremity of danger, all the nicer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of Decency are super-seded, and nothing is to be thought on but the most honourable way of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring or escaping the present danger. And as for that, my Opinion is, that though we could save our selves by flight, it would by no means be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to our Affairs. All Men are born under a Necessity of dying, but the Man that has once worn a Crown is bound to scorn to live an Exile, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live his own Majesty. God forbid that any Man should ever see <hi>Theodora</hi> live to be stript of this Royal Purple, or that she should survive one hour after her being saluted Empress. As for you (great Sir) if you think good to make your escape, I grant it may be done with ease, you have both Treasure and Shipping at hand, but consider whether you may not fall into the Traitor's
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63060:257"/>
hands, and suffer an ignoble death from your own Rebel Subjects. You may do, Sir, as you please, but I will act by that brave old saying, that the best Inscription upon a Monument is, <hi>Here lies the King,</hi> and that an Imperial Robe is the best winding sheet.</q>
This brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Empress infused both shame and courage into the Council, and they all unanimously resolve to dye upon the Place rather than to consult their safety by flight. Upon this result those two great Soldiers <hi>Belizarius</hi> and <hi>Mundus</hi> sally out from different Parts of the Pallace upon the Rabble in the <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the short account of this wild Tumult; and if the <hi>Venetae</hi> served his Imperial Majesty against the Rebels, it is a great Crime in a Prince to be kind to those that stood fast to their Master, and to their own duty at a time of greatest distress, even when
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63060:258"/>
his own Guards had deserted him, for when <hi>Belizarius</hi> commanded them to follow him, they refused it. Now at such a streight as this, when the <hi>Venetae</hi> flockt in to his relief, it was an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so high, that it could never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and therefore that they were the Emperor's Favourites, is an objection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit for a Traitor's Mouth: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so unpleasant to Rebels as to see Loyalty rewarded. And as the <hi>Venetae</hi> were dutiful Subjects to their Prince, so the <hi>Prasini</hi> were lookt upon as disaffected to the Government, and for that reason they were countenanced and incouraged by the Enemies of the State, particularly by the greatest of all,<note place="margin">

               <p n="29">§. XXIX. And thus having routed our <hi>Satyrist's</hi> main Battel, all his following Attempts will appear like the weak Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of a vanquisht Enemy, and such as deserve more to be slighted than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, being little else than the same general Characters and Calumnies repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:63060:258"/>
and so are already answer'd. But because I am resolved not to leave one spot of dirt upon the sacred memory of this mighty Prince, and to expose the folly and rudeness of this Pasquil to the utmost degree of contempt, I will trace all his smaller strokes of Malice, and prove every line of it meer poison, spite and fiction. Of this kind of rubbish then is the eighth Chapter compounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Justinian</hi> was a natural Fool, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect resemblance of the dulness and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of an Ass, a poor Wretch to be led up and down in a string, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the conceit, having his Ears always in the same posture and motion with As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ears. That he made Ducks and Drakes with the publick Revenue, spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it either in extravagant Presents made to the <hi>Huns,</hi> or making prodigious but useless Moles against the Sea: And that to defray the Charges of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Undertakings, he plunder'd and ruin'd all his Subjects. That he was like <hi>Domitian</hi> not only in Manners but Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as appears by <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Statue at the ascent to the Capitol. That he was a crafty Knave and a great Master of the Art of Dissembling; that in him the two extremes of Folly and Dishonesty met even as a Peripatetick Philosopher
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:63060:259"/>
taught in ancient time, that some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are compounded of the two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so are some mens natures; in short, he was all Fool and all Knave. What a Scavengers dirt-Cart is this, loaded with all the filth and nastiness of the Town, a Fool, an Ass, a Sot, a Thief, a Knave? But let us briefly examine the Particulars in order. And in the first place the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter contradicts it self, that the same man should be a natural Fool and yet a crafty Knave, a great Master of the Art of Dissembling, which I am sure no Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den can manage. Yes but some men (as the Philosopher holds) are made of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, as some colours are of black and white. This arguing from similitudes rarely proves any thing but the want of good Arguments, otherwise this blind Scribler would have seen that he does not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound but Reconcile the Extremes; if he had made <hi>Justinian</hi> a middle sort of man, it might have been sense, though not truth, but when he makes him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fool and perfect Knave, it very much resembles the late Famous Description of <hi>Don John,</hi> at once a very black and yet a very fair man. For these Characters are not less inconsistent with each other than those Complexions. I will grant all Knaves to be Fools, but if they are Crafty
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:63060:259"/>
Knaves, they cannot be Natural Fools, and if they are Natural Fools they can never make Crafty Knaves. I have read of a Renowned Pedant of <hi>Greece</hi> (to vie one Philosopher against an other) that went about to inform the World in this useful piece of Philosophy, that Snow was Charcoal, and Charcoal Snow. For my part rather then be put to the trouble of disputing it with him, I would grant that to be possible, but that both should be both, I could never endure the impudence of the Assertion. And yet that is our Authors Case in this Character of the same Mans being meer Knave and meer Fool; a stupid Ass, and a man of a very sharp Wit, a natural Sot, and a man of admirable Parts; expressions that occur every where through all parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. But next, why a Fool? what one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Folly? Why this, that he did not more resent the Affronts offer'd him by the Rabble in the <hi>Circus.</hi> This dull pretence is worse then a flat Lye: As if any man but a natural Fool would have contended with a Rabble in such a mad sit of Out-rage as they were in at that time; and <hi>Justinian</hi> if he had been a wise man, instead of securing himself in his Palace, would have exposed his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to their dirt and stones and unlimited
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:63060:260"/>
fury. Well fare our secret Historian for a lucky Fool-finder. But what other proofs of his Folly? was it his reforming the Laws? Was it his skill in Theological Learning, that is attested by <hi>Victor Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonensis,</hi> who entertain'd disputation with him 15 days about the <hi>tria Capitula,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Procopius, Liberatus,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius,</hi> all of them Co-temporary Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? So vain a Dream was that, that obtain'd so long at the first Restauration of Learning, that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, occasion'd by a false Translation of <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> against the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy it self, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Justinian</hi> for <hi>Justin,</hi> of whom <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> relates it, and with what probability I have shewn above, but as for <hi>Justinian</hi> there is not so much as the shadow of any ground to lay it to his Charge, beside that dull and evident mistake of a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator. But on the contrary he carried away the Title of <hi>Doctissimus</hi> in his own time, that is frequently given him by <hi>Theodatus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the 5th General Council, all these are pregnant Proofs of a natural Fool. But what shall we say to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of publick Affairs, when the Empire never flourished more under any Prince then his Government, when he not only preserved and emproved
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:63060:260"/>
what he was possest of, but recovered all that had been lost and secured it to his Successors, by fortifying it on all sides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Incursions of all Enemies. If these are the sports and projects of a Fool, I would be inform'd by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Historian what undertakings are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a wise man. But as for the Learned Librarian whil'st he goes about to stop this hole of his Author, he has made a much wider mistake of his own, by excusing it that the Author only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Character not of the vigour of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Age, but of his Dotage. This excuse if it were true is very key-cold, but it is enough that the Comment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Text, for the Author speaks plainly of the Emperors natural Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and habitual course of his life, and therefore to Apologize for such a false Character by applying it to the time of dotage, is to confess his Author a false Calumniator, for dotage is no natural fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But if he had doted, what then? Is it not base and disingenious to upbraid a Great Man with the natural infirmities of extreme old Age? He lived to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most bounds of Nature, and if he out-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself, can any man of sense or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, think it decent or ingenuous to brand him to all Posterity, with the mark of a
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:63060:261"/>
Fool and an Ass? But then beside this the excuse is false, for the <hi>Anecdota</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been written Seven Years before <hi>Justinian</hi>'s death, in which Interval of Time he perform'd many great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may be seen at large in <hi>Agathias de rebus Justiniani, &amp; Procopius de Aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiis.</hi> And yet <hi>Alemannus</hi> after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next Link in this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors long Chain of Vertues is twisted up of the most oppressive Covetousness and the most profuse Prodigality, and it is the second part of the Character of <hi>Don John,</hi> a man made up of nothing but Contradictions, a natural Fool and a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Knave; a griping Extortioner, and a careless Prodigal. But the Libeller it seems is resolved to say all the ill things of him, that are to be said of all the ill men in the World, and therefore has in

And this thing alone lays open both the Malice and the Folly of the Man; for no man of any Sense or Modesty could either have dared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it, or expect to gain belief to it, when it is so apparently contradicted not only by the whole History of the <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Reign, but by the very Libel it self.

This is the first sum of his Accounts, which I am sure the Reader, if he be either a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or a wise Man, cannot but sign with approbation and applause.</p>
               <p>The next head of Accounts to be cast up are his immense Buildings, though that account is already stated above, and may be done much more particularly out of <hi>Procopius de Aedificiis,</hi> from whom it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears, not only what incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sums of Money he expended, but to what good purpose, all his Works being contrived for the benefit of Mankind and the security of the Empire.

And first, as for his Fences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sea, there is not one by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> his own account, that was not absolutely necessary against the most dangerous and sweeping Inundations.<note place="margin">

Tempests. And to this <hi>Alemannus</hi> says, that his Author had particular regard in this passage: but if he had, then that is a very fair cast of his Authors Ingenuity, to raise so rude a clamor against so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Work. But I pray why is it to be understood of this in particular? Because, says he, <hi>Procopius</hi> in his first Book <hi>de Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificiis</hi> in his waggish way under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of praising it has jear'd it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his way for exposing it the more broadly in the <hi>Anecdota.</hi> But again I pray how has he jear'd it? Why, he says, that it was a work truly becoming a great Prince, and was built by <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s own skill and industry, who himself attended to every thing, but the diburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Money. From whence our learned Commentator ingenuously infers that he built it without taking care to defray its Charges. Whereas the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's apparent design is to magnifie both the greatness of the Works and of the Emperor; The works, he says, were so great, that he could not express them, but that in short as great as they were, the Emperor himself had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things, but defraying the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Now from hence to draw <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus</hi> his Inference, that he wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected them, is nothing but a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

to his Author, who commends the Emperor for sparing neither pains nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, only he left the money-part to other Mens management, but took the work it self into his own hands.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther secondly does <hi>Procopius</hi> affirm this of that particular Structure in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeum,</hi> but of all the Emperor's Buildings, in which he concern'd himself as to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part but the disbursements of Money:

And that was an equal commendation of his ingenuity and generosity. Neither thirdly was it an hint to prepare the way for this broad story in the <hi>Anecdota,</hi> when that was written so many years after this, so unhappy is this <hi>Vatican</hi> Tinker, that when ever he goes about to patch up his Authors Mistakes, he makes them wider. And in truth the Books <hi>de Aedificiis</hi> are an everlasting Monument both of the greatness and the usefulness of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Foundations; that neither time nor malice nor envy will ever be able to impair. But to return to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself, when he concludes this woful ditty of expending so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in giving bounds to the Sea, with this serious Remark, that he in vain wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fury of the Waves only out of vain-glory to vanquish the Sea it self. The malice is chill as the touch of a dead Man's hand, without life or Satyr, all flegm and dullness, just as if a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing an Invective against the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> should seriously declaim against them for defrauding the Sea of its true and ancient Rights, just such is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against <hi>Justinian,</hi> that he should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to set new bounds and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Ocean.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:63060:268"/>As for the other bottomless pit of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, <hi>viz.</hi> gifts to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man knows, that when a Man is prest with Enemies on all sides, there is no fighting them all without the silver Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and to buy Peace of some is the most speedy way to vanquish all. And this was the Policy of <hi>Justinian,</hi> he was content to buy Peace of the <hi>Persians,</hi> when he undertook the <hi>Vandalick</hi> War, and when that was done, he soon forced them to buy Peace of him, and thus by fighting his Enemies singly, and fencing off the rest, he at last Master'd all. A policy both just and laudable in it self, practiced by the greatest and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Princes, and indeed it is impossible to wage War without it, and therefore this exception of buying off the <hi>Barbarians</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not less dull and peevish than that of banking out the Sea.</p>
               <p>And as for the great gifts to the <hi>Huns,</hi> that our Author particularly complains of, we have already seen how well they were bestowed; the Empire had been harrassed by their continual Incursions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since the time of <hi>Valens,</hi> and they were so very numerous, that it was an endless work to destroy them; so that as fast as one Army was cut off, another was pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in. And therefore the Emperor takes a
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:63060:268"/>
wiser course to divide them among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to supply both Parties with Money to destroy each other: And he managed them with that Art and Vigor, that the <hi>Huns</hi> themselves left not the very name of their own Nation, by which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice the Empire was deliver'd from its greatest Plague to all future Ages. Now can any Man be so disingenuous as to cry out here, what need of this Expence; or can any Man assign me an Instance of Money better laid out for the good of the Common-Wealth, than to destroy so great an Enemy for ever without the loss of a Subject? And therefore though the People of <hi>Constantinople</hi> at first mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd against it, to see the <hi>Barbarians</hi> depart loaded with so much Wealth, yet when they saw the Event, they could not enough praise and admire the Emperor's great Conduct and Wisdom.</p>

They say nothing of his being cut in pieces, but only that he was kill'd with seaven Wounds; Nothing of his Bodies being begg'd by the Empress <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia,</hi> but that it was buried by <hi>Phillis</hi> the Chamber-Maid, nothing of her ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a Statue as a Monument of the barbarous Cruelty of the Conspirators, but that she her self was the head and Contriver of the whole Conspiracy. Where then this barbarous Writer could pick up the Fable, I cannot divine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be that he lived in an Age, when it was the fashion to debauch all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient History with Fable and Romance.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:63060:270"/>
But all this, says <hi>Alemannus,</hi> detracts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the truth of the <hi>Procopian</hi> report, because the Ancients do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it. But all this, say I, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates it to be a palpable false-hood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do nothing but contradict it. Yet however (he says) the thing is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved by the brazen Statue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Authors own time. But this pieces exactly with all the rest of the story, for there never was any such Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue seen before or since. And yet such a remarkable thing could never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped the observation of other Writers if it had continued so long a time in so eminent a place. So that the Statue is so far from proving the rest, that it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it self, and only proves that the Founder of the Tale lived in a barbarous Age, when Men scribled any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being accountable for the truth of their Reports. But beside all this 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely and becoming <hi>Romantick</hi> tale, that when a Man has been hewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and chopt to bits, they should again be so pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together, that from thence any Man should be so subtile-sighted as to discern the exact shape of his Body and Features of his Face. And yet that we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in this story of the great resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Justinian.</hi>

Though when all is done we are still har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon the burden of <hi>Don John,</hi> for if we compare their several descriptions, as they are drawn by <hi>Suetonius</hi> and our pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Procopius, Domitian</hi> was a very tall and a very fat man, but <hi>Justinian</hi> of a middle stature, and a moderate habit of body. But however if he resemble him not in shape, he did so in Rapine and Cruelty: as for example, he it was that was the first Prince that punish't Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks with temporal Penalties, Enacting <hi>Dracho</hi>'s Laws against those innocent <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, Montanists, Sabbatians, Arians, Nestorians, Manichees, Jews, Sodomites, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Astrologers,</hi> only to enrich himself by seizing the forfeitures of their Estates. This indeed is a Tragical Story, but so like the Author himself, that it would have been great pity if it had been omitted. And though it is more then enough confuted by the account, that I have given above of this Princes Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Laws, yet because the passage is of a remarkable strein, and so well stuft with lucky mistakes, I will be at the pains to transcribe it, to satisfie the Reader that it is impossible that it could ever have been written by any man that was not an utter stranger to all the Affairs of that Age. Thus then the black Tragedy
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:63060:271"/>
begins.
<q>There are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire divers Sects of Christians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Heresies, as <hi>Montanists, Sabatians,</hi> and several others that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned the People. All these he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to quit their own Sentiments, threatning the obstinate among other Penalties with the great punishment of <hi>Intestability.</hi> In the Temples of these Hereticks, especially those of the <hi>Arian</hi> Sect were treasured up incredible heaps of Wealth: so that neither the whole Senate it self, nor any other eminent Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with these Churches for abundance of Wealth and Riches. All their Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and Ornaments were of Gold, Silver and precious Stones of value not to be estimated and number not to be computed, beside vast Purchases and Estates in all parts of the World; no Prince having ever before this time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them any disturbance; so that they were able to relieve and maintain out of their common stock great numbers of the Orthodox Christians. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of these wealthy Churches were seized on and made a Prey to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to the utter undoing of vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Subjects. And his Officers prowling up and down into all parts,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:63060:271"/>
forced upon all Men the change of the Religion, in which they were educated. The Countrey People thought this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition too oppressive, and from that thought proceed to think of making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance against it, but are sacrificed by the Imperial Inquisitors: Others out of superstitious madness cut their own Throats, and vast numbers deserted their native Countrey. The followers of <hi>Montanus</hi> in <hi>Phrygia</hi> locking up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Churches, set fire on them and perisht together with them, and from this time forward there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be seen throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire but Slaughters and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations. And the same Law being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> it occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd wild Tumults in <hi>Palestine,</hi> but those of my Native City of <hi>Caesarea</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited themselves Christians, to escape the severity of the Laws, though some of the more honest sort proved real Converts. But the greater part dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to be hector'd out of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Fore-fathers, in meer spite rather than turn Christians, turn'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> Till at last the <hi>Boors</hi> rise in Arms against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and chose <hi>Julian</hi> the Son of <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> for their Leader, but after a long

and doubtful fight with the Imperial Forces are vanquisht and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral slain, there being, as 'tis credibly reported, no less than an hundred thousand Men slain in the Battel. The best Estates being thrown up by the Farmers, the Landlords, that were Christians, were the greatest Losers, who though they received no Rents were forced to pay heavy annual Taxes to the Emperor; that were exacted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy or abatement. This being done, in the next place he turns his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the Heathens, cutting their Throats and siezing their Estates, and they that counterfeited Christianity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to escape the fury of the Inquisition, were watch't so diligently, as some time or other to be snapt at their old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Rites and Sacrifices. How he treated the Christians we shall declare afterward. In the next place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Sodomy, punishing the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not from the date of the Law, but from any time before. And these he punisht, though none prosecuted, upon no other Evidence than the Testimony of a Boy or a Servant, and that extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, against his own Master. And those that were found Guilty were punisht with the loss of their Privy Members.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:63060:272"/>
Though at first this severity did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all, but only to the <hi>Prasini,</hi> and the Men of great Estates, or those that were cast out of favor. Then he was much offended with the Astrologers or Fortune-tellers, and upon that account disgracefully whipt divers grave and honest Men through the City. Upon all which accounts vast crowds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple betook themselves not only to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but to the farthest distant Countries. So that in every City you might observe Strangers, that were fled from home, to hide and shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if their own Country had been laid wast by some commmon Enemy.</q>
How <hi>Justinian</hi>'s reign was all ruin and desolation to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire we have seen above; so that when he recover'd those two great branches of it, <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> from the barbarous People, that great reckoning is discounted as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Destruction. But now he cannot so much as punish an Heretick, no not a Sodomite without the same subversion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. As for the Laws themselves in general, and the wisdom of enacting them, and the good effect of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in execution, they are able to justifie themselves against such mean and impotent Cavils. And I know not how
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:63060:273"/>
this Author could more have betrayed his folly, malice and ignorance than by bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming such wise, such useful and such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Laws to that height of aggravation, as if to punish <hi>Arians, Manichees, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> were of no less consequence than the subversion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And therefore at present I shall not trouble my self to answer a Cavil, that sinks and breaks by the weight of its own folly, but shall content my self with proving the Author of it a perfect stranger to the Records and Transactions of those times. For I pray what could have been contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more absurd than the story of the infinite Wealth of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks, by reason of that undisturbed Peace and Quiet, that they had injoyed under all former Emperors? When it is so unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably evident that the Sect was long before that time so reduced by the severity of former Emperors, that by that time it had scarce any thing left but the name within the Empire. And for this reason he never enacted any particular Rescripts against them, nor, as I remember, makes so much as any mention of them, unless in those general declarations of his Faith, in which he enters his Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the Heresies, that either then were or ever had been: So unfortunate
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:63060:273"/>
is this barbarous Writer in this Tale of the infinite Wealth of the <hi>Arians.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the strange dexterity of the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Librarian</hi> at an excuse, <hi>Procopius,</hi> he says, does not deny that the <hi>Arians</hi> were prosecuted by former Emperors, but that they were not so publickly fin'd in all Cities, but rather punisht only as it were by stealth and upon certain occasions. But I say <hi>Procopius</hi> here says, as plainly as words can express, that they were not punisht at all, and therefore when <hi>Alemannus</hi> says that he does not say it, for civility sake, I will say no more than that he says an untruth. Nay it is not only destitute of, but contrary to the most known and undoubted truth it self, when the former Emperors pursued them with that rigour and severity, that if <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> had design'd to set up an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, he would have wanted Objects to vent his Cruelty upon. There were only a few stragling <hi>Goths</hi> of that Sect at that time, and these were particularly excepted out of the first Commission for prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other Hereticks: so ill a Botcher is our <hi>Vatican</hi> Commentator at patching up Apologies.</p>
               <p>But though he has every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his want of Skill, yet he has no where fail'd more unfortunately than in
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:63060:274"/>
this Paragraph, composed of no other materials than Excuses, that apparently contradict the Author's on sense. Thus when the Author says, that none of the former Emperors ever inflicted any Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at all upon Hereticks, the meaning of that, says he, is not that he did not inflict any at all, but not so much. And now again when the Author blames <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> for the attempt it self: <hi>No, no,</hi> says <hi>Alemannus, he only blames him for the wrong manner of putting it in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But this is a direct Affront to the Author's own Words, for though he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward indeavors to aggravate the folly of the Design by its ill consequences, yet his first and main displeasure is vented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Design it self, as absurd, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and without Precedent, as is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably evident from the passage it self. But still his hardest task is to bring off his Author from his angry Censure of the Laws against <hi>Sodomy</hi>; for which he has no better defence than that <hi>Theophanes</hi> thought they were too severe, so that himself could not but detest them. And yet <hi>Theophanes</hi> says no such thing, but only that they were severely punisht, without any intimation of dislike, much lesss of abhorrence. <hi>But it was executed upon two</hi> Thracian <hi>Bishops to the great
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:63060:274"/>
scandal of the Church, whereas</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>the Great would rather have cover'd them in the Fact with his Imperial Robe.</hi> That was a great Complement of that great Emperor, and 'tis likely enough, that if the Crime had been known to himself alone, such was his generous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he would never have divulged it. But that was not <hi>Justinian</hi>'s case, for the Crime was become publick before it came to his knowledg, and after that, it had been a Scandal with a witness to let it pass unpunisht. But that after all, is the thing, that gauls at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Secular Prince should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any Power to correct Ecclesiastical Persons, which though it has long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as an unquestionable Rule in that Court, yet I have proved through the whole series of this History, that it was both claim'd by all the Emperors, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by all the Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. But beside, as for this story of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> concerning the two Bishops, by my Rules of critick Law, I must pass it for meer fable, because destitute of timely and sufficient Testimony. For so I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but esteem the Reports of all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that live at too great a distance of time from the matter of Fact. And that is the case of this little Story, there are no
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:63060:275"/>
foot-steps of any Record of it either in that or the next Ages, whereas <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> that was its first Founder, reports it not till above 250 years after it was done; and then what reason have we to believe him in a matter of Fact, that had been so many years beyond the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mankind, any more than if he had lived at twice the distance of time? For when a thing is once got out of the reach of the memory of Man, an hundred and a thousand years are the same thing. And then it is never to be admitted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny capacity of belief without some more credible and timely Records. And for that reason I have industriously negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all the latter Greek Historians, as to any matter of Fact done at any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable distance from their own Age. For if they are voucht by any more ancient Authority, that is proof enough without them; if they are not, their own is none at all. And the truth is they are so much addicted to the humor of patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fables to the ancient Records of the Church, that whatever we find in them not reported before them, we ought for that reason to conclude it meer Fable and Fiction. But in the last place, which way will he bring off his Author in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault with the severity of this Law,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:63060:275"/>
for reaching such as were Offenders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its publication?<note place="margin">141.</note> when the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it self to have been only enacted in pursuance of the known establisht Laws of the Empire, especially the famous Law of <hi>Constanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What a childish piece of malice then is it in this Author to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate, as if this Law had taken hold upon Offenders, at a time when there was no known Law against them? As for the Law against Astrologers, our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian</hi> has so much wit as not to touch it, and to leave his Author in the lurch to answer for himself. For these Men commonly call'd Astrologers, that is, such as profess to read all Mens Fates in the Stars, were ever lookt upon as the most mischievous and most dangerous Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Government: and any Man that has but cast an eye upon the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Story, cannot but know that there never was any one Act of Treason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived against the Prince's Life or Gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without their encouragement or direction: as in the present case <hi>Joannes Cappadox</hi> was put upon his Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Justinian</hi> by their instigation. And for this reason it was ever punisht with the greatest severity by all Princes, as well Heathen as Christian. Under the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:63060:276"/>
heathen Emperors down from <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, by banishment, under the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian from <hi>Constantine,</hi> by death. And yet this wretched Satyrist is so infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to inveigh against it as a new piece of Cruelty in <hi>Justinian,</hi> only for setting them in a disgraceful posture upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and so whipping them through the City, when by the Law they ought to have been executed.</p>
               <p>But upon occasion of this fierce cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the counterfeit <hi>Procopius</hi> upon the Emperor's prosecuting of Heathens and Hereticks, it is become a dispute what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the true <hi>Procopius</hi> adhered to, or whether to any at all. <hi>Alemannus</hi> will have him an Atheist; <hi>Rivius</hi> and <hi>Eiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> a bigotted <hi>Pagan,</hi> but they are both apparently too severe and equally in the wrong: when through all his Writings he expresses so high a sense of honor and kindness for the Christian Religion, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his last Books <hi>de Aedificiis,</hi> that are for the most part a Panegyrick upon <hi>Justinian</hi>'s great zeal to advance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Christian Faith. And let the Reader only peruse the first Book of that History, and he will soon be satisfied of the Author's own sense of Religion. But they say, that he was only a counterfeit Christian for Interest and Preferment.
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:63060:276"/>
But this they may say, if they please, of any Man as well as <hi>Procopius.</hi> But he has dropt some loose and slite Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Christian Religion, and both Parties instance in the passage out of his Books <hi>de Bello Gothico,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a great dislike of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies on foot at that time, that is, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heats about the <hi>tria Capitula.</hi> Which it is evident from his own description of them, that he did not in the least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, but supposed them to have been too curious and philosophical Inquiries into the Secrets of the divine Nature; whereas (he says) it is satisfaction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to him, that God Almighty go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the World with a wise and good Providence, and as for other more nice Speculations, every Man might for him, quietly enjoy his own Opinion. This though it be very false Politicks, as we have seen by the <hi>Henoticon,</hi> and our own late too dear bought Experience, yet it is neither <hi>Atheism</hi> nor <hi>Paganism</hi>; For a good and wise Providence that governs the World, is the only Principle opposed to <hi>Atheism</hi>; and though it may (thô very hardly) be consistent with philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick <hi>Paganism,</hi> yet it is the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of Christianity. Now the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, as he states it, was not between the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:63060:277"/>
two Religions, but about an Argument common to both, <hi>viz.</hi> as he supposed, the Nature of God, and like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he frankly declares his Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all bigottry in these nice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Controversies, and thinks that Men ought not to inquire farther into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature than the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Providence. This is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the sense of that offensive passage, though perhaps too loosly express't. And as for the Opinion it self, it has too long had too great a vogue amongst our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Statesmen, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is below the Wisdom of the State, to concern it self in Men's various fancies about Religion, but rather to leave them to the folly of their own Apprehensions: and this they suppose the best security of the Publick Peace, when every Man is indulged the liberty of his own little Conceit. But this is a very short-sighted Prospect only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the present, whereas if they would look home to the natural issue of the thing, it tears the Nation into impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Factions and Animosities. For it is certain the People will be zealous for their Religion, so that if they differ, it is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable but that they will quarrel, and hence it has ever come to pass that all Schisms in the Church have ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:63060:277"/>
in Factions in the State. So that here it is not material, Whether these Controversies are of any moment or not (as these Gentlemen would state the Matter) but the thing to be first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd is, Whether to indulge or suppress them be the most effectual way to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Publick Peace, the first may do it for a short time, but the last does it forever. For Men will not be over-fond of disputing with a Rod at their backs, and when they receive a lash for every <hi>Syllogism.</hi> This I take to be the true state of the Controversie about <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> that in this point he was (as too many great and wise Men have been) out in his Politicks, but not in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But in the last place, say they, he frequently makes use of the old <hi>Pagan</hi> terms and phrases, as Fortune, Fate, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, publick Genius, Omens, Oracles. He does so, but all learned Men know that these were long since become Terms of Art, and even vulgar expressions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that <hi>Procopius</hi> was an Orator, and familiarly conversant in all the Eloquence of the Ancients, and therefore it is no wonder that he endeavour'd to imitate their Stile in familiar Phrases and forms of Expression. Though after all he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used them in their proper sense, but
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:63060:278"/>
by way of Metaphor and Allusion with a <hi>quas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in their meaning, as they have ever been used in all Ages, and are so to this day. And therefore as we find that <hi>Procopius</hi> has ever express't great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Christian Faith, so we have no reason from any thing, that occurs in his Writings to suspect his sincerity in it.</p>
               <p>But what though there were no cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in executing the Laws against Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and what if <hi>Justinian</hi>'s practice was warranted by the Precedents of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, yet they spoil'd not a good work as he did, by doing it meerly for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness. For that, says our ingenuous Author and his more ingenuous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, was the only thing that set him upon the Project to squeeze all their Estates into his own Coffers. This at best is no better than ill-natur'd surmise, and betrays the malignity of the Man, for how can he look into any other Man's secret Intentions? and if he cannot, to pass such sowr judgment upon them, can proceed from nothing but Malice and Ill-will. But as ill-luck will have it here too, the matter of Fact it self lyes cross to his ill-nature: for whereas most of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors siezed the Fines and Forfeitures into their own Exchequer, <hi>Justinian</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles

them upon the Church; thus when in the leading Law of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> all Churches of Hereticks, and all Goods and Endowments belonging to them, are confiscated or forfeited <hi>fisco nostro</hi> to our Exchequer, in the same Law, as 'tis recited in the <hi>Justinian Code,</hi> instead of <hi>Fisco Nostro</hi> we read <hi>Ecclesiae Catholicae, i. e.</hi> they are forfeited to the use of the Catholick Churches. So little design of Covetousness had this great Emperor in his zeal against Hereticks, that he remitted the Forfeitures due to himself by Law, and settled them upon pious and charitable uses. So that in all particulars our Author might better have vented his poison and ill-nature upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man than <hi>Justinian</hi>; who of all the great Men that ever lived will the least endure to be abused. But because his Covetousness is aggravated in every page of the Libel as a most insatiable gulf, so that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not sufficient to supply its cravings, though he used all the ways of Rapin and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to fill his Exchequer, I will shew in two or three Instances that he was so far from laying new Burthens upon the Subject, that he took off old, settled and legal Taxes of mighty value to himself, only because he thought them too hard
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:63060:279"/>
and heavy upon his Subjects. The first was the <hi>Lex Papia,</hi> and all the Branches of the Law <hi>de Caducis</hi> added to it, by which if a man had no Heirs of his own begetting, or if the next Heirs died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Actual Livery and Seisin of the Estate, all such Estates came to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown, which in so vast an Empire could not but arise to a Prodigious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and yet he abrogated all these Laws for the ease of his Subjects, as he declares in the Preface to his own Law.
<q>Such is our Clemency, that though all <hi>Bona Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> are due to our Exchequer, yet are we pleased to remit them all, notwithstanding our Royal Prerogative; preferring the common benefit of our good Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own private Advantage, &amp; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Interest to be most our own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second Law was that of the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio Bonorum</hi> or the Sale of the Goods and Chattels of all sorts of Malefactors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Executed, Out-lawed, or Banished; and that was a greater Revenue than the former, and yet because it lookt harsh to this just and tender Prince, he takes it quite away, and setles all forfeited Estates upon the next of Kin. The third was that old and standing Practice of the Sale of all Offices, by which the Emperor had a certain Sum; not for the Office, but
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:63060:279"/>
his <hi>Suffrage,</hi> in the same manner as if one should purchase a Bishoprick by buying a <hi>Conjedelire.</hi> But this corrupt Custom he scorns, and cashieres it as a base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prince-like practice,
<q>Because (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it) Justice we know will be done, if we can any way oblige our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Governors of Provinces to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Justice with clean hands, abstain from Bribery, and be content with their Pensions out of the Exchequer. But this cannot otherways be brought about, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they may enter upon their places without charge, giving nothing to the Prince upon pretence of Suffrage, or to any other Officer whatsoever. For we are well aware that though it lops off too great a branch of our Revenue, yet it will redound to the unspeakable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our good Subjects, to be preserved from the oppression of our Officers, and both the Empire and the Exchequer will flourish the more by a thriving People. And if this Rule were once setled, it is unimaginable of what advantage it would be to the publick.</q>
Now is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this Prince who cancell'd all these Laws, though not unjust in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, only because he thought them somewhat too harsh and heavy, should rob, plunder, and undo vast Multitudes

               <p>But there remains one Enquiry, that is so obvious for the Reader to make, from what friends he could have Supplies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray all the Charges of his expensive Reign, how he could maintain so many and so great Wars? How he could build such vast numbers of Cities and infinite other structures? how he could maintain so many and so chargeable Corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? This at first view seems very strange, but the account being well stated, it will not appear so strange as easie. For first he was a very great Husband, and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing in Luxury, the great Pane of Princes Courts. In the next place he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench't all the exorbitant Expences of the Theatres and publick shews, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor often complains. Thirdly, the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revenue and ordinary Taxes of so vast an Empire, as they were of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense value, so were they frugally man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged and expended. But that which makes the wonder quite to vanish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the infinite Treasures taken in his Wars from the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> that had plundered all <hi>Europe,</hi> and laid all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

This Charge, if it were true, is very mean and childish: for what if he were too desirous of Glory, that is a Passion incident to all great Men, and is in it self a natural effect of Greatness of Mind? and therefore to aggravate a Fancy so common to all great Men, as a singular Enormity in <hi>Justinian,</hi> is a piece of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice only to be despised.

In short whatever Alterations he made in the State of the Empire, he always gives an account of the usefulness and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing in the Preface to the Law. And therefore if <hi>Alemannus</hi> would have made any real advantage of his Authors Tale, instead of relying wholly upon its blind Authority, he ought to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Justinian</hi>'s reasons of State; for otherwise they stand upon Record as a Conviction against his Author, that the Emperor made no Alterations without good reason. But he inscribed his own Name upon all things, says our Author, <hi>i. e.</hi> says <hi>Alemannus,</hi> upon Cities, Towns, Ports, Letters, Books, Scholars, Crowns, Magistrates, Military Officers; such, says he, was his excessive thirst after vain-glory. But if this be a Vice, it would be happy for Mankind, if all Princes were tainted with the same Itch of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Name and a good Memory behind them. If he had done (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Men have) ill things to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate his Fame, that had not been more a crime than a folly. But when all his Works were for the benefit of Mankind, then if they were call'd after

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, they say, built 12 great Cities, and was God-father to them all.

And as for this story of plundering his Subjects, in illegal ways to enrich himself, it is as consistent as all the other Fables, when he remitted so many great branches of his settled Revenue, only to ease and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his Subjects, as we have seen above in his abolishing the <hi>Lex Papia,</hi> and all the Laws <hi>de caducis.</hi> What a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the nature of things is this, that he should so frankly give up such vast proportions of his lawful Revenue, and yet out of a meer covetous humor turn Pick-pocket, and enrich himself by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate pilfering. This story is so remote from so cross to the common sense of Mankind, and the practice of Humane Nature, that it interdicts its own belief: For it is impossible in the nature of things that the same Man, who did one, could ever be induced to do the other. And thus this Calumny, as well as all the rest only enhances the glory of <hi>Justinian</hi>; who was so far from cheating his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Estates and Inheritances, that of all Princes he took the greatest care to secure their Rights. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

the practice of the Laws had been a long time corrupted with tricks and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties for the advantage of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, he cut them all off, and made such wise and strict Rules concerning Wills and Testaments, as secured the right Heir of his Estate against all Pretenders, but most of all against the Crown it self, abrogating all manner of Forfeitures to it. And in truth there are no greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Justice and clear dealing than his Laws <hi>de Testamentis</hi>: he has done the utmost that Man can do to prevent Frauds, and if the practice of the Courts were re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now 'tis hugely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that this very Man, who dealt so very fairly with the World in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that was so solicitous to secure every Man's right, and that for that end out off such vast Revenues from himself, should be so bereft of common Sense, as to go

               <p>Especially if we reflect upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable numbers of opprest Persons that this Author is able to muster up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his reign, only eight, and 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credible that he should for-go the vast profit that came without envy or regret from the Laws <hi>de caducis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not make them, but found them in force from his Predecessors, and yet incur the hatred of his Subjects by such a mean oppression, and in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the other of no value at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what were these eight Mens Estates, how great soever, if compared to the infinite Forfeitures throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? The absurdity of every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance in the Tale stares the Author of it in the face: but most of all when by these eight Persons he would prove that this was his constant practice all the World over. And of these eight he gives us only the names of five without any circumstance of matter of Fact, and in the other three he sets down the Story
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:63060:287"/>
so perversely, as to make one part of the same Tale a flat contradiction to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first is the story of <hi>Zeno,</hi> whom he on purpose sent Governor into <hi>Egypt,</hi> who loading a Ship with a vast treasury of Gold, Silver and precious Stones, that was to follow him, <hi>Justinian</hi> prevails with some of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s best friends to cast all the Goods over-board in the Haven of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and then to fire the Ship, and make <hi>Zeno</hi> believe that all the Goods perisht in it, who dying not long after the Emperor siezed all his Goods by vertue of a forged Will, as 'tis reported. This as 'tis reported is a very saint end for an Accusation, for if it have no other proof but report, then it is a Tale without a Witness, and that is meer Tale. But beside this, as Dr. <hi>Rive</hi> ingeniously replies, were I to plead this Cause before a Court of Judicature I should not doubt to make out by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of clear and pregnant Proofs, that the Tale it self could never have dropt from the Mouth, I will not say of a learned or skilful Accuser, but of any Man of common Sense. For stories ought to be like Pictures, if not true yet at least probable, but this is all defyance to the very possibility of things. That so great a Treasure should be cast away so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:63060:287"/>
in the most frequented Port in the World, that neither the Master of the Ship, nor the Sea-men, nor the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor the Servants should perceive it, no not any of his own Servants that he left on board to see the Goods conveyed. But when he had got the Goods into his own Possession by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, what need had he to entitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them by a forged Will? The fire gave him full possession of all, because the Estate was supposed to be lost, but after that to produce a Will to a lost Estate is only to betray the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So great an improbability suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by so weak a foundation as meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, must needs sink into nothing of its own accord. The next Instance is <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> a wealthy Man, who dying in the Garrison of <hi>Daras,</hi> the Governor forged a Will, by which the whole Estate was left to the Emperor. But if another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Will ar so great a distance (for <hi>Daras</hi> was the last Town of the Empire upon the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi>) what is that to the Emperor, how can any Man say that he was privy to it? But if you say 'tis likely. I think it is more likely, than that the Governor should contrive it meerly for the Emperor's profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

any advantage to himself, if he had given himself any share in the Estate or any good Legacy, the thing might have past, but to make no advantage of it to himself, when it was wholly in his own power, is a thing not credible of a Knave, nor indeed of any Man; nothing more certain than that saying, <hi>Nemo gratuitò fit improbus.</hi>

Happy is the Man that can be fond of such a pleasant Historian. And yet <hi>Alemannus</hi> is in so good humour, as not only to believe it all, but to adorn it with large and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commentaries. Never was Author and Commentator better met. It is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but he should have written Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Legend of St. <hi>Silvester,</hi> and the Dragon, that his Predecessor <hi>Baronius</hi> sets up as the best account of the Reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> against all the Records both of the Church and the Empire. Into such absurdities will fanatick Zeal drive the wisest and most learned Men. But above all the rest, his grave Apology to justifie this <hi>prudentissimus Scriptor</hi> (as he stiles him) in his folly, is most pleasant, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a common Form of Speech in all Authors prophane and sacred, to give the title of Devil to Men eminently

wicked, as our Saviour calls <hi>Judas</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. That any Mans understanding should be sunk so low, as to satisfie it self with such trifles as these. When the wise Author says expresly, That he was no Metaphorical Devil, but a Devil in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Son of a Devil in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. And there if his learned Advocate cannot prevail with himself to believe it, notwithstanding his excuse he leaves his wise Author in the lurch to answer for the possibility of his Legend.

The crafty <hi>Augustus,</hi> as demurely as he look't, and as severe Laws as he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, was publickly known to have been one of the most notorious Sinners of the Age. But as for <hi>Justinian,</hi> as he was more severe in his Laws against this Vice, than any of his Predecessors, so he was never charged with any one Breach of them. The Wife, the Daughter, the Servant that he debaucht, are to this day nameless. Whose Bed did he ever defile, whose Modesty did he ever attempt? was he ever so much as suspected of Love to any but his Empress? What rudeness then, what Malice, what Impudence is it in this Scribler to cast dirt upon such an eminent and unblemisht Chastity, without so much as attempting to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any one proof or example of it?
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:63060:290"/>
and that alone is a demonstration of its falshood, for if he could have charged him with any one Fact, we know he owed him not so much kindness as to conceal it. But as he introduces the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, he makes it more absurd, <hi>viz.</hi> That though he were very much given to fasting and watching, yet he was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for Lust. These things hang very well together, a man much given all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to watching and fasting, and yet the very <hi>Priapus</hi> of the Age, an insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Satyr,</hi> and exceeding the natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Makind in Lust. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fair contradiction, and as consistent as his being black and white, tall and low, prodigal and covetous, an Ass and a Fox, a natural Fool and a crafty Knave, so blind a thing is Malice when it is over eager in the pursuit of its rage.</p>
               <p>The next Twins of Vertue are his great kindness to, and great oppression of the Orthodox Christian Clergy. His favour to them was so exorbitant,<note place="margin">

And so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous was his Piety that he Committed all his Rapins to enrich and endow the
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:63060:290"/>
Christian Churches, though but just now they were all swept into his own Coffers. But with what cruelty he opprest the Christian Clergy the Author has several times promised to relate, but it seems ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Treacherous Memory, as we find by the inconsistencies of his Tale, he at last forgot it, notwithstanding he has so often rubb'd it up in <hi>Cap.</hi> 10, 11, 26, 27. An ill Memory (they say) is very inconvenient for some sort of men, but a false one is very useful, it is an easie matter to excuse any ill-natur'd Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under pretence of forgetfulness, and as easie to stab any innocent mans reputation only by suggesting some vile thing of him, as by broad direct slander. But here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our <hi>Vatican</hi> Apologist at his old knack of excuse-making. His Author, he says, had it all the while in his head, but unluckily forgot to let it out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no doubt, the hard usage of the Popes <hi>Silverius</hi> and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Bishops in the Contest about the <hi>tria Capitula.</hi> This excuse Dr. <hi>Rive</hi> caps with this Story, of a <hi>Jockey</hi> not less hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a forgetful Memory, who putting a Pad-Nag into a Friends hands upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, after the Bargain was ended, the Buyer seriously ask't him (as the Custom is) what faults he had, to which

Just such is the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Author in declaring <hi>Justinian</hi>'s faults and offences amongst the Clergy, he would have told what strange havock he made amongst them, but that as often as he came to mention it, it flipt out of his Memory. Of all his faults this was the greatest, it added Sacriledge to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; his hard usage of other Sects is capable of a defence; but for a Prince to rob and trample down his own Clergy, 'tis the height of Barbarity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to leave it out in the Description of his Vices is the exact Story of the blind Horse. But he intended the ill usage of Pope <hi>Silverius, Vigilius,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bishops in the Controversie of the <hi>tria Capitula.</hi>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:63060:291"/>

But however I have already discoursed both that, and the Case of <hi>Silverius</hi> and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and that will be answer enough to <hi>Aleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his foul surmise of their barbarous treatment. Only I would advise him and the <hi>Roman</hi> Courtiers once more not to concern the Apostolick Chair in the Vindication of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but rather to thrust him out of the List into the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the <hi>Anti Popes,</hi> both because it is confest on all hands that he got into the Chair by Usurpation, when it was full already; and because his Actions were so foul, that no Wit, no Apology, no Candour can wipe off the Scandal. As for the Reverse of this Calumny, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors exorbitant kindness and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Christian Clergy, I must confess it was very great to a degree of fondness; we have seen above in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels what Endowments and Priviledges he setled upon the Church, what care he took to secure their setled Revenues, and to protect them against the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great men. But that he ever run into any Act of Injustice out of Zeal
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:63060:292"/>
and partiality to their Interest, we have no one Instance upon Record, the only thing that can be pretended is his Grant to the Church of <hi>Emesa,</hi> of the Prescription of an hundred years, which as this Author tells the Story,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 28.</note> was a very lewd act of Fraud and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, but then the cheat was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperor, as well as upon the Subjects that suffer'd by it. It is this, one <hi>Mammianus,</hi> a Man of a noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vast Wealth, had long before made the Church of <hi>Emesa</hi> his Heir. But it hapned that under <hi>Justinian</hi> one <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was imployed to take the <hi>census</hi> of the Families of that City; who being dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous at imitating other Mens hands, and diligently observing the hands of some of the Ancestors of some of the most wealthy Families, he draws upon them Bills and Bonds for great sums of Money to <hi>Mammianus,</hi> these he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to the Procurators of the Church, but because the Law of only 30 years prescription lay against them; they repair to the Emperor to relieve them in so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and charitable a Suit, and he being satisfied with the piety of the Case is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prevailed upon to grant to them and all other Churches a power of looking back to 100 years, whereas before 30
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:63060:292"/>
years prescription was a legal Bar to any claim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon this they put all their counterfeit Bonds in suit to the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the best Families in the City. But <hi>Longinus</hi> a wise and an honest Man that the Emperor sent thither with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commission to be Judg in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cause, suspecting some cheat by the vast Sums of Money that were chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, he therefore takes <hi>Priscus</hi> to task, commands him to bring in all his Bonds, but he refusing it, because that would put an end to the Plot he in a rage beats him, who upon it fearing that he had discover'd his Cheat, confesses all; and the Emperor being inform'd of it, and finding by this example the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this Law, that there would be no stopping of Frauds in behalf of the Church-Estates if they might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to claim against so many years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, he repeals it, and because he would not utterly spoil his Courtesie, he takes it down from an hundred to forty years, and that was ten years more than any other Plaintiff was allowed. Now which way can the Emperor be blamed in all this Transaction, he had no ground to suspect the imposture, and then it was evident that great sums due to the Church had been basely embezel'd, and
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:63060:293"/>
to prevent such Abuses for the time to come he takes off the usual limits of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in Pleas of this Nature. And yet this impudent Libeller is so foolishly malicious, as contrary to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his own story, to insinuate, as if the Emperor himself were privy to the design. Which if he were, how durst <hi>Longinus</hi> have so disgracefully exposed it, who if his Master had any such Plot must have been privy to it, because without him it could not be managed? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he so rudely spoil'd it, that shews both his own and his Masters ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of it, and he was so far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring his displeasure, that he was not long after advanced to the Prefecture of the City: If we may trust our Author, for otherwise I find no such Man as <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> in all <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Reign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but suspect the whole story to be meer fiction. But granting its truth, the Emperor is innocent, and when our Author suggests that he was privy to it, he ought to have told us how himself came to know the Secret, and so indeed he ought to have done through his whole history, but to tell us that such prodigious things were done in the dark and with great secresie, and give us no account how he came to know them, is
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:63060:293"/>
but a very poor way of vouching for an history. These are the grand Articles of this Libel against this great Prince, for the following Chapters are little else than the same Rhapsody repeted, and things are heaped together so confusedly, so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art and decency, as plainly proves, that so elegant a Writer as <hi>Procopius</hi> could never have writ it, but that the true Author was some unpolisht and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Barbarian.</hi>

Is this stuff to put into an indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? can you think to beat down the Emperors towring reputation by such Tales as these? you had been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advised, when you first found your <hi>Vatican</hi> Manuscript, instead of publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the World with so much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Revenge upon the Emperor, to have buried it in some secret Corner, where it should never have been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, for now you have only brought down reproach and disgrace upon your own head by opposing such a barbarous Pamphlet to the Glory of all his Actions, and have withal provoked more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men to revive the Memory of his great Name, and make the unparallel'd Actions of his Reign though 1100 years old, shine as bright and look as fresh, as if they had been the Wonders and mighty Works of our own Age. But however if the Emperor had an ill Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to bring these Miseries upon the World, I am sure he had a good one too to make amends, and what breaches the one made upon any part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the other repair'd, and left it not

This was a Law highly useful to the Common-Wealth, for it not only cured the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sort of People of their silken Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it stopt a great Revenue that went annually out of the Empire into the Enemies Country, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Persians.</hi> And to prevent that Mischief for the time to come,<note place="margin">

               <p>But he set up two new Officers in the City,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 20.</note> because the old Magistrates were not enough to execute his Rapine and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:63060:295"/>
Cruelty. One was call'd the Praetor of the People, to prevent Fires and punish Burglaries; the other Quaestor, to make inquiry after <hi>Sodomy,</hi> Adulteries and false Religions. What then! were not these useful Offices in the Common-Wealth? If they were, what malice is it in this Author to impute the design of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution meerly to Rapine? But still his Ignorance keeps pace with his Malice; for the Praetor was no new Office, but as ancient as <hi>Augustus,</hi> and by him sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Praefect of the Watch, but <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> will have him go by the name of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, because that was the most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Title for all Offices among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romans</hi>; and this Restitution of that old Word, this ignorant Writer every where mistakes for the institution of a new Office. But as for the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Questor, for punishing the Vices mention'd, it is but another fair cast of his ignorance, for there is no such thing extant in the whole body of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Law, nor any where else. There was indeed the Office of a Quaestor to find out lazy People that would follow no Imployment, and force them to work. This Office, this barbarous Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ignorantly ascribes to the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Vices: so utterly unacquainted is
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:63060:296"/>
he with the true State of Affairs at that time. But he put unfit Men into that great trust of City Quaestor, to the great oppression of his Subjects, as <hi>Tribonian, Junilus</hi> and <hi>Constantinus.</hi> But of his great care in the choice of his Officers we have discoursed above, and if among so great a number of good ones, some few proved corrupt, that is a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune not to be avoided in this World. Though this is all Tale, for <hi>Tribonian</hi> was admired for all his Vertues and good Qualities, only he loved Money too well. <hi>Junilus</hi> is a Man never heard of but in this Author, and it is likely that he should be in so great an Office as this, seven years, and never be so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in any Record, no, not in one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Rescript. To him succeeds <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus</hi> a very young Man, not yet so much as call'd to the Bar. But this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all the rest: For <hi>Constantinus</hi> was Secretary of State, and one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for compiling the Code in the third year of <hi>Justinian,</hi> whereas <hi>Tribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> injoyed the Prefects Office many years to his dying day, which <hi>Alemannus</hi> computes to be in the 21<hi>st</hi> year of that Reign; to him succeeds <hi>Junilus,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the Office seven years; now if <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus,</hi> who followed both, were so
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:63060:296"/>
young a Man, that he was not of age to practise the Law, I would only know of the unlearned Author and his learned Commentator, of what Age he might be in the third year of <hi>Justinian,</hi> when he was Secretary of State, and so eminent for his Skill in the Law, that he was made one of the Commissioners for its Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>But beside the old Revenue of the Crown he imposed a new heavy Tax commonly call'd the <hi>Aerial</hi> Tribute,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.</note> as if it dropt out of the Air, coming neither from Law nor Custom, this was colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Praefecti Praetorio,</hi> and that they might squeeze his Subjects to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he put the worst Men into that Office, and when they had enricht them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by oppression, he siezed all their Wealth into his own Coffers. This is pure Romance, for there is not the least mention of any such Tribute in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Author or Record, and though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemannus</hi> (as himself declares) searcht all the <hi>Vatican</hi> Manuscripts in quest of it, yet he could never trace any Foot-steps of it in Antiquity. And it is very likely that such a singular Oppression should pass so unobserved in such a writing Age, as never to be so much as suggested by any Author but this <hi>Barbarian.</hi> And as
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:63060:297"/>
for the <hi>Praefecti Praetorio,</hi> that belongs to the old Topick of corrupt Officers and Ministers of State, and therefore needs no particular Answer, and though <hi>Alemannus</hi> reckons up 17 or 18 in his reign, yet he can find no more ill Men than <hi>Joannes Cappadox, Petrus Barsames</hi> and <hi>Addaeus,</hi> who was put into the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the last year of the Emperor's life, when he was past business. Though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these he says there are divers others to be found in <hi>Evagrius, Agathias, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> his other Books, <hi>Theophanes</hi> and <hi>Suidas.</hi> That is his standing figure when he has reckoned up all the names that he can rake together, to tell us of great numbers of People that shall be nameless. And whereas the Author adds, that it was the Emperor's constant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to drain these great Officers, when they were well gorged, by some sham-Accusation; it is so far from truth that he never prosecuted any of them but <hi>Joannes Cappadox,</hi> and when he put him from Court, he suffer'd him to carry his Wealth along with him.</p>
               <p>But he oppressed the honest labouring Farmers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.</note> As how? why first by never remitting their customary Tribute. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, but if it were due by Custom, then it could be no oppression. And if
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:63060:297"/>
it be thought to be too hard upon the Subject, yet I find that the ablest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were most averse to the abatement of their Land-Taxes, and there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peremptory Rescripts against it, and therefore if <hi>Justinian</hi> were so too, he might justifie himself by the Examples of some of his wisest Predecessors, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considering the vast Expences of his Wars, and that a great part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire paid Contributions to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And yet the suggestion is as false as foolish, when he remitted the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Taxes to the Inhabitants of <hi>Palestine</hi> upon the Insurrection of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and made two Christian Bishops his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors and Judges to determine what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement was fit and reasonable. And in the great Plague at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Bello Goth. l.</hi> 2.</note> in which the Rich were reduced to the same state with the Poor, their Servants and Attendants being swept away, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points an Officer to take care of all the sick, and to supply all that wanted, with Money, and that was a greater kindness than meer abatement of just dues. But secondly he imposed the Corn-Tax for the maintenance of his Army, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the poor countrey People to carry it to the Camp. But alass, this was an old Tax long before <hi>Justinian</hi>'s time, and
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:63060:298"/>
there are so many Laws about it in the Imperial History, that nothing but meer barbarous Ignorance could have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its beginning from <hi>Justinian</hi>; and accordingly <hi>Alemannus</hi> has voucht it by the Authority of that Ecclesiastick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 24.</note> In the next place the Souldiers were opprest, and that divers ways, first he set Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Masters over them, and deducted the 12<hi>th</hi> part of every Souldier's Pay for their Salary. This is pure igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for that Office was ever in the Army, and its Salary settled without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deduction from the Souldiers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his 130 Novel. Secondly the Companies were not full, that is a common Fault, but then it was the fault of the Officers not the Emperor, who allowed them full Pay, and then the surplusage of the vacant Places came into their own Pockets. Thirdly he dismist his old Souldiers without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Provision for them. This is likely that he should so wholly neglect them, when he built so many Hospitals for the maintenance of Aged People, in which it is not to be doubted but his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-annuated Souldiers that had been useful to the Common-Wealth, were preferr'd in the first place. Fourthly he
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:63060:298"/>
left the Frontiers every where unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As we may see by those innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Garrisons and Fortifications that he built round the Empire, to keep out the Incursions of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It is pretty observable that when in the whole list of Emperors there were three very eminent for guarding the Frontiers, that is <hi>Constantine, Theodosius</hi> the Great, and <hi>Justinian,</hi> that these should be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly branded for leaving them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless. It is the head-topick of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus</hi> his fanatick Invectives against <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great, and here it is the very Chorus of all our Rhapsodists mournful Ditties. And yet there was scarce a Garrison upon the Frontiers, that was not built by one of these Princes, though <hi>Justinian</hi> stopt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Passage and In-road so advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, that he made the whole Empire but one entire Fortification to it self. Fifthly from those of the Militia, that refused to go to the Wars he with-drew their Pay. An heavy Oppression this not to reward idle People, that refuse to serve their Country. Sixthly he defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Guards of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay. But why? because, says our Author, they were use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. But if they were, they deserved no Pay. Lastly he with-drew the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quennial
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:63060:299"/>
Donative. If he did, first to with-hold a Gift is no Robbery, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he did wisely not to dispense his Rewards promiscuously, but according to Mens deserts, and to this purpose he created a new Officer call'd Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quaestor of the Army, to reward such as did any signal piece of Service, and his Donatives being great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it made every Souldier forward to signalize himself.</p>
               <p>In the next place he opprest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 25.</note> and spoil'd the freedom of Trade. That is to say, when he had built that convenient Port at <hi>Constantinople</hi> that commanded the Haven, he took an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all Ships out-ward bound, that they might not export the Commodities of the Empire, but especially Arms to its barbarous Enemies. That is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grievance of this Complaint, the next is the regulation of the silk-trade from <hi>Persia,</hi> which we have discoursed above.</p>
               <p>The next that were undone were the Lawyers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 26.</note> by lessening their Fees and shortning their Proceedings. Then it seems their Fees were grown too high, and their Proceedings too dilatory, and then it was a great kindness to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to reform them. Though Dr. <hi>Rive</hi> is my Author, that before <hi>Justinian</hi>'s time
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:63060:299"/>
the Lawyers never received any Fees from the Client, but were maintain'd by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from the publick. But he supprest the very Physitians and Professors of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>i. e.</hi> because he enacted so many kind Laws on their behalf under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>de Medicis et Professoribus.</hi> But then he abolisht the old <hi>Circensian</hi> Games and all the other Heathen sports for ever. Then he made a Reformation, that all good Men had ever desired from the first settlement of Christianity in the World. Lastly he opprest the Poor. As appears by those prodigious Provisions that he made, that there should be no such thing as Poverty within the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but for the Readers satisfaction or rather amazement in this matter, I must refer him to the Books <hi>de Aedificiis.</hi> And now I hope I have sufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the Reputation of this matchless Prince against all the malicious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies both of the Libel and the <hi>Librari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> so as to make it appear that it could never be written by <hi>Procopius,</hi> but by some Man in the barbarous Ages, that was ignorant of the Customs and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of that Time, and that the whole Work is nothing but an heap of ignorance, malice and false-hood. And
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:63060:300"/>
is proved so by the best and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Records of that Age. And I know not what can be done more for the Discovery and Conviction of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.</p>
