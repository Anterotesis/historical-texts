            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

enough of <hi>Men</hi> that would be thought more Merciful than God Himself; who not finding in their Hearts how to condemn themselves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Eternal Pains, <hi>will</hi> not apprehend how God should find it in His. The main To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks insisted on by those so tender dispositions in order to the extinguishing the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire are, First, <hi>The</hi> Finity of <hi>Sin,</hi> that in its own Nature cannot Merit an Infinite Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Secondly, <hi>The</hi> Nature of <hi>Punishment,</hi> which is for Castigation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, wherewith the Perpetuity of it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. Thirdly, <hi>The</hi> almost Invincible Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ations that even <hi>Christians</hi> (Weak and
<pb facs="tcp:98179:3"/>
Impotent as they be) are surrounded with, which renders the state of Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Perfection that only has the Promise of Blessedness, Unattainable by most of them. And is it not Hard that Poor Souls so very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily diverted from the Way to Heaven, (though they have it shown them,) should for ever be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such a Hell! Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The</hi> more Tremendous Circumstances of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> that never heard of Jesus Christ the Way, Truth and Life, who would be treated with Severity, with Rigour to Astonishment, if, for not Proceeding in a Path which they were never Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb facs="tcp:98179:4"/>
of, They should be Damned to Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In <hi>a word,</hi> How can it comport with the Infinite Goodness, Love, Kindness, and Fatherly Bowels, of which Almighty <hi>God</hi> doth make Profession to the world? And who can once think that Tender Mercies, that Compassions that never fail, should suffer <hi>Him</hi> so quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without Remorse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pity, to behold his Own Offspring Frying in Eternal and Unquenchable Flames!</p>
            <p>You see <hi>Sir,</hi> how hard a Task that Person has, and in how large a Field he is to Expatiate, that will Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish Perpetuity in Infernal
<pb facs="tcp:98179:4"/>
Torments; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only thing design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me at first, but I found my self in Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Design, instead of framing only one Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, if I would not have that One Defective, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Digress into several. Wherefore, I resolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Thoughts the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to range into the <hi>common Places</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> of <hi>Punishment</hi> in general, of <hi>Humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> and the <hi>Evangelical Righteousness,</hi> and of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Instances</hi> of Wisdom, Goodness and Justice in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Transactions with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as well as <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>; that Assuming this Freedom, I might Display
<pb facs="tcp:98179:5"/>
the <hi>Syntax,</hi> Harmony, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, Concinnity of the Notions I Employ, and on which I Bottom, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perspicuity and Clearness, than otherwise I could have hoped to Effect it. In all, the thing I Principally Aim at, is to manifest what <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> Reason can do to solve Objections about them.</p>
            <p>I call the Whole <hi>Apologie for God,</hi> because the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Alledged, are <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> Insinuating Want of Goodness, Justice, Wisdom in the great Creator, if <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> there be a Perpetuity in the Torments setled by Him; And no Doubt, but when the Arguments are Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Dissolve and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb facs="tcp:98179:5"/>
Them, is to make an Apology.</p>
            <p>Little thought had I to have Engag'd my self on This, or on resembling Subjects, when I was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited</hi> to it by a Letter from One from whom I as little expected it; Who Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on an <hi>Essay</hi> lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished concerning Divine Goodness, imagines it Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, for that I do not from the Infinite Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, conclude either the Non-Existence of Infernal Torments, or their Finite Duration. As if God cannot be Just, if he be Good.</p>
            <p>Such was the Rise of these Discourses, which I Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Habit of an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98179:6"/>
Not to interest therein the Person who Occasion'd it more than Others, but for <hi>Form-sake,</hi> that the Notions I conceiv'd, might enter in more easily upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Mind; who, if intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the same thoughts, the samé Scruples it Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, may look on <hi>This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as One of Resolution, written to Himself about Them.</p>
            <p>As it is, I humbly make a Present of it to You. Not that I Presume to put the Honour of Your Name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, with design to get Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for Defects and Weaknesses therein, that do not Deserve it; But to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to All the World, that

            <head>To his much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and Worthy Friend <hi>Richard Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogge</hi> Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Lately met with a Discourse of yours: both the Subject and Title of it, as well as the Authors name invited me to a perusal. What you designed in that Essay, I think you have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well performed: But I confess
<pb facs="tcp:98179:8"/>
I expected more than I found, and I believe such a mind as yours, can both inlarge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the subject.</p>
            <p>Without doubt 'tis true what you suggest, that it is a Satanical illusion, <q>That God Rules by will; that he hath no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his creatures comfort, but only of his own Glory; that he made the greatest part of men to damn them, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in their ruine; and that he cruelly exacts impossibilities, and obliges men to come, when yet he knows' they cannot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, they are not Atheists, but men of great Devotion, and in the last Age admired for their parts, and piety, that confidently asserted such things as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine. These are not
<pb facs="tcp:98179:8"/>
only the <hi>Dogma's</hi> of the <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bists,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but of Gentlemen of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Twang; and therefore whatsoever an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist may be in his practice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these principles, he is speculatively Orthodox and Godly. I suggest this, because in your making the Atheist to personate —you know whom, you make too severe a reflection upon either their Learning or their Religion.</p>
            <p>Since (Sir) you have been pleased so happily to enter upon so good and gracious a subject, might it not be worthy your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to give an account <hi>How it is consistent with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness to inflict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for finite Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98179:9"/>Punishment (according to the Notion we have of it) is <hi>either for the Good of the whole, or of the part,</hi> and 'tis infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>not to</hi> torment the Criminal, but either <hi>to amend</hi> him, or the society of which he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that both may enjoy the comforts, and the sweets of it: But what of good in everlasting Punishment is there to either of these? or how doth it agree with the Notion of Infinite Goodness ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own description?</p>
            <p>Not to urge, that <hi>the most that are Christians, lye, and live under such odd circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> that they are very near in impossibility wholly to subdue and suppress the influences of sense, and yet must they be plagued or punisht with unspeakable and eternal tortures?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98179:9"/>
               <hi>How much more dismal and tremendous doth it look that those People in</hi> America, Japan, China, Lapland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that live under an unavoidable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance (I mean <hi>morally</hi> so) that yet these poor creatures for what they cannot help, shall be cast into Everlasting Darkness, and sorrows, and that there are no reserves for their acting for a happiness they have no notice of, or very little, or if they have, yet are ignorant of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per methods to attain it? How agrees this with Infinite and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goodness? A return to such an Enquiry in order to a farther explication of Divine Goodness would do a great deal of service to the Religion which we own. Some such thoughts as these have
<pb facs="tcp:98179:10"/>
disturb'd mine about the receiv'd and common Faith of future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments; and if ever your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations lead you to a second Edition of yours, some Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about such an Objection may not I think be impertinent.</p>
            <p>I hope I need not beg a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this trouble from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that pleads for so much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but question not but you will candidly entertain and construe this bold offer of</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ALthough I am not so vain as to flatter my self into a conceit, that either the first or the second Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of All, or of Most are like to be as partial in my Favour, or Candid, as a Generous and Noble
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98179:11"/>
friends: Yet to obey you, and to acquit my self of some part of what I owe you for your Kindness to my former Discourse, and for your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility to me, I am at last resolv'd to Expose Another to Mercy; well Assured that whatever Entertainment Ruder hands may give it, It shall receive in Yours, and in those of worthy Persons, none but what is Fair and Equitable. And this is all it desires. Which that you may afford without Repugnance, I must oblige you to consider, that if you do not find in this Essay, no more than in the Former, the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Delight that Novelty in things is wont to bring with it, you ought not to impute it either as a Fault to the Author, or as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to the Work, but to ascribe it purely to the Fulness and Riches of your own Mind; it being that alone which renders you uncapable of such agreeable Surprize and Pleasure, as not a Few Resent in what appeareth New to them, because indeed there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98179:11"/>
can but little seem so to one of your Endowments and Knowledge. But what talk I of things New: For as to my <hi>first Essay,</hi> whosoever shall but give himself the trouble to Remind the Method I imployed therein, will easily Determine I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had design of innovating <hi>new Notions,</hi> seeing if I had, I could not hope to evidence them in the wayes I there propos'd (to do it) either from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which I was to regulate my self in all I said, or from the <hi>Philosophers.</hi> You may believe I only courted Truth, and that I resolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my self in <hi>common</hi> Notions, and to common sense, in Reasons that were suitable to Mankind; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perswaded, that the things I treated on were of so ample, and so large a Nature, that no Arguments, no Notions of Scholasticks, or of any other private Faction, Party, Sect, or Division of men, would ever Adaequate, and Suit, and fit them. Notions deduced from common
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98179:12"/>
sense, are only capable of Adjusting things of common Concernment. And if I my self have any regard for these Conceptions, which have had the Fortune to entertain the World with <hi>Variety</hi> of Discourse, 'tis only for their plainness and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, because I take them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be such as every body that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, will think he had the same before, and that he never thought otherwise: Which if they were not, I should be very much inclined to suspect them False, since I am apt enough to think it to be as true of Truth, as of the God of Truth, that it is not far from any of us, if we will but feel and grope after it. Certainly those Conceptions are not most likely to be truest, which are most elaborate, and farthest fetcht; but which are easiest and most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. Truth lyeth not so deep in the Well, as many (with <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) think, and who thinking so, do often overlook it.</p>
            <p>And having made you this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98179:12"/>
for the Plainness of my <hi>first Essay,</hi> I hope I need not add, that in this <hi>second</hi> you are not to expect Profound, Uncommon, Deep, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Notions, but Easie, Natural, Sensible, Plain and Obvious Ones, [such as whoever reads, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend] in what I shall rejoyn to your <hi>Letter. which,</hi> that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto it may be the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and orderly, I shall distribute into <hi>three</hi> Parts, and so proportion and adjust my <hi>Answer</hi>; of which</p>
            <p>The First <hi>containeth matter of Reflection on Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second, <hi>matter of charge on Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third, <hi>matter of Exception, or Argument</hi> against <hi>Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these in Order.</p>
            <p>And first concerning the first <hi>Head,</hi> matter of Reflection on O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <q>These are not only Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's of the <hi>Hobbists,</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> but of Gentlemen of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Twang.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98179:13"/>And here I beg pardon for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning that knowledge you impose upon me, concerning worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the <hi>Geneva Perswasion</hi>; (for I presume, you mean <hi>Geneva Perswasion</hi> by <hi>Geneva Twang,</hi> a term I profess I do as little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in any other sense, as I believe it not to be <hi>Canonical</hi> or Receiv'd in this.) For I know not any under that Notion so forsaken of their Wits, or their Religion, as in terms to Assert, <q>God Rules by Will, that he hath no consideration of his Creatures comfort, but only of his own Glory; that he made the Greatest part of men to Damn them and triumph in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and that he cruelly exacts Impossibilities, and obliges men to come, when yet he knows they cannot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, if there are any under that, or other Notions, who affirm and assert such things, (though properly I may not call them <hi>Atheists)</hi> and indeed it were a Contradiction in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98179:13"/>
the Adject so to do) yet I think, I shall not be Uncharitable in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they that <hi>are none,</hi> have <hi>made many</hi>; since I know not any more effectual way of inclining and disposing men unto Denyal of the Being of God, than to Represent and Paint him out to them, in <hi>Idea's</hi> not agreeable to common Reason, nor Sense. You may sooner make them believe themselves to be no men, than that there is such a God. They that have been constantly told that Contradictions cannot be, and that God himself can never make them be, will very hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe, that God himself is, if the very Notion they are taught of him be a contradiction. And who can reconcile the Roughness of these. Expressions of the Absolute and Tyrannical Empire of God, to those other softer ones of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Kindness, and Tenderness for men? Certainly, the Will of God by which he doth all things, is not absolute, and meer Will, but

               </gap> Good Will, Good Pleasure. And thus all men <hi>should</hi> speak.</p>
            <p>True it is, that all <hi>do</hi> not, for some, especially (the) Moderns, in Vindication and assertion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Dominion</hi> and Soveraignty, have biassed too much to one Extream, using terms sounding not a little harsh in mild and temperate Ears: as others on the contrary, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and assertion of Divine <hi>Goodness</hi> and Clemency, have also done to the other. The <hi>Reason</hi> of mens running to extreams in this matter, and of their aberration from the mark and scope to which they should direct their thoughts, is, that they look on God <hi>abstractly,</hi> under one or other Attribute, whereas they ought to consider him in all his Attributes together; and all these, in all their several and respective Aspects, as they have a mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon, Concernment with, and Respect, Order, and Habitude unto each other. For such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98179:14"/>
on one another, and such a Complication and Concernment have the Attributes in God, that it is as true of them in their Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Godhead, as of the Persons of the Trinity, that One is in Another, or rather, that they are together in God, so as that one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth some modification (as it were) and some respect from the other. You may believe of all the other Attributes, in their mutual and respective Aspects, what I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but in One, I mean <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> which as it is compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated [for Example] with alike <hi>Greatness</hi>; so it receives, a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter therefrom, and must be suitably deferred to. Thus <hi>David,</hi> there is <hi>mercy with thee that thou mayest be Feared</hi>; Mercy, that thou mayest be feared; and therefore God is to be feared for his mercy, because he is as Great, as Merciful; and so <hi>Moses, Fearful in Praises</hi>; Fearful Objectively and Passively; God is to be feared while we praise him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98179:15"/>
and for this reason, because he is Almighty as well as Beneficient, Dread Majesty as well as Gracious, and consequently, not only the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Love and Praise, but of our Fear and Dread. We ought not too abstractly to consider God under One Attribute, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on him under others, for we must <hi>rejoyce with trembling</hi>; while we Rejoyce in his Goodness, we must also Tremble at his Greatness. He is Good, and He is Great also.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>second head, matter of Charge on me.</hi>—<q>But Sir they are not Atheists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And so much for the <hi>first</hi> part of your Letter, and in return to the <hi>second</hi>; or as to those Reflections you suggest me to intend, in making the Atheist Personate you tell not who; I utterly disclaim them, and profess with all imaginable clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sincerity, that though I know a sort of persons (far enough from being <hi>Atheists</hi>) that do argue against others, in terms somewhat
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98179:15"/>
resembling some of those wherein I dress <hi>mine,</hi> yet I was not guilty of a Design of so much weakness, as in what I said to Reflect on them for that as such. I am free to say of all Reflection in the Present matter, as some are wont to say of far fetch'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Jests, that he alone does make the Reflection, that can understand it to be One. For my part, I abhor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and Hard words, as neither Philosophical, nor Civil, nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.

            <p>And who can once Question the Perpetuity and Everlastingness of Future Punishments, that seriously considers the Greatness and Infinity of the <hi>Wrath</hi> that shall inflict them? They are to be the Issues of the Utmost Wrath of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not simply called Wrath, but <hi>Wrath in the Day of Wrath</hi>; Men treasuring up unto themselves infernal Torments, being Affirmed in the Sacred Writings, to <hi>treasure up Wrath unto themselves against the Day of Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Judge how great a Wrath that is, since all Resentments in the heart of God proportion and adjust him? Without Question, whatever is in God, is in him according to the Vastness and Capacity of God;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98179:19"/>
so that seeing God is absolutely Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being, and also is Immutable and Unchangeable, Wrath and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as well as Love and Good Will, as they exist in him, are also so. <hi>The Wrath of the King is as the Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Lion</hi>; what then is the Wrath of the <hi>King of Kings!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the Anger of Almighty God is in the present Dispensation trusted in the hands of Jesus Christ, [<hi>All Iudgement is committed to the Son</hi>] and therefore for the present, since He, who hath the letting out of Wrath, is partaker of the Flesh and Blood of the Brethren, and so of kin to us, no wonder if it be let out according to Humane Measures, and with some consideration, and respect for man; which yet hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the World to come, when things shall be no longer in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators hands, but God himself who is inexorable, and inflexible but in his Son, shall immediately be All in All, and do All in All, is not to be presumed or hoped. So that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98179:19"/>
though Divine Wrath break not out on sinners altogether in this World, yet in another it will. There is a <hi>Day of Wrath,</hi> and of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Righteous Judgement of God.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps it may <hi>be offer'd,</hi> that Jesus Christ is so invested in the Government of things, that he has not only the managery of them before the day of Judgement, but is also to conclude the <hi>Scene</hi> in it, and consequently that the <hi>Sentence</hi> then to be pronounced, since it is to be so by a man, <hi>will be past on men with some allay</hi> and abatement. But it must be minded, that though the Son of man shall Judge the World, yet that he shall come to do so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Glory of his Father,</hi> or in Divine Majesty; as who would say, that when he Judges, He will lay aside those Humane considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Respects he had before, and as he appeared more like man in all Precedent Transactions, so that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98179:20"/>
He will shew himself like <hi>God</hi> in this last. Beside, He will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately resign the Government, assoon as he hath passed sentence; and (as I noted before) then <hi>God shall be All in All,</hi> so no Mutation, no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration (after that) of States or Things.</p>
            <p>I confess, <hi>Philosophy</hi> as clear and quick-fighted as she was in other Articles of Christian Doctrine, was but obscure and dimm in This. For though she saw a day of Judgement, and Rewards and Punishments in the Future Life, for whatever should be done in the Present, as is evident not only in <hi>Plato,</hi> both in the Story of <hi>Erus</hi> in his <hi>Rep.</hi> and in that fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tradition of which in <hi>Gorgias</hi> he maketh <hi>Socrates</hi> Relater; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Consolation to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and in his <hi>Golden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> of Divine deferring of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This (I take it) is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Apostle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, when in the first Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Wrath of God is Revealed from Heaven</hi>; namely, that the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> by which I understand the Catholick Tradition of the World, as well as common Reason, did not manifest the Perpetuity of infernal

Torments, but that before the Preaching of the Gospel, which is a Revelation of the Mind of God from Heaven, men as little appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Wrath of God for sin, in the Duration and Eternity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they did the Righteousness of God, for Salvation from it. It is the Gospel bringeth both Eternal Death, and Eternal Life to Light. This Knowledge is an Effect of the Light of Revelation, and not of the Light of Nature. The Wrath of God, as well as the Righteousness of God, is <hi>reveal'd</hi> from Heaven. <hi>Oppositorum eadem est scientia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> yet as clear a Revelation as there is Now from Heaven in the Gospel, of Eternal Wrath on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the Philosophers before ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd it, so there are many <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> since, not only <hi>Origen</hi> and those who follow him, but also others, who make a scruple to admit it: concerning whom and their <hi>Dogmata,</hi> together with the Censure of the Church on <hi>Origen</hi> for this Conceit,

<q>Now I must have a Gentle disputation with certain tender hearts of <hi>our own</hi> Religion, who think that God, who hath justly doomed the Damned to Hell fire, will <hi>after a certain space,</hi> which his Goodness shall think fit for the merit of each mans guilt, deliver them from that torment. And of this Opinion was <hi>Origen</hi> in far more pittiful manner, for He held that the <hi>Devils</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves after a set time expired, should be loosed from their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and become bright Angels in Heaven, as they were before, but this and other of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, chiefly that <hi>Rotation,</hi> and Circum-volution of misery and bliss, which he held, that all mankind should run in, gave the Church cause to pronounce him <hi>Anathema,</hi> seeing he had lost, &amp;c.

            <p>For my part, I am apt to think that Hell is of a <hi>Vast Extent,</hi> and that the bounds and limits of it, are not so strict and narrow, as the most imagine.

            <p>This for the Place of Hell, and for the <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the Punishment which is therein; It doth not only consist in <hi>Loss</hi> and <hi>Deprivation,</hi> but also in <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Exquisite Torments.</hi> For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is called <hi>Fire,</hi> and the rather called so, because (that) Hell it self is styled in the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

            <p>So much for the first Particular, that there are Eternal and Atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Punishments ordained to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in the other World both on Soul and Body, for the sins of Men committed in this. I am now in Prosecution of the Order I proposed to my self, to Evidence the <hi>Second</hi>; which is, <hi>That there is not any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in the Punishment ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the sin; but great Equality and Proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which to effect with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Evidence and clearness, <hi>I will</hi> first <hi>lay down a Truth acknowledged by all that know any thing</hi> (viz.) <hi>That every sin is committed against</hi> God, <hi>who not only is most Excellent Majesty, but also Infinitely Good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sinner himself, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that 'tis Infinite in Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Then</hi> [in the second place]
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98179:31"/>
               <hi>I will make it Evident and Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable, that that Infinite Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in every sin, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its Object, is the Bottom, Ground, and Foundation, whereon the Perpetuity of its Punishment is Erected.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I will fully prove (to Obviate some exceptions which may lye before me) that though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sernal Punishments be all of them Perpetual, and consequently Infinite protensively and in duration, yet that Intrinsecally and Subjectively they are but</hi> Finite. <hi>And when I have acquitted me of what I promise you on these points, then in the</hi> fourth place, <hi>I shall lay before your eyes, in a full and more express de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation, the great Equality and Proportion between the Sin and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; which I will abundantly confirm by many more considerations I shall add.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>first, That every Sin is committed against God, who not only is most Excellent Majesty, but also Infinitely Good, and to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98179:31"/>
sinner himself,</hi> cannot be denyed by one that Understands the Nature of sin. <hi>Against thee,</hi> the Royal Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.4.</note> 
               <hi>thee only have I sinned.</hi> The Wrong and Injury may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, as that of <hi>David</hi> was against <hi>Uriah,</hi> but the <hi>Sinfulness</hi> therein is only against God. There is in every sin a <hi>Transgression,</hi>

            <p>Most certain it is, that those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations in inferior Objects, which scatter'd and dispersed, do render Actions under greatest Guilt and aggravation, are all <hi>Concentred</hi> to aggravate what ever Action man is guilty of against God.

            <p>Yes, and all the Aggravations Reflected on the faulty Action by this Transcendent Object, are as much <hi>Superiour</hi> to those deriv'd from any other, <hi>as those Considerations</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By this time I make no question but a small <hi>Objection</hi> which hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred but too much matter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity to some, will offer none to you, namely, that <hi>it will not follow that Sin is therefore Infinite, because against an Infinite God, no more than that it is Good, and Iust, and Holy, and Omnipresent and the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause against a Good, a Iust, an Holy and Omnipresent God.</hi> For you see I argue not the Infinity of the sin, barely from that Infinity which is in God, so as if this Attribute in him did <hi>Physically</hi> (as some would speak) and Naturally imprint its like upon the faulty Action; no, this Infinity in sin is not a Natural Infinity, but a <hi>Moral,</hi> not Infinity of Being, but of <hi>Guilt and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and consequently, such an one,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98179:34"/>
as cannot be derived but from such Considerations [Moral] as are able to Reflect it. It is not deriv'd <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically,</hi> but <hi>Morally.</hi> I doubt not but you comprehend my meaning, <hi>that Sin is not to be affirmed Infinite, meerly because it has an Infinite and Transcendent Being for its Object,</hi> For this the mentioned Objection fully evidences, but <hi>because there are Perfections in the Divine Nature, such as Goodness, Greatness and the like, that are of a Quality to Greaten the Offence,</hi> and Fault against them; which Perfections being <hi>Infinite,</hi> do make the Aggravations they Reflect upon the crime or sin Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For it is a manifest, a Plain and an Infallible consequence, that if a crime against obliging Goodness, or the like Consideration (for what is instanced in One will hold in All) be great; and against a greater Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it be a greater crime; then a crime against an Infinite and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Goodness, must needs be a crime of Infinite and inconceivable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98179:34"/>
Guilt: <hi>Ut se habet simpliciter ad simpliciter, ita magis ad magis, &amp; maximè ad maximè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that <hi>no sin is small.</hi> For not to stand on this Subtilty, that there is a kind of <hi>Boundlesness</hi> and of Infinity in Sin, Sin being in its very Nature a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression or <hi>Excess</hi> of Bounds, the Law it setteth bounds and limits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens Affections, but sin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth them. I say, not to stand on that Consideration, the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion Evidently follows from what I have already offer'd. For if every Sin be Transgression, and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply a Violation of the Law of God, a Preferring of Our Unruly, Profane, Unrighteous, Evil Wills before His, which is Holy, Just and Good, and consequently, be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Indignity, and (as it were) affront to Him, it is easie to inferr, that None is small, since to violate the Divine Authority and Pleasure, and to despise it and contemn it for our Own, cannot be imagin'd so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98179:35"/>I the rather do Enforce this great, Truth, because I know many Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istically inclined, who deride the Doctrine of the Fall of man occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the eating of an <hi>Apple,</hi> as a senseless and absurd conceit. It cannot penetrate their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that a Wise, and Just, and Good God should conceive so great Anger and Indignation for so small and poor a thing, that He should expose the First man, and all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants from him, to the danger of Eternal Ruine, for no more than eating an Apple. And what is an Apple to be compared with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and with all its comforts! In the day thou eatest, thou shalt dye the death,<note place="margin">

            <p>And indeed an Apple is no great matter, nor is the eating of it in it self a Greater; But then it is no small matter neither to offer an Affront to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98179:35"/>
God Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, to scorn and contemn most Excellent Majesty, to oppose his Will, to break his Bands asunder, and cast away his Cords, which <hi>Adam</hi> did in eating. And what is offer'd by the Atheist in order to extenuate and abate the Guilt, doth extreamly aggravate and heighten it, that he would break with God for (but) an Apple, as one resolved to deny himself in nothing, to keep in with God, and Please Him who is his Maker and Soveraign. Verily He that will break for an Apple, will break for any thing. Without doubt, It was an Ample <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Infinite Benignity and Goodness of God, that He did not choose a greater matter to exercise the Vertue and Obedience of the First Man in, who might very well have forborn the Apples of but One Tree, when he had so many Others bountifully Accorded to him, to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige and gratifie him. Indeed had God Requir'd Proof of Mans Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98179:36"/>
in a matter absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to his Comfort or Delight, it might have minister'd some colour of Excuse for his Failure. But now there is None. 'Twas but an Apple, no more that God denyed him, and would he run the hazard of Divine Displeasure, and Expose his own Eternal Happiness for <hi>That?</hi> What Pretext can there be for a Plea, that he would be faithful in greater matters, that broke his Faith for so small a One? Some find the Breach of all the Commandments in This. Verily, That <hi>Adam</hi> disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged God for an Apple, it argues the greater <hi>contempt</hi> of God, and the greater <hi>Injustice</hi> in <hi>Adam.</hi> For this I appeal to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who speaks home to All I have said.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>first</hi> Consideration to Evince it (which I shall insist upon again hereafter, when I more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly shew the Proportion and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between the Sin and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is, that there is nothing else in the Punishment of meerly Finite Beings, but the Perpetuity or Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its Duration, that can answer that Infinity and Vastness of Guilt and Aggravation which is in the Sin, by Reason of that Infinite Goodness and Transcendent Majesty, that is the Butt and Object of it.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98179:37"/>
Nothing in the Punishment but its Infinite Duration answers the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Guilt and Aggravation in the Sin.</p>
            <p>But beside this main considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is <hi>another</hi> that Establishes it, namely, that Eternal Death or Perpetuity of Punishment, is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto sin as sin [every sin] and therefore must be bottomed on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in sin as sin [in every sin] which what it should be is unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable other than the Aggravation it receiveth from the Object; which if you suppose it but to be, then will all things be adjusted, and (as I shall evidently shew hereafter on the fourth Head) will all lye Even and Square.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a Barr unto the Truth alledged and Pleaded for, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Confirmation, that the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> which Jesus Christ sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in behalf of all that will receive him, who suffering in their stead, is understood to bear what they should, was in its utmost Duration, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98179:37"/>
but <hi>short</hi> and momentany: For as much as it is evident, that the Punishment in Him receiv'd the same Infinity, or Reputation from the <hi>Subject,</hi> he being <hi>GOD-MAN,</hi> that the sin of man Receiv'd from the <hi>Object,</hi> which was <hi>GOD.</hi> For if in the One, God was sinn'd against, in the Other, God suffered; the Blood of Christ was the Blood of God. The Sin was Infinite, it was committed against an Infinite God; the Punishment was infinite, it was suffer'd by an Infinite Person. Not that Christ suffer'd as he was God, God as God cannot suffer, but he who was God, suffer'd. Passions, as Actions are of Persons or Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, and as the Infinity of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject made the Sin Infinite in Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; So the Infinity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject suffering, made the Punishment so in Value and Reputation. Thus Christ suffering for us, suffered but a moment, though we, had we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our selves, were to suffer to Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98179:38"/>So congruous it is, and so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the Perpetuity of infernal Punishment should be bottom'd on the aggravation which the sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from its object: but yet as evident a Truth, and as Perspicuous as it seemeth, <hi>Many</hi> there are who cannot Acquiesce and rest contented with it, Who think themselves obliged to Account for this Article, in a very different way and manner from that so lately proposed.</p>

The <hi>first</hi> is, That thé Damned should they live for ever here, they would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98179:38"/>
sin for ever, and so are Punisht not for what they have done, but what they would do. The <hi>Second,</hi> that in Hell they never leave sinning, and that therefore God will never leave Punishing.</p>
            <p>Truth is, it were all one to me and my design, which is to evidence the Perpetuity of Internal Torments, to have it bottomed on either <hi>these</hi> considerations (one or both) if I thought them able to support the weight of it, or on the <hi>former</hi> I have laid. But not having that Opinion of their great sufficiency and strength some others have, and knowing that a weak and ruinous foundation, most times betrayes the Fabrick; I am unwilling a Doctrine of so much concernment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance unto all mankind, and to all Religion, should be oblig'd to stand or fall with them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that for the future none may build upon them, I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a little of my time, and exercise a little of your patience
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98179:39"/>
to shew their Weakness.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first</hi> then, <hi>that the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would sin for ever if they lived for ever here, and that therefore they are Punished for ever.</hi> I say it seemeth not an Account that can be owned with any safety to the honour of <hi>Divine Iustice,</hi> seeing to those that weigh things, and that know That only to be Just which is Equal, it appears not so Consistent with <hi>it,</hi> that the Punishment should be Actual, Real, Effectual, when the Sin for which it is inflicted, is only Possible, Hypothetical, and on Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (only.) That which would be, never was in Act, and it seemeth very hard, and most unworthy Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Soveraign Righteousness and Justice, That there should be Punishment inflicted actually, for sin that never was (in Act.) Non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities have no Praedicates, and can do Nothing, if the Sin never was, it can merit no Punishment. 'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

evil Effect, but then the Intention is the Crime. In all I have said, I suppose the Objection to proceed of the <hi>Event,</hi> and not of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> that the Damned would for ever sin, if they liv'd for ever; not that they Actually and explicitly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd</hi> to sin for ever. (For) this case is rare, if possible. In this the <hi>malice</hi> of the Will would be Infinite, and so he that had an Actual Will or Resolve to sin for ever, if he could, would deserve for that to be punished for ever. The <hi>will</hi> which is the Cardinal and Grand Principle of what is Moral in an Action, might justly pass for the Deed. But of all the Damned few, if any, can be conceiv'd to have such Resolves and Intentions.</p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>second</hi> Opinion, <hi>That the Damned are subject to Eternal Punishment in Hell, because they sin there Eternally,</hi>] of more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than the former. For though the Damned sin <hi>materially,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate in Hell the same Actions
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98179:40"/>
(some of them) which they did on Earth, and for which they suffer in Hell, yet 'tis a great Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may rationally be affirmed <hi>formally</hi> to sin there, since there is no <hi>Law</hi> there: Hell is no part of Gods Kingdom, those in it, are not <hi>subjects,</hi> but condemned Rebels; and there is no Transgression; and consequently no Sin, where there is no Law.</p>

               <hi>Nor is their doing Actions which in themselves were sinful formerly, and which perhaps are still so in Others, an Argument they sin now in it.</hi> For as the <hi>Beasts</hi> that are not under Law, though they do the same Actions that men do, yet do not sin in doing them as men sin, so the Damned that do the same Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet being now <hi>Exiled</hi> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by God from under his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and from his Kingdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>DUCER</hi> Darkness, and consequently, are no longer under the Law of his Kingdom, they do not sin in what they do, but suffer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98179:40"/>
for what they sinn'd. Hell is not a Place of Sinning, but of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their Sin there is their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> a Person once condemn'd to dye for Treason, cannot in our Law, be Judicially called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any subsequent Act, because he is <hi>Civiliter mortuus</hi>; His former Attainder of Treason is the highest and last work of the Law, in the eye of which he is Dead, after that, and so unable to commit offences. And why, after Sentence pronounced by Divine Justice on the Guilty Sinner, may not he be looked on as Dead in Gods Law, and as uncapable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing against it more? Is not the State of Hell in Scripture call'd the <hi>Second Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Destroy the <hi>both Opinions</hi> at Once, with one Argument; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death is threatned unto men for sin in <hi>this</hi> life, and the sentence of it is Pronounced on the Damn'd for this; <hi>Depart from me you cursed into Everlasting Fire</hi>; and why?
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98179:41"/>
               <hi>for I was an hungred, and you gave me no meat; I was a thirst, and you gave me no Drink; I was a stranger, and you took me not in; Naked, and you cloathed me not; Sick, and in Prison, and you visited me not; Therefore Depart from me, you Cursed, into Everlasting Fire.</hi> Now, is Eternal Death be threatned unto men for sin in this Life, and the Sentence of it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon them for what they have committed here; it cannot Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be presumed, that the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingness of the Punishment should not be founded on some thing in the sin <hi>already</hi> acted in the present world, but only either on the Hypothetical Perpetuation of it in this, or on a Fancied Continuation and Persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it Hereafter in the Other.</p>
            <p>And having said thus much, you cannot doubt of my sense of what the Learned <hi>Parker</hi> further offers out of the Schoolmen, in his Treatise <hi>de Descensu,</hi> which because it is a Learned Passage, and one, that by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98179:41"/>
Representing the Variety of Opinions about the thing whereon I now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, will also represent the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of deciding in it, I shall give you entirely.— <hi>Atqui nostrum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Park. de Desc. lib.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>quòd in medio, tutissimum iter est: Christum nempe, &amp;c.</hi>—
<q>But our Opinion lyes in the middle in which it is most safe to go, namely that Christ endured the <hi>very Pains</hi> of Hell as to their <hi>Substance,</hi> which were due to us, and yet avoided their <hi>Eternity.</hi> To make this clear, We <hi>Deny that Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eternal Pain is absolutely due to All Sins</hi>; and withal, with the Schoolmen, particularly with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanne's Scotus,</hi> and with <hi>Iohannes Picus</hi> C. of <hi>Mirandula</hi> affirm, that some Distinction must be made in this matter. There are <hi>Three</hi> things then that ought to be considered by us in sin: The first is the <hi>Aversion</hi> that is in it from God; and to this the Pain of <hi>Loss</hi> which is Infinite is due, forasmuch as it is the Amission of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98179:42"/>
Good. The second is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> to what is Perishing and Transient, and to this the pain of <hi>sense</hi> is Due, which is Intensively Finite, Agreeably as that delight and pleasure the sinner takes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Finite. But thirdly, there is to be considered also in sin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Continuation</hi> and Persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (of the sinner) in it, or his <hi>Cessation</hi> from it. It is only with the <hi>first</hi> of these that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Pain doth hold proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>second</hi> is adjusted by a but <hi>Temporal</hi> enduring of the Pain. It is Objected that every sinner sins in his Eternity (as <hi>Gregory</hi> speaks) forasmuch as he hath cast himself upon a necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from which he cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be Restrained by any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his own: This indeed is true, and therefore the Eternity of Punishment doth naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their sin; But yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that if sin be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally <hi>interrupted,</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98179:42"/>
in that case <hi>Extremity</hi> only, and not Eternity of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be the Due; as which answers the greatness of the sin but finitely committed; And this is that which <hi>Scotus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, and which the Count of <hi>Mirandula</hi> demonstrates at large, namely, that to sin continued to Eternity both in the Guilt and Filth, Eternal Punishment is due; but that it is in no wise necessary, nor exacted by Divine Justice; that Eternal Punishment should be inflicted for sins, that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to Eternity, but abandoned by Repentance. Now things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, 'tis easie for Every Body to discern how <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> endured the <hi>Pain</hi> of Hell, without the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi>; especially, That being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred which we said before, That He sustained not the Infernal Pains of those <hi>actually Damned,</hi> but only of those that <hi>were to be</hi> so. [<hi>Non Damnatorum poenam gehennalem sustinuisse, sed Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandorum
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98179:43"/>
tantum.</hi>] Verily the Use of this <hi>Distinction</hi> here is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, since those that are Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Damned</hi> sin far otherwise than the <hi>Elect</hi> that were to be so: So that Eternal Torment is in Justice due to Them; but to these <hi>Extream</hi> Torment (indeed) is, but not Eternal. This is clear in a <hi>simile. Imprisonment</hi> is no part of the Debt, but is Justly due to him that abides in Debt. And thus it is in the Elect and Reprobate, of which the former paying the Debt in Jesus Christ, and (renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Spirit) ceasing from sin are freed from that Eternal Prison of Hell, in which the <hi>Damned are Tormented for ever, because they are for ever in Debt, and abide for ever Polluted with</hi> the Filth, and with the Guilt of Sin. The Case then is thus, Christ suffered only for the <hi>Elect,</hi> who were to be Damned, to whose sins ceasing by Repentance, not Eternity, but Only Extremity
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98179:43"/>
of Punishment was due. So that Justice Requir'd not that Christ should Endure the Eternity, but only the Extremity of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Notion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Parker,</hi> which yet I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I cannot Entertain a thought of but with Repugnance; for to me it seemeth very Harsh, if not directly contrary to Sacred Scripture, That Death Eternal should not be the Due of every sin; For though indeed Perpetual Torments are not inflicted on every sinner, and for every sin, yet they are deserved and merited by every sin, and due to every sinner. The wages of sin is <hi>Death</hi>; Death Eternal, for it is opposed to Eternal Life. And if Almighty God be pleased to forgive and Pardon upon Repentance, it is his Free-Grace, and not his Justice but in respect of that well-order'd and Immutable <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> wherein he has oblig'd and ty'd himself to do so; so indeed, he is faithful to forgive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98179:44"/>Nor is Hell a Sheriffs Ward in which the Debtor is Imprisoned till he pay his Debt: For Imprisonment on Account of Debt is not so intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Punishment upon the Debtor, for not having paid, as to be in <hi>lieu of Payment,</hi> and satisfaction of the Debt: But 'tis ordain'd to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate him, and to compell him to Pay it. Whereas all Infernal Torments are truly <hi>Poenal,</hi> Design'd for satisfaction to the Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and <hi>Not</hi> by way of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to make the Prisoner pay a Debt, which, when he is in Hell, it is impossible for him to Do, since that Design were Irrational. In vain are those means which are Referred to Ends that they can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass. Nor can it consist with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Institute such. The Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell are <hi>Debts</hi>; Nor are there are Other which they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to constrain the Prisoner to pay. If the Scripture speak of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Prison, till men Pay the Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Farthing, it must be Understood
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98179:44"/>
of the Eternal Punishment to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone (in Hell.) This is the Only Debt there to be paid, of which no Abatement can be had. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to the Utmost Farthing, and this is all that that Phrase imports.</p>
            <p>Thus you see I differ both from this and other Excellent and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons, and why I do (so) about the <hi>Ground</hi> on which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of Infernal Punishment is rais'd, I say the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> for though I have acknowledged Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Punishments to be Perpetual, yet I cannot easily be brought to own them to be Infinite, but with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, <hi>they are not Infinite in Essence or Being, 'but only in Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Continuance, and consequently are not to be called Infinite in any sense, but because they are End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For questionless the Torments which the Damned suffer in Hell, are intrinsecally and subjectively <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and as Finite as the sins them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves intrinsecally and subjectively
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98179:45"/>
are, for which they be Inflicted. For since all Reception is according to the Measure and Capacity of what Receives, the Torment, Pain, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted on a Finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and received by it, neither is intrinsecally, and subjectively Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, nor indeed can possibly be. So that if the sin subjectively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally be Finite, the Punishment ordained is not subjectively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally Infinite: which was the <hi>third</hi> thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>And this Re-minds me of the <hi>fourth</hi> thing I promised, namely, <hi>to Represent expressly the Proportion between the Sin of man and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of it.</hi> And this <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is manifest. For if the Sin of Man subjectively be Finite, and Unequal as well as Finite, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of that sin subjectively is also Finite, and Unequal as well as Finite; there are Degrees of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell, as there are Degrees of Guilt in sin; and if the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be Infinite Protensively and in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98179:45"/>
Duration, it is because the sin is so Objectively and in <hi>Aggravation:</hi> And <hi>Infinite objective Aggravation</hi> (for such is that of sin, as we have formerly evidenced it) cannot be Proportion'd in the Punishment of a meerly Finite Being, but by its <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Duration</hi> and Extent. Once the sin is <hi>some way</hi> Infinite, but the Punishment of a meerly Finite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither is, nor can be <hi>any wise</hi> so but in Duration. Wherefore the Punishment would be Unequal to the sin, if as this is Infinite in Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation that were not also so in Duration. But this I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, upon the whole you will be pleas'd to Judge what Inequality there is, or what Unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or rather what great Equality and Justice in Divine Proceeding, wherein you cannot but receive abundant satisfaction, as to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Righteousness thereof, if to what Considerations have already
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98179:46"/>
been presented you concerning it, you but add the <hi>following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Proportion which is observed in Distributive (or as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it, Dianemetic) Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is not Arithmetical, but Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical; or (as they love to speak) the <hi>medium</hi> it observeth, is not <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Rei,</hi> but <hi>Personae,</hi> that is, that Persons are as much consider'd in the Distribution of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as things themselves. Yea and more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in Proportioning of Punishments, to make them Just and Equal, it is not Requisite that their Duration should exactly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed unto that of the sin's. A short and momentany sin, if aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in the circumstances, may in great Justice have allotted to it long and tedious Punishment. A Truth so obvious, that were it not Unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, I might abundantly enlarge in instancing it; and I would have offer'd somewhat of mine own in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98179:46"/>
that kind, but that the grave St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> from whom I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but you will take it better,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de Civit. l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> hath happily prevented me. He tells us, <q>Some of the Adversaries of Gods City hold it Injustice for him that hath offended, but <hi>temporally,</hi> to be bound to suffer pain <hi>Eternally,</hi> this they say is utterly Unjust. As though they knew any Law that adapted the <hi>time</hi> of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the time in which the Crime was committed. <hi>Eight</hi> kinds of Punishments doth <hi>Tully</hi> affirm the Laws to inflict: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, Imprisonment, Whipping, Like for Like, Publick Disgrace, Banishment, Death and Bondage. Which of these can be performed in so little a time as the offence is, excepting the <hi>fourth,</hi> which yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man the same measure that he meteth unto Others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Law, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth?</hi> Indeed one may lose his eye by this Law, in as small a time
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98179:47"/>
as he put out another mans by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. But if a man kiss another mans Wife, and be therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be <hi>whipt,</hi> is not that which he did in a moment paid for by a good deal longer suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Is not his short pleasure paid with a longer pain? And what for <hi>Imprisonment?</hi> Is every one judged to lye there no longer than he was a doing his Villany? Nay, that Servant who hath but violently <hi>touched</hi> his Master, is by a Just Law doomed unto <hi>many years</hi> Imprisonment. And as for <hi>Damages,</hi> Disgraces are not many of them <hi>dateless,</hi> and lasting a mans whole life, wherein they bear a <hi>Proportion</hi> with the pains Eternal. Thus the Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further,</hi> I propose it to the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration of Intelligent and Prudent men, if that Punishment, how great, how long soever, be too great, or too long, which for all its greatness and for all its length, is <hi>Unsufficient</hi> in the threatning of it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98179:47"/>
to deterr from the sin; it is the <hi>End</hi> that Measures and Proportions all the <hi>Means</hi> that lead to it; and the sole Intention, Design and End of God in menacing and threatning Punishment, is to Deterr and fright from sin. If the End be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, the Punishment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned can never be too great. <hi>Besides,</hi> it argues <hi>great malice,</hi> when great Threatnings can't deterr. However, It becomes God to threaten, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish too as a <hi>God</hi>; Sin is Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Gods Anger is <hi>his</hi> Defence; if mortal men kill the Body Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their Anger, it is <hi>like</hi> the Immortal God, to Damn the Soul Eternally in his.</p>
            <p>In fine, What if in an Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Hypotheses</hi> are taking, I should offer this, (which yet, what I have proposed already, evinces to be more than so) that perhaps the Constitution of the other World may require, that what ever state is in it be Perpetual, as the Make of this requires, that all things in it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98179:48"/>
should be Otherwise; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that 'tis as agreeable and natural, that all Punishments as well as all Rewards, should be Eternal in the Future Life, as that all in this should be Temporal. But when I say it may be as agreeable, and as natural, that all Punishments in the other Life should be Eternal, as that all Rewards, I would not have you to conceive I think that to be a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> which is generally current, and passeth with the most for One, namely, <hi>That because the Rewards of Heaven are Eternal,</hi> therefore <hi>the Punishments of Hell are also so.</hi> I acknowledge that it will not follow. For to do Good (for so it is to <hi>Reward,</hi> or to Remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) it carries in it more Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abless, and more Congruity to the Divine Essence, and is an Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it more Connatural, and consequently more Free, than to Punish is, or to inflict Evil; This being call'd his <hi>strange</hi> work, which that is not. It is for this Reason,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98179:48"/>
that God is so much more Benign and Liberal (as the Holy Scriptures plainly shew us) in Assigning Large Rewards, than He is Severe and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in Ordaining Dreadful Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments; For if (as he is said to do in the second Command) <hi>He visit the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the children, unto</hi> the third and fourth Generation <hi>of them that Hate him; He sheweth Mercy</hi> to the thousandth <hi>of them that Love Him.</hi> So wide a Difference there is! The Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depends on the Divine Will; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Lenity, Moderation, Propensity to Favour is the Natural Vertue of the Will.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of this Great Truth, that there is no Inequality, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in the Punishments Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained (though Endless) to crimes or sins, but great Equality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and that the Soveraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was neither Arbitrari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us and Wilful, nor Unjust, but both Wise
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98179:49"/>
and Righteous in assigning them. What I am next engaged to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>is to evince him Good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as well as Iust, and, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and threatning Endless and Eternal Punishments to sin, he has as much Consideration of the Humane Interest and Concern, as of his Own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I may Proceed to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and Evince this Verity, it will be necessary for a clearer and fuller stating of it, to distinguish between the <hi>threatning</hi> of Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the <hi>inflicting</hi> of them. Which I note here, because I hold my self obliged but to demonstrate <hi>now,</hi> that there is Goodness in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and in threatning of Eternal Punishments, as <hi>hereafter</hi> I shall prove, that there is great Justice, and no want of Goodness in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting on laying them on, and those who merit them.</p>
            <p>And who can question the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and Benignity of God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and threatning unto men Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

            <p>But <hi>why Eternal Punishments?</hi> (will you say) I <hi>answer,</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Justice of it, the menacing of Infernal Punishments (the lusts of men are so Exorbitant and high) is <hi>not sufficient</hi> to subdue and quench them; there must Eternity be added to Extremity in the Torments, to make the threatning of them an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to reclaim men; and when that is done too, all is little enough; there are millions in the world whom not that considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as tremendous and as Direful as indeed it is, is able to deterr and fright from their Vices. If the threatning of Eternal Torments can effect no more, how much I pray you would the threatnings of shorter ones effect! Future things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and remote, and what are so,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98179:51"/>

Great Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments in another World would awe but little, if they were not also Perpetual, it is the Eternity that adds so much to the weight; and the weight of the torments, that makes them over balance, when they are compared with the sin. <hi>Purgatory</hi> is not half as scaring as Hell. The <hi>Emphasis</hi> of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as much upon the Duration, as upon the kind of it. <hi>Go you,</hi> sayes Christ, not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>From what I have presented you on this Head, it is not Difficult to Conclude what sense one ought to have of Mr. <hi>Hobb's Notion of Hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hobbs Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat. par.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 45.</note> and of the Texts that concern it.
<q>He tells us, that the Texts that mention <hi>Eternal Fire,</hi> Eternal <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or the Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyeth, contradict not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Second and Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98179:52"/>
                  <hi>Death,</hi> in the <hi>Proper</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of the Word Death. The Fire and Torment prepared for the Wicked in <hi>Geenna, Tophet,</hi> or what place so ever, may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, and there may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want men to be tormented in them, though not <hi>every One,</hi> nor <hi>any One Eternally</hi>; For the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being left in the <hi>State</hi> they are in after <hi>Adams</hi> sin, may at the Resurrection <hi>live as</hi> they did, Marry and give in <hi>Marriage,</hi> and have Gross and Corruptible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>as all mankind now</hi> have, and consequently may Ingender Perpetually after the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, not to mention the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Perplexity in this Notion, what will Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> make of that <hi>Description</hi> the Evangelist gives of Hell, wherein the Torments of it are painted out so Dreadfully by Fire and Brimstone, by a never Dying Worm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is but a solemn piece of <hi>Mockery,</hi> a Bugbear, a <hi>Mormo</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98179:53"/>
that can only fright those weaker Apprehensions that do not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand and see it? Hell to those that know it, for all this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Description of it in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is a <hi>Paradise</hi> of Pleasure, such a Place as all the Wicked would elect and <hi>choose</hi> for their Heaven, a Place of Eating and Drinking, of Marrying and giving in Marriage, and why not of Quaffing, Carousing and making merry? In a word, no worse a Place than this <hi>Earth</hi>; and the state of sinners in it, no worse nor better (so over-merciful a God we have) than that of Men before the Deluge. [<hi>The wicked,</hi> saith he, <hi>being left in the</hi> state <hi>they were in</hi> after <hi>Adams</hi> sin, <hi>may at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection live</hi> as they did.] As if the wicked in the Old World, had in it suffered and undergone their Hell, and that they had not been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved for that time, from the Wrath to come. Here is a Hell for Sinners that would tempt them to be so. Is this <hi>Wrath in the day
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98179:53"/>
of Wrath?</hi> this the <hi>Utmost</hi> that God can do? Is <hi>Tophet</hi> Prepar'd of Old, and <hi>Geenna,</hi> and the Lake of <hi>Fire and Brimstone,</hi> and the Place <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd</hi> for the Devil, and his Angels, come to this? Is this the <hi>Terrour of the Lord,</hi> with which the Apostles perswaded men! Who would care for Hell, if this so soft and easie ae Place be Hell! Ay, but the <hi>Fire is Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what if Fire and Brimstone prepared for the Wicked in <hi>Geenna</hi> be eternal, and there never want men to be tormented in it, but that there be an Eternal Succession of the Wicked to keep in and feed that Fire? This will not Help the matter; For though the <hi>Fire</hi> be Eternal, yet seeing there is no one to lye Eternally therein, The <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is not Eternal; not doth the Perpetuity of the Fire, bring an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to the Punishment and suffering of the sinner, since if he feel it not Eternally, it is to him all one as if it were but Temporal. What
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98179:54"/>
doth it matter to a Criminal whose Execution is to be but short, how long the Gibbet stand, or how many others be hang'd on it after him? So to Interpret Eternal Fire, is to Trifle with it.</p>
            <p>But this is a too Absurd and Gross Conceit for me to Exercise your Patience longer on it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Apply my self unto the <hi>last</hi> particular; Not to mention what <hi>Abatement</hi> Goodness may be thought to make in Hell Torment, since this is secret, I shall only endeavour to demonstrate what suffices for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>that it is not want of</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>no more than 'tis Injustice, to Inflict Eternal Punishments on those to whom they are threatned, when the Good Designs and Ends for compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of which they were so, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether defeated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to the stating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of the present point, I will offer all my Notions and Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it, under three Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98179:54"/>First, <hi>I will endeavour to Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this Truth, That Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments are not Inflicted, but on the Obstinate and Irreclaimable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I will Demonstrate, that it is but just to Punish them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that are Obstinate and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>I shall evidence there is no want of Goodness in inflicting of Eternal Punishments on such. So far the doing so is from being thwarting and inconsistent with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Infernal Torments are not inflicted, but on the Obstinate and Irreclaimable,</hi> cannot but be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all that soberly consider, that the Divine Heart as well as Divine Arms are ever open to the Penitent and Converting, and that the great God, Resenting as he is of injuries and wrongs, yet sheweth not his wrath for any, but <hi>on the vessels of dishonour,</hi> those <hi>whom he hath first endured with much long-suffering,</hi> who notwithstanding all his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on them, and all his endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98179:55"/>
Audaciously persist as long as life enables, to Provoke him. Can any thing be more Express, or more full, than is the <hi>Declaration</hi> which he makes in favour of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent? <hi>If the wicked</hi> will turn <hi>from All his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes and do that which is Lawful and Right,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek 18.21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>He shall</hi> surely live, <hi>he shall</hi> not dye. <hi>All his transgressions that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they shall not be mentioned unto him, in his Righteousness that he hath done, he shall</hi> live. <hi>Have I any</hi> pleasure <hi>at all that the wicked should</hi> dye? <hi>faith the Lord God, and not that he should return from his wayes and live? Again, when</hi> [whensoever]<note place="margin">V. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>the wicked man</hi> turneth away <hi>from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doth that which is Lawful and Right, he shall</hi> save <hi>his soul alive, because he considereth and turneth away from all his Transgressions that he hath committed, He shall</hi> surely live, <hi>he shall not dye.</hi> So manifest it is that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98179:55"/>
none Perish but the Irreclaimable and Unrepenting.</p>
            <p>For this Reason as well as Others are such forlorn wretches on whom infernal Torments shall hereafter be inflicted, compar'd to <hi>chaff,</hi> to <hi>wild</hi> Trees, to <hi>dry</hi> Trees, they being so Perverse, so Corrupt, so desperately Overgone with Wickedness and Lusts, that there is as little hope of working on them in the Methods Appointed by Divine Wisdom to that End, as of converting chaff in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wheat, or of Receiving fair, and good and pleasant fruit from a wild and crabbed Tree, or from a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd and dry one. The <hi>Chaff</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>shall be burned up with Fire Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.</hi> And the <hi>Tree</hi> only that will not bring forth Good fruit, <hi>is to be cut down.</hi> And what Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man would not cut down a Tree that is but Cumber and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Ground?</p>
            <p>And this Re-minds me of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing,</hi> which I propounded to be evinced, namely, <hi>That for God to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98179:56"/>
Punish with Eternal Torment the Obstinate and Unreclaimable, is so far from being Hard and Unrighteous, that there is nothing more Agreeable to Justice, and to the common senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and notion which we all have of it, than This.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>First,</hi> If God inflict Eternal Torments on men, it is but what he <hi>told them of before</hi> that he would do, if they did not Reform, (which was <hi>fair</hi>) He striketh not but after He hath threatned, so that if they would themselves, they might avoid the Effects of his Anger; which if they do not, the blame and Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be laid on God, who deplores them, and who gave them warning, but on themselves that would not take it. On this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>God</hi> himself insists to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his dealings, and when he had Accounted thus for them, he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids the <hi>Israelites</hi> with great. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and Unreasonableness, for not acknowledging the Equity and Righteousness of his Procedure. <hi>Yet
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98179:56"/>
ye say, the way of the Lord is</hi> not equal. <hi>Hear now, O house of</hi> Israel, <hi>is not my way equal?</hi> are <hi>not your wayes unequal?</hi> When a <hi>Righteous man turneth away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and when the wicked man turneth away,</hi> Ezek. 18. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> if God were Good, and Wife, and Just in threatning as we have evinced him, he cannot be Unrighteous, Evil or Unjust in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting; it is but Vindication of his Word, and what he is obliged to in point of Honour, and in point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to himself, to make them to feel the Verity and Truth of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Threats, who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did mock and scorn them. They who do not Reform and Convert up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>threatening</hi> of Eternal Death, when God makes it, do by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation laugh at <hi>That,</hi> and dare him; it is as if they should say, we care not for his threats, nor fear them, let him that makes them do his worst. And what shall God in <hi>Honour</hi> then do, when he is challeng'd to do his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98179:57"/>
Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, but the Justice which he owes himself, to make them feel the Dire Effects of his extream displeasure, who so despis'd it and him? Should he only threaten and not inflict, what were his Threatnings, but Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Fooleries! Once, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned He has, and he will execute his Threatnings. <hi>He cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And supposing it to be a piece of high Justice to God, it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to the sinner, to make him an Eternal Instance of Divine Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for <hi>ut Verum vero, sic justum justo consonat.</hi> There is as great a Consonancy and Agreement in all things which are Just, as there is in all things which are True: What is but Just to One, that cannot be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and Unrighteous to Another. Indeed it is the Goodness of the great God to bear with men so long, and to try so many and so likely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to reclaim them: But it is but Justice, when all endeavours to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, become Unprofitable and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98179:57"/>
vain, to let Justice to himself, and to the sinner take its course. I say Justice to the sinner, for He inflicts but what the sinner merits. We have already proved an Infinity of Guilt in every Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> There is so great Reason that the Obstinate and Irreclaimable should be Eternal Instances of wrath, that by the Light of Nature, many wise and knowing men among the <hi>Heathen</hi> thought so. For <hi>Socrates, Plato, Plutarch</hi> and many others, though, as I have shewn already, They held infernal Pains to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal and Purgatory, and in that respect to be Finite, yet they also held, that Persons overgone with Wickedness and Vice, who were Obstinate, Perverse and Irreclaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are given up unto <hi>ERINNYS</hi> to abide in Torments, with that most Dreadful Fury for ever.<note place="margin">

            <p>Wherefore taking Goodness in a <hi>Moral</hi> sense for Kindness, Benignity, Clemency, I hold my self obliged <hi>to evince there is no want thereof in the execution of Divine Justice, by Inflicting infinite eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Nor is there, for certainly there cannot be a <hi>want</hi> or culpable Privation, Absence or Defect of Goodness, in <hi>Administrations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ought not Properly to be</hi>; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or want it is <hi>Absentia debiti inesse,</hi> The Absence of that which ought [one way or other] to be in or Present; and therefore seeing Goodness it self Obliges not the great God to shew it in the mentioned circumstances [on the Obstinate and Irreclaimable] and consequently, it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98179:59"/>
ought not to be further exercised on them, there is no want thereof, if it be not.</p>
            <p>Now there can be nothing clearer, than that Goodness obliges not the Great God to give Perpetual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of it to the Irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Obstinate; For Divine Goodness, as the Humane, is seated in a middle between the two extreams of Cruelty and Weakness, and is to be directed in the Exercises of it by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>wisdom.</hi> Now it is against all Reason, that Goodness which is but cast away upon the Stubborn and Incorrigible, should be everlastingly continued to them; for if it were, the Exercise thereof in such a circumstance, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Honour of that name, since, though to bear long be Goodness, to bear alwayes, and with the Insolent and froward, is not so, but Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Goodness obliges not God to shew it where there is no Reason He should, and where there is no Reason he should not. God owes

            <p>But to <hi>exemplifie</hi> the Reason, to render't more convincing; what if a Father, after he hath long threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Disobedient and Rebellious Son with disinherison and utter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure, do at last upon his Sons Persistance in his Follies, proceed to make him feel in effect what was threatned, Doth it argue any want of Fatherly affection, or kindness in the Parent, whose Bowels yearn, who would rather than the better part of his estate, it may be of his Blood, he could reclaim and turn him? No, but a Noble and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar

piece of <hi>Iustice</hi> which He owed to himself; which if he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in the present circumstances, after so much injury and affront done to him, and so much Patience and endurance exercised by him, the world would accuse him of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and fond Indulgence, and of most pittiful <hi>weakness.</hi> And is so Irrational and impotent a Fondness inexcusable in man that hath Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Nature to Apologize and plead for it, what would it be in God that hath none? 'Tis Reason only obliges to be Good. Indeed so long there is Reason to be Good, in the <hi>Reason</hi> of Goodness, as there is no Reason against it. To be good against Reason, is Folly and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not Goodness.</p>
            <p>But it may be, you will say, <hi>But why so much Haste then? and why doth God Precipitate a Sentence, which he might much longer defer? Perhaps, had he but deferred it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer, those that have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, would convert.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:98179:60"/>I answer, <hi>Every man hath his Time,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, that Frame and Constitution of things, whereby they ever are in Flux and Revolution, allows no more; many they be who are to Act their Parts on this Terrestrial Stage, and those that are before must go off, and take their leaves, to make room for those that follow: every one must have his turn, there is a settled Law and Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and, according to it, <hi>One Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration passeth, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> One must pass, that another may come. Now 'tis highly Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Congruous, that Divine Wisdom should conform to the Laws it self hath made; and no less so, that this consideration of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Uncertainty of Humane Opportunities and Seasons, should excite in man a due and thorough care to improve them; it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream weakness for Him, by any Omission to neglect and Trisle with the Present, that knows himself not

sure of the Future; it is, <hi>to day if we will hear his voyce.</hi> This is the great Reason why God has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred humane life so Uncertain, namely, to Prevent the Oscitancy and Delayes, that man is subject to, <hi>I come as a Thief in the Night, watch therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor may it be thought that lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time would effect</hi> what those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the present time affordeth doth not. Nothing will reclaim the irreclaimable and Obstinate; that very space to Repent, which doth intenerate and mollifie the vertuous and ingenuous, it but confirmeth and emboldens the stubborn and wicked; there is enough afforded in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time to Operate on those that do not harden their Hearts, and no forbearance, no Patience will have a good effect and operation upon those that do. <hi>To day if you will hear his voyce,</hi> harden not <hi>your Hearts:</hi> his Voice is loud enough to make men hear, if they harden not their Hearts, and stop not their Ears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98179:61"/>In fine, <hi>How long should God try?</hi> What bounds and limits would you set his Goodness? When He hath stay'd one year, would you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand another? When he hath waited one and another, perhaps if he would stay the third, the sinner might Repent; and you might as well demand a thousand years as one, and as well a Myriad of years as a thousand. How long shall God await and expect? Surely <hi>For ever,</hi> if Delinquent man shall vote it. Man will never think that God hath try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long enough, and God only knows when he has.</p>
            <p>Thus I have evinced all I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to do upon the first Argument, and all was necessary I should. I have evinced that there are Eternal Punishments; that there is equality and Proportion between the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as Endless and Eternal as it is) and the sin; I have evinced that the threatning of Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to the compassing the Present and the Future Weal of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98179:62"/>
Man, is an Instance of Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity; and also that the Infliction of them on the irreclaimable and Obstinate is a great Evincement of Divine Justice, and none of any want of Goodness, Kindness or Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</p>
            <p>And now when I recall my thoughts, I find them tempted to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to me, That all the labour I have put my self to in writing, and (put) you to in reading is superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the matter might have been concluded more effectually in fewer words. For <hi>what if God whose only End is his Glory, and the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Himself in all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Perfections, willing to shew his Just and Dreadful Wrath upon his Open enemies, should execute</hi> and hang them up in chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to make them Everlasting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Monuments thereof to Saints and Angels? What if God will?</p>

            <p>What <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Notion of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is, you may inferr from what I have already offer'd on the first Argument; and for <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> both of them seem entirely yours. <hi>Seneca</hi> sayes expressly, and for what he saith, he quoteth <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> that <hi>this ought to be consider'd in every</hi> infliction of Punishment, <hi>that it be designed either</hi> to amend <hi>the wicked, or to</hi> remove <hi>them, and that in both, respect ought not to be had to what is</hi> Past, <hi>but to the</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>for asmuch as</hi> Plato <hi>affirmeth, No Prudent Rector will inflict Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on any man, because he</hi> hath <hi>offended already, but lest he</hi>

            <p>I make no question but whatever Perswasion you may possibly have had before, you have this now, that I will <hi>do you all the right</hi> imaginable in the Argument, seeing I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (that) the Notion that is its Basis and Foundation, hath such Authority to countenance and favour it: <hi>which that I may,</hi> I shall reduce the Reason which you urge, to Form, and so display it in its Utmost Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98179:67"/>
and Force, and then joyn Issue upon it. And in <hi>Forms</hi> it runs thus, <hi>All Punishment which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted justly, is inflicted either for the Good of the whole, or of the part. But Everlasting Punishment as such, is neither inflicted for the Good of the whole, nor for the God of the Part. Therefore Everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as such is not inflicted justly,</hi> and consequently, <hi>not at all.</hi> For Everlasting Punishment is none, if not Just.</p>
            <p>Or thus,</p>
            <p>All Iust and Righteous Punishment is inflicted, not to torment, but to amend the Party Punished, or the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety whereof he is a member, that both may enjoy the sweets. But Infernal Everlasting Punishments are not, cannot be inflicted to amend the Punished, or the Society, but only to Torment the Offendor. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is your Argument in Form, wherein I take it to be so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, so cogent against Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>

            <p>Who seeth not how unapplyable to either Proposition in the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Argument this Answer is? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the great Harshness, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge should not regard the Past, but the Future; and as great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake [or <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi</hi>] as if the thing is question were the <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting</hi> and Ordaining of Eternal Punishment, whereas indeed it is the <hi>Inflicting,</hi> between which there is no little Difference; since if the Menacing and Threatning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge respects the Future, yet the Execution and Performance of that Revenge, doth in common sense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Past.</p>
            <p>Wherefore seeing Mr. <hi>Hobbs's</hi> Answer will not satisfie a thinking man, I must Essay to give the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment another, wherein though I might content my self simply to deny the <hi>Major,</hi> namely, that All Punishment which is inflicted justly,

is inflicted either for the Good and Reformation of the Party Punished, or for Example to Others: yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of how great advantage it may prove, not only to detect a false Notion of Punishment, but instead thereof to Settle and Establish a true One, I shall in order thereunto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiate in my Answer.

            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I will consider Punishment in general, as Abstracting from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane, and so from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, endeavour to explain the Nature of it, and the Ends, Where I will shew it to be Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</item>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will shew, that the Notion of Revenge is not incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to God, but that He is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger.</item>
               <item>

            <p>To the <hi>First.</hi> And what is Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in the common sense and Notion which all the World has of it, but <hi>Infliction of some Evil</hi> [of Pain] <hi>on an offender for some Past offence?</hi> Or as others judge it fitter to express it,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:98179:69"/>This then Is the true and proper <hi>Notion,</hi> and the most agreeable to Holy Scripture, of Punishment as it abstracteth from Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and <hi>it</hi> importeth in it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as the <hi>matter,</hi> somewhat as the <hi>form.</hi> For the <hi>matter,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth Pain; for the term Pain in <hi>English,</hi> is deriv'd from <hi>Poena,</hi> the word for Punishment in <hi>Latine</hi>; and indeed what ever is inflicted could not be a Punishment unto the Party, if it did not some way Pain him. For the <hi>Form,</hi> it importeth a Relation to committed sin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which, and as a thing deserved, the Pain or Evil is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; for Pain inflicted without Relation unto some Offence and Transgression, may indeed be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Affliction,</hi> but to make that Pain a <hi>Punishment,</hi> it must regard some Injury, some wrong done, for expiating which it is inflicted.

            </p>
            <p>'Tis is relation unto this <hi>end,</hi> that <hi>Anger</hi> cannot satisfie it self, as <hi>Malice</hi> does, that evil be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that hath provoked it; <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth further that he be sensible</hi> of that Evil, and who inflicted it; for if he be not, it cannot compass this its End thereby; It <hi>removeth</hi> not contempt, it maketh not the enemy <hi>to know himself,</hi> no nor to know <hi>him</hi> neither with whom he hath to do.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>This end is so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Punishment,</hi> that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does inflict this, must needs propose it; and if he do not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propose it, he is in Reason to be interpreted to do so virtually, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Person he sustains, which is of one so impaired, so injured in his Honour by some contempt shewn him, that he cannot choose but vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it. This is the proper end of Punishment as Punishment, and in respect of this, Punishment is meer Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.

Hence God when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to Revenge and Punish, words it, <hi>I will make them know that I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

For Instance, a Father so corrects his Child, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster his Servant, not meerly by way of Vindication, for that he hath been bad, but by way of Reformation, that he may be made better. <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is bound up in the Heart of a Child, and the</hi> Rod of Correction <hi>must fetch it out.</hi> Thus Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>Physick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we consider Punishment in <hi>Reference to the standers by or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants,</hi> so it is called <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And so <hi>much for the First</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to explicate the Nature and the Ends of Punishment, wherein I have evinced it (as such) to be <hi>Vindictive</hi>; I now proceed to the <hi>Second, which is to shew,</hi> that <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in this notion of Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, is not incompetent to God,</hi> but that as he punishes, so he is an <hi>Avenger</hi>; and that the Punishments which he inflicts, are not only Castigations and Examples, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges.</p>
            <p>And there is nothing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous than this Truth; for <hi>First, Therefore he Assumeth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wrath</hi> and Indignation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nay, Jealousie, to shew he minds his Glory, <hi>that</hi> he will not bear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <hi>that</hi> it is no good despising of him, <hi>that</hi> if he be despised, as he wanteth not the Power, so he will not want the Will to avenge for

it. The thought that God will avenge; it striketh men with fear, and the <hi>fear of God is the Beginning of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; they that fear him cannot flight him. So <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Again, He hath ingrafted a Vindictive Principle into</hi> every thing that hath sense; there is not a Worm but has it, and he that hath ingrafted Revenge, shall not he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? for if he that Planted the ear, must needs hear, and he that made the eye, must needs see; and he that gave a heart to man, must needs understand; then surely he that hath implanted in every living thing a Principle of Revenge, in order to its own defence and conservation, must needs be one himself that will take it.</p>

            <p>But you will ask me, <hi>why</hi> doth God Appropriate Vengeance? and <hi>how</hi> doth he Execute it?</p>
            <p>I answer <hi>First</hi> to the <hi>first</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that <hi>therefore Vengeance is appropriated unto God, because in every wrong,</hi> iniquity, injury or sin, which in its utmost comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and extent he hath severely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>there is contempt of him</hi>; and his command, so that though the Hurt and Injury be done to man, yet there being also in it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and Neglect of God, it were an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence</hi> that could not be excused, for the Creature to take the matter out of his Creators hands, who is infinitely more concerned in it than
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98179:78"/>
he. This were for man to frustrate and defeat (as much as in him lyes) the Vindication and Revenge of his Superiour and Lord, and by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous execution and Pursuit of his own. God sayes, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> I am more concerned in the Injury than Thou. Thy Enemy <hi>wrongs</hi> thee, but he <hi>contemns</hi> me; and therefore since it is so much my Interest to see it taken, do thou leave the Revenge to me. And to leave it to God, is but a piece of Deference and Respect we owe him. So <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

            <p>And <hi>How</hi> is <hi>Vengeance executed by him,</hi> which was the <hi>Second</hi> Question I supposed you to put, <hi>but either immediately</hi> and in his own Person, or <hi>mediately</hi> and by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State and <hi>Magistrates</hi>?

it with men to execute and let it out; <hi>I have said ye are Gods,</hi> Magistrates that bear the name, they have the keeping of the Honour and Vengeance of God; it is God hath put the Sword into their hands, and to appeal to them for Vengeance is to go to God for it.

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98179:79"/>I make no question, but by this time you see the little excursion I have made in this Particular, is not impertinent, but that I was obliged to it, to obviate the <hi>Prejudices</hi> some have taken up against the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness of Punishments in general, and consequently of Divine Ones; namely, that Humane Punishments are so <hi>Rectoral,</hi> as <hi>not to be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> or effects of Anger.

               <p>And my Assent to these Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is unshaken, notwithstanding that I find <hi>objected,</hi> that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Punishment is taken from the <hi>Influence</hi> that crimes have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the <hi>Peace</hi> and Interest of the Community, Pride, Avarice, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice not being punished by Humane Laws as severely as <hi>Theft, &amp;c.</hi> But this moves not me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>For <hi>First,</hi> Humane Laws (as also Law-givers) are not alwayes what they should be. And we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish <hi>Humane Laws.</hi> For these are either <hi>Universal,</hi> such as are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with Laws Divine, and do Prohibit or Injoyn, what they do: or else <hi>Municipal,</hi> and more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98179:81"/>
founded only on the Profit and Utility of such as Consent to them. Now Humane Laws of the <hi>first sort,</hi> which I called Universal, are properly <hi>Laws,</hi> and do oblige the Conscience, as being of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and Sanction, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments annexed to them must be executed on offenders, they being <hi>Vindicts</hi> and concerning God. But Humane Laws indeed of the <hi>second sort,</hi> which I would rather call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements</hi> of the People or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts under a forfeiture, do oblige no farther, than as they are of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; Nor by the breaking of them incurr you other Danger than of the forfeit was agreed on, to those to whom you have made it, who may Dispence. For every one may depart with his own Right, though none with anothers. <hi>Again,</hi> if Pride, Avarice, Malice are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by Humane Laws of the first sort as severely as Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So neither are they in the present World by the <hi>Divine,</hi> which yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98179:82"/>
Regard God; and it is because they have not that Malignant Influence upon the Publick, which Theft and others like it have, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in that Respect they are not so Evil. But Thirdly, though the measure of Punishment be taken as you see I grant in part it is, from the Influence that crimes may have upon the peace, and interest of the Community, yet it <hi>follows not</hi> but that such Punishment inflicted, may be Vindictive. And Vindictive 'tis, for God ordained it. And he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth greater Punishment for such than other crimes, for that they having Tendency to Ruine and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Common-wealths, which it is as well his Care, as great Concernment to maintain and uphold, are more offensive and provoking to Him, than Others.<note place="margin">

And so much for the <hi>Second</hi> Head.</p>
            <p>I am now in the <hi>Third</hi> Place <hi>to shew the kind and species of Eternal Punishments, whether they be</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Whether they are meer <hi>Revenges,</hi> in satisfaction and contentment of Divine Justice and Anger; or <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> intended only to Reform and amend the punish'd; or in fine, <hi>Examples,</hi> design'd to Edifie the standers by, and make them Careful what they do.</p>
            <p>And to be plain, I hold <hi>Eternal Punishments</hi> now threatned, and One Day to be inflicted on the Wicked that despise them, all <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive,</hi> or <hi>Effects of Wrath</hi>; And that the great Design and End of God in them is to Rescue his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Honour and Glory, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and please himself in Trophies of his Justice, and in Triumphs over vanquisht Enemies.</p>
            <p>Now that Eternal Punishments are principally, if not solely designed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98179:83"/>
for the <hi>Honor,</hi> Glory, Triumph of the Great God, is evident, in that the <hi>day of Iudgement</hi> (wherein the sinner shall be damned to them,) is the <hi>last day</hi>; when all Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Government and Rectory shall cease, and be no more; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently cannot be intended either in favour of the punished themselves, or for Examples to others.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some who love <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as many do in this too Curious Age; will tell you, that the Eternal Punishments and Torments of the Damned <hi>are Examples unto Saints in Glory,</hi> and that they are designed as a <hi>means</hi> to settle and establish them in that condition; it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be thought that any in it can <hi>incline to change,</hi> when they shall ever have before their Eyes so Dire <hi>Examples</hi> of changing. And <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> who makes the damn'd in Hell Examples unto those in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, is in part of this Opinion, <gap reason="foreign">

—<hi>But others are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wicked, and by Reason of their wickedness become</hi> incurable. <hi>Of these, Examples are made, who indeed being incurable, receive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no advantage and benefit, yet</hi> others do, <hi>who see them suffering for their sins, the most extream, most sharp, and most tremendous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that to</hi> Eternity.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>confirmation</hi> of it, it may be colourably offer'd, that the <hi>Devil</hi> who affected to leave his first Habitation, and to change it for another, had not had an instance them of that Exorbitancy and folly in any kind; nor had <hi>Adam,</hi> whole Easie Nature was abused by that Serpent into a like Extravagancy and weakness with his, then had one in his own.

he would have found therein a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure for <hi>Curiosity,</hi> that Impotent and Fond Emotion, which prov'd so Fatal to both.</p>
            <p>I say <hi>Curiosity,</hi> which I apply as well to Faln <hi>Angels,</hi> as to Faln <hi>Adam,</hi> because it seemeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, an <hi>Unhappy Curiosity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Inferiour World,</hi> and perhaps of making an Experiment of Misery and Evil, whereof hitherto they had but heard, that rather than <hi>Pride,</hi> or any Impotent and senseless Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being either Equal or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to their Maker (as the most think;) or, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> do) Their <hi>Envy</hi> at the Honour and Happiness of man was the <hi>Lust</hi> inclining them to leave their First Habitation, and to exchange't for Another.

            <p>This is the less improbable, for that they tempted <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> with the same consideration, <hi>you shall be like to Elohim</hi>; presuming (as it may be rationally thought) that that was likely to become the most Efficacious and Successful bait unto others, that had proved but too Powerful a One unto themselves.

But this by the way, to Return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But though</hi> another might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to bottom the Eternal stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Good Angels, on the Dismalness of that Condition, which they see the Faln Ones have plung'd themselves into, by leaving their first Habitation; and who would try again, or wish to have Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Hell, Evil, Misery in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that has seen, or still sees so dreadful an Experiment thereof in others? And he might also think
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98179:85"/>
himself as able to account in like manner, for that eternal confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glorified Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the tremendous observation of the Dire Examples of the Damned in Hell, eternally depending in their eyes. I say, though another would account and reckon thus, <hi>yet I dare not:</hi> There is in my Judgement an Infinitely higher <hi>ground</hi> than this, both of the Fixation and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Glorified Saints and of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels. For (as I take it) it is Incorporation and Ingraffment of the former, and also of the latter into Jesus Christ, and the Inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Indwelling of the Great Eternal God in them, as in his own house, that doth Establish and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them; it being the Prime De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of God in all that has been, and all that shall be done in the World, but to build unto himself a Spiritual House, and Temple wherein he may Reside for ever; <hi>whose House ye are.</hi> Christ is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Builder, Ministers Inferiour

Builders, the work both of Christ and Ministers is Edification and Building. <hi>To whom coming as to a living stone disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of</hi> God, <hi>Elect and Precious, you also as lively stones, are</hi> built up a Spiritual House.</p>
            <p>By this you see Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not designed for Example, much less for Castigation and Amendment of the Punished Hell is not a Purgatory, <hi>as</hi> the Treefal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>so</hi> it lyeth: Judgement is the Final and Conclusive Act of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations: No, Eternal Punishments are neither Castigations, nor Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but meer Revenges, intended to Assert Divine Honour, to satisfie Justice, and in a word, intended to remove away from God, all that Dishonour and Contempt, that hath been put upon him by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

               <hi>End,</hi> is not only a Blasphemous, but a foolish Assertion. The last End can have no further End; indeed no end can as an end, because as an End it is last.

               <hi>Again,</hi> But you will tell me out of <hi>Grotius</hi> in the Place before cited, <hi>that God</hi> delighteth not <hi>in the Death or Punishment of those on whom it is inflicted, that is, to use the terms of</hi> another <hi>Learned Person</hi>; of whom I also made some mention before; that <hi>as a Governour or Rector he delights not in it,</hi> as expedient for himself, <hi>and that because</hi> the Right of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment <hi>is not existent for the sake of him</hi> that Punisheth, <hi>but for as much as all Punishment regards the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal <hi>or Society, it is existent for the sake of</hi> that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98179:88"/>But I have already proved, that the <hi>Obligation</hi> unto Punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth not solely, nor principally from the Injury the Publick may sustain, by Impunity of Crimes, but from the <hi>wrong,</hi> and Injury and <hi>Contempt of God</hi> that is in them; which whosoever seriously considers that Societies themselves are for God, and that Punishment it self is in the Nature of it vindictive, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily deny. Temporal Rewards and Punishments as well as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and Governments, are Divine Ordinances, and therefore directed to Divine Glory, as to their last end.

            </p>
            <p>I <hi>answer no,</hi> for 'tis impossible for any while immur'd in the Body, <hi>wholly</hi> to subdue the Influences of sense, and should none arrive at Heaven, but who had first arrived to a <hi>State of Perfection</hi> here on Earth, Heaven would be empty, and Hell full: That Perfection which is to be our aim on earth, cannot be our attainment, or our achievement but in Heaven.

We may check them and restrain them, but cannot destroy and era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them.

of Temptations without the Danger and the Power of any, and that he is the Great Example of Divine Life; but I also know the Devil who coming unto us doth find so much, coming unto him, <hi>found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him.</hi> For he not being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten or <hi>conceived</hi> in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of Generation, as all others are, with the <hi>common Fervency</hi> and Heat of Lust or Appetite, but on a Pure and cold <hi>Virgin,</hi> and by the Holy Ghost, had no Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence or Lust to be awakened and excited in him, as in us, by the many Objects presented daily to the sense. Now external causes work little without there be internal ones to co-operate, <hi>Inefficax est causa Procatarctica sine Proegumena.</hi>

            <p>But to return; <hi>Again, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life here is compared to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect things, to Fighting,</hi> to Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to Growing, to Walking, in a word (compared) to <hi>Motions</hi>; and what is Motion but Imperfect Act, <hi>Actus entis in Potentiâ, quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

in potentiâ.</hi> What is in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but in tendency unto Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but hath not yet arrived to it. In Motion there are two terms.

            <p>Truly Sir, <hi>Our Holiness is not our Righteousness to justifie our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>; 'tis too Imperfect and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to do that, 'Tis not our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent but Adherent Righteousness, not the Righteousness within us, but the Righteousness imputed to us, that must bottom all our Hopes; And I the rather say this, because I am a little jealous (by reason of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on which the Argument you urge is grounded) that you hold the Opinion which is now the Ascendent, That <hi>Imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Phancy, and that it was not the Design of Jesus Christ, nor of the Gosple to advance and set up that, but only that which inheres in us.</hi>

But since I am not sure, I shall say the less of it now.</p>
            <p>Only thus much I will say, that certainly <hi>the great Design of God in sending Iesus Christ into the world, was to make His Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the Righteousness of God Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, in opposition unto that of <hi>man,</hi> or the Righteousness of the <hi>Law</hi>; there being Nothing within the compass of the Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that can more contribute to illustrate and set off the Infinite and Transcendent Majesty of the great God, as to his Wisdom, Goodness and Justice, than the <hi>Declaration</hi> he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98179:92"/>
hath made from Heaven of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in Jesus Christ, that he is <hi>Just and a Justifier; Iust</hi> to Punish Christ that assumed on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the sin of man, and a <hi>Iustifier</hi> of those that are in Christ, whose Punishment he bore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inherent Righteousness, that</hi> Romanists <hi>and others so insist upon, is nothing as a Righteousness</hi> to boast of, but that <hi>Pharisaical</hi> one display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Blessed Saviour in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it which he gives in <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 18.10, 11, 12.</note> I <hi>thank</hi> thee O God that I <hi>am not</hi> this nor that, but <hi>do</hi> this and that: Wherein there is an Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God as Author and Inspirer of all the Good he doth, but withal an Exaltation and Advancement of self, <hi>I thank</hi> thee, there is the <hi>One,</hi> I <hi>am no</hi> Extortioner, no Adulterer, nor Unjust: I <hi>fast</hi> twice in the Week, I give Tythes of all that I possess, there is the <hi>Other.</hi> It was very well done that he fasted, that he gave Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet not so well as to Incourage him to boast

therein before God.</p>
            <p>Verily the <hi>Great Design of Jesus Christ and Christianity is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt, but to depress</hi> self; He that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries must not glory in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> not in anything he is, not in any thing he doth, though by <hi>Divine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</hi> For by <hi>that</hi> must all have been done, that either was or could be done by <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence, it must have been done by Gods As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance; and yet for all that, <hi>Room</hi> enough there was for Boasting and Glorying, then in that Transaction, whereas in this of Grace, or in the Dispensation of the Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality by Jesus Christ, there is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely none at all.</p>
            <p>No, the <hi>Design</hi> of Christ and Christianity is instead of <hi>Pharisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical and Legal</hi> Righteousness, which consisteth in our doing and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the works of the Law (as by Divine Assistance and enable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we can) to Institute <hi>another,</hi> that of the Son of God, the Lord our Righteousness, who is appointed to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98179:93"/>
invest and cover with <hi>his,</hi> all those that sensible of their own Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Imperfection, do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves unto him for it. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteousness exceeds the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> [which consists in their own doing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And the <hi>Christians</hi> doth Exceed it, his is the Lord Christ, it consists not in his own doing for himself, which is but short and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but in Christs doing for him, which is full and Perfect.</p>
            <p>That it doth so is evident,<note place="margin">Luke 18.13, 14.</note> in that the <hi>Publican</hi> in whom the <hi>Christian</hi> Righteousness is represented, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his head, as one <hi>ashamed of</hi> himself, and ashamed to come into the Divine Presence, not boasting of performances and works, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and acknowledging of sins, humbly imploring Grace and Mercy, was <hi>rather Iustified than the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi> that is, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Language, was Justified, and not the Pharisee. The like of <hi>Paul,</hi> who had as much according to the

Law to boast of as another, yet in the matter of Justification, when he comes to make Reflection on his best Performances, he in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, esteems them all but <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Dross</hi>; and is to far from standing on them in point of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that he first renounceth all Presensions of his own thereto, and then intirely devolves himself on Jesus Christ for it.

            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> By way of <hi>Premise</hi>; I lay it down as Fundamental in the Christian Doctrine and Profession, That <hi>there</hi> is <hi>no salvation but</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for it is he the Son of God <hi>that</hi> hath assumed humane Nature; <hi>that</hi> hath satisfied in it the Divine Justice; <hi>that</hi> by his

Obedience and Death, hath rendred God Attonable to man; and <hi>that</hi> hath procured all the terms (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be) on which Divine Majesty is pleased to transact again with us, and to receive us into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. <hi>He</hi> is the Prince of peace, that Glorious Intercessor, that hath gone between the wrath of God and us, but for whom Apostate <hi>Adam</hi> had been lost for ever, and there had been no more reserves for Happiness, or overtures of Grace for him and his Descendants, than for the faln and Apostare Angels. Christ is the <hi>Foundation</hi>-Stone, the <hi>Chief Corner</hi>-Stone in this building. <hi>God so lov'd the world, that he gave</hi> his Son: <hi>This is my beloved</hi> Son, through whom <hi>I am well pleased. Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared for me. Lo</hi> I come. <hi>The Lamb slain from</hi> the beginning <hi>of the world.</hi>

which we can be saved, but the name of Iesus, viz.</hi> That no other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to be acknowledged to have the Honour of being the <hi>Procurer</hi> of Peace and Reconciliation for us with the Divine Majesty, and of having <hi>marked</hi> out the way to glory, but only Jesus Christ, it being too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and momentous an Affair for any but <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or Jesus, one that is God as well as man, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to manage.

               <hi>whereby we can be saved:</hi> It is not the name of <hi>Moses,</hi> nor of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> nor <hi>Plato,</hi> nor of <hi>Mahome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Practical Belief of This is called faith in Christ</hi>; and is a thing so <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that without it 'tis impossible to please God, or be accepted with him. But as absolutely necessary to salvation, as belief is, it is not so in every <hi>Degree,</hi> or every <hi>Act</hi> of it; there are Degrees of Faith, and there are several Acts; there is a <hi>Formal</hi> and explicite apprehension and belief of this Truth in so many terms, that there is <hi>One God</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty, Propitiated and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned towards men; and that there is <hi>One Mediator,</hi> Jesus Christ God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath attoned and propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him. And as there is a Formal and Explicit, so there is a <hi>Virtual</hi>

and Implicit Apprehension and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it, which he has that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>that</hi> God is; <hi>that</hi> he is Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Benign; <hi>that</hi> he pardons sin; and <hi>that</hi> he is a <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> And one may as well implicitly and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Believe as Will. For as he implicitly and virtually doth <hi>will</hi> the means, although he doth not actually Reflect and think upon them, that effectually doth will the End; so he that does explicitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is gracious and well-pleased, He doth <hi>implicitly believe</hi> in Christ, in whom alone he is so; the explicit belief of the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the implicit and virtual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Premises.</p>
            <p>This Virtual and implicit Faith <hi>he</hi> may be said to have, <hi>who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God</hi> and <hi>worketh Righteousness,</hi> whether he be Jew or Gentile; for he that feareth God and worketh Righteousness, cometh unto God [by doing so;] and he that <hi>cometh unto God,</hi> must needs <hi>believe that

            <p>'Tis true; some of the <hi>old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> are Illustrious Instances of Faith, and of its vigor and power; for though the day of Christ were far off, yet they saw it clearly, and distinctly; <hi>Abraham</hi>; sayes Christ, <hi>saw my day</hi> [though] <hi>far off.</hi> So

            </p>
            <p>But yet I find them not <hi>explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Praying in the name of Christ,</hi> or doing any thing therein. <hi>So; hitherto</hi> (sayes he unto his own Disciples) <hi>you have asked nothing in</hi> my name;<note place="margin">John 16.24.</note> nor were they yet obliged, since he was not to be <hi>so</hi> exalted, but after he had drunk of the brook in the way; it was then the Comforter the blessed Spirit was to come, and give his Testimony for him in the Hearts of men, after which His Name was to be honoured.<note place="margin">John 16.26.</note>

Indeed the Antients prayed towards the <hi>Debir</hi> or Oracle, or Ark which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Christ, and so <hi>implicitly</hi> and figuratively prayed in his Name, but yet explicitly and formally they did not.</p>
            <p>I confess there are not a few, both Pious and Learned that herein dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from me, who believe the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> prayed Formally and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly in the name of Christ, and who apprehend themselves abundantly confirmed in that belief, by one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               <hi>Now therefore O God, hear the Prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary</hi> that lyeth Desolate, <hi>for the Lords sake</hi>; for the Lords sake, that is, say they, for Christs sake. But to omit that <hi>for the Lords sake</hi> may be refer'd to desolate, as it is in some Translations, wherein the <hi>Comma</hi> is not put to <hi>desolate,</hi> but to <hi>Sanctuary</hi>;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98179:101"/>
as if the sense were, that for the Lords sake the Sanctuary was desolate: I say omitting that, and taking it for granted to referr to <hi>hear, and lift up the light of thy countenance</hi>; yet whosoever doth compare it with the following Verses, must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that for the Lords sake is for Gods sake, for his Name sake, his Honours sake,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.19.</note> it being so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, v. 19. <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord consider and do it, defer not</hi> for thine own sake, <hi>oh my</hi> God; <hi>for</hi> thy Name <hi>is called upon this City, and upon this People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>thus much by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, I now apply my self to give a more particular answer to the Exception,</hi> by making evident and clear the several Propositions which I mentioned for that end, and which evinced and made out, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly illustrate this matter, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely satisfie your mind, in a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which cannot but be much abated already.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:98179:102"/>And <hi>first,</hi> That <hi>God is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by his</hi> Goodness <hi>to afford equal light to all.</hi> For though Divine Goodness be a Perfection essentially inherent in him, yet in the <hi>Exercises</hi> of it he is <hi>Free</hi> and Sovereign; the emanations of that Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not being as some imagine them, as Unrestrainable and necessary as those of Light from the Sun, and Heat from Fire. No, it is as well a great Truth as commonly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Divine Goodness is seated in the Divine <hi>will,</hi> and is (as it were) a certain <hi>mode</hi> of it; The Goodness of Almighty God, it is his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Good pleasure, Good-will, and consequently being but a certain kind or manner of will, must in all the exercises of it be as free as this is. Divine Goodness is nothing but the <hi>Divine Good-will,</hi> or a Propensity in the Divine Will to be doing all the Good that in his Infinite Wisdom he sees meet.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>will</hi> of God (if to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse thereof as of Mans, be not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98179:102"/>
too great Presumption) is not a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and Determined, but a <hi>Free</hi> and Undetermined Principle; and the <hi>Nature</hi> of it as to Liberty and Freedom, consisteth in an <hi>Unrestrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Unconfined Amplitude of Acting.</hi> Whereof he cannot doubt that seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously considers what (of another Purpose) I noted in my former Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi> That as what is <hi>lower</hi> on the Scale of Being, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in matter, is more <hi>confined</hi> and determined; so that what is <hi>higher,</hi> and superior, and more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, is in proportion according to the measure of its advancement on the <hi>Scale,</hi> more undetermined and <hi>free.</hi> For thus, a little to illustrate and set out the matter in Examples, <hi>Plants</hi> and Vegetables are less deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in respect of Action, than are the <hi>Minerals</hi> and Fossils. <hi>Again,</hi> the meerly Sensitive or Irrational <hi>Animals</hi> are less determined than the Vegetables; <hi>Men</hi> less than they; and not improbable, the <hi>Angels</hi> less than men; But <hi>God</hi> who is above
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98179:103"/>
them all, a Pure Act, possesses <hi>Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of Action, as Infinitely much transcending all theirs as is his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All Determination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is from <hi>Matter,</hi> all Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and Unconfinement from <hi>Form.</hi> God is therefore most Free and Undetermined, because most Formal and most Pure Act.</p>
            <p>But by this <hi>Infinite Amplitude and Liberty of Action,</hi> I would not have you understand me to intend <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>; as if the Will of God, which is the Principle and Rise of all External Actions, were <hi>meer</hi> will, and that in that Will, there were not also Wisdom, Justice, Goodness and Holiness. For it were to have a most Unhappy and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Apprehension of me, as if I coin'd a Notion of the great God, and of the freedom of his Will, that could not be endur'd by any that did either know, or fear him.</p>
            <p>No, But by this Amplitude of Action, or Liberty of the Divine
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98179:103"/>
Will, I mean no other but a <hi>most illimited Capacity and Power in God, to do what seemeth</hi> best <hi>and most</hi> agreeable <hi>unto himself to do</hi>; and that is <hi>best</hi> and most agreeable for him to do, which is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and congruous, and most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming all his Glorious Attributes, his Wisdom, his Benignity, his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, Majesty, &amp;c. as who would say, it is a Free, Unconfined, Unnecessitated, Undetermined Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of doing or not doing what he <hi>pleases.</hi> Now he doth what he pleaseth, that does whatever pleases him; and what can we imagine to please God, but what is (most) agreeable and congruous to him? and what is (most) agreeable and congruous to him, but what suiteth (best) with all his Attributes? So that it is not meer will that is the Principle or Reason of the Divine Actions, but, as the Holy Scriptures happily express it, it is <hi>counsel,</hi> counsel of Will. His Will is <hi>will,</hi> it is <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Free,</hi> but it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98179:104"/>
               <hi>wise</hi>; and <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Holy.</hi> God does what he will, and because he will. But yet whatever he does is Wise, and Good, and Holy, because his Will is so.</p>
            <p>But you will say, I grant enough for your Argument as now I have explained my self; for if <hi>the meer and naked</hi> Will <hi>of God be not the sole Reason or Rule of his Acting, but that his other Attributes do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and guide him in it, and so his</hi> Goodness and Benignity <hi>doth challenge some share; then seeing there is no Respect of mens Persons with him, but that in his sight all are</hi> equal; and also seeing Goodness <hi>obligeth not to make a</hi> Difference, <hi>where there is none already, 'Tis Unconceivable how</hi> any <hi>should be made, and how he should not deal</hi> alike benignly [<hi>be Bountiful and Good alike</hi>] <hi>to All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer; <hi>That indeed Benignity and Goodness hath a</hi> Great, <hi>though not the</hi> sole <hi>hand in moving</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Divine Will; <hi>that</hi> God
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98179:104"/>
is no Respecter of mens Persons; <hi>that</hi> both Jew and Gentile are as One to him: No humane Qualities of Wit and Ingenuity, of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Beauty, of Civility, or the like, which rather are Effects than Motives of Divine Favour, do at all affect or move him. <hi>Further,</hi> nor will I deny, that Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Benignity as such, obligeth not God to Discriminate or make a Difference between Man and Man; but then; as it obligeth not to make a Difference, so it obligeth not to make <hi>none,</hi> but it leaves him <hi>free</hi> to follow the motions of his other Glorious Attributes, such as either Wisdom, Soveraignty, or some other of his admirable Excellencies do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire and infuse him with. But chiefly his <hi>Soveraignty</hi>; for all his <hi>Practical</hi> and Active Attributes (for such I call these which (seem to) have an Influence upon him in his Acting) are all <hi>Will.</hi> Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath Place in All. And this brings me home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:98179:105"/>For do you ask me, <hi>how it cometh to pass there is a</hi> Difference <hi>made between man and man, Nation and Nation, in respect of the</hi> Light <hi>and Knowledge of God?</hi> I answer, God makes it, who dealeth not alike to all; and do you further ask me, <hi>Why he dealeth not alike to all?</hi> I answer further, it is to shew he is not <hi>bound</hi> to do what he does to any; and that if he sheweth mercy, it is because he <hi>will</hi> shew mercy; <hi>not</hi> from any obligation on him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, much less any engagement from the Object, but <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> of his own alone Election and Choice.</p>
            <p>It is for this Reason that he so delighteth in Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he <hi>not only</hi> sheweth them in <hi>mankind</hi> among particular and individual Persons, he chooseth <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and rejecteth <hi>Esau</hi>; and among Nations, he choosed the <hi>Iews,</hi> and he refused the <hi>Gentiles; of all the Nations of the earth, I have</hi> chosen you; and among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98179:105"/>
enlightens some sooner, others later, some more, some less: <hi>but also</hi> in the kind of <hi>Angels,</hi> thus he elected those that stood, and he rejected those that did not: All is to shew <hi>how Soveraign</hi> and how Free he is, in whatsoever he doeth. Hence the Scriptures speak so much of <hi>Election,</hi> and of Gods <hi>Purpose</hi> according to the Election, and of the <hi>Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> and of the <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Thus God in all the Exercises of his <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Free,</hi> not only from all Determination and Necessity of Nature, but from all <hi>engagement</hi> by any foreign and extrinsecal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects whatever in the Object; and it is to manifest himself <hi>so,</hi> that he so diversly dispenses it; to some he manifesteth more, to some less, to those in one way, and to others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; All according to the Counsel and Advisement of his own Will, and not according to the Humor, or Deserts of ours.</p>
            <p>So much for <hi>the first Proposition; but Secondly, Though God dispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98179:106"/>
not an</hi> equal <hi>light to all, yet to whom he hath dispensed least, he hath dispensed</hi> enough, <hi>if not to save them, (which many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and most Learned Fathers thought) yet he has to leave them</hi> Inexcusable, and without Defence, as our Apostle exprestes it,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> —<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Certain it is, as I proposed in the first Assertion, That the <hi>Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Almighty God in point of Light and opportunities of Grace, are <hi>not equal</hi> every where; for if they were, there would be as little <hi>Beauty,</hi> Ornament and Lustre, as <hi>Variety</hi> in them, since 'tis in the Moral World, as in the Natural; wherein Day and Night, and Diverse Graduations of the Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them, are necessary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, and to set it off with some Advantage and Beauty.</p>
            <p>But though there be a Diverse and <hi>inequal</hi> Dispensation of the Light, some have more, and some have less, yet so Extensive is Divine
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98179:106"/>
Goodness, and so large, that all have some, and that some (as little as it may be) <hi>Enough</hi> to silence Obloquy and Contradiction: A Truth that cannot be Refused in consideration of the <hi>Antient Gentiles,</hi> with more reason than it can be doubted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Antient Jews,</hi> who had the Oracles of God.</p>

               <hi>So both the Barbarian and the Greek Philosophy containeth in it a certain Portion of the Eternal Truth; which it Borrowed not, or derived from the Mythology of</hi> Bacchus, <hi>but from the

Theology of the Eternal Word him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Thus <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and indeed it is the main Design of his <hi>Stromata</hi> [Books he called so, because in them he collected these Dispersed Truths] to manifest the Consonancy and Agreement of the Old Philosophers, with the Verities of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>I know the Great <hi>Apostle</hi> affixeth on Philosophy an Epithete that seemeth not agreeable to this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, he calls it <hi>Vain Philosophy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.8.</note> and cautions those he writes to, with very much concern, more than once against it; but who ever well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he represents the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies, which in their Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were Divine and useful methods for happiness, as beggarly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Rudiments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> as <hi>Elements</hi> of the World, and under other <hi>hard</hi> names, he will not find himself sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at his doing the <hi>former</hi>; or necessitated to confine the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of which he speaks,<note place="margin">

               </note> as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> does, to the <hi>Epicurean</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:98179:108"/>
that denyed Providence, and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and care of God for the World.</p>
            <p>For I make no question but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seriously Reminds the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of Time wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle wrote, that it was after the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the Blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the bringing of the Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light in Jesus Christ, will easily agree that his Principal, if not his sole <hi>Design</hi> in so severely reflecting on the Ceremonies of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and on the Philosophy of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was to oblige both the one and the other to abandon and forsake their A, B, C. And <hi>that</hi> since there is a fuller and a clearer Demonstration, or Discovery in the <hi>Gospel</hi> of the way of Life, <hi>It</hi> is to wean them from those Darker Ones, that serv'd their turn before. And indeed, though God connived at men in the dayes of their <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> yet <hi>now</hi> he calleth all to Repent.</p>
            <p>And verily it is a great Truth,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98179:108"/>
that as <hi>he</hi> would not have the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish <hi>Law,</hi> so much less would he have the Gentile Wisdom to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the Gospel. All the <hi>Light</hi> before Christ, whether that among the Jews, or that among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, was but <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Star-light,</hi> designed only for the <hi>night</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but it is the <hi>Sun</hi> must Rule by <hi>Day.</hi> Now the Gospel <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> is the <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> the Sun that makes it; by whose Alone Light we must walk. For as in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Light</hi> afforded by the Moon and Stars, which is of great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and very much administers to our Direction, and Comfort in a Journey by night, yet in the day is <hi>none</hi>; The Moon and Stars that shine by night, and then make other things Visible, they are Invisible themselves, and Dark by day; So in the <hi>Moral</hi> world, not only the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> to the Jews, but that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> and Wisdom among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that before the coming of the Lord Christ, while it was yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98179:109"/>
Dark, was of extraordinary Use and Benefit, <hi>It</hi> is no longer <hi>new</hi> of any to them, nor to be insisted on, since He is come. For now 'tis <hi>broad Day.</hi> One would be glad of Moon-light, or Star-light, that is to travel by night; but he delires, and is out of his Wits, that would preferr it before the Sun by Day.</p>
            <p>By this time, you see how my <hi>Opinion of the Old Philosophy,</hi> that it was a kind of <hi>Star-light</hi> derived from the Sun of Righteousness, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, is so far from being in <hi>Derogation</hi> to the Gospel <hi>Grace,</hi> that <hi>it</hi> rather highly Illustrates and Establishes it; the Philosophers themselves, as well as the Prophets, being (as it were) as so many <hi>Stars</hi> that shined in a Dark Place, and with a borrowed lustre,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> until (in <hi>Peters</hi> own expression) the <hi>Day-Star</hi> arose from on high.</p>
            <p>But this Assertion, so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices lye against it, is not of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be entertain'd assoon as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98179:109"/>
wherefore I shall crave your leave to offer somewhat by way of Confirmation, which though I might do by very probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, both <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Paerabolical</hi> and Figurative way of Institution used by Jesus Christ, so conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>that of Plato</hi>; and the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory</hi> and Questionary, so like to <hi>that of Socrates</hi> and others, and <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> put upon Philosophy and Philosophers, not only by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in giving some of them the Preheminence, in an extraordinary manner, by a <hi>Starry</hi> Messenger sent on purpose, first of all others to behold the blessed Jesus in the Flesh, and to Recognize him King; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by the <hi>Antient Christians,</hi> who not only Permitted, but Assumed their <hi>Formalities</hi> and Customs. I say, though I might confirm this Truth by these, and many other very Probable Conjectures, yet I rather choose to go a Plainer, and more Demonstrative way, by particularly Instancing the several Doctrines of<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98179:110"/>
the Grave Philosophers, and Wise men among the Gentiles, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how agreeable they are to those of Christians; and that, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my self from all Temerity and Rashness in affirming what I have, as well as to afford an entertainment that will neither be unpleasing, nor unuseful to many. Indeed, it will put the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion beyond the Contradictions</hi> of the Atheist, to a Person that shall see them to be such as have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among <hi>wise men</hi> in the most Antient Ages, and <hi>Universally</hi> over all the World.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as to the <hi>Moral</hi> part of Christian Religion, there is not so much doubt but that the Heathen had a great Intelligence and Understanding of it, as whoever readeth <hi>Homer, Hesiod, Theognis, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Xenophon's Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomus, Isocrates, Tully</hi>'s Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and <hi>Seneca,</hi> cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; therefore I shall not stay you here with any long
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98179:110"/>
Discourse on that point.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98179:145"/>
Separation and Dis-union from the Body again, and what becomes of it then.</p>
            <p>He saith of the <hi>Soul,</hi> that <hi>before</hi> its Immersion into this Terrestrial Body, she was <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>This is his <hi>Notion</hi> of the Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of souls, and of the cause of their incorporation in <hi>terrestrial Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles</hi> or Bodies, which in his own terms you may read in his <hi>Phaedrus</hi> thus. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now supposing any of them to have had such Reflections, what Inference can be more easie (if we suppose them also to <hi>believe, what</hi> the <hi>Universal</hi> obtaining of Cruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Sacrifices over all the Earth compelled them to do, namely, that <hi>they were ordained of God;</hi>) I say, what <hi>illation</hi> or consequence can be more easie, than that God ordained not cruentous Sacrifices for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> as the <hi>only means</hi> of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin, or Propitiation of God; [it not consisting with Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to appoint so Unproportionable and Imperfect Ones:] but only in Relation to a <hi>Thing</hi> of more Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Sufficiency, which <hi>these</hi> did but <hi>Prefigure</hi> and Type? Thus, Christ was not far from any of the Gentiles, would they have (but)
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98179:163"/>
Groped after him. What the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial. Law</hi> given to the Jews was ordained for to them; Those <hi>Apish Observations</hi> might have proved to the Gentiles: such Imperfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices might easily have put them on the Quest of another more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Expiatory Sacrifice. As the <hi>Law</hi> among the Jews, so these <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances</hi> and Rites among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, did but point to <hi>Another: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Offerings thou wouldst</hi> not, that is, <hi>ultimately, and for themselves; In Burnt offerings and Sin-offerings thou hadst</hi> no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>viz. Terminatively</hi> and in themselves. These were Insufficient for Purgation of Sin, and Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; <hi>Then said</hi> I, <hi>lo</hi> I come, [I come] to do what they could not, <hi>viz.</hi> by making my <hi>Soul</hi> an Offering for <hi>Sin,</hi> to Purge and Take it away.</p>
            <p>I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, when I consider with how great care the Antient <hi>Mystae</hi> made it be conceived, <hi>that</hi> their <hi>Religion</hi>

or <hi>Hiatus in the Earth, one near another,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> many <hi>also above in</hi> Heaven right opposite to them. That <hi>betwixt these Openings there sate</hi> Judges.

to Report to them all that he had seen and heard, and therefore that he should exactly observe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And how agreeable (I say) is this <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>Erus,</hi> for so much of it as concerns Judgement, to <hi>that</hi> we have from <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that</hi> in the last day there shall a <hi>Separation</hi> be made, as of <hi>Sheep</hi> from Goats?

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98179:180"/>
down of Doctrines from hand to hand by Words, or else by visible and significant Actions,</hi> many things were transferred from preceding to succeeding ages. But Report or Oral Tradition and Delivery, is in it self a <hi>means</hi> of conveyance so <hi>Uncertain</hi> and fallible, that when it passes many hands, there can but little be <hi>consided</hi> to it in controverted matters; (for) then it proveth (most commonly) so diversified and various, that it is the <hi>cause</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, not the <hi>cure</hi>; the persons that convey it are so lyable either to <hi>mistake</hi> and Imposture, or to <hi>design</hi> &amp; Interest. Nothing is more Obvious, or more frequently experienced than this: For the <hi>Report</hi> of an Accident but at <hi>One</hi> End of the Town; albeit it may <hi>Retain</hi> (as for the most part it <hi>doth</hi>) some <hi>general likeness</hi> and similitude of the First and Original Truth: yet 'tis <hi>disguised</hi> with a thousand Errors; though perhaps in some places with more, in some with less, according to the different
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:98179:180"/>
Capacities, Numbers, Tempers, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Designs of those that have the conveying of it. Report the further it goes, the more it loses of Truth, and the more it gains of Error.</p>
            <p>In this Instance we have a lively <hi>Pourtraict</hi> of the <hi>False Religion</hi> of the Gentiles, and the plain <hi>Reason</hi> why it seemeth in so many things an Apish <hi>Imitation</hi> of the <hi>True</hi>; why it is so <hi>diversified</hi> in it self, and yet withall <hi>Retaineth</hi> such Resemblance and Conformity with Ours. It is because <hi>that</hi> all men came from one, and <hi>that</hi> all men came from one, and <hi>that</hi> not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Noah</hi> did instruct his children in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the True Religion, and in the Rites of it, and these again <hi>Reported</hi> to theirs, and so onward. But we may easily believe it to have hapned in this Tradition, <hi>as</hi> it doth in all others, that there was almost in every <hi>New</hi> delivery and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, (for the mentioned causes) some <hi>departure</hi> and Recess from the <hi>Former</hi>; and <hi>thence</hi> arose so
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:98179:181"/>
great <hi>Diversity</hi> in several parts of the World; yet (<hi>what also is in all</hi> Reports) notwithstanding so much Variation in <hi>Particulars</hi> as there was among them; all <hi>Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> some <hi>Agreement</hi> in the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> Greater or Lesser, as those that made them were either <hi>nearer</hi> to the <hi>first Reporters,</hi> or more Remote; or else were more or less <hi>Intelligent, Faithful,</hi> careful and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in Transferring them. <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and Designing men foisted in something of their own, and made the <hi>Catholick</hi> Traditions, to father their <hi>conceits</hi>; But <hi>others</hi> were more <hi>Honest</hi>: Hence the <hi>Variety,</hi> and hence the <hi>Agreement</hi> in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, those <hi>General Articles,</hi> Heads, or Points of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all men all the World over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly agree, and which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>common sentiments, though</hi> they be <hi>not</hi> (what by some they be imagined) <hi>Innate Idea's,</hi> or Notions ingrafted and imprinted
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98179:181"/>
on the Minds of Men by Nature, but (as I have evinced them) <hi>main</hi> and <hi>substantial Points of the first Tradition,</hi> and consequently, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> in all the following, with more or less Disguise; <hi>yet</hi> be they as <hi>Infallibly and Indubitably true, as if they were</hi>; since 'tis as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that they should obtain so <hi>Universally</hi> (all the World over) if indeed they were not the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a <hi>first and common Parent,</hi> as that they should be false, if they <hi>were.</hi> For grant one <hi>first Parent</hi> common to all the World, who could not but know the Truth, and that he so delivered things to his Children, and <hi>doubt</hi> O Atheist, the <hi>Reality</hi> of them, if thou canst!</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>How disguised</hi> soever Truth was in those Successive Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as necessarily it <hi>must</hi> have been in passing through so many and so diversly affected hands; <hi>yet</hi> as in other Reports, so also in these, when one becomes acquainted with the Original Truth, he will be able by
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98179:182"/>
               <hi>comparing</hi> and conferring, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Causes,</hi> or rather the first Occasions and <hi>Rises</hi> of <hi>Mistakes</hi> and Errors, [ what grounds there were for such; ] since it is as certain, that all <hi>Mistake,</hi> Error, Falsity hath for its bottom and foundation one or another <hi>Truth,</hi> as that <hi>Evil</hi> has some <hi>Good</hi> to ground it. <hi>This</hi> considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will administer abundant Light to those that mind it, for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the cogency of some of those Discourses I have made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, about the <hi>Christianity disguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many of the Gentile Rites</hi>; and it was for that Purpose, and with that Design, namely, that it might reflect upon them somewhat of strength and confirmation, that I made any mention of it here; for doing which, after I have offered this Apology, I hope I need no Pardon. Thus <hi>Tradition was one way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though Tradition was <hi>One</hi>; yet the <hi>only</hi> way it was not whereby the Gentiles became acquainted with

            <p>As for the <hi>Rise and Origin of heathen Inspiration of Oracle,</hi> I do not hold my self obliged to discourse thereof here, farther than as generally hinted, it may serve to regulate our Apprehensions in the present matter; and therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what <hi>Peripatetiques</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, who make <hi>it</hi> the Effect of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Preparations or Dispositions of mind, or what <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who ascribes it unto Qualities and Temperatures of places; I impute it to <hi>Religion,</hi> and to the state and condition of the first times, wherein Inspirations, while there was no other certain way of knowing the Divine mind, and of being guided by it, were far more frequent and common, than in the more remote. And <hi>no question</hi> but among the many other <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:98179:183"/>
given by <hi>Noah</hi> [Father of the Second World] to his Children, this was <hi>One,</hi> In <hi>Extraordinary Cases to consult</hi> God <hi>for Resolutions and Direction by</hi> (a way of) <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Worship and Religion</hi>; for instance, by Extraordinary Prayers, and Extraordinary Sacrifices; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acknowledged <hi>Nature</hi> of Religion and Worship, by qualifying and accommodating of the mind to God, to <hi>Invite</hi> and draw him down, and make him present to the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Worshippers. Thus <hi>all men</hi> all the world over mov'd by <hi>that</hi> Tradition, as by <hi>Instinct</hi> of Nature, did in all unusual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Emergencies, or when they would be counselled and resolved in any matter, immediately <hi>apply</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Deity; which the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> Doing <hi>in wayes</hi> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods not appointed by the <hi>true</hi> God, expected him in vain, <hi>he</hi> (for the most part) disdaining to approach unto them on such allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>whence</hi> it came to pass, they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:98179:184"/>
were <hi>abused</hi> by the <hi>False,</hi> (I mean the Devil) who readily espying and improving this Occasion, <hi>Slily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded</hi> himself; so that appearing <hi>in the place</hi> of God, he passed for <hi>him.</hi> It was thus the <hi>Devil</hi> became the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> or of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The superstitious invocated God in false wayes, who therefore refusing to approach, and visit them, the Devil takes the opportunity; he comes in his stead, and so passes for him.</p>
            <p>I am the more <hi>confirmed</hi> in this Opinion, by considering that among the Superstitious, there were the <hi>same wayes</hi> of <hi>Responses</hi> by <hi>Visions,</hi> by <hi>Dreams,</hi> by <hi>Voice,</hi> &amp;c. as among the truly Religious; as also by the <hi>Cessation and defect of Oracles</hi> or Inspiration, which on this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in this way, is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable than in any other. For when the Superstitious ceasing to be so, became (as in process of time they did) <hi>diffident</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of the Power and Aptness of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98179:184"/>
means, for effecting of the Ends pretended, and consequently either <hi>innovated</hi> New Rites, more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own conceits, or else grew <hi>cold</hi> and formal in the use of the Old; it followed, that they lost the advantage of such communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and direction from their Gods, as formerly they had, with their Faith and Zeal in those Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, that is, with that <hi>Religion</hi> which possessed them of it. False Religion made Oracles, and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ruin'd them. <hi>Sublata causa tollitur effectus.</hi>

            <p>But to circumscribe my self: That the <hi>True God did on occasion infuse into the</hi> Heathen <hi>some Divine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> is (in my Apprehension) scarce questionable by any that Reflects on <hi>Balaam.</hi> Again, and as little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable is it, that <hi>the Devil,</hi> after <hi>he had usurped the Place</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>assumed his Person, did frequently both say and do many things that were like him,</hi> to the end he might more craftily secure the cheat, and pass for what he was not. Though indeed at other times, he acted things like <hi>himself,</hi> which when he was received for God, he might the safer do; and all this as one that <hi>Personates</hi> another is wont, who <hi>must</hi> do something like the person he pretends to be, that he may pass for
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:98179:186"/>
him; and <hi>will</hi> do more like himself. Hence the Heathen <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylls</hi> had a <hi>mixture</hi> in both of Good and Bad. The former, that they might <hi>seem</hi> to come from God; the latter, <hi>because</hi> they came from the Devil.</p>
            <p>Now whether the <hi>Sibylls</hi> (for of these I principally design to speak, as having pressed their Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) were inspired in what they spake of Jesus Christ by the <hi>Deity</hi>; or (as you see I apprehend) prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Devil,</hi> is a matter not so necessary here to be decided. <hi>Both</hi> wayes are <hi>Possible.</hi> God inspired <hi>Balaam</hi> many hundred years before the Prophets arose, so that he spake as plainly and fully of our Saviour, as any of them all; and for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he</hi> gave as large and full a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto Jesus Christ, <hi>when come,</hi> as any in that time beside him. And that he might <hi>Predict</hi> or prophesie of him in the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and other Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for the <hi>same</hi> respects and Ends <hi>before</hi> he came, <hi>for</hi> which he did
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:98179:186"/>
confess him <hi>when come,</hi> is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be conceived by a Thinking and Attentive man. What if the Devil by the <hi>clearness</hi> of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in this particular, thought either to <hi>out-vye</hi> or to <hi>forestall</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in theirs? It would not seem a Design (if that were his) Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy either of the <hi>Envy,</hi> or the <hi>subtlety,</hi> for which he is so infamous. And what if he intended to <hi>verifie</hi> his Divinity to after Ages, by the Truth of his Prognosticks in the former? Besides, he might conceive it would intangle and perplex suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, as indeed it mightily hath; which to design was proper for him.</p>
            <p>Once, 'tis out of doubt that there were <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and those Antient, though <hi>how Antient</hi> it be not easie to determine. Certain it is, their Writings (of old) were held at <hi>Rome</hi> in extraordinary <hi>Veneration,</hi> there being <hi>Officers</hi> appointed, during both the Government of <hi>Kings,</hi> and that of the <hi>People,</hi> to preserve, and

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:98179:188"/>
Mothers were used to be Register'd in a fair Book. In the time of <hi>Christ</hi> a Priest dyed, and <hi>he</hi> was chosen in his Place; but when his name was to be entred, his Father <hi>Ioseph</hi> being dead, his Mother was sent for, who being asked, who was his Father, she answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that she never knew man, but that she conceiv'd by an Angel. So his Name was Register'd in these words, JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD, AND OF THE VIRGIN MARY.

            </p>
            <p>These, and other <hi>instances</hi> of <hi>Pious Fraud</hi> in former times, may be a just ground whereon to raise suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that <hi>some</hi> of those Verses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed <hi>Sibylls,</hi> were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but that all were <hi>so,</hi> or that the most, is not at any hand to be admitted, seeing they were insisted on so much, and appealed to so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
