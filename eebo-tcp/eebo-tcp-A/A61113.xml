            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A Coppie of a Letter to a great Peer of this Land, upon a strange discontentment betwixt him and his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lady, about the passing of two Manners unto his onely Sonne as brave and as noble a gentleman as this Kingdome afforded; the Letter I delivered unto his owne hand: he read it, and retired himselfe into an inward Chamber, wept much, and came out againe unto me, gave me thanks, and said never man desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more to gaine a woman than he did to gaine her: to this effect, never did I in al my time know such great dislike about such a slight occasion, betwixt two so vertuous, so noble, so beautifull and amiable, and so long reioycing in happy enioying one another, as will appeare in this dolorous discovrse.</head>
               <p>IT may seem strange unto your Lordship that a stranger should write unto you in this strange fashion, but then I beseech you in the feare of God, consider the strange course that you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that forceth me thereunto: for is it not strange yet most strange, that so noble, grave and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a man, should forsake his wife being a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, beautifull and religious Lady, make it not your owne case, and would you thinke it possible a wise man should be so transported, but beleeve it my Lord, such a thing may be, &amp; such a thing is and as the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> said unto King <hi>David, Thou art the man,</hi> that have behaved your selfe so undiscreely, and forwardly: for have not you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the wife of your youth, that vertuous and beautifull Lady, with whom you have lived with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62099:8"/>
great happinesse these twenty yeares: who hath approved her faithfull love and constancie unto you in so many strange and forraigne Countries, and adventured her selfe in so many dangerous passages both by sea and land, to yeeld you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment; now to forsake her when you are gray headed and stand more in need of your mutuall societie and comfort: but now to forsake her to grieve your friends, and make your enemies reioice; to forsake her to vex your selves, and to ruinate your estate, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the losse of your soules and everlasting happinesse, what greater want of wisdome can be shewed? you carry your selfe exceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly herein, that neither the perswasions of friends, nor the intreating of those that love you, nor so many pitifull teares from the faire eies of your Lady can move a reconciliation, but you fly from a distressed Ladie as if you were pursued by an armed enemie; was your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blood ever stained with such cowardlinesse? how may those renouned Princes of the united Provinces, who held and approved you so noble and valarous in Heroick Atchivements, both in Germany and when you were Lord Deputie of Ireland, be grieved to heare of this strange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in you? but this is not the worst disgrace, for herein you have dealt very unwisely, for you have reiected the counsel of the Prophets, of the Apostles, and of our Saviour Christ himself: and have followed the course of your violent passions, or else the shallow device of some giddie heads, as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did to his owne confusion: for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

Lastly, our Saviour Christ being demanded by the proud Pharises whether it was lawfull for a man to put away his wife upon every occasion, makes this most holy answer, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.4. <hi>And he answered and said unto them, have you not read that he that made them at the beginning, made them male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and said, for this cause shall a man leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his wife, and they twaine shall be one flesh, wherefore they are no more twaine but one flesh.</hi> Let therefore no man part asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom God hath coupled together.

To this effect I did much endevour to remove that conceit of mistaking, and reduce his Lordship to his former good opinion of my Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and disired that hee should passe by that as an error of a young man, and so ground his opinion upon the former and future carriage of my Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> towards him, then upon the fayling in one particular, which hope gave some satisfaction unto his Lordship, therefore I pray doe you second that with your best perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as occasion shall give you opportunitie; and let us not be discouraged to deale therein, because they are great men, for God hath ordained weake things of the world oft times to confound the mighty: And we may observe in the overthrow of <hi>Benhadads</hi> mighty army at the siege of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> whereof he made such proud boasts, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was given by a small number of 232 of the servants of the Princes of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.10.17. So likewise when <hi>Naaman</hi> that great Commander was so discontented with the message that the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> sent him to wash him seven times in the rivers of <hi>Iordan,</hi> the

good councell of his servants prevailed with him, and stood him more instead then if he had had the whole army of the King of <hi>Aram,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.11. and therefore let us use our weake meanes, and leave the successe unto the powerfull God of heaven and earth, who is able to make the lyon and the lambe, and the faulcon and the dove, to live peace able together, unto whose gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection I doe commend you, and so rest,</p>

               <p>IN the raigne of King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, passing through the Pallace yard, I saw two men very much urging one another to goe over into Saint <hi>Georges</hi> field to fight, one was M. <hi>Phillips</hi> the Queenes footman, the other was M <hi>Newman</hi> my Lord Chamberlaines footman; the English man a Protestant, the Irish a Papist.

When they saw that I would not leave them, the Irish man asked what religion I was of, I said I did beleeve to have salvation onely by the

infinite merits of the death and passion of my Saviour Iesus Christ, and so I hoped he did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: then I demanded what religion he was of, that could warrant him to fight in such a quarrell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he answered, happy man be his dole: In the end they were contented that I should have the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the businesse betwixt them: so we went to a Taverne in Kings street, where they fell out at Tables, and drew their swords, but the servants parted them, and upon the examination of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that did appeare, that the Irish man did the wrong to the English man, and called him boy? and that was the word of disgrace that M. <hi>Phillips</hi> would never be satisfied till he fought with him; therefore I did order, that M. <hi>Newman</hi> should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he had done M. <hi>Phillips</hi> wrong, and that he was sorry for it; and then M. <hi>Newman</hi> cryed mercy, and then they embraced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with such expressions of love, that they would live, &amp; die together in defending one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers quarrels, to this effect, and as it pleased God I parted this dangerous quarrell without drawing my sword, the Irish man was a proper tall man, but M. <hi>Phillips</hi> was young, but a brave spirit.</p>

               <p>ANd now that I am upon the point of peace-making, give me leave to give some few dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the better effecting of this charitable worke.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humbly pray unto the God of peace, and lover of concord, to give you wisedome and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and frame the hearts of the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62099:16"/>
to unity and concord, then get them into bond to stand to the arbiterment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conferre with the parties alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and then use all the strongest arguments you can to weaken the party you speake unto, by telling him what advantage his adversary hath of him, his great friends, his able parts, and resolute minde, and use the like arguments to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Try if a wife, a childe, or friend, may not be a fit agent to perswade in these differences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider what a happy and pleasing thing it is in the sight of God and good men to see neighbours to live together in love and unity.</p>
               <p>But in my long trading in these charitable busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, I will declare unto you two very rare and unusuall means which I have made use of:</p>
               <p>A gentleman of great worth, and Knight of the Parliament house, and his Minister of great worth and of great parts also, having spent much money in suites of Law in the high Commission Court.</p>
               <p>I humbly intreated my Lord <hi>Mandevill,</hi> that noble peace-maker to take into his consideration they being his neare neighbours, who tooke great paines to order the businesse, and end the suites, and gat them into bands, but they were both so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, they brake their bands, and refused the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and procured Commissions out of the high Commission Court to examine witnesses, I think almost a fortnight together, to their great charge, and to make such misdemeanors appeare to that Court, that some of their good friends thought would make them be fined a thousand pound at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62099:16"/>
the least. The Commission was sealed up, and sent to <hi>Huntington</hi> to be returned into the high Commission Court. I was sorry to see all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour lost, &amp; hopes frustrate, yet it pleased God to put a conceit into my head, and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with two that were nearly allyed to the Knight of the Parliament house, and told them we must make an end, either with the consent of the parties, or without their consent; for the first, that the suit was impossible; the second, how could it be, that I will tell you? so we fell to writing, first, that all suites in law should cease: secondly, that thus much the Knight of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament should give the Preacher for rearages for his tythes, and then to prevent suites hereafter, the Knight of the Parliament should give thus much a yeare for composition for his tythes. When we had done, I told them I will engage my selfe to be bound in this summe, that the Minister shall stand to this, and you shall doe the like to me; That the Knight of the Parliament should doe the like, we entred into bands, and then sent for them, and when they saw that we stood enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for them, and it was not their Act they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to that end, and entred into five hundred pound bonds a peece to stand to that end, thus it pleased God to take off this tedious and dangerous businesse.</p>
               <p>The other concerned my selfe: in my old age a gentleman had made a scandalous report of me, that I should send a Cart upon the Sabbath-day to remove certaine goods, which was very false, yet he made report of it to a noble friend of mine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62099:17"/>
which answered very much for me, and would not beleeve it, used many meanes to vindicate my reputation; but he would not be satisfied, but gave credit to the report of some lewd malicious companions: so in the end I grew so foolish, that I sent him a challenge, &amp; sent my man with it to meet me the next day by eight of the clocke in the morning, upon such a Common, betwixt two Woods, to meet single and with single swords. I came to the place at the time appointed, and beat the ayre, but he came not; I rode to his gates to call him, but he returned his answer in a kinde letter to me, did acknowledge that he had done me wrong, to give credit to the report of such ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and malicious knaves, and that he would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my noble friend how much I was wronged, to this effect, and afterwards we continued very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends during his life: this I doe relate, but would have no man follow this example, except they will doe (and so I hope we should have done) As two knights in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, as I take it, that the one was Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other Sir <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> two valiant Knights, and brave souldiers, and contended for a peece of ground, and spent more money in Law then they were willing; and seeing it was unfit for soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to follow suites in Law, they resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it with their swords, and appointed a day to meet upon that ground, and there met, but considering better of it, that their valour was well knowne, and what a vaine thing it was for them to adventure their lives upon such a quarrell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they grew to make offers each to other of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62099:17"/>
the ground, and contented who should give or take it: a vaine example of two so noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knights; but I would now advise all men to take heed they be not put to that adventure, for men to meet in the field, the devill will put these conceits into their mind that it is not for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to appoint the field and not to fight, and if they fight, then it will be their dishonour to give over with this disadva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, thy enemy hath given thee more wounds then thou hast done him, and so will urge them to fight still untill either one or both are slaine: as was seene in the ever to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented example of Sir <hi>George Wharton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Steward</hi> that stood upon tearmes of honour, and were both slain in the field.</p>

               <head>A Copy of a Letter to my Cousin M. <hi>Bullie,</hi> a grave Preacher in new England.</head>
               <p>MY very louing Cousin, seeing we can no longer enjoy your company in old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, we would be glad to heare of your safe arrivall in new England, and I feare in this little time you finde by experience that all things are not answerable to your expectation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that your friends that did so earnestly desire your stay were not altogether mistaken, when they told you that you should find many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in that place. Well, howsoever God, the God of infinite wisedome, that hath in his eternall Councell appointed us our going out and our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62099:18"/>
comming in; that hath in his providence thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and inclined your heart unto this course, I trust also he will sanctifie both your prosperity and adversity in the fame, that all shall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the best, to further you to that everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting rest which he hath prepared for his children in the kingdome of heaven; and therefore now let us be partakers of the truth in both, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the comfort of your freedome in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and in your publique exercises in the holy worshipping of him, for that is the main thing that I desire to be satisfied in: and whether you have yet setled any uniforme course to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practised for the sanctifying of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and when you begin and end the same, as also for prayer and reading the holy Scriptures, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, and singing of Psalmes, with the manner of the administrations of the holy Sacraments, and how far you doe still hold the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church of England, and wherein you differ from the same, or if you have not yet esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished such a course, but leave every Minister to order his peculiar Congregation to his own Rule, whether you doe not finde great variety and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in mens opinions in that way, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience and danger may grow thereby, through sects and schismes, that of necessity is like to fall thereon. And thus good Cousin you see how bold I am to trouble you with so many quaeries in a forraign land, when it is more need to make enquiry into my owne sinfull and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, to see what is done there in matter of reformation, repentance, and amendment of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62099:18"/>And therefore now though we are far remoted in the body, yet let us be present in spirit and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and although you are retyred to a place of more privacy, and where your eyes (I hope) doe not see such abominations to vexe your heart with as ours doe, yet pitty us and pray for us; and on the other side, be not, oh be not so secure, nor put your confidence in your select company, nor in those remoted woods and solitary mountaines; but remember what befell unto <hi>Lot,</hi> that was righteous <hi>Lot</hi> whilest he lived in <hi>Sodome</hi>; but when he would fly out of <hi>Zoar</hi> to a solitary cave in the mountaines, with his two daughters, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those abominable sinnes there, that his soule would have abhorred once to have thought on in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and therefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall, our help is in the name of the Lord, that hath made heaven and earth, who is able to help us in all places, and at all times, and so beseeching the God of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ the shepheard of his sheep, through the bloud of the everlasting covenant make us perfect in all good works, and to doe his will, working in us that which is pleasant in his sight through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to whom be prane for ever and ever.

               <p>MY very loving and kind Keeper, although you have been long out of sight, yet you have been oftentime in minde, and often in my thoughts and prayers unto God for you, as I had good cause when I remember the great care and love that you and M. <hi>Hutchinson</hi> did shew unto me when I was prisoner in your house. Oh that it would please the Lord to make me as happy a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner unto you, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was unto his Keeper at Philippi, whereof you may read in the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, who at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> first comming into the prison, was in such a woefull estate of a persecuting Infidell, yet that night being terrified with the earthquake
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62099:24"/>
and feare of the losse of his prisoners, would des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately have murthered himselfe, but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having pitty and compassion upon him, cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>Doe thy selfe no harme, for we are all here</hi>: and then with feare and trembling he fell downe before them, and brought them out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and said, <hi>Sirs, what must I doe to be saved</hi>? and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them, <hi>to beleeve in the Lord Iesus, and he and his houshold should be saved</hi>: and so through the Lords great mercy they were converted and baptized, and greatly reioyced that he and all his house beleeved in God. Now though I have not seen you so desperately minded to kill your selfe with your sword for feare of my escape, yet I must needs say, I have seen you ready to wound your soule with fearefull swearing, and excessive drinking, and how greatly this may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger your soule and body also you may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it: You remember well that the Lord will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth testifie, that <hi>drunkards shall not inherit the Kingdome of God, Galat.</hi> 5.22. but of these sinnes I have admonished you of when I was with you, and through the Lords great mercy found some reformation thereof, in that I did see you refraine from such excessive drinking, and sometimes abstaine an oath, and reprove others for swearing. I know that is a hard matter sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cast off such growne sinnes, and those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you have been so long accustomed; but on the other side also, I know it is an easie thing unto our omnipotent God to set your feet into the way of peace. Oh therefore unto that mercifull God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62099:25"/>
to convert your soule, and to set your feet into the way of peace. Oh therefore pray unto that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord, and importune him with earnest and zealous prayer day and night, untill he hath wrought in you that blessed worke, to give you grace not onely to see your sinnes, but give you also true repentance and godly sorrow for them, that you may now loath them more then ever you loved them, and utterly detest and abhorre them, though they be as deare unto you as your right eye, and as profitable unto you as your right hand, yet cast them off, and cast them from you; for it is better for us to enter into the kingdome of heaven so maimed and spoiled of our sinnes, then to enjoy them here for a short time, and then both soule and body to be cast into hell fire, where there is weeping and wailing in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting darknesse. And now that you may escape those everlasting torments, and attaine to the kingdome of heaven and the righteousnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you must settle your selfe to the constant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of those holy duties of prayer and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God; and you must take unto you that Christian resolution, that no feare of mans displeasure, nor the mockes and scoffes of wicked men should make you never to neglect the same; I meane, you must not be ashamed to goe to Sermons, nor to keep holy the Sabbath-day, nor to pray with your wife and servants, though all the drunken companions in Kent should rayle or ieere at you for the same; but remember that those that are ashamed of our Lord Iesus Christ, and of his holy service on earth, he will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62099:25"/>
to owne them in the day of judgement, and leave them to their devillish masters, and to those hellish torments which he hath prepared for such base slaves that doe preferre the service of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill before the service of God: And then will they cry unto the mountaines to cover them, and to hils to fall upon them, rather then they would heare the dreadfull sentence of, <hi>Goe ye cursed into hell fire, prepared for the devill and his angels</hi>; and the wofull execution that followes thereupon, to be closed up for ever in utter darkenesse, and there to be tormented with those damned spirits, where in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of their carousing and filthy speaking, they shall have weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth for evermore, and never shall behold the face of any man, nor heare the voice of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to yeeld them comfort; but as they deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves in swearing and staring, in cursing and raging, so they shall have their fill thereof among those raging and furious damned spirits, and yet shall not procure one drop of water to coole their tongues, although they be tormented in those hellish flames, as you may read in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dives,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. and then my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Keeper, is it not much better with <hi>Moses,</hi> to chuse rather to suffer afflictions with the children of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season, and then to goe to everlasting torments. And what if you be mocked and pointed at for a Puritane, and be counted a mad man because you separate your selfe from the company of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wretches and abhominable drunkards, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62099:26"/>
doe now resolve to serve the living God with an honest heart; nay, what if you should be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and imprisoned for his name-sake? Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets and holy men of God in former times; and so likewise did the Iews persecute our Lord Iesus Christ, and said, he was mad, and had a devill: And if they dealt thus with him our Lord and Master, shall we looke for a greater priviledge? nay, let us with a holy resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion arme our selves to encounter with all their temptations; and with the blessed Apostle rejoice that we are accounted worthy in such an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause, and to be made like unto our Saviour Christ in any sort; for he entred into his kingdome of glory through many tribulations. I am a little the more earnest upon this point, because even while I was with you, I feare there were some that did with scoffing and geering seeke to discourage you in those good courses whereunto you were so tractable: But I beseech the Lord of mercy streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your faith, that you may not onely come se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I say unto you likewise, ioy shall be in heaven for one sinner that converteth, more then for ninety and nine iust men which need no amendment of life: and so humbly praying to that blessed Lord, that you and yours, and I and

               <p>THis letter I sent to Master Commissary by an understanding man, and wished him if the Commissary gave him a shilling for his paines he should not refuse it, and appointed him to run to Bedford, that I might know the Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries answer. The Commissary was a very stout and cholericke man, and when he had read the letter he stampt and fumed as if he had been wilde, and returned me this answer: That he would iustifie that he did, and if I had any thing to say to him, I must meet him tomorrow at his Court at Amp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thill, and so I did; and when he was going to his Court in his pompe, I met him in the street, and asked him if he was the Commissary, and he said, yes: then I told him, I doe charge you with suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treason against the Kings Royall person, and so then commanded the Constables to doe their office, and then there was a great hurrye to fro, as if we had been driving an Oxe to the butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers stall. He made great offers to put in bayle, and that he might goe to the Church to take order for the dismissing the Court; but I would give no consent, but told him, I knew not whether hee might sit there, being thus attached upon treason; yet he prevailed with the Constables, and they went with him to the Church, and I rode to the Church gate, and sent in the Constable to bring him away, he intreated to have a little longer time to dissolve the Court, and there was such a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62099:28"/>
order for the sending of him up to the Councell; and told him that I had charged him with suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treason against the Kings Royall person; and desired his care to send him up safely by the Sheriffe, or else to send him to Bedford Goale that he might be forth-comming. So Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> said, he must do one of them, and would have knowne of me what were the words which hee should say; but I answered him, that was not so fit for me to tell, that I must make that knowne to the Councell, and so made hast towards London; and then I saw Master Commissary and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and three or foure more with him afoot, as though they had been going to hunt the Foxe: they called unto me, and would have me stayed to see if they could have taken up the businesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Master Commissary and I, but I would not come at them, but hastened to my Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and related unto him the businesse betwixt Master Commissary and I: So his Lordship said, that was somewhat irregular, yet he should not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe me in my devotion.

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary did solemnly protest that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute us because we kept a fast, and prayed for the King; but heard that it was so well performed, that if it had been with authority, he would have been at it himselfe, and then I did acknowledge that I was sorry that I did not apprehend it so: To this effect then we did consult what might be done
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62099:29"/>
for the repayring of Master Commissaries repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: so we resolved that Master Commissary should put in a bill against me, and I should not plead against it, and so a writ of enquiry should go out to enquire what damage this was to Master Commissary; and he promised me, if they gave him two hundred pound, he would not take a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it: so he put in two bils of complaint what great damage he was put unto; and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was well esteemed of noblemen and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen now they eschew his company, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I made this short answer:</p>
               <p>When M. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missary shal clear himself of the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of treason against the Kings Royall person, and cleare his bill of untruths : I hoped I should be at more leasure to make a longer answer, in the meane time desired to be dismissed of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable court; so they gave him a hundred pound da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which I tendred unto him, and he told it, and put it up againe every penny; I gave him a piece of plate with two hearts joyned together, and this inscription, <hi>Amantium ira amoris, redinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratio est</hi>: and so we continued very loving friends to his death; and he told a gentlewoman of great worth, his loving neighbour, that never any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did him so much good to commiserate this trouble and vexation that he had done to others, and so grew one of the best Commissaries, and died lamented.</p>

               <p>SIr, the blessed Apostle having used that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement intreaty unto the Romanes, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themselves to the service of God, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 12. In the next verse he doth second that intreaty, with this excellent exhortation: And fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion not your selves like unto this world, but be ye changed by the renewing of your minds, that you may prove what that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God is.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I beseech you give me leave to make this profitable application to you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whom it hath pleased God to call now unto an office of great dignity in the common wealth. And humbly I beseech him likewise to give you a wise heart to mannage it to his glory, and the good of his Church, and the comfort of your owne soule: and that you may so doe, take heed you doe not fashion your self like unto this world, not like to a worldly Sheriffe, especially in these two thinges, neither in your Officers nor in your Attendancy, for it is oft the custome of carnall minded Sheriffes to receave there under officers by tradition whatsoever their condition be; but I pray be not you in that fashion, but follow that grave and holy directon that <hi>Iethro</hi> gave to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> the 18. the 21. <hi>Moreover, provide thou amongst all thy people men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truely, hating covetousnesse,</hi> and therefore I pray make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62099:30"/>
a diligent inquisition amongst your officers, and if you finde one lewd Bayliffe in all your pack let him be discarded, and an honest man put in his place; againe, it is the fashion of many vain glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sheriffs to exceed so in the number of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and in their excessive entertainments, that they are forc't either to end their house keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their office, or else to lay such heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and wracking rents upon their tennant, as gives them just cause to lament the prodigallity of their landlords Sherivalty seaven yeares after; but I beseech you take heed you be not in any sort drawne to like of this fashion, neither by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of others, nor by the volentary offers of your honourable friends which at this time it may be will be too forward to adde fewell to the flame of your one ambition; but I pray consider your own revenue is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent both for your own ranck, and for the support of that office which is imposed upon you, and thanks be unto God for it, Master <hi>Oliver Luke</hi> is well known and well esteemed of in the country without the liveries of great mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures, and therefore I pray stand firme upon your owne bottome, and let your own vertues make you still to be honoured, and not your excesse lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in my poor conceit it is more for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to shew your selfe in the habite of true judgement and moderation, and attended with your own servants, then to encrease your number with borrowed companies and decke your troopes with the gay feathers of other birds. Again consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you are to entertaine Judges of the land, men of wisdome and gravity, and such as should punish
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62099:30"/>
excesse and prodigallity as well as theft and usury, besides these times are so peaceable that they need not such troopes of horse or Squandrons of foote to guard their persons nor such pompe nor bravery to divert their minde from the better consideration of these great and serious imployments that they are to goe about.</p>
               <p>Lastly in the feare of God lay this consideration well to your heart, how unseasonable &amp; unseemly a thing it is to make that a time of feasting, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward jollity, which should be a time rather of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, wherein both Magistrate, and people should bewaile their own sins and the sins of the land, which at such times are so apparant, and for the which many of their Christian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do suffer such heavy Iudgements; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we were in the right fashion, we should weep with those that weep, and remember those that are in bonds as though we were bound with them, and those that are in affliction as if you were also afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. Thus did that noble Magistrate <hi>Ezra</hi> fast and mourne for the sins of the people and thus did <hi>David Samuel</hi> the 1. the 3. the 35. and therefore what great cause is there for our Magistrates to fast and mourn when they hear of so many thefts and murthers and abhominable sins committed in our streets, and for the which the Lord might iustly bring his fearfull Iudgements upon the whole land. And thus good <hi>Sir Oliver</hi> through the Lords mercy, you may see that they are very proposterous in their house, &amp; shew great want of true iudgement and Christian like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thinke these fit times for feastings, pompe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62099:31"/>
and outward bravery. And therefore I beseech you take heed unto your own heart, and let neither the vaine examples nor the violent perswasions of vain glorious men, drawe you into their vaine errours, but evermore remember that most holy saying, and righteous censure of our Saviour Christ, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. That which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God, and therefore hold fast that word of truth and follow the holy directions thereof which is able to make you wise unto salvation, and both in these and all other your affaires first prove what that good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and perfect will of God is, and doe that with all diligence, and then assure your selfe if you should fail of this fading honour that they so eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hunt after, yet you shall have everlasting honour in the sight of God, and of his glorious angells in the Kingdome of heaven.

               <head>A Copy of a letter to his brother <hi>Nicholas Spencer,</hi> to disswade him from his inordinate delight he took in Cock-fighting, which soon after he happily and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely gave over.</head>
               <p>IT is said of the churlish Inne-keeper of <hi>Bethlehem Luke</hi> 2.7. who entertained so many guests in the Inne, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, were thrust out into the stable, because there was no roome for them in the Inne: but let us in in the fear of God take heed of such Jewish tricks, lest in the end we force our Saviour Christ to leave us in the sight of our sins, and ingratitute, and then it will cost us many a grievous sigh, many mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teares before we finde him againe, read <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. Nay, so wofull shall our estate be that it shall be never out of our minde: and now out of my brotherly love unto you I must admonish you of that bewitching and vain pleasure of Cock fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein you are so strangely transported that both my selfe and many of your faithfull friends wi<hi rend="sup">th</hi> grief of heart discern a great alteration in your affections to those courses of religion wherein heretofore you have shewed your selfe more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and zealous. I beseech ye in the fear of God consider to be a stunling in religion is a fearfull thing, but to go ten degrees backward with <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> diall is most intollerable; alas shall we begin in the Spirit and end in the flesh, shall we be such greedy Elues in our pleasure, sell those heavenly ioyes and blessed hope of our heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62099:32"/>
for a messe of vaine delights: Oh consider how farre we are from the holy zeale of those blessed Saints in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook both their goods, wives, and children for the glory of God and the safety of their soules: What vaine wretches shall we approve our selves to be, if we will not forsake our vaine pleasures? It is not your faire house, nor your children, nor loving wife I perswade you to forsake, it is the vaine and unprofitable sport of Cock-fighting, which brings ruine to your state, and the endangering of your everlasting happinesse: and therefore if either a desire to preserve your estate, or to preserve your everlasting inheritance might prevaile, my suit were soone granted. But it may be you will say, if I can prove this you will give over Cock-fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Well, upon that condition I will take some paines to make it manifest: First, to the matter of the ruine of your state, I referre you to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your particular exspences of those occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and I pray let Sir <hi>William Dyers</hi> ruinate estate be a meanes to make you take heed by other mens harms; for the matter of discontentment I appeal to no other judge then your loving wife, which can tell you what discomforts she oftentimes findes in your long absence, &amp; the dangers that doth fright her when she considers that you are in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of such swaggering companions, for the latter which is the maine point I purpose to insist upon being a matter of such hign concernment, first because you make that a cause of your jollity and merriment, which should be a cause of your griefe and godly sorrow, for you take delight in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62099:32"/>
enmitie and cruelty of the creatures, which was laid upon them for the sinne of man, for the earth was accursed with thorns and briers for our sins, and therefore the blood-shedding of the creatures should rather teach us to shed teares for our sins: thus did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when he heard the Cock crow he went out and wept bitterly: I would to God you Cock-masters would make that use of these Cocks. Secondly it is dangerous unto your soul in regard of the time that you mispend, for if ye must give an account of every idle word that we speak <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. How much more of idle houres and dayes, and if you did keep as strickt an account as you do of your houshold expences you should at the weekes end see what a heavy reckoning you should make when you shall see before your eyes thus many houres of such a day and so many daies of such a week, I have spent in my vain delights, and thus few houres in the service of my God; well, howsoever we are loath to come to this account now, yet we shall be one day, brought to it whether we will or no. Thirdly it is dangerous to your soul in regard of the company with whom you do converse who for the most part are either swearers drunkards, or licencious people, now if it be most true that the prophet saith <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.25. <hi>With the holy, thou shalt be holy, and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.</hi> Then on the contrary it must needs be, that with the wicked we shall learn wickednesse, and with the prophane we shall learn prophanes, for it is a hard matter to handle pitch and not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field with it, or to lie among thornes and not be pricked with them, as the Prophet saith
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62099:33"/>
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.6, 7. <hi>But the wicked shall be every one as thornes thrust away because they cannot be taken with hands, but the man that shall touch them must be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with iron, or with the shaft of a speare, and they shall be burnt with fire in the same place.</hi> Therefor dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you did rightly consider of the hatefull and infectious qualitie of the wicked, it will make you stand upon thorns while you are in their company and to bewaile the hardnesse of your heart which hath not felt them such pricking thornes all this while.</p>
               <p>Lastly it is dangerous to your soule in making your soul guilty of many other mens sinnes, by drawing away many a poore man from his honest labour whereby he should maintaine his wife and children, to spend his time and money in such an idle manner, but also you are guilty of many great mens sins whilest you see and hear the glorious Name of God dishonoured, and dare not, or will not reprove for the same, consider what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith. 50.16. <hi>But unto the wicked said God, what hast thou to do to declare mine ordinances, that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed, and hast cast my words behinde thee? For when thou seest a thiefe, thou runnest with him, and thou art partakers with the adulterers. vers</hi> 22. <hi>O consider ye that forget God, least I teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi> Now therefore I beseech you observe that those that run with the wicked and are partakers with the ungodly in their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are those whom the Lord shall tear in pieces: thus you see that not onely the wicked themselves, but also their associates and partakers shall be torne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62099:33"/>
in pieces in the day of Gods fearfull wrath: O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this, sweet meat must have sower sawce, and then I trust through the Lords great mercy you will utterly refuse it upon those tearmes: for what were it to gaine the whole world and to loose our soules.</p>
               <p>But to conclude if neither perswasions nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations may prevaile with you to break the neck of your Cock-fighting pleasures, consider wel with your self that the Lord hath put you as it were into the Cock-pit of the round world to fight his battel against the flesh, the world and the divel, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est striking, the sorest hitting, and the cunningest fighting Cock in the world, who is onely to be wounded with the spurres of faith and piety, and that all those that wil overcome in this battell must be thorowly fed with the word of God, and dayly breath with prayer and, meditation, whereby they strengthen their faith, and sharpen the spurres of their holy zeale: and those that neglect this meanes let them brag never so much upon their own dunghill, yet when it comes to a sound tryall they will prove themselves to be brand fallen Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and likewise consider that every houre idely spent, and every vaine word that proceeds out of your mouth is as it were vain to your soule: and all unlawfull pleasures like hovells upon the spurres of your devotion: and then with wisdom consider what an unlikely, or rather impossible a thing it is for a poor famisht Cock pitifully vained and thus hung and hovelled to overcome a Cock of that wonderfull strength and devilish spirit that you are matched withall. Again suppose that those that sit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62099:34"/>
in the lower ring of the Cock-pit are the Divells and wicked Spirits, and those that sit in the upper ring of the Cock-pit are the glorious Angels and blessed Saints, both behoulding this doubtfull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, though with contrary affections, the angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing when they see you fight this spirituall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell like a good souldier of Jesus Christ, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits wohping and hallowing when they see you strike faint, fight like a Craven, and fall beastly, and hear dear brother that we make our selves a laughing stock to this wicked spirits: let us pray unto our Lord Jesus Christ to strengthen our faith and to assist us with his grace that we may resiist the devill and make him flie from us and in the end tread Sathan underfoot and give us a crown of immortall glorie.

               <p>First therefore let that blessed Lord be humbly fought unto by fasting and prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly let the distressed gentleman be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his own house unto some other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place well situate for aire, and spacious fields: to walk in and to do other exercises.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, settle with him a religious discreet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that may constantly pray with him and read unto him evening and morning, and upon all good occasions to keep him company.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, place about him six honest servants men of good discretion and resolution that may be ready upon all occasions to aid and assist in the well ordering of him according to the dirrections of him that shall undertake the government of him, to watch with him, to ride with him, and to exercise with him in shooting or bowling or any other exercise that shall be thought fit for him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let them be very carefull and take heed that there be no knives, nor swords, nor any woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding instruments left in the roomes wherein he comes, nor worn by others, that he may suddenly snatch at them for their temptations are many times very violent and their resolution sudden and disperate.</p>
               <p>Sixtly let his apparell be decent and comely of cloth or plaine stuffe without lace or any such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62099:35"/>
trimming, and let his attendants give him no titles of honour but in civillity call him Master <hi>Rotchester</hi> or Master <hi>Carr,</hi> and when he doth any thing wel, then to shew the more respect unto him: but otherwise to slight him, as those that are set over him to command him, and not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him.</p>
               <p>Sevently, let his diet be sparing and moderate, rather to support nature then to pomper the flesh: veale, lambe, pheasant, larkes: smelts, troutes, pike, pearch, also let him fast often and pray much, let him refraine from all kinde of wines and strong drink, if you can by any meanes, let him sleep six or seven houres in the foure and twenty and not above.</p>
               <p>Eightly, let him be held constantly to prayer, and reading an houre in the morning and an hour in the evening, and if the weather be fitting and his strength answerable let him walke a mile out right in the morning and evening and if you finde him inclining to a sottish humer put an armour upon him and beat a drum before him and let one attyre himselfe like a Captaine and put on his gorget and a plume of feathers in his hat &amp; a trunchion in his hand and make to march and exercise his armes, or else set him upon a bounding horse and trot the ring and run a career: and in these martiall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses let the Captaine command him as his souldier, and if he finds him peevish and froward give him a good knock upon his helmet, and if he finde him willing and tractable then to commend and praise him.</p>

               <p>Lastly, because these maladies and distempers are accompanied with a great deale of peevish crossenesse, and wilfull obstinacie, and a great part of the cure stands in the right crossing of them from those froward and furious humours, which will require great patience, and good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; for the generall, use all faire meanes you can devise to gain them to the good, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from the ill: but if that will not prevail, you must have patience and passe it over as though you took no notice of it; but if it comes once to this, that they do perceive that you go about to crosse them, and that you are in opposition and contesting with them, then you must follow it with all importunity, and resolvtion to subdue them, and compell them to do it; but be sure you take them with such advantages that you prevail, otherwise the attempting of it will prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to your selfe, and make them more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and insolent.</p>

of your fearful temptations both past and still continuing: these as I take it are your chief reasons, &amp; being rightly understood they wil prove so many sound arguments, to prove that you never had so good cause to rest assured of Gods favour towards you, nor ever had so many testimonies of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting mercyes towards you as you have now, that afflictons, chastisements and temptations are the signes of Gods favour, and the markes of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I pray consider what the holy Apostle faith <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 12. the 5. the 6. my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and he scourgeth every son that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth: and mark how he concludes in the eight verse, if therefore ye be without correction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sonnes, is it not strange that you should vex and torment your self, because the divell cannot prove you a bastard, but it may be you may say it is not thus in your iudgement, but then know that it is not fit for you to be a Judge in you own cause, but submit your selfe unto the Judgement of Gods word, which is the word of truth. And beleeve his holy Apostles that knew how to iudge in those cases better then you, and they will testifie that we have cause rather to reioyce then any wise to be discouraged with afflictions and temptations: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2 My brethren count it exceeding ioy when ye fall into temptations, and the blessed Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was tempted and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously buffeted by Sathan, for the which thing he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62099:37"/>
him, but what was he presently released? no but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved this answere from the Lord, and he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me my grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect through weaknesse, and what was the blessed man dismayed with this answer or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as you would do that he was out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God because his prayer was not granted? no such matter but rather doth conclude greater comfort and assurance, very gladly therefore saith he, will I rejoyce in my infirmities that the power of Christ may dwell in me therefore I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in anguish for Christ sake, for when I am weake then am I strong, thus you may see how the Apostle out of <hi>Daniel</hi> gathereth matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and out of his own weaknes encreaseth great strength of faith, and thus must you do in these fearfull temptations not so much as cast your eyes upon your own weaknesse, nor upon the strength and power of your malitious enemy, but you must looke up with the eye of faith unto our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Iesus Christ who is in the highest heavens, and whose grace is sufficient for us, and he it is who hath triumphed over sin, death and damnation, and hath tramped underfoot all the enemyes of our salvation: and therfore with the holy Prophet say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom then shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom then shall I be afraid?</p>
               <p>Now concerning your discomfort in hearing the word, because you take so small comfort in the promises, and are so much terrified with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, This I take it proceeds partly from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62099:38"/>
of your judgment in misse-aplying the same, and partly from the malice of Sathan who ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more labours to drive us into extremities either with <hi>Eve</hi> not to fear the iudgements of God at all, or else with <hi>Cain</hi> to thinke our punishment greater then we can beare, but even from your weaknesse, and from Sathans malice doth the Lord draw out that which may tend to his glory, and to your great comfort, and hereby I trust he hath broken up the fallow grounds of your heart and brought you to godly sorrow for your sins so that I do assure my selfe, within this short time of your afflictions; more repentant teares have been put up into the Lords bottle then in many yeers before, &amp; account not this as a small blessing nor passe it over with a slight thankfulnesse, but take speciall notice of it, assure your selfe, this faire will not last all the yeer, and the time will come when you will desire to see these teares of contrition and shall not see them, no though you seek them with fasting and prayer, and that you may the better conceave how blessed their estate is that have a contrite heart and sorrowfull spirit, I pray consider of that wonderfull comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able promise of the Lord, <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 57.15. <hi>For thus saith he that is high and excellent, that inhabiteth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whose name is the holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to give life unto them that are of a contrite heart,</hi> who would think themselves most happy that had a heart fit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that glorious guest, thus likewise doth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet testifie <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.13. The Lord is near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are of a contrite heart and will save
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62099:38"/>
such as are afflicted in spirit and our blessed Saviour in whose mouth was no guile, he saith blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted, and in the 16 of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> verse the 20 <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you ye shall weepe and lament, and the world shall reioyce, and ye shall sorrow, but your sorrow shall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ioy, a woman when she travelleth hath sorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her hower is come, but assoone as she is delivered of the childe she remembreth no more the anguish for ioy a man is borne into the world, and you now therefore are in sorrow, but I will see you again and your heart shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and your ioy, shall no man take from you.</hi> Thus you may see this godly sorrow, is but as the throes of our spirituall birth in Christ, which although it may be somewhat grievous for a time yet when we see our selves thereby borne againe of water, and the spirit, and so made able to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, oh how ioyfull and comfortable should this make us to be, many would with <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> sons sit one at the right hand, the other at the left hand of our Saviour Christ in his kingdome, but they are loth to tast of this cup, but let us know assuredly that as he is entred into his Kingdome of glory, through many tribulations, so must we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him thorow many tribulations if ever we will come there; you are now in the way be not weary of well doing, nor turn not backe till you come to that holy resting place, and that you may finish your course with ioy and comfort, be diligent in prayer, and observe a constant course therein even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and morning and at noone dayes, and as often as you finde your affliction to presse and oppresse your soule, then make your mone unto your merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62099:39"/>
God and powre out your soules before him, and especially bewaile wicked thoughts and vaine lusts where withall you heretofore so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted your selfe, and labour to mourn in secret for them, and likewise all other secret sins, and that your prayers may be more fervent, adde thereunto the holy use of moderate fasting, and this I trust through the Lords mercy, you shall finde an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes to recover your selfe unto your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall chearfulnesse again, and be not discouraged from these holy exercises though Sathan strive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much to vex and terrifie you: nay though you feare the Lord is angry with you, nay though you knew that assuredly, yet pray with the <hi>Psasiuist. Psal.</hi> 80.5. <hi>O Lord God of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly having in this holy manner recomend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your soule and body unto God in prayer waite upon him with a quiet minde, assuring your selfe that now the Lord is to take care of you and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast your care upon him, and so with a setled resolution dispose of your selfe unto some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table imployments fitting for your calling, and this course the Prophet <hi>David</hi> tooke <hi>Psal.</hi> the 5.3. <hi>Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lord, for in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wil I direct me unto thee, and I will wait</hi>: and what good successe those have that do thus attend, we may read in the <hi>Psalm.</hi> 147.11. <hi>But the Lord delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them that fear him and attend upon his mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly labour for meeknesse of heart and an humble spirit, for where this grace is in some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable manner attayned there the heart of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth breake away apace, and the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62099:39"/>
is little to be feared, for our blessed Saviour hath pronounced a double blessednesse unto such <hi>Matthew</hi> the 5. <hi>Blessed are the poore in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven, blessed are the meeke for they shall inherit the earth.</hi> And the want thereof hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many in their desperate fury, to loose their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance both in heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly take heed of moderate greife, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passions, which at this time is very unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though easily fallen into; and therefore watch over your own heart diligently and doe not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine so much as a sorrowfull sigh into your heart except it be for your sin, nor an impatient word into your lippes except it be when you see God dishonoured, and then speake zealously and spare not: and furthermore you must be contented to be admonished of these infirmities by your Christian friends with whom you do converse, for it may be they may discerne these things amisse in you when you doe not discerne it in your selfe being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the pleasing humour of Sottish melancholy.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that you may well remember it, you must by all meanes possible strive to serve the Lord with a cheerfull heart and a willing minde, for the Lord loveth a chearfull giver, and especially in matters of his holy worship: therefore when you come to hear his holy word, to fast, to pray, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious conference or any other holy duty, strive to doe it chearefully, and to reioyce even in your very teares, for I can tell you that is a good cause to make both you and others reioyce it; may be you thinke it strange, but read what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62099:40"/>
his intirely beloved <hi>Timotheus</hi> and then I hope you will say I am in the right, desiring to see thee mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy teares that I might be filled with ioy. 2. of <hi>Timothy</hi> the 1.6. And for neglect of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Lord doth threaten many heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the children of Israel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. <hi>Because thou servest not thy Lord thy God with ioyfulnesse and a good heart for the abundance of all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou shalt serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send uppon thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakednes, and in need of all things.</hi> And thus according to my simple understanding I have satisfied your request in setting down some directions humbly beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mighty and glorious God who giveth wisdome to the simple, and worketh great effects by weak meanes to give such a blessing unto my poor endeavours that his great power may be seen in my weaknesse, that you may finde such comfort to your soule, and such peace to your conscience, that hereafter you may tell unto others the great mercies that the Lord hath shewed unto you in the dayes of your afliction; and therefore say with the Prophet, loe this is our God we have waited for him and he will save us, this is the Lord we have waited for him we will rejoyce and be joyfull in his salvation. Amen Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

And I saw it was now time for me to get out of my chaire, and because he should see that I was not daunted at his speeches, I drew neerer, and said, Who are you that I must not speak unto you?

towells as though we were going to dresse a Hog, made them ply his mouth with pouring in milke or posset drinke which we would as freely cast up againe into our faces and moile us pitifully; but which did the deed, I poured milk into his nostrils and that falling, more backward upon the gollet of his throat, and that passed downe, and so fed him divers daies and kept him from famishing, and then to make him speak I caused a great fire to be made and bound his armes, behinde him, and a spit thorow his armes and held him down to the fire a basting stick and butter to bast him and made him beleeve we would roste him but he endured a great deale of heat, but it came not to blistering, and my sonne said unto me, father let us but roste his head to night for the disease lies in his head, so at the last he spake, and then we took him from the fire, and that night he took his rest well, and in the morning spake to my wife and asked for his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and kneeled downe to his prayers and read his chapter, and went to the church and behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so orderly that I never saw any in such a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate estate to mend so much in a short time, and so returned unto his father, and is a more active man and of better discourse then ever he was.</p>

               <p>I Came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to my brothers Master <hi>Edward Spencers,</hi> as I take it, upon a Friday towards the evening, that night I went not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bed, but towards morning fell asleep, and was much troubled with a dream, that I was at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, and when the Minister delivered the bread he was taken suddenly in such a maner, that he could not come at us, I was much troubled to think what we should do in such a case; but it pleased God I waked, and then was free of that feare. My brother came presently after, and desired me to go with him to see a friend, that could not live but till eight of the clock, it was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Twells</hi> his son, that was then Major, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tould me a strange discourse of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62099:45"/>
of his sicknesse, about a moneth before had a little dog that bit him by the finger and repelled the skin and bled a little and healed up againe the little dog grew mad, upon wednesday the young man found him very ill, and went to two or three of the cheefest Doctors of phisick, and they used their best indeavours but could not prevayle, but the young man grew worse; when I came into his chamber I found his mother weeping, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and two or three attending on him: he was a proper tall young man, spake strongly, and very religiously, with great apprehension of the ioyes of heaven: oh, that some good man would further me, with their prayers, I saw him so well disposed desired his father to send for some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to pray with him: but he desired me to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his desire since he made the motion to me, and so rather then it should not be done I prayed with him, the young man seemed to be greatly affected therewith and made great expressions of his ioy and comfort: he was very hot and dry but durst not drinke for then he thought he should presently die: and now let me tell you something that hath relation to my troublesome dream, the morning before I came young Master <hi>Twels</hi> was very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to receave the Sacrament of the Lords supper and resolved to drink the wine though he died for it, and so the Sacrament was administred unto him, and they thought some of the wine went downe, but they had much a do to keep life in him: I tould his father that I feared he would fall into more extremities, but advised them not to binde him for that would make him worse: but I tould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62099:46"/>
my brother that if his sicknesse grew upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he would be mad, I would have made him a bath of milke and plunged him in it over head and eares and let it run in at his mouth at his nose and his eares, and in this desperate case put it to that adventure, for otherwise there was no hope: but they had sent that morning to a skilfull man, to advise with, and was loath to make triall of it till they heard from him, and I was loath to presse it in such a desperat case; so in the afternoone I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home: but my brother told me that night he fell into a great rage and madnesse, and in his fits barked like a mad dog: but some houre or two before he dyed, it pleasd God to restore him to his sences againe, and he spake very religiously, and prayed earnestly unto God to pardon his sins, so departed. Now to give some directions in such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous cases: first, pray unto the God of heaven to blesse the meanes, and if the party so bitten with a mad dog be near the Sea let them with all speed throw him into the Sea water and plung him over head and eares and wash the wounds thorowly with the Sea water, if that cannot be had, then take the liver of the mad dog and make poridg of it and let them eat the liver and the broath as long as it lasteth, and take the hair of the mad dog and make tents of it and put it into the holes that the mad dogs teeth made, and this I saw in experience by one <hi>Richard Haines,</hi> a tall young man, pursued a mad dog a mastie neer the place where I dwell, and standing at the gap the mad dog would come thorow, clasped him in his armes, intending to hold him tell his fellows came, but the dog bit him
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62099:46"/>
very grievously in his side and about his belly: they gat the mad dogs liver, and made poridge and stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed the wounds with the hair and so through Gods blessing the mad man did very well: Crabs clawes, and lobsters claws beaten to pouder and put into butter-milk or drinke is very good.</p>
               <p>It is for the zeal of Gods glorie, the desire to yeeld comfort unto poore afflicted soules, and love of my country, which moves me to write upon this subject.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Samuel 16.23.</bibl>
                  <p>And so when the evill spirit sent of God, came upon <hi>Saul, David</hi> took an harpe and played with his hand, and <hi>Saul</hi> was refreshed, and was eased, for the evill spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>NOw the question is wether this distemper and distraction grew out of some inordinate affection, which proud, ambitious, covetous and amorous men are subiect to fall into: the only help in this case is to pray unto God, to give them humilitie and patience, to submit themselves unto Gods will, and faithfully beleeve that God will turn all crosses and losses to the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. Againe consider what thy sinnes have deserved, and thine own unworthinesse of the least of Gods mercies despise the world, and prise heaven, this is the only musick to cheat the heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly if it were some naturall in disposition, or distemper Pheniticall, timpheticall, then materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drugges might rectifie the humour, so a sensible musick might recreate the spirits; so a man preferre the spirituall and inward remedies but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and outward also are not to be neglected, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62099:47"/>
mirth good company or any comendable recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be refused, but undoubtedly it was an absolute madnesse or melancholy fury with some intermission, in which time he could hear advice, and do mischief, those mischeivous actes of mad men, are both guilty before God, and punishable also before men, when the force of reason is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally transported and extinquisht. Again if it were a meer obsession that daibolicall spirit troubled and vexed him, and because the divell is Gods creature and at Gods comand he may be said to be an evil spirit sent from God, now in case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaicall obsession and affliction I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave what naturall power musick or melodie sick can have for the profligation or repulsion of devils, and seeing a created Art hath properly, not farre upon any proternaturall habit unlesse musick doth delight the sence, and so draw attention, and so alter the passion: but I resolve it thus this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick cured <hi>Saul</hi> not as musick, but as <hi>Davids</hi> musick, no musick but <hi>Davids</hi> musick could do it, otherwise seeing <hi>Saul</hi> so much hated him he would not have been so much behoulding unto <hi>David</hi> having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cunning Musicians in the temple, but their musick made him more mad: God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to work such an effect to bring him into favour with the king.</p>

speak somewhat of the humours in general. second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly somewhat of the four chief in particular. Thirdly will set down a method, 1. For knowledge of those things that any wise concerne the melancholy humour.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>1. Of the humours in generall.</head>
               <p>MAns body may be divided into such parts as are contained, or such as do containe them: those which be contained are of a fluid and liquid substance, the other may be called the subject or vessels wherein these are kept and do cohere, which otherwise would be as water spilt upon the ground. To omit the parts containing, those which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are, humours, and spirits. Concerning spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits let it suffice to know, that they are a thin, aieriall vapours substance, the chief instruments which our soul worketh withall, those which be inplanted and fixed in our solid partes from our first generation, be the seat of our native heat and the bond of soul and body: those which be after added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are first naturall in the liver conveied in the vains to the habit of the body, secondly vital made in the lest cavity of the heart, partly of the naturall spirit and partly of the air which we suck in, and runneth by the Arteryes through the whole body. Thirdly. Animal, made of the vitals in the braine thence diffused by the sinewes into the body stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up sense and motion therein.</p>
               <p>A humour is either Radicall or adventitious, that is necessary to the constitution of a thing, this to the preservation thereof. Here is a fat aieriall oyly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance inplanted, inbred an inherent in the body from the conformation thereof, this we call Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62099:48"/>
moisture, or naturall Balsome, and compare it to a candle: there is likewise an inbred and innate heate (which word does not signifie a naked quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a substance indued with this quality which our most wise Creatour hath made sensible to our touch so long as the life lasteth) this heat is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the soul and is likened to the flame wasting the candle, the coexistence of these two in the heart chiefly is the beginning and continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, this is that perpetuall fire that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall light (although it never flame) which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chymicks have in vain laboured to imitate and blow up or kindle, when nature saw this heat ever feeding upon, &amp; consuming that moisture, she thought good to adde oyl to the lamp, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wayes to repaire what was spent, this she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed should be done by the use of meat, drinke, &amp;c. The humour thus generated is called Adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, because it is added to the former, now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the faculties flow with this humor or no, I will not here determine. All those humours which are continually made to renew so much of the Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call moisture as is dayly spent, are first primairly, such as proceed from the second publique conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the liver of these, to be accounted alimentary or fit to nourish <hi>viz.</hi> blood and phlegm, the cast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious <hi>viz.</hi> Choller, melancholy and why, the matter of urine; as also those which be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the third and private concoction <hi>viz.</hi> Teares and swet, secondarily such as proceed from the manifold concoction of the blood till it come to the most perfect degree of assimilation, <hi>viz. Ros, Gluten, Humour, Innoninatus, Caubis.</hi> The two last
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62099:49"/>
are added without necessity, and therefore by some excluded without iniury.</p>
               <p>The four humours, blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy be made in the liver all at one and the same time, all by one and the same heat. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of them is not to be imputed to this heat but to the condition and qualification of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect matter, if they be mad, when which is the Chylus, that is the meat and drinke concocted in the stomack, resembling perhaps no colour &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence Almond-butter, now this though it seem to be one simple humour yet it never is, no not in the greatest disease. <hi>Fornelius,</hi> if this Chylus be temporate in a temporate body, then all these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in that body are temporate in their kinde, if all, then choler does not alwayes proceed from an immoderate, but sometimes from a temporate, nay a weak heat. For what mans liver how cold soever it be is altogether without it. This Chylus is carried by the meseraick vains to the liver which encompasseth it with the same heat from all parts, and penetrates it equally, making of the temporate part thereof blood, of the hot part choler, of the crude phlegm, of the terrene melancholy, and all this at the same time. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But phlegm is cold and crude, the rudiment and shadow of the blood and and may by further, concoction be turned into blood. <hi>Ans.</hi> Tis true yet not therefore necessary that we should name all halfe-concocted-blood phlegm, or think it proceedes therefrom. For then we might call the Chylus our meat or whatsoever we are nourished withall, phlegm: which how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant from reason let the obiector iudge: moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62099:49"/>
if the whole masse of blood were made of phlegm, and choler of that, and melancholy of this, and each thus of other successively; there should be but one humour in us, taking diverse names according to the degrees or continuence of heat working upon it: as a river is called now thus now otherwise, by the inhabitants of this or that towne as it passeth by it. It may here seem to be required what phlegm is, but of that hereafter, Thus much of the Galenists opinions, of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: the Chynicks laugh at these and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, calling them Humorists, &amp;c. And count it folly to fetch the common internall causes of diseases from these supposed humours, but derive all from Suphur Salt, and Mercury, which three principles to speak properly, are not bodyes, but plainly spiritual (as they say) by reason of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from heaven with which they are filled, nor are they spirits because corporall; therefore of a mixed nature participating of both: and do bear anallagey and allusion as followes, <hi>viz.</hi>

Whether the blood be only a mixture of the third sincere humors, so that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62099:51"/>
choler or rather colerick blood in the veins should be the same with that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in the Gall. I conclude negatively to both, and think that the blood is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with the rest of the humours, which only resemble those which be separated and received into their proper vessells, this of humours is the best, the treasure of life, many excellent things are spoken hereof, insomuch that <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Critius</hi> say it is the soul, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> &amp; <hi>Zeno</hi> say it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth the soul.

               <p>Phlegm (so called by contrariety because of its crudity and that not in respect of the first conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but of the second) is an humour cold and moist white and without tast, or somewhat sweet.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62099:51"/>
in respect of the other three kindes which follow. This onely is properly termed a crude humour: tis true, every concoction may have its crudity, but this concoction which attaines not its full perfection in the stomack, by way of eminence is called crude, and that body which aboundeth herewith is of the colour of lead, such an humour also appears 1 in the sediment of some urines, 2. Acid, (tasting like vineger) which remaine thus for want of naturall heat and is caused by cold and moist diet especially if liberall, large and out of due time: as also by the constitutions which is colder in old men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then others, by a cold liver, cold aire, to much sleep and the want of the ordinary evacuation thereof, thirdly Salt, <hi>Avian</hi> thinks phegm becomes salt by adustion of bitter humours, as we finde after combustion the fixed salt of any plant as worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood &amp;c. <hi>Galen</hi> sayes tis either from putrefaction or from the mixture of a salt whaylike humour, neither do oppose other if rightly understood, for doubtlesse the true cause is a salt whaylike moysture which is nothing but the superfluous salt of those things which we eat and drink; do we not finde tartar in wine casks? and is not such a substance found in the earth wherewith plants are nourished? do we not use salt with many meates? that then hereof, which nature cannot convert to nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the matter of this preternaturall humour, which is therefore hot because salt. Fourthly glasse this difference is not taken from the taste as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but from the colour and consistence, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents melted or liquid glasse: this is the coldest of these kindes yet not exactly cold, for then it should

and valour, who for the good service that he hath done to his Prince and countrey with the losse of his blood and the danger of his life, in so many brave adventures in the warres, both in <hi>Spaine</hi> and in the Low-countrys, and against the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may justly challenge a great deale of love and respect, not onely from us his native country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but also from this Nation, and the whole Kingdome; and therefore to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse, and disregard from you in this place, whither he is retired in his old age, to doe good and to end his dayes in peace like a good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Iesus Christ; I say to receive unkindnesse and disregard from you, must needs be a great discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and no small provocation to a well restrained mind, and therefore to qualifie discontentments of this quality, it is no easie matter; For the word of God doth teach us, that the discord of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are like the barrs of the gate of a City, strong and hard, for flesh and blood to beate through, and so I finde in searching into these bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses, that there are to many barrs that will keep out these happy guests of vnity, and amity, which I so much desire to bring in amongst you; and therefore doe beseech the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is the God of peace and lover of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he would vouchsafe to breake in sunder these Iron barrs of revenge, and hard conceit, and frame your hearts to meekenesse, and to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the word of exhortation with patience, for Sir <hi>Iarret Harvie</hi> as a Souldier, and standing upon the point of honour, cannot passe by such wrongs &amp; oppositions as it may be (as he conceives) hath

beene offered unto him.

               <p>But if it please Sir <hi>Iarret Harvie</hi> to lay aside the resolution of a man of warre, and to take unto him the disposition of a Christian Souldier, and to follow the direction of that blessed Lord, and great commander under whose banner we have vowed manfully to fight, that is to learne of our Saviour Christ, <hi>to be meeke and lowly, love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to pray for them that persecute us.</hi>
