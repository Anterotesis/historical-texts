            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yeeres laſt paſt, whereby wee are not only, moved &amp; bound therevnto, in regard of conſanguinitie, fidelitie, and amitie, but alſo by reaſon of that eſpeciall faithfulnes, which time out of minde hath bin found, betweene the Crowne of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and the Pomeriſh Countries &amp; inhabitants by a ſetled Commerce, which hetherto hath bin continually kept and mainteyned betwixt them: as alſo when wee call to mind the dèepe Obligations, Contracts, Alliances, and Treaties, made by our pious Predeceſſors, betweene the Crowne of Swethland, and the Duke of Pomer his Lands States &amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, concluded at Old Statin Anno 1570. Having taken alſo into our conſideration how greatly wee are interreſſed in the keeping and poſſeſſion of the Baltike ſea, how and in what manner to our great preiudice the pomeriſh countries (the cauſe af all theis troubles) are not onely poſſeſſed: But alſo all free tradeing expulſed, and dryven out of them to annoy vs and our Kingdoms, vſing our name as a pretext to this horrible oppreſſion. All which being duly wayed, (thongh not by the inſtigation of the Duke of Pomer and his Countries) it concerns vs moſt neerly not to abandon and forſake theis Dukedomes and lands of Pomer, to th'end, that the love &amp; Neutralitie, which they haue ſhowne to vs may be ſetled vpon a ſute foundation. And that by the help of God, by our power and aſſiſtance, wee may cleere his innocency, and deliver them from this vniuſt violence, and oppreſſion, and out of their manifold adverſities and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compulſions, committed againſt all humaine lawes and rights.

            <div type="list_of_grievances">
               <head>And for our Parte wee Bogis Laus Dukes of Pomer and Statin, call to minde theſe Agrevances.</head>
               <p n="1">1. That wee were left deſolate, and Comfortles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help and aſſiſtance of any man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That wee were not ſtrong enough to reſiſt the great power, which was brought againſt vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our ſubiects of the Land, and thoſe which ſhould haue holpe to defend it, were diſarmed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All ability which was yet remaining, was taken from vs, and wee drawne ſo dry, that wee ſcarely had any meanes for the ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life, much leſſe to make any defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefor vs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After theſe three yeares oppreſſion, in which wee were ſo vnchriſtianlike intreated, our people had a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to deliver themſelves, and theirs out of it then to plung themſelves deeper into it, with the loſſe of life and goods.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Eſpecially, ſeing they could promiſe themſelves noe hope of helpe and comfort, but found rather that all which was aſſured them by ſo manifold Capitulations, and which was ſigned vnto and promyſed them ſo holily, little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heitherto was kept and obſerved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the helping whereof his Royall Ma. was forced to betake himſelf to theſe Chriſtian meanes.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THat in manie Quarters, and large Countries, the church of God is ſo diſperced, that they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme noe religious excerſices, not be ſuffred to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lords holy Sacraments, ſo that, the poore people run vp &amp; downe together in flocks, without any Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for their ſoules; yea their children dying without receiuing the holy ſeale of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe Countries by reaſon of theſe two laſt yeeres and a halfe oppreſsion, and the quartering of ſouldiers in them, are reduced into the vttermoſt extremitie, yea, and are brought into ſucha caſe, that the ſuſtenance of life will come to late, neither can they get any foode, becauſe the ſommer ſeede is diſtroyed, and cannot be brought in, in ſo much, that whole Countries lies waſt, and vntilled, as euery place can ſufficiently witneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all proviſion of money and money-worth, as Tynne, Copper, and other Mettle, together with all manner, of malts, and proviſions for the kitchin, linnen &amp; Bedding are giuen in Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yea, wee conceale howe the good Inhabitants of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are forced for helping of themſelues, to laye their credit &amp; goods to pawne, to take vp moneys to paye this Contribution, to the end, that the rigourous execution (not by a fewe, but by a great number of ſouldiers, yea of whole companies in committing all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences, as burſting open of doores, ſcoffing and geering the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of Townes, &amp; vnfurniſhing the inhabitants of neceſſaries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons, by forcing and conſtrayning from the people, might once ceaſe and not be committed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the people by reaſon of the ſouldiers marchings too and
<pb facs="tcp:19683:8"/>
fro, and their continuall compulſions, being depriued of means, were not onely driuen to Eate hoggswaſh, the barke of trees, &amp; other vnnaturall things; yea dead mens fleeſh, &amp; to eate their owne parents, for the ſatisfying their hunger, in ſuch ſort, that of late time ſome freſh tragicall ſpectacles haue bin ſeene hereof. For in his graces Iuriſdiction of Wolgaſt, there were diuerſe people found dead with graſſe in their mouthes, And a woman in the village of <hi>Dandum,</hi> murthered her owne child, dreſt it, and eate it, and therewith ſatisfied her hunger of which there are many credible proofs. I conceale how many haue made an end of themſelves out of deſperation, and by poy ſonmg them ſelues, to eſcape from the threatned tourments of the ſouldiers, requiring that from them, which they had not, ſo that the moſt part dyed miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and periſhed with hunger.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And though for the taking away of horſes, many ordinances haue bin publiſhed, yet they are ſo litle regarded, that there is ſcarce now a ſouldier goes afoote, but muſt ride a cock horſe, which cauſes that the ſeede is not onely ſowne, but alſo noe horſe can be gott vpon the high-waies, or for his Imperiall maieſties ſeruice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And albeit the officers are furniſhed with horſes, and forrage provided for them, yet never theleſſe the poore people, when the officers iourney a hors back, or haue any thing brought vnto them, they take their horſes from them, or the ſouldiers rides them dead.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When that the poore people for want of horſes cannot furniſh them to put into their waggons and karrs, as they require, and at the officers pleaſure, that then the magiſtrates in the Townes, yea likewiſe his graces owne officers and Councill if they refuſe, againſt the Lord Generalles order, where there lie ſpeciall Safe-gards, preſentby to vexe them they are taken from them, and they ſend them ſouldiers to lye vpon them, and thus are plagued and terrified with them. Therefore it is good reaſon, that they ought to be protected &amp; defended againſt theſe inſolences of the Emperours armies, and ſuch vnanſwerable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ought to be ſeuerely puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the officers are not contented with their vſuall billet-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and fyring, but hewe downe the growing woods, cutt downe whole groves, and will not be contented vnleſſe they haue variety of diſhes.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is therefore needfull to take ſuch order therein, that this land in all places (in ſtead of their ſubiection, and dutifull devotion) be not brought into a vaſt wilderneſſe and that the one be not conſtrayned to paye for the other.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb facs="tcp:19683:8"/>
10. That the people be not proſt to ſend many waggons, ſhow vels, ſpades, pickaxes for the ordinance, and ſuch like materials: and yet not with ſtanding by ſharpe exactions are forced to ſend great ſommes of money, yea ſometimes a thowſand Rix-dallers vpon a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, beſide the daylie furniſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with victualls, &amp; munitious. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the neceſsitie requires that not onely ſuch, but alſo ſuch other like innovations, and committed exactions, which are againſt the lands welfare ſhould be ſeverely prohibited.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That his graces cuſtomes and Toles againſt the Lord Generals ordinance notwith ſtanding they be in the midſt of the land are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe taken from him.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That beſides the manifold huntings (yea which are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by the vnder officiers) in ſhooting of Deere and game and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of chaſes continew ſtill.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the manie out-flyings of the ſouldiers, and out rydings of horſemen into villages, which giues an euill exſample to others, and emboldens them the more are not forbidden.</p>
            <p n="14">14. When the poore people complaine of theſe inſolences, they cannot be heard, but are ſent awaye with geering and threatnings, or whenſoener his grace or his graces Officers interceeds for them, they diſdayne to giue them an anſwere.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That they will not abate the charge of contribution, but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and ſouldiers though not withſtanding they be maintained by the quartiers will preſse the exaction of what is required to a penny, therefore they entreate, that what they haue had to much maye be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That the Cattle and Mettails (ſeing there are but a litle left,) maye be receiued vpon a due price, and the vſuall worth, and though a certaine price is ſet therevpon. yet the fame in their exactions are not kept and obſerued.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That for diverſe Churches, which are broken downe and althings plundred out of them, as was committed lately by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſh horſemen in Rughen, it is exceeding need full they ſhold be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed there fore, and an exſample be made thereof.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Robing in the high-waies is ſo frequent and common in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places, that the poore people cannot bring vp their grevous tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and after it is taken from them muſt pay it once againe.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Beſides, whatſoeuer is conditioned and promiſſed them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is performed, but firſt one end then an other is threatned with execution.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb facs="tcp:19683:9"/>
20. That others comprehended in the laſt diſpatched ordinances, not a point thereof is kept, nor the violaters there of once puniſhed, but the more the complaints are, the leſſe remedie is for them.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, according as the prince himſelfe muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the teſtimonie of all the provinces, the Emperours ſouldiers doe not performe &amp; keepe any thing of that which they haue promiſſed, and therefore all thir treaties and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, which wee take vpon truſt, and the ſteadfaſtneſſe which one ought to relie vpon them, is rather to be avoyded, then to be entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with them.</p>

               <head>The King of Svvethen his anſvvere.</head>
               <p>MOſt Illuſtrious and moſt Mightie Emperour, moſt deare friend, and Couſin: wee have, not without admiration, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by your Imperiall Mas. letter, ſent to vs the 18. of Auguſt laſt paſt, &amp; delivered to vs in our Campe at Ribnits the 6, of this month, that your Imp. Ma. doth much wonder, that we have this laſt ſommer paſſed over with an army into Germany; and would ſo turne over the Fault, both of making this warre, as alſo of the neglect of denouncing it vpon vs. certainly, we did not thinke your Imp. Ma. to have ben ſo vnmyndfull of matters paſt, that yow ſhould doubt, which of vs did firſt offend the other by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; and we have all wayes promiſed our ſelves more of your Imp. Mas. equanimity, then that he would have that imputed to the one, which is committed by the other. That the Mareſhall of your Imp. Mas. army, did the laſt yeare, without any proclamation of warr, bring (in greatnes) a reaſonable army, together with the hoſtile Imperiall enſeignes againſt vs into Pruſsia (that we may paſſe by the long and greevous traine of other hoſtilities and injuries heaped the one vpon the other) it is as well knowne to all men, as it is certaine, that we have now ſufficiently proved the hoſtile mynde and invaſion of thoſe Imperiall forces, which neither our innocencie, not the moſt, equitable requeſts of our Counſell by their meſſage was able to ſtay or revoke. Wherfore all reaſons being well and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently diſcuſſed, we can ſcarcely ſee, by what title or right, the cauſe of this warr can be attributed to vs, or by what colour or pretext of equitie your Imp. Ma. doth require of vs (not making, but repelling warr) a denounciation of warr, neglected by yourſelff, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that behalff accuſe vs of violating the lawe of Nations; for as much, as it is manifeſt, that it is no leſſe agreable to the lawe of Nations, that thoſe warrs, which are vndertaken for the repelling of force, are not proclaymed by a Heralde, but by nature it ſelff: Neither have we nothwithſtanding altogether omitted all denunciation (howbeit in
<pb facs="tcp:19683:11"/>
this caſe noewayes-neceſſarie on our part) but we have ben very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and warie, that no man, might by any right complaine, that being deceived by hope of Peace, he ſuffered hoſtilitie vnawars; by two letters, we ſent to the Electors of the Roman Empire, as alſo by ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to the Generall of your Imp. Ma. army, by the <hi>Legate</hi> of our Counſell, that vnles the errours alreadie committed by the other ſide, were in time amended, a neceſsity ſhould be laid vpon vs, by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the neglecters of our moſt juſt complaints, by other meanes to provide for our ſecuritie and dignity. Moreover, your Imp. Ma. doth affirme that while he hath governed the raines of the Empire, nothing hath ben done by him, either injuriouſly, or maliciouſly againſt vs, nor that his preparations of watt both by ſea and land did tend to any ſuch thing, wherby we and our ſtates needed to feare any daunger. and finally, that all matters controverted betwixt your Imp. Ma. and vs, might be eaſily ſet at reſt, by other means, and that they were not of ſuch importance, that therfore preſently armes were to be taken againſt the Roman Empire. But, we doe not, on the contrarie, ſearch and inquire ſo diligently, whether theſe proteſtations be not contrary to the deede it ſelff, all which we confidently leave to be judged of by the world? Whether your Imp. Ma. had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in any kinde to offend vs, we doe not know, as being vnable to dive into the moſt inward and hidden ſecrets of your mynd: but, that vnder the ſhadow and authoritie of the high imperiall name (and that either by your Imp. Ma. command, or at leaſt, connivence) many and divers indignities, hoſtilities, and injuries were done vnto vs, is ſo cleare, that to attempt to deduce it more at large, were all one, as to pres to adde light to the ſunne, neither doe we feare to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to your Imp. Mas. owne conſcience, either as witnes, or judge in this matter. What we ought likewyſe to have promiſed our ſelves of your Imp. Mas. preparations of warr, we will not ſo much declare, as his officers and miniſters actions, endeavours, and devy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not only ambiguous and ſuſpected, but manifeſt, doe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vtter and ſignifie: all which, if they be ſilent, let Pomer ſpeake, which together with the adjacent Provinces, hath theſe years by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone bene miſerably vexed, exhauſted and brought to nought by your Imp. Mas. forces, in malice againſt vs, and vnder no other colour, then vnder the pretext of warr againſt Swethen. More over, we doe not deny but the controverſies, which were ariſen, might have bene decided more commodiouſly by other means, then by armes, and it were to be
<pb facs="tcp:19683:12"/>
wiſhed, that your Imp. Ma. had eſteemed as equitably of that ſupply wherwith we (with no damage to the Roman Empire, but rather to the benefite therof) did moſt juſtly ſuccour the Citie of Stralſound; as we did conſtantly, with a mynd reſolutely bent to patience, for the good and tranquillity of common Chriſtianity pardon that hoſtility, which (together with many more injuries) the Duke of Holſatia did exerciſe againſt vs, moſt vnjuſtly, vnder the very Colours and Enſeignes: of your Imp. Ma. for we ſhould hardly doubt, but that then, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diffidence and diſcord had ariſen betwixt your Imp. Ma. and vs, might eaſily have bene compoſed by a friendly tranſaction, neither ſhould perhaps a neceſſity have bene laid vpon vs; to have leavied an army, at ſo great a charge, and to place our colours vpon the confines of the Roman Empire, to the end we might maturely prevent the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent evill, leaſt it ſhould ſpread itſelf further. But ſince it hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſemed good to your Imp. Ma. and that your commiſsioners have, contrary to the ſtatutes of all Nations, refuſed to admit our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, ſent to Lub<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>c cheefly, to decide the cauſe and controverſie of the Sound, ſeing alſo your Imp, Ma. armyes have declared themſelves ſo open enimies to vs, and have exerciſed all hoſtilitie againſt vs, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending vs with all manner of hoſtile attemps: every lover of equitie, and indifferent arbitratour in this cauſe, will ſay, that not we, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Imp. Ma. vilipending other equitable and lawfull means, hath at the firſt attempted extremities: how beit therfore, that (being ſo many wayes vnworthily provoked, and almoſt dejected from all hope of any frendly compoſition) we might, without all note or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any vnjuſt attempt, rather have bene ſollicited for other means thencefoorth, then for proffers of any farther peace: yet nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that we might teſtifie to all the Chriſtian world our fervent deſire, and endeavour for common tranquillity, we would no wiſe caſt of our reſolution of peace, but did, by our earneſt and frequent cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bring the moſt Gracious King of Denmarck this laſt winter ſo farre, that interpoſing himſelff for peace, we prepared the way for appointing a frendly treatie betwixt our and your Imp. Ma. commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries at Dantfike then did we alſo furniſh and provide our Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, with the reſt adjoyned to him, with full commiſsion to enter into that treatie: and finally, leſt the motions of warr ſhould any wiſe diſturbe the deliberations of peace, we ſuffered our militarie expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (not without loſſe both of time and means) to be differred for a long time. of this our care and ſollicitude for the common quietnes,
<pb facs="tcp:19683:12"/>
and tranquillitie of Chriſtian contreyes, this was the truſt we gained, that our beſt deliberations, being ſhifted of by divers ſlights and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, did not only evaniſh without taking any effect; but that now alſo your Imp. Ma. doth make no ſcruple to aſcribe the cauſe to vs, why that buſines had no proſperous ſucceſſe: wheras it had bene more agreable to equitie, rather to have examined the doings of your Imp. Ma. Commiſſarie, who did with earneſt endevour hinder the mediators from viſiting our Ambaſſadors, reſiding at Dantſike, and from laying the foundation of the future treatie, according to the due and accuſtomed manner and it had bene altogether more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that your Imp. Ma. ſhould have pondered with your ſelff, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this often aforeſaid treatie ought ſo ſtrictly to have bene tyed to the towne of Dantſike that (that place being, by reaſon of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened afterwards, in reſpect of ſome ſeed of variance, which was then ſowne betwixt our officers, and the towne of Dantſike made incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and ſuſpected to thoſe of our ſide) it might not have bene celebrated elſwhere, but was to the hurt of the common tranquillitie, for that cauſe only, to be altogether broken off, becauſe our Deputies (though for reaſons vrgent and pregnant enough) could not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare in the ſaid place. All and each of theſe, being weighed in a juſt ballance, let any man, who doth ſincerely eſteeme of matters, judge which of vs hath juſter cauſe to complaine of the other, yea we commit this to be examined and diſcuſſed by your Imp. Ma. his owne ſecret thoughts, in the which we doe fully perſwade ourſelves, that we arte clearly purged. Now your I. M, does indeed affirme, that yee will maintaine inviolable frendſhip with vs, and our Kingdome of Swethen, if ſo be, that we reſtraine, yea altogether lay downe our armes. but for as much, as the matter is not now any more entire and the daunger hanging over the heads of our States, cannot be ſaid to be imaginarie, but hath often really and effectually ſhowne it ſelff, and ſince that we have bene wronged and offended both by ſea and land, not in word, but by armes, and other hoſtile enterpriſes; we deſire your I. M. to pardon vs, that we can not admit of ſuch caution and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for our ſecuritie, and that, being beyond words offended, we cannot in this manner be ſatisfyed, but have determined to maintaine theſe armes, which we neceſſarily and juſtly have put on, vntill ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as that we have either this way ſufficiently provided for our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignitie; or then, the juſt feare, and reall imminent daunger as alſo the offences, and injuries really inferred vpon vs, be redreſt by
<pb facs="tcp:19683:13"/>
ſufficient proviſion, and real ſatisfaction: and commending the whole matter to the goodnes of God, and to the equitie of the cauſe, we doe not refuſe to abide whatſoever may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, in this our moſt equitable, and conſtant reſolution, but if in the meane time your I. M. thinke that the ſhip of the Chriſtian worlde, which hath now this long time bene vehemently toſſed by the huge and violent waues of warr, is rather to be brought into the deſired and calme haven of peace, then any longer to be committed to the ſtormy ſea of contention and armes, and for this cauſe, does incline to any farther treatie, your Imp. Ma. ſhal ſee, that we ſhall nowayes be avers from ſo ſafe and pious a reſolution, and ſo ſoone as your Imp. Ma. ſhall ſuffer yourſelff to be induced ſo farr, that we may ſee the Princes and Common wealths of Germany, our reſpectiue allies, Kinſmen, frends, and moſt deere neighbours ſo reſtored to that former eſtate, wherin they were, before this German warr did beginne to wax or increaſe, that our States may thencefoorth be duely ſecured, and mutuall truſt and frendſhip may againe be renewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Kingdome and theſe people, as alſo, that by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we may try and perceave theſe vnuſuall preparations of navies and armes vpon theſe coaſts, partly juſtly to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of vs, and partly nowayes to be tollerated, in reſpect of the defence of the Balthik ſea, which doth belong to vs, to have ceaſed, and a due conſideration to be had of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries inferred vpon vs, as alſo of the noe ſmal charges which we have bene forced to beſtow for this our defence: verily, no ſooner ſhall any man ſee theſe things accompliſhed on your Imp. Ma. his part, but he ſhall really and ipſo facto find it made manifeſt by vs, that our greateſt deſire doth moſt tend, to keep inviolated frendſhip with your Imp. Ma. no les, then with the reſt of our neighbours, and mutuall truſt and confidence being renewed, and all other contention
<pb facs="tcp:19683:13"/>
being laid a ſide) only to contend with your Imp. Ma. in good will, and all other kind of dueties whatſoever. Mattors ſtanding in this condition, we ſhould alſo ſcarcely give occaſion to any man juſtly to complaine, that we did to curiouſly prye into other mens affairs: for, as we are not accuſtomed to intermix our ſelves with other mens matters except other mens affairs be ſo mingled with ours, that the one doth involve the other; and as in all this time, that Germany hath bene burning in the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of warr, we, being contented with the care of our owne Kingdome, did not involve our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, in the affairs of Germany, vntill ſuch time, as the iniquitie of other men did bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that pas, that other mens affairs did alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs, ſo ſhould we alſo be found to be of the ſame mynd then, neither ſhould we in any kinde trouble your Imp. Ma. by making the affairs of Germany to be ours. But howſoever the matter fall out, and whether it appoint vs peace or warr, we doe religiouſly proteſt that we doe foſter no hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in our mynd againſt the Roman Empire (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Imp. Ma. would ſeem to draw and wreſt the poynct of the buſſines) and that we are ſo farr from deſyring any thing to be attempted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice therof, that we have rather determined to keep inviolated and ſound frindſhip with the ſame, ſo long as it doth abſtain from all manner of hoſtilitie againſt vs, and doth not wreſt out of vs, though vnwilling, a juſt retaliation, either by favouring our enimies, or by aſſociating it ſelff vnto them.

Having by all theſe ingenuouſly declared our mynd concerning the matter in hand, we frendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend your Imp. Ma. to the protection of God. Given at Stralſound the laſt of October, 1630.</p>
