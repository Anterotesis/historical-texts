            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Teſtimony and Warning
Given forth in the love of Truth, and is for
the <hi>Governour, Magiſtrates</hi> &amp; <hi>People</hi> inhabiting on the
Iſland of <hi>Barbadoes; </hi>which is a Call to turn to the Lord.</head>
            <p>O Ye Magiſtrates and Inhahitants of the Iſland of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi>
O conſider how often the God of Heaven hath
viſited you, ſending his faithful Servants and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
amongſt you, to call to Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life, and to warn you, that ſo you might have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the many Judgments which his Hand hath brought upon you
divers times both by Fires often, and Peſtilence, and Storms,
all which happened to your great Dammage in outward things;
alſo many have been taken away by ſudden Death, as ye well
know, to the Sorrow of ſome, and amazement for the preſent,
though indeed very ſoon forgotten again, as many have been Eye-Witneſſes
thereof: For when the laſt great Fire was in Town, I
being in one Houſe near adjoyning, where were many of the
chief Women of the Town, who were there to eſcape the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and looking on the Fire, and ſeeing it like to take hold on
their Houſes, great Terror was then in their Hearts, who then
in the Time of Affliction remembred to call upon God, where
I heard ſome of them ſay, <hi>Lord have Mercy, and ſpare us this
time, and ſurely we will Repent and Amend our Lives:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ye knew that ye did lye to God; for ye ſtill went on in the
ſame Exceſs after, and unto this day; ſo out of your own
Mouthes you will be condemned; for you were then ſpared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and many of your Houſes did eſcape the Fire. And now
you are affraid of Wars; for indeed the Sword it is already
furbiſhed for a Slaughter; all Trees that bring not forth Fruit
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65580:2"/>
to God muſt be cut down by the Sword of his Mouth. Neither
can any truly ſay, <hi>that God is unrighteous in his dealings towards
the Sons of men,</hi> becauſe that his Viſitations have been many to
turn People from the Wayes which are not good, that ſo he
might have Mercy on all, &amp; abundantly pardon thoſe who through
true Repentance and Amendment of Life do hearken unto his
Reproofs of Inſtruction, which is the Way of Life, as ſaith the
Scripture. So now conſider how his Meſſengers have been ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among you, and ſent away empty, and ſome ye Impriſon'd,
who came from far to ſeek for Fruits amongſt you, Fruits of
Mercy, that ſo God might ſhew Mercy in the Day of Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which ſurely will come on all that dwell on the Earth. Some
alſo who have been long Inhabitants amongſt you, my ſelf and
another Woman, we were moved to go to your Houſe of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to call upon you to Repentance, that ſo amongſt God's
faithful Ones ye might be made Partakers of like precious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in this day of Lovingkindneſs, which is known to thoſe who
are given up with the whole Mind and whole Heart to follow the
Lamb whitherſoever he goes: And indeed, in the ſhedding abroad
of God's Love in our Hearts it was in which I with the other
Friend came among you, but ye know ye made a Mock at it;
O therefore take heed that God, who is juſt in all his Wayes and
righteous in all his Judgments, do not laugh at your Calamity,
and mock when your Fear cometh, yea, whenas your Fear co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
like a Whirlwind, that none can ſtop it, then ſhall you call,
but he will not hear, and cry, but he will not anſwer: And ſo
though we did not break any Law (for it was not charged againſt
us at your Court) yet were we committed to Priſon, and were
haled along by the <hi>Bell-man</hi> of the Town, who at firſt handled us
roughly; but we told him, <hi>We ſhould not reſiſt him, nor ſeek to go
from him, ſeeing he was commanded to carry us:</hi> thus hath God's
Servants been handled in your Iſland. Likewiſe the Oppreſſion
of God's People who are Dwellers among you is very great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that for Conſcience ſake towards God they cannot ſend
Horſes nor go in Arms, their Goods are taken from them, almoſt
to the Ruin of ſome Families outwardly. So all theſe things and
more the great God both of Heaven and Earth taketh notice of;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65580:2"/>
and ſurely if there be not a ſpeedy courſe taken for to eaſe theſe
heavy Burdens and Oppreſſions of his People, who are indeed
made a Prey upon for turning from Iniquity, and Perſecuted for
living godly in Chriſt Jeſus: Yea, ſurely, even God the Lord,
who knoweth how to deliver his People, who in all Ages did
marvellouſly appear for thoſe who truſted in him, who is now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on conquering and to conquer; we know he is God, who
changeth not, but is the ſame this day, yeſterday and forever,
with whom there is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning: I ſay,
he will not turn away from any who turn unto him, and put their
whole truſt in him; for he hath ſaid. <hi>Mine Ear is not heavy that
it cannot hear, neither is mine Hand ſhortned that it cannot ſave;</hi>
nor will he in any wiſe caſt off any who come unto him. So now
there are many that can draw near unto the Throne of his Grace,
and can come unto him as unto a faithful Creator, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<hi>That the Rod of the Wicked ſhall not alwayes reſt on the back
of the Righteous, leſt they turn to Folly:</hi> So I ſay, that God will
ſhew forth more and more of his Mercies unto thouſands,
who love him and keep his Commands; and his Indignation
will be known upon thouſands of them that hate him, and keep
not his Commands; <hi>For if any ſay, they love God, and keep
not his Commands, ſuch are Lyers, and do not the Truth:</hi> So
theſe are his Commands, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength, and thy
Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> ſo to <hi>fear God &amp; to keep his Commands is the
whole Duty of man,</hi> as ſay the Scriptures of Truth. Now, I ſay,
they who take away Goods from any, would not be ſo done unto;
they who do impriſon any when what is done is for the Anſwer of
a Good Conſcience towards God, ſuch would not be done ſo unto;
ſuch as go about to Kill with the Sword or any carnal Weapon,
they would not that another ſhould do ſo to them; but Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>He which killeth with the Sword, ſhall be killed with the Sword:</hi>
So all his Followers or Diſciples muſt not take up any carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
for <hi>their Weapons are ſpiritual, and mighty through God, to
the pulling down of the ſpiritual Wickedneſs;</hi> they muſt <hi>take his
Yoak, which is eaſie,</hi> and <hi>his Burden, which is light,</hi> they <hi>muſt take
up the Croſs daily, which is the Power of God unto Salvation unto</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65580:3"/>
               <hi>all that believe and obey the Truth;</hi> they <hi>muſt walk in the Light as
he is in the Light, and ſo become Children of the Light and of the
Day, by putting off all the Works of Darkneſs and of the Night:</hi>
and theſe are Chriſt's Commands to all his little Flock, for whom
he ſaid that <hi>a Kingdom is prepared;</hi> yea, he ſaid, <hi>Walk in the Light
while you have the Light,</hi> and <hi>work while it is called to Day, for the
Night cometh wherein none can work;</hi> yea, the Night cometh, I
ſay, upon the Children of the Night, in whom the Prince of this
World ruleth, where the Wars are, and Rumours of Wars
within and without: But bleſſed be God, there are many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Day who can truly ſay, <hi>Greater is he that is in us then
he that is in the World;</hi> and Chriſt ſaid to his Followers, <hi>If ye
were of the World, the World would love his own; but ye are not of
the World, even as I am not of the World; but I have choſen you out
of the World, therefore doth the World hate you; but they hated me
before they hated you; and for this cauſe they hated me, becauſe I
teſtified that the Works thereof are evil.</hi> So now conſider what is
of the World, Evil Thoughts, Envy, Malice, the Luſt of the
Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, with other
ſuch like things, and the Love of the World, which is Enmity
with God, as ſaith the Scripture; for where the Love of the
World is, the Love of the Father is not. And ſo, I ſay, turn
to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in your Conſciences, that with it
you may ſee how it ſtands between God and your immortal Souls;
for that is it which ſtands all people moſt in ſtead, that is to ſay,
<hi>how it ſhall be with us when we go hence and be no more, even to our
long home;</hi> for our time here is but a moment in compariſon of
Eternity; and all Souls are immortal, either ever to live with
God in Joy &amp; Happineſs, or elſe in eternal ſeparation from him, in
perpetual Miſery &amp; Torment, in that Fire which can't be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as for inſtance, you may read how that <hi>Dives</hi> when he was in
Hell was not dead, but living in that place of Torment, where he
ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, and how <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Now remember how thou in thy Life-time had thy good things, but</hi>
Lazarus <hi>evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou tormented:</hi>
and further he ſaid, <hi>There is a great Gulf between, that thoſe who
would come from thence cannot come;</hi> ſo his Day time was gone
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65580:3"/>
over his Head. O therefore I warn you in God's Fear, lay theſe
things to heart, before it be too late, and your day of Viſitation
paſs over your Heads; and let not theſe things be to you as a Tale
that is told, but, as I ſaid, turn to within, to the Light of Chriſt,
and every one deal truly with your own Souls, while you have a
time and ſpace given you; for <hi>God will not be mocked, ſuch as every
one ſows, ſuch ſhall they reap; they who ſow to the Fleſh, ſhall of the
Fleſh reap Corruption; but whoſo ſoweth to the Spirit, doth from the
Spirit reap Life everlaſting.</hi> Now what can any ſow to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
I ſay, Nothing but Obedience to its Requirings; for ſo is
Life reaped, and Joy and Peace, that none can take away; bleſſed
and praiſed be God forever, doth my Soul ſay: and as ſaith the
Scripture, ſo we ſay, All have a Meaſure of the Spirit given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
withal, as to God-ward; and by it all may know a profitting
in the Knowledge of God, <hi>whom to know is Life;</hi> and ſome have
more and ſome leſs, as it is teſtified: but he who hath leaſt, if he
come to improve it, he ſhall find it ſufficient for Salvation, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
for Inſtruction: and <hi>the Reproof of Inſtruction is the Way
of Life;</hi> and ſo herein it is that God's Grace hath appeared unto
all, in that all are enlightned with a meaſure of the true Light,
which as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>The Grace of God hath appeared to all
men, which teacheth us, that denying all Worldly Luſts, we might
live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily in this preſent evil World:</hi> ſo it
hath appeared to all, but all do not turn to it, to be taught by it.
And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That
was the true Light, which enlightneth every man that cometh into the
World:</hi> So we ſay this is the Grace, the Light, which manifeſteth all
that is to be known of God, for by it God hath ſhewn it unto us, and
by it God will ſhew it unto all who believe in it, and no other way
but by the meaſure of his Grace made known in the hearts of all
Believers, whereby a profitting is known, and a growing from
one degree of Grace to another degree of Grace; for, <hi>By Grace
are we ſaved, and that not of our ſelves, it is the Gift of God,</hi> as ſaid
the Apoſtle, who was taught firſt to live ſoberly, then righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then godlily, and <hi>to do unto all as we would have all do unto us;</hi>
for ſo it teaches, and brings into Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,
<hi>without which none can ever ſee God:</hi> So all that do run this Ra<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65580:4"/>
which is ſet before us faithful unto the end, ſhall ſurely obtain the
Crown of Life, which God the Righteous Judge ſhall give at that
day: So the Way of Life and the Way of Death is ſet before
every Man and every Woman; ſo <hi>they who love the Light, they
bring all their deeds to the Light, that thereby they may be tryed
whether they are wrought in God, who is Light, with whom there
is no Darkneſs at all; for God will render unto all according as their
Works are, whether good or evil; but they who hate the Light, love
their evil deeds, and will not bring their deeds to be tryed, leſt by the
Light they ſhould be reproved; for that which manifeſteth is Light;</hi>
ſo while it ſhines in Darkneſs, the Darkneſs cannot comprehend it;
but as it ſhineth out of the Darkneſs, then ſhall all ſee how it is
with them; that is a meaſure of him who told the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi>
all that ever ſhe had done, who when ſhe had met with him,
ſhe ran and told them of the City, and ſaid, <hi>Is not this the Chriſt?</hi>
ſo when we had found him, by turning to the <hi>Light,</hi> for that is his
Name, we cannot but tell you of him, that you may wait to ſee
his Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts, which gives the true Knowledg
of God and of his Glory in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt; and his Name
is called <hi>The Word of God.</hi> So to the Word of Faith, which is
near all, in the Heart and in the Mouth, that all may obey and do
it; <hi>for Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and to Hearken better
then the Fat of Rams:</hi> yea, this Word is a ſwift Witneſs, as it is
given heed unto, againſt every Evil Way, and Evil Word, and Evil
Thought; and as it is minded it ſaith, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it,</hi>
when thou turneſt to the right hand or to the left; and ſo as Chriſt
ſaid, <hi>This is the Condemnation of the World, that Light is come into
the World, but men love Darkneſs rather then Light, becauſe their
deeds are evil:</hi> ſo that which ſhews the Evil, the ſame gives power
againſt all Evil, and purifies the Conſcience from all dead works,
and makes alive to ſerve God in the newneſs of his own Spirit; to
whom be Praiſe and Glory, even to God, who is over all in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth bleſſed forever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this is a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and alſo a <hi>Warning</hi> from one who hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Mercy through Chriſt the Lord of Life and Glory, that
now ye may ſeek God, that ye may find him to your Joy; for he
is not far from any one of you; and this is the way to keep God's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65580:4"/>
Judgments from a Place or Land, even by keeping his Commands,
for it is ſaid, that <hi>a man's greateſt Enemies are thoſe of his own houſe.</hi>
