            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few Words in ſeaſon to all the Inhabitants of the Earth, to call them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before it be too late,</head>
            <p>ALl you Inhabiters of the Earth, hear the Word of the Lord, &amp; hearken what the Spirit of Truth ſaith; you who are ſpending your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious time in <hi>Pride, Coveteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Lightneſs,</hi> in <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Vanity,</hi> in your <hi>vain Converſations</hi> and <hi>evil Communications,</hi> in <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceit,</hi> in <hi>vain words,</hi> and <hi>evill ſpeaking,</hi> in <hi>laughter</hi> which is <hi>madneſs,</hi> as ſaith the Scriptures, ſporting you ſelves as in the day-time, making merry over the juſt principle <hi>in you,</hi> and ſlaying my Witneſs <hi>in you,</hi> my controverſy is againſt you all, ſaith the Lord Almighty, and my wrath and indignation is kindled againſt you all that are found in theſe things, and if you do not ſpeedily repent and turn from the evill of your wayes, and turn in your minds to my Witneſs <hi>in you,</hi> which witneſſeth againſt all your unjuſt doings; (yea my Law <hi>in your hearts,</hi> you trample upon, which condems you for your rebellion againſt it) and if you hearken not to my counſel, and turn at my reproof, and joyn to the Light <hi>in you,</hi> &amp; give up to be guided by it, ye ſhall for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95332:3"/>
ever periſh; for <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt, and lighteth <hi>every one that cometh into the World;</hi> and <hi>this is the condemnation that Light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil; you will not come to me that you may have life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; for all your preaching and praying, and ſinging, and the beſt performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye have, whilſt the heart is unclean, and the fruit brought forth that is accurſed, they are all as menſtrous raggs and ſtinketh in my noſtrills, and your prayers are an abomination, ſaith the Lord; yea, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> hath all corrupted their wayes, <hi>there is none that doth good, no not one</hi> that, beareth the Image of the earthly; therefore return, return from the wickedneſſe of your wayes, <hi>and ceaſe to do evill, and learn to do well;</hi> and come and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, <hi>though your ſins are as crimſon, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though as red as ſcarlet they ſhall be as white as wooll;</hi> for what is to be known of God is manifeſt <hi>in man,</hi> that is the <hi>true Light</hi> which <hi>lighteth</hi> every man that cometh <hi>into the World; John</hi> 1. And whileſt you have <hi>the Light</hi> believe in <hi>the Light,</hi> that ye may be Children <hi>of the Light,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>John</hi> 12. This is the condemnation, <hi>that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the light, nether cometh to the Light leaſt their deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;</hi> but he that doth Truth <hi>cometh to the Light,</hi> that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are

            <p>So people conſider, is not <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> works of darkneſs? For the Lord <hi>beholdeth the Proud afar off,</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is Idolatry, and <hi>a Lyer</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom, neither can any in their vain converſation; for ye are grieving his Spirit and doing diſpite to the God of Truth: Are ye not ſpurning againſt God? do ye think to ſtrive with him and proſper? no verily, a day of ſorrow is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon you, and will overtake you <hi>as a Thief in the night,</hi> and you cannot eſcape it; therefore you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lay it to heart, be afflicted and <hi>Mourn</hi> and <hi>Weep,</hi> let your <hi>Laughter</hi> be turned <hi>to Mourning,</hi> and your <hi>Joy</hi> to <hi>Heavineſs;</hi> it is better to go to the Houſe of <hi>Mourning,</hi> then to the Houſe of <hi>Laughter,</hi> or to the Houſe of <hi>Feaſting;</hi> for that is the end of all Men, and the living will lay it to his heart; <hi>Sorrow</hi> is better <hi>than Laughter, for by the ſadneſs of the countenance the Heart is made better;</hi> the Heart of the Wiſe is in the Houſe <hi>of Mourning,</hi> but the Heart of Fools is in the Houſe <hi>of Mirth;</hi> So ye Fools be wiſe and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Heart; <hi>Fear, Dread</hi> and <hi>Tremble,</hi> ye ſtiff necked ones; for unto ſuch a one will I look that is of a contrite Spirit and trembleth at my Word, ſaith the Lord; <hi>Therefore ſerve the Lord with fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce before him with trembling, kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way; when his Wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95332:4"/>
repent, repent and turn from you evil wayes and wicked actions, and turn to the Witneſs of God <hi>in you,</hi> which witneſſeth againſt theſe your actions, and judgeth you for them; and if you meet Him not <hi>by Judgment,</hi> He will cut you off <hi>in the feirceneſs of his Wrath,</hi> and you will down to the pit, and there will be none to deliver you; for becauſe of theſe things the Land mourneth, and the habitations thereof are become deſolate, yea deſolation hangeth over your heads for theſe things; yea my Law in your hearts you trample upon, which condemns you for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and if you do not ſpeedily repent and owne <hi>my Word</hi> in your Hearts <hi>(the Light)</hi> which ſhews you theſe great abominations; and if you hearken not to my counſel and turn at my reproof; Lo, I will come in a day and in a hour, that ye look not for, and in the midſt of your <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> will cut you off, and you ſhall go down into the Lake that burneth for evermore; but if you will return from your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; hearken to my Word in you, ſaith the Lord; the Gate of Mercy is ſet open, by which you may return and Live; ſo <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is ſet before you, chuſe you whether; for the Lord wills not your deſtruction, it will be of your ſelves if you periſh for evermore; ſo whether you <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>forbear,</hi> the Lord is clear of your Bloud; ſo <hi>remember</hi> you rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ones, you had warning in your life time, <hi>for the Grace of God hath appeared to all Men, and it teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live righteouſly and ſoberly in this preſent World;</hi> who were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95332:4"/>
ſometime <hi>in darkneſs,</hi> but now are <hi>Light in the Lords Prayſes, Glory and Honour be given</hi> to his gracious Name for evermore.</p>
            <p>And you that are found in theſe things before mentioned, the Grace of God hath appeared to you, though you mind it not, but live in laciviouſneſs, in the Luſt of the Eye, which is the Pride of Life; and the Lord beholdeth the Proud afar off, and to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you muſt come aſſuredly; and you that live in the luſt of the Fleſh, which they that live after muſt dye, and think not that you ſhall eſcape the Wrath of the Lord for theſe things; and you Lyers ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdome in that nature, for all theſe things cometh forth of the curſed nature and evil ground; therefore return, return to the meaſure of the Spirit of God in you, which judgeth you for theſe things; and as you joyne to the Spirit it will mortifie the deeds of the body, the unruly Nature, which diſhonoureth the Lord; and ſo as you are lead by it, it will bring you out of the evil wayes to live righteouſly and ſoberly to the Praiſe and Glory of God with us; for the Lord made Man for his own Glory; but whilſt you live in your evil wayes, you diſhonour his Name and grieve his Spirit, ſhewing you are Children of diſobedience, which will bring deſtruction upon you; and if you do not <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>return</hi> it will come upon you aſſuredly. This is a Warning from the Lord to warne you before his Wrath break forth upon you; but if you hear and return from your evil wayes, it will be well with you;
