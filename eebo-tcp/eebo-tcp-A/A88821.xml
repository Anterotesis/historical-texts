            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Obſervations for the diſcovery of Witches.</head>
               <p>NOw for aſmuch as Witches are the moſt cruell, revengefull, and bloody of all others: The Juſtices of Peace may not alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect direct evidence, ſeeing all their works are workes of darkeneſſe, and no witneſſes preſent with them to accuſe them; and therefore for their better diſcovery I thought good here to inſert certaine obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly out of the book of diſcovery of the Witches that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at <hi>Lancaſter, Anno dom.</hi> 1612. before Sir <hi>James Altham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Bromeley</hi> Judges of Aſſiſe there: And partly out of Mr. <hi>Bernards Guide to grand Jury-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Witches have ordinarily a familiar, or ſpirit, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them; ſometimes in one ſhape, ſometimes in another, as in the ſhape of a Man, Woman, Boy, Dogge, Cat, Foale, Fowle, Hare, Rat, Toad, &amp;c. And to theſe their ſpirits they give names, and they meet together to Chriſten them. <hi>Ber.</hi> 107.113.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their ſaid Familiar hath ſome big or little teat upon their body, where he ſucketh them; and beſides their ſucking, the Devil leaveth other markes upon their bodies, ſometimes like a Blew-ſpot, or Red-ſpot, like a flea-biting, ſometimes the fleſh ſunck in and hollow, all which for a time may be covered, yea taken away, but will come again to their old forme; and theſe the Devils markes be inſenſible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pricked wil not bleed; and be often in their ſecret parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require diligent and carefull ſearch. <hi>Ber.</hi> 112.219.</p>
               <p>Theſe firſt two are maine points to diſcover and convict theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for they prove fully that thoſe Witches have a Familiar, and made a League with the Devil. <hi>Ber.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe if the ſuſpected be proved to have been heard to call upon their Spirit, or to talk to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of them, or have offered them to others.</p>
               <p>So if they have been ſeen with their Spirits, or ſeen to feed ſome thing ſecretly, theſe are proofes they have a familiar, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have often pictures of clay or wax (like a man, &amp;c. made of ſuch as they would be witch) found in their houſe, or which they roaſt, or bury in the earth, that as the picture conſumes, ſo may the parties bewitched conſume,</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are other preſumptions againſt theſe Witches; as if they be given to uſuall curſing, and bitter imprecations, and withall uſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to be revenged, and their imprecations, or ſome other miſchief preſently followeth, <hi>Ber.</hi> 61.205.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their implicite confeſſion, as when any ſhall accuſe them for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113274:3"/>
hurting them or their cattell, they ſhall anſwer, You ſhould have let me alone then, or, I have not hurt you as yet: Theſe and the like ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are in manner of a confeſſion of their power of hurting, <hi>Ber.</hi> 206.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their diligent inquiry after the ſick party; or coming to viſite him or her unſent for; but eſpecially being forbiden the houſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their apparition to the ſick party in his fits.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſick party in his fits naming the parties ſuſpected, and where they be or have been, or what they do, if truly.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Common report of their neighbours, eſpecially if the party ſuſpected be of kin, or ſervant to, or familiar with a convicted Witch.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The teſtimony of other Witches, confeſſing their own Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, and witneſſing againſt the ſuſpected, and that they have Spirits, or Markes; that they have been at their meetings: that they have told them what harme they have done, &amp;c. <hi>Ber.</hi> 212.223.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the dead body bleed upon the <hi>Witches</hi> touching it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The teſtimony of the perſon hurt, upon his death.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The examination and confeſſion of the Children (able and fit to anſwer) or ſervants of the Witch; eſpecially concerning the firſt ſix obſervations of the party ſuſpected; Her threatnings and curſings of the ſick party; her enquiring after the ſick party; her boaſting or rejoycing at the ſick parties trouble: Alſo whether they have ſeen her call upon, ſpeak to, or feed any Spirit, or ſuch like; or have heard her foretell of this miſhap, or ſpeak of her power to hurt, or of her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to this or that place, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Their own voluntary confeſſion (which exceeds all other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences) of the hurt they have done, or of the giving of their ſoules to the Devil, and of the Spirits which they have, how many, how they call them, and how they came by them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Beſides, upon the apprehenſion of any ſuſpected, to ſearch alſo their houſes diligently for pictures of clay or wax, &amp;c. haire cut, bones, powders, books of witchcrafts, charms; and for pots or places where their ſpirits may be kept, the ſmell of which place will ſtink deteſtably.</p>
               <p>Now to ſhew you further ſome ſignes to know whether the ſick party be bewitched:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a healthy body ſhall be ſuddenly taken, &amp;c. without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon, or naturall cauſe appearing, &amp;c. <hi>Ber.</hi> 169.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When two or more are taken in the like ſtrange fits in many things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the afflicted party in his fits doth tell truly many things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113274:4"/>
what the Witch or other perſons abſent are doing or ſaying, and the like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the parties ſhall do many things ſtrangely, or ſpeak many things to purpoſe, and yet out of their fits know not any thing thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When there is a ſtrength ſupernaturall, as that a ſtrong man or two ſhall not be able to keep down a child, or weak perſon, upon a bed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the party doth vomit up pins, needles, nailes, coales, lead, ſtraw, haire, or the like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the party ſhall ſee viſibly ſome apparition, and ſhortly after ſome miſchief ſhall befall him. <hi>Ber.</hi> 173.</p>
               <p>Note, for the better riddance of theſe Witches, there muſt good care be had, as well in their examinations taken by the Juſtices, as alſo in the drawing of their indictments, that the ſame be both ſet down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the materiall points, &amp;c. As,</p>
               <p>That the Witch (or party ſuſpected) hath uſed invocation of ſome Spirit.</p>
               <p>That they have conſulted or covenanted with their Spirit.</p>
               <p>That they imployed their Spirit.</p>
               <p>That they fed or rewarded their Spirit.</p>
               <p>That they have killed, or lamed, &amp;c. ſome perſon, &amp;c. And not to indict them generally for being Witches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The difference between Conjuration, Witchcraft, and Inchantment, &amp;c. is this: <hi>viz.</hi> Conjurers and Witches have perſonall conference with the Devil or evill ſpirit, to effect their purpoſe, ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7. &amp;c. The Conjurers believe, that by certain terrible words they can raiſe the Devil, and make him to tremble; and by impaling themſelves in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle (which as one ſaith cannot keep out a mouſe) they beleeve that they are therein inſconſed and ſafe from the Devil, whom they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to raiſe; and having raiſed the Devil, they ſeem, by prayers, and invocation of Gods powerfull Names, to compell the Devil to ſay or do what the Conjurer commandeth him.</p>
               <p>The Witch dealeth rather by a friendly and voluntary conference or agreement between him (or her) and the Devil or Familiar, to have his or her turn ſerved, and in lieu thereof the Witch giveth (or offereth) his or her ſoule, blood, or other gift unto the Devil.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Conjurer compacteth for curioſity, to know ſecrets, or work miracles; And the Witch of meere malice to do miſchiefe, and to be revenged.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113274:4"/>The Inchanter, Charmer, or Sorcerer, theſe have no perſonall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Devil, but (without any apparition) work and perform things (ſeemingly at the leaſt) by certain ſuperſtitious, and ceremoniall formes of words (called Charmes) by them pronounced, or by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, herbs, or other things applied above the courſe of nature; and by the Devils help, and covenants made with him.</p>
               <p>Of this laſt ſort likewiſe are Soothſayers or Wiſards, which divine and foretell things to come, by the flying, ſinging, or feeding of Birds: and unto ſuch queſtions as be demanded of them, they do anſwer by the Devil (or by his help) <hi>ſc.</hi> they do either anſwer by voyce, or elſe do ſet before their eyes in glaſſes, chryſtall ſtones, or rings, the pictures or images of the perſons or things ſought for.</p>

               <head>I ſhall now adde the Confeſsion of Mother <hi>Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> who was arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a Witch, and ſuffered death by burning, at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> on Tueſday the 9. of September, 1645.</head>
               <p>THe ſaid Mother <hi>Lakeland</hi> hath been a profeſſour of Religion, a conſtant hearer of the Word for theſe many years, and yet a <hi>Witch</hi> (as ſhe confeſſed) for the ſpace of near twenty years. The <hi>Devil</hi> came to her firſt between ſleeping and waking, and ſpake to her in a hollow voyce, telling her, that if ſhe would ſerve him ſhe ſhould want nothing. After often ſollicitation ſhe conſented to him; then he ſtroke his claw (as ſhe confeſſed) into her hand, and with her blood wrote the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. <hi>(Now the ſubtilty of Sathan is to be obſerved, in that he did not preſſe her to deny God and Chriſt, as he uſeth to do to others; becauſe ſhe was a Profeſſour, and might have loſt all his hold by preſſing her too far)</hi> Then he furniſhed her with three Imps, two little Dogs and a Mole (as ſhe confeſſed) which ſhe imployed in her ſervices: Her huſband ſhe bewitched (as ſhe confeſſed) whereby he lay in great miſery for a time,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113274:5"/>
and at laſt dyed. Then ſhe ſent one of her Dogs to one Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> to torment him and take away his life: ſhe ſeat one of them alſo to his Child, to torment it, and take away the life of it, which was done upon them both: and all this (as ſhe co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>ed) was, becauſe he asked her for 12.3. that ſhe owed him, and for no other cauſe.</p>
               <p>She further confeſſed, that ſhe ſent her Mole to a Maid of one Mrs. <hi>Jenings</hi> in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> to torment her and take away her life, which was done accordingly: and this for no other cauſe, but for that the ſaid Maid would not lend her a needle that ſhe deſired to borrow of her, and was earneſt with her for a ſhilling that ſhe owed the ſaid Maid.</p>
               <p>Then ſhe further confeſſed, ſhe ſent one of her Imps to one Mr. <hi>Beale</hi> in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> who had formerly been a ſutor to her Grand-child; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not have her, ſhe ſent and burned a new ſhip (that had never been at Sea) that he was to go Maſter of; and ſent alſo to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him and take away his life; but he is yet living, but in very great miſery, and as it is verily conceived by the Doctors and Chirurgions that have him in hand, that he conſumes and rots, and that halfe of his body is rotten upon him as he is living.</p>
               <p>Severall other things ſhe did, for all which ſhe was by Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, and in particular to be burned to death, becauſe ſhe was the death of her huſband, as ſhe confeſſed; which death ſhe ſuffered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>But ſince her death there is one thing that is very remarkable, and to be taken notice of: That upon the very day that ſhe was burned, a bunch of fleſh, ſomething after the form of a Dog, that grew upon the thigh of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Beale,</hi> ever ſince the time that ſhe firſt ſent her Imp to him, being very hard, but could never be made to break by all the means that could be uſed; brake of it ſelf, without any means uſing: And another ſore, that at the ſame time ſhe firſt ſent her Imp to him, roſe upon the ſide of his belly, in the form of a Fiſtula, which ran, and could not be healed by all the means that could be uſed, preſently alſo began to heale, and there is great hopes that he will ſuddenly recover again, for his ſores heale apace, and he doth recover his ſtrength. He was in this miſery for the ſpace of a yeare and halfe, and was forced to go with his head and his knees together, his miſery was ſo great.</p>
