            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING'S Most Excellent Majesty.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Interest you have in the flourishing of Your Antient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose Crown is transmitted to You by an Hundred and eleven of your Ancestors, without ever having been on the Head of a Forraigner, emboldens the Author to lay the following Sheets at your Majesties Feet.</p>
            <p>The design of them is to vindicate the Settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Darien,</hi> and Your Majesties Justice in protecting them, against the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Aspersions which are cast upon it in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Memorial.</p>
            <p>The Soveraignty of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath alwise been held Sacred by our Ancestors, who never were sparing of their Blood to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it either from the Invasion of Foreigners, or the mean Compliance of some few of our Princes that were unworthie to wear it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were either totally excluded from it, as the Family of <hi>Baliol,</hi> or oblig'd to reassert its Right when rescu'd out of the Hands of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as happen'd to our <hi>William I.</hi> and <hi>James I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Providence having now plac'd it on the Head of Your Majesty, whose Heroic Courage is known to all the World, our Nation should be unjust to Your Character to expect any thing less than that our Crown, which You receiv'd free and independent from Your Ancestors, should be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by You with greater Advantages than ever to Your Successors.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is, Great Sir, that a privat Subject of your Antient Kingdom takes the holdness to vindicate the Soveraignty and Dignity of Your Crown as Kings of <hi>Scots,</hi> and to put such as are Enemies to it in mind, that when <hi>Edward I,</hi> and <hi>II.</hi> of <hi>England</hi> invaded it, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation did gallantly defend it, advanced <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:54217:3"/>
Exclusion of <hi>Baliol</hi> the nearest Heir, and acquainted the Princes of <hi>Christendom</hi> that they did so in defence of their Independency; adding that they would expel <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> if he offered to betray their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and would never subject their Crown to that of <hi>England,</hi> whilst there were <hi>100 Scots men</hi> alive.</p>
            <p>This being the fundamental Constitution of our Government, and the Condition on which that Prince and his Successors were admitted to Our Crown; they can in no wise be look'd upon as Friends to your Majesties Dignitie as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who call in question what You enact in the Parliament of that Kingdom, or that offer to traverse it by contrary Proclamations.</p>
            <p>We are Your Majesties Subjects as well as our Neighbours, and have an equal Right to share your Protection, which its hop'd they will at last be convinc'd it is their Interest to agree to in relation to our <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Settlement.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty's Paternal Affection to the Kingdom of <hi>Scorland,</hi> hath discover'd it self in many Instances: nor is it to be desired or expected by our Nation, that it should any way interfere with the like Care and Affection, which is owing to our Brethren of <hi>England;</hi> but there is no reason that they should enjoy a Freedom of Trade throughout the World, and that we should be denied it.</p>

               <p>THE Under-Subscriber, Ambassador Extraordinary from his Catholick Majestie, finds himself oblig'd by express Orders, to represent to your Majesty, that the King his Master having receiv'd Information from different places, and last of all from the Governor of <hi>Havana,</hi> of the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>All that the King desires, is, That this may be represented to your Majesty, and that your Majesty may be acquainted, that he is very sensible of such Hostilities and unjust Procedures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which his Majesty will take such Measures as he thinks convenient.</p>

               </gap>. 1699.</p>
            <p>It were easie to make proper Remarks upon the Weakness, Insolence and ingratitude of this Memorial, but it is not worth while; all the World knows what the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> ows to his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and therefore a more civil Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might reasonably have been expected to a Prince, who hath not only saved the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but prevented his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesty from being insulted on his Throne at <hi>Madrid.</hi> But these things we pass over, and come to the chief point in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, which is, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>have posted themselves in the King of</hi> Spain'<hi>s Demains in</hi> America, <hi>contrary to the Allyance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Crowns.</hi> If this be proved to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>alse, then the cause of the Complaint ceases, and his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath reason to demand Satisfaction for the Affront offered thereby to his Justice and Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>To prove the falshood of the Allegation, That the Province of <hi>Darien</hi> is part of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Demains: It is positively denied by the <hi>SCOTS,</hi> who challenge the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to prove their Right to the said Province, either by <hi>Inheritance, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54217:4"/>It is evident that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot pretend a Tittle to that Countrey by Inheritance, Marti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that it is the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Imposition that can be put upon any Nation, and one of the most audacious affronts that ever was put upon so Great a Prince as K <hi>William,</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to pretend a Right to <hi>Darien,</hi> and accuse him of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It remains then that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can lay no other claim to <hi>Darien</hi> but what they plead <hi>from the Pope's general Grant of</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, <hi>its being bounded by their Dominions, and the Treaties with</hi> England. which shall be considered in their Order.</p>

            <p>The next <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is from the Treaties betwixt them and the Crown of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> of which they alledge the Settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien</hi> to be a Breach, But that there's no Ground for this Allegation. will appear to those that peruse the said.

               </gap>'d from those Treaties, is, that they were a mutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the peaceable possession of what each Crown enjoy'd in that Countrey. and no more; which is sufficiently confirm'd by the Patent granted to Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and the settling and removing of the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Campechy</hi> Bay, &amp;c. without Controul, as before mention'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus made it evident that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Title or Right to <hi>Darien,</hi> it is Natural in the next place to shew that they themselves are guilty of the Breach of Treaty by proceeding in this Affair as they have done.</p>
            <p>By the third Article of the Treaty between the Crowns of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> concluded at <hi>Madrid May</hi> 23. 1667. it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, <hi>That if any Injury shall be done by either of the said Kings, or by the People or Subjects of either of them, to the People or Subjects of the other, against the Articles of that Alliance, or against common Right, there shall not therefore be given Letters of Reprisal, Marque or Countermarque, by any of the Confederates, until such time as Justice is follow'd in the ordinary Course of Law.</hi> Yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such Procedure, or offering in the least to prove their Title to <hi>Darien,</hi> present a virulent and huffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>g Memorial, at the very first charging the King <hi>with want of Friendship, and a Breach of Alliance, and threatning to take such measures as they shall think meet:</hi> when their sickly Monarchy has not yet had time to breath, since rescu'd from the common danger, wherein <hi>Europe</hi> was involv'd, by the Arms of that very Prince whom they treat so ungratefully.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for contrary to the express Words of that same Treaty, they attack the <hi>Scots</hi> by Sea and Land, who had done them no Injury, but acquainted them that they came peaceably, without any hostile design against them or any other People; And

were so generous as to reject the Motion of Capt. <hi>Andreas,</hi> one of the <hi>Darien</hi> Princes, and their Ally, when he offered to make them Masters of <hi>Panama,</hi> if they would but join him with 500 of their Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have also, contrary to the <hi>10th</hi> and <hi>11th</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Treaty concluded at <hi>Madrid.

And we have mentioned before that Capt. <hi>Sharp,</hi> who was accused of Piracy, for that same Expedition, and succeeded <hi>Sawkins</hi> in his Command, was acquitted in <hi>England,</hi> because he had that Prince's Commission.</p>
            <p>Having fully prov'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no Title in <hi>Darien,</hi> it remains to be prov'd that the SCOTS have as good and just a Title to their Settlement there, as any People in the World can have; which may easily be demonstrated thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54217:8"/>They were authorized by an Act of Parliament, and the Kings Letters Patent, <hi>to plant Colonies in</hi> Asia, Africa, <hi>or</hi> America, <hi>upon Places not inhabited, or any other Place by Consent of the Natives, not possest by any</hi> European <hi>Prince or State.</hi> Being provided with this Authority than which there cannot be a Greater, or one more duly and honestly limited, they equipp'd their Ships, and landed on the North side of the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1698. where the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as has been fully prov'd, never had any possession, and no other <hi>European</hi> Prince or State pretends any Claim to it. Being arriv'd there, they fairly obtained the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Princes and People of the Country, and particularly of Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> who is the chief Man in that Tract; And after a solemn Treaty and Alliance deliberatly made, and wrote in <hi>Spanish,</hi> because the said Prince understands that Language, they peaceably enter upon their new Colony, without either Force or Fraud. So that they have religiously kept to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Act and Patent, which is a plain demonstration hat they have a just and legal Title to their Settlement. and a Right to the Protection of the Government, against the Attempts of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or any other People whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The next Topick to be insisted upon. is the Advantage or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage that may redound to <hi>England</hi> from this Settlement. We shall begin with the Disadvantage which consists in the supposed Damage it may do to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and that it may, as is pretended, occasion a Rupture between them and <hi>Spain.</hi> To this we may easily reply, that being a distinct and independent Nation, we are not oblig'd to consult their Interest, any further than they consult ours; and that we have as much Reason to maintain this Colony, because of the Advantage it may bring to our selves, as they have to oppose it, because of the Disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they fancy may arise from thence to <hi>England.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al we deny that it can be any damage to their Trade, which from that part of the World consists chiefly in Sugar and Tobacco, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which are yet to be found in <hi>New Caledonia.</hi> But that which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54217:8"/>
we look upon to be a compleat Answer to the Objection, is this, That they may be sharers with Us in the settlement if they please, and by consequence Partners in the Profits and Trade, and lay it under such Regulations as may prevent its endamaging the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is further objected, That by the great Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and freedom granted to the SCOTS Company for so many Years, we shall be able to undersell the <hi>English</hi> Company forestal their Markets, and lessen his Majesties Customs; we answer, that this Objection is in a great measure obv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ated, since we do not now pretend to set up an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade; but admitting it were true, it will be to the general Advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>age of the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since the Buyers are always more than the Sellers. It must certainly be better for the Kingdom in general, that every one who has occasion for Musl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n or <hi>Indian</hi> Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should have so many shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard or peice in their Pockets, than that some two or three Merchants should once in an Age get Money enough to make a Daughter or two a Countess or Dutchess. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> can it be denied but it's better for <hi>England,</hi> that Housekeepers in general should save that Money to buy Provisions for their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which consumes our own Product, than that a dozen of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants should be enabled by the extravagant prices of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to keep their Coaches. Add to this, that the <hi>English</hi> if they please by joining with the <hi>SCOTS,</hi> may have an equal share of all those Immunities; and if there should be for some time a lessening of the King's Customs, of which there is at present no manner of prospect, it will be sufficiently made up in time to come by a large Addition, if that Colony prospers; so that the King's Bounty in that respect, is but like the bestowing of charge to improve barren or waste Ground, which will return with treble Interest to him or his Heirs.</p>
            <p>There's another Objection made against the <hi>SCOTS</hi> Company, that by their Constitution, such Ships as belong to them must

us and our Nation would have afforded them a safe retreat, in case of any Disaster, till they could have concerted Matters to the best advantage; the late King would not have yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self such an easy Conquest, nor disbanded his Army in such a manner as he did; <hi>Ireland</hi> had certainly never revolted, since every one knows that the Revolution was begun, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure perfected there by the <hi>Scots</hi> of the North; so that <hi>England</hi> must have become the Theatre of War, been lyable to an Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>These must certainly have been the Consequences os our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the late King, and the <hi>English</hi> would have thought they had had a very good Bargain if they could have bought us off in that Case with uniting both the Kingdoms into one, and granting us a joint Trade to their own Plantations; whereas now they will not allow us to settle a Forreign Colony of our own, and treat us as Forreigners in theirs.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54217:16"/>It must be granted, that the Reasons of such a grateful Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution are redoubled now: Intermarriages betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more frequent than ever; the Union of the Kingdoms under one Crown for almost 100 years; the generous Concurrence of the <hi>Scots</hi> in the last Revolution; their loss of so many gallant Officers and brave Soldiers in the common Cause during the late War, and the preservation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which hath been twice ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Charles <hi>I. the Anarchy of the Rump, and several Models of Armies and Juntos. by encouraging General</hi> Monk'<hi>s Undertaking; for it cannot be denied that we had the Ballance of</hi> Europe <hi>in our hands, at the time of the last Revolution, and that we turned the Scale to the advantage of</hi> England <hi>in particular, and of</hi> Europe <hi>in general, which must be allowed to be as great a Service, as that which was so thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rewarded by</hi> Edward, <hi>and</hi> William <hi>the Conquero; whence it is evident that those</hi> Englishmen; <hi>who at present oppose our Settlement in</hi> America, <hi>don't inherit the gratitude of their Ancestors, when they not only will not allow us to trade in Conjunction with them, but withstand our doing any thing that may advance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by our selves.</hi>

               <hi>three Northern Counties of</hi> Northumberland, Westmorland, <hi>and</hi> Cumberland, <hi>to be held in Fee of the Crown of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is likewise very well known with how much honour the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>treated us, when they courted onr Assistance against K.</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les I. <hi>and what large Promises that Prince made us, if we would have but stood Neuter; which tho we had reason to think many of those that opposed him had no great kindness neither for our Civil nor Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Constitution, yet the sence that we had of the common danger that our Religion and Liberties were in at that time, made us proof against all those Tentations; so that after all Endeavours for a Reconciliation betwixt the King and Parliament of</hi> England <hi>proved unsuccessful, we sent an Army, which cast the Ballance on the side of the latter, who before that time were reduced low enough by the Kings Army, as is very well known to such as are acquainted with the History of those times, and is own'd by my Lord</hi> Hollis <hi>in his Memoirs lately published.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the last Revolution; Tho we must own that we owe our Deliverance to his present Majesty, and were oblig'd in Conscience and Honour to concurr with him; <hi>Tet who could have blam'd us to have stood upon Terms before we had fallen in with</hi> England, <hi>Especially</hi> considering how ungratefully (nay villan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously) we were treated by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Party, after we had sav'd them and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> from the Scorpions that the Cavaliers had prepar'd to chastise them with; as is own'd by the said Lord <hi>Hollis.</hi> Not could we have been any way Calpable, if we had stood upon higher and surer Terms with his Majesty, <hi>Considering how unthankfully we were abus'd and enslav'd by our late Kings, for whom we had acted and suffered so much.</hi> And tho we must own that no less Present than that of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Crown,</hi> was sufficient to testify our Gratitude for what the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> had done for us, yet we were under no necessity of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that manner, since our Deliverance was effected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and that he himself in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> expres'd it to be no part of his design to come for the Crown, so that our Re ward was as frank and generous as his Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54217:17"/>Then as to <hi>England,</hi> we were under no manner of obligation to continue the Union with them; <hi>We might have insisted upon having our King obliged to reside as much amongst us, as amongst them: that we should be govern'd without any Consideration or respect to their Interest, any further than it fell in with our own.</hi> We might have insisted upon an Act, that we should not be oblig'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Majesty at any time at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> about our Affairs; but that he should either attend upon our Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in person <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as he does now upon the Affairs of <hi>Holland,</hi> or lay down Methods to have his Pleasure signified to us at Home in such cases as it was requir'd; which would save a vast deal of Money annually to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then as to the Succession, we were under no Necessity of settling it in the same manner as they did in <hi>England;</hi> for since they had made a Breach in the Line, they could not handsomely have blam'd us to have made an improvement of it, and either to have limited the Reversion after his present Majesty's Death, or otherwise as we should have thought best, for the Security of our Civil and Religious Liberties; or we might have settled it upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his Issue by any other Wife, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause enough then to conceive that he was never like to have any by his late excellent Princess. Had we taken any of these Methods, it must be own'd that <hi>England</hi> would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably weakned, and lessen'd in the Esteem of the World by it; that we should have thereby had an opportunity of making such Forreign Alliances with <hi>France,</hi> as formerly, or with any other Nation, as would have made <hi>England</hi> uneasy, and perhaps unsafe on occasion; and therefore it must be reckon'd highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick, as well as ungrateful, in our Neighbours to treat us continually at such a rate, as if they had a mind to bring us under Subjection, since we have so many open Doors to get out at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54217:17"/>
               <hi>They must not think that we have so far degenerated from the Courage and Honour of our Ancestors, as tamely to submit to become their Vassals, when for 2000 years we have maintain'd our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and therefore it is not their Interest to oppress us too much. If they consult their Histories, they will find that we alwayes broke their Yoke at long-run, if at any time we were brought under it by force or Fraud. The best way to assure themselves of us, is to treat us in a Friendly manner: Tho we be not so great and powerful as they, it is not impossible for us to find such Allies as may enable us to defend our selves now as well as formerly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None of these things are suggested with an ill design to raise <hi>Annimosity betwixt the Nations,</hi> or to perswade to a Separation of the Crowns, but meerly to shew those of our Neighbours, who use us os unkindly, that they are bound in Gratitude, Duty and Interest to do otherwise, and particularly to support us in our <hi>American</hi> Settlement, and not to lay our King under a necessity by their froward Humours in Parliament or otherwise, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in that Undertaking, as they have hitherto done, and continue still to do in their <hi>American</hi> Colonies, <hi>by their Proclamations against having any Commerce or Trade with the</hi> Scots <hi>at</hi> Darien; Tho they be settled there, according to the Terms of his own Patent, and an Act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not insensible that the present Juncture of Affairs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to carry fair with <hi>Spain,</hi> and may admit that in part as an Apology for some of that Opposition we have met wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>h from them; but the questioning our Act of Parliament at first, and their hindering our Subscriptions at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> afterward, before ever they knew what our design was, make that excuse of little weight: but allowing it all the Force they would have it to bear, it may be worth their while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether it be more their Interest to incourage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in an unjust Opposition to our <hi>American</hi> Settlement, or to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Scots</hi> in maintaining their Right. It is certain that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54217:18"/>
are in no condition to break with <hi>England;</hi> or if they should, it's in the power of the <hi>English</hi> to reduce them speedily to reason: whereas if the <hi>Scots</hi> should miscarry in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking by the Discouragements from <hi>England</hi> before-mentioned, which exposes our Ships to be taken and treated a Pirates by any Nation that pleases, the infallible consequence of it will be, that the Ruin and utter impov'rishment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow such a miscarriage, will immediatly affect <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> both in her Trade and Strength: The City of <hi>London</hi> and the Northern Road will soon feel the Effects of it, when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney spent by our Gentry and Merchants continually for Cloaths, Provisions, and Goods, ceases to circulate there: <hi>England</hi> must unavoidably become an easier Prey to any forreign Enemy; since it will not be only the loss of a Tribe, but of an entire Sister-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or supposing that <hi>Scotland</hi> should be able to bear up under the loss, it will lay the Foundation of an irreconcilable Feud, and perhaps issue in a War betwixt the two Nations; which did never yet terminate at long run to the advantage of <hi>England,</hi> and is as unlikely to do so now as ever: For in such a case they would find us unanimous as one Man against them; whereas we are sure that all those who wish well to the Protestant Interest, and their present Constitution, would never join in any such War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; and therefore those who are Enemies to the Peace of the Nations, being aware of this, labour to Effect their design by another Method, and endeavour as much as they can to dash the Government against one another. But they are mistaken in the People of <hi>Scotland:</hi> we are so sensible of our obligations to K. <hi>William;</hi> and know so well what is due to our Deliverer, that it surpasses all their Art to create in us the least ill thought of him; it is not in the temper of our Nation.

Let them consider then what our Nation hath suffered in that respect now for almost 100 years, besides the lessening our Esteem in the eyes of the World, so that our Honour and Substance are both swallow'd up by the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and yet they will neither admit us to the privileges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It will upon due Examination be found as bad policy as it is Christianity, to urge, as some of our Neighbours do, that it is the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to keep the <hi>Scots</hi> low, because they are an independent and free Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were our ancient Enemies; and therefore may be dangerous Neighbours if they grow rich and potent.
