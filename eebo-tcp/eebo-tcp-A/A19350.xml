            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>OF a ſtout Cripple that kept the high way,</l>
               <l>and begd for his liuing all time of the day:</l>
               <l>A ſtory Ile tell you that pleaſant ſhall be,</l>
               <l>the Cripple of Cornwall ſirnamed was he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He crept on his hands &amp; his knees up and downe,</l>
               <l>in a torn iacket and ragged patcht gowne:</l>
               <l>For he had neuer a leg to the knee,</l>
               <l>the Cripple of cornwall ſirnamed was he,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He was of ſtomacke couragious and ſtout,</l>
               <l>for he had no cauſe to complaine of the gout:</l>
               <l>To go upon ſtilts moſt cunning was he,</l>
               <l>with a ſtaffe on his neck gal ant and free.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>His tooles he kept cloſe in an old hol ow tree,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus all the day long he begd for reliefe,</l>
               <l>And late in the night he plaid the falſe theefe:</l>
               <l>And ſeuen yeares together this cuſtome kept he</l>
               <l>and no man thought him ſuch a perſon to be,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>There was few graſtiers wenton the way,</l>

               <l>And euery braue Marchant that he did deſcry.</l>
               <l>he emptied their purſes ere they paſſed by,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The gallant L. Courtney both valliant and bold,</l>
               <l>rode forth with great plenty of ſiluer and gold:</l>
               <l>At Exeter there a purchaſe to pay,</l>
               <l>but that the falſe cripple his iourney did ſtay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For why the falſe cripple heard tidings of late</l>
               <l>as he lay for almes at this noble mans gate:</l>
               <l>What day and what houre his iourney ſhould be,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then to his companions this mater he moued,</l>
               <l>which he in like actions before time had proued.</l>

               <l>With that they L. Courtney ſtoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his defence</l>
               <l>and ſo did his ſeruants but ere they went hence</l>
               <l>Two of the true men were ſtaine in the fight,</l>
               <l>and foure of the theeues were put to their flight,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And while for their ſafegard they ran thus away</l>
               <l>the iolly bold cripple did hold the reſt play.</l>
               <l>And with his pikeſtaffe he wounded them ſo</l>
               <l>as they wers unable to run or to goe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With fight the L. Courtney was driven out of breath</l>
               <l>and moſt of his ſeruanes wounded to death,</l>
               <l>Then came other horſemen riding ſo faſt,</l>
               <l>the cripple was forced to fly at laſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ouer a riuer a riuer that ran their beſide,</l>
               <l>which was very deep and eighteen foot wide,</l>
               <l>With his long ſtaffe and his ſtilts leaped he,</l>
               <l>and ſhifted himſelf in an old hollow tree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then through the country was hue and cry made</l>

               <l>The Crepple he creeps on his hands &amp; his knees</l>

               <l>And thus vnto Exeter creeps he along</l>
