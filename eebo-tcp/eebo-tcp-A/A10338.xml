         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For many there are that see well, and yet haue evill eies. Namely such as delight at the harme of their <hi>brother,</hi> and sorrow at his good. Wherefore we must beware of both effects namely, that we neither behold the prosperitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with griefe, nor their adversitie with ioy.</p>
                     <p>And for the former, we must be so much the more diligent in avoiding it, because a good mind is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times subiect vnto it. When a young man told <hi>Ioshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> that <hi>Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Modad,</hi> prophecied in the host, hee <note place="margin">Num. 11. 27</note> willed <hi>Moses</hi> to forbid them.

summe is this, that we look to our heart the fountaine of these affections, and purifie it.

                     <p>For taunting, as not onely doers but abetters are culpable in faults, so these scoffers as well as the doers of evill; and so much the more, because they scoffe the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, as when they said, <hi>The land wherein the Lord is.</hi> How heavy the hand of the Lord was on <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakeh</hi> for this blasphemy, we haue an evident exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

be faulty herein, consider the end of the <hi>givers and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> whereof the <hi>one strangled</hi> himselfe, the other were <hi>overthrowne</hi> in the destruction threatned against them.

Oh that they would at length consider wisely of it! And here should I speake to the Magistrate of the city, if hee were present, in that matter, which hath beene often moved vnto him, for the provision for such as might minister the word vnto them, which in the <hi>Apostles</hi> iudgement is necessary: <hi>No man at any time goeth to warre on his own

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F these three verses, the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are diverslie <hi>translated</hi> &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by reason of the diverse significations of the <hi>words.</hi> And the difficulty seemeth to bee such in my eies, that I dare not take on mee particularly to avouch the meaning of the <hi>Prophet</hi> in each word, but submitting my selfe to your iudgements, &amp; to any, that shal yeeld reason of any other exposition. I will impart vnto you, that which in my opinion see meth most likely. Which is that, which agreeth with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16034:69"/>
the circumstances of the text, and generall drift of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Which is evident by that which hath beene set downe already, and that which is afterwards added in the last verse. So that wee shall not greatly erre, if in in this or that particular word we hit not on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meaning of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> so long as we keep the generall doctrine without errour.</p>
                     <p>It hath beene said before, that the seed of <hi>Iacob.</hi> should possesse their ancient inheritance, and destroie their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies. These points are here againe handled, but so that it is promised they should not onely repossesse their ancient right but also much more by extending the bonds and limits of their possessions every way.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>land of promise</hi> is so situated, that it hath on the South the land of the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> called here the <hi>mount of Esau;</hi> on the West a low plain, which was the country of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> on the North lay <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and on the East, <hi>Gilead, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Iosua</hi> the <note place="margin">Ios. 13.</note> best Geographer hath taught vs. The meaning is then that looke how farre the borders of their dominions in former times extended, so much should they repos sesse, yea that they should stretch out farther on every side, and possesse much more. <hi>Samaria</hi> is here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, with certaine <hi>shiers</hi> as it were on the north, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the difficultie which seemed to be in winning them, for that the king of <hi>Assyria</hi> hauing taken <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and led away the people captiue, had peopled that citie and the countrie about with many stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And for the like cause it may seeme that <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> is here named, for that being little and seated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:16034:69"/>
many enimies, they were in greatest danger to be dispossessed, &amp;c. had they not receaued this pro mise, that eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their borders by the seed of <hi>Iacob</hi> should be inhabited. Now whereas they were divided into two people <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah:</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> were cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away captiues by <hi>Salmanasar,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> by <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar.</hi> Wherefore in the words following, the promise is made vnto both, laying downe the borders of both the kingdomes, &amp;c. This being laid downe followeth the other point of the destruction of the enimies. <hi>Saviours shall come vp to mount Sion to iudge the mount of Esau.</hi> Where by the name of <hi>(Saviour)</hi> the rules and governours are meant: for to <hi>iudge,</hi> is to rule and execute iudgement in right of the oppressed, as it is commonly vsed in the booke of <hi>Iudges.</hi> And this they shall doe by comming vp to <hi>Sion,</hi> the strongest fort in <hi>Iewrie.</hi> Finally <hi>the kingdome</hi> (it is said) <hi>shall be the</hi> LORDS: to note the happy state of the faithfull, having such a one for the governour, so mightie and therefore able, so mercifull, and therefore willing to keep them safe from all evill, and to participate with them all good things.</p>
                     <p>The performance of al this was in part represented by the bodily restitution of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> when by proclamation of <hi>Cyrus, Zerubabel, Ioshua, &amp;c.</hi> came and built <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and continued by <hi>Iudas Macabeas,</hi> who iudged the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and so are these called <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi> where notwithstanding GOD doth this by them his lieutenants, as he also said to <hi>Samuel, they haue not refused thee, but me.</hi> But this fully performed and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16034:70"/>
in the deliverance of our soules, by <hi>Christ</hi> who himselfe preached to the lost sheepe of the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and then by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> sent from <hi>mount Sion</hi> into all the world, and so were <hi>Idumea</hi> &amp; <hi>Palestina,</hi> &amp;c. subiected, when all were ioined to make one flock. As also the kingdome is <hi>Christs, king of all kings &amp; Lord of all Lords,</hi> of whom the <hi>Angel</hi> said that he should <hi>raigne for ever.</hi> And out of controversie, the <hi>Prophet</hi> meant not so much the former bodily as the latter spirituall deliverance, and restitution; even as the event plainly shewed. For although that the men of <hi>Iuda</hi> returned, vnder <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. yet the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so restored; so that assuredly wee are to thinke that by corporall benefits, spirituall blessings are signified. By the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the <hi>spirituall seed of Abra ham;</hi> by repossession of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the possession of the <hi>graces of the holy Ghost.</hi> A misterie touched before, and to be had in remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the better vnderstanding of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> For it pleased GOD by liuely figures to foster the expectation, which his people had of <hi>Christ. Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Sampson,</hi> the one a <hi>Nazarite</hi> of his brethren, the other for his brethren, figures of <hi>Christ,</hi> who should come out of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as the <hi>Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16034:70"/>
looking on him that saueth vs from all our sinnes. For as <hi>Moses</hi> brought the <hi>Israelites</hi> to the border of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and sight of it, but none except <hi>Iosua</hi> could bring them into possession of it: so the law may shew vs, the blessings and <hi>promises</hi> of GOD, but <hi>Christ</hi> by his gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell maketh vs enioy them. So <hi>Davids</hi> stone refused. <hi>Ionah</hi> in the belly of the whale, &amp; his torments, <hi>Christs</hi> death and <hi>resurrection.</hi> And even so these things here handled are by the <hi>Apostles</hi> expounded of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> according to the faith. That place of <hi>Isaiah 9. Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthalie,</hi> Mat. 4. when the light of the truth shone amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them. That which is in the last of <hi>Amos, Iames, 5. Acts,</hi> 9. applied not only to <hi>Israel,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, but according to the spirit also. In the place where it was saide <hi>yee are my people,</hi> fulfil led in Christians, when they are called the sonnes of GOD. As <hi>Iames, Paul, Matthew</hi> expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded those, so we these.

Which opinion is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be marked against the franticke dreames of <hi>Iewish Rabbines,</hi> who dreaming their men that now liue, to bee they who should bee thus set in possession, doe not expound that which here is said of such as were led captiue, of them that <hi>Salmanasar</hi> and <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>

                     <p>Against which peevish exposition we need not say much: onely we may note, that it cannot stand with the circumstances of the text. For when it is said <hi>this host,</hi> it is evident that hee spoke of his owne time, that is, of such as presently were here caried into captivity. 2. <hi>Zarephath</hi> is elsewhere in Scripture, 1. <hi>King. 17.

For they say that when <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua</hi> expelled the <hi>Cananites,</hi> many of them fled into <hi>Germanie,</hi> whereas in the 1. 2. 3. of <hi>Iudges,</hi> it is said of such as were not slaine, that they remained in this and that tribe. 3. Where here the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaketh of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as of two distinct parts, it is manifest that <hi>Titus</hi> only led away them of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> after their captivitie by <hi>Salmanasar</hi> were never restored. 4. Where they adde that <hi>Zepharad</hi> being a proper name commeth neer to the name wherewith they call <hi>Spaine,</hi> it is plaine that although the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> expoundeth it as a proper name, yet is not the name of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and it might be the name of some place then knowne, that now is not.
