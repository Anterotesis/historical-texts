         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gentlemen of no leſſe

houſes, with expectation of newe occaſions to be eftſoones
employed. And after they had (ſome little tyme) diſpenſed
with the honeſt and chaſte entertainments of their wyues,
diſpoſing (withall) their houſholde &amp; familiar affayres, they
determined by mutuall méetings, to reſtore their late wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

the preſent ſeaſon coulde ſtyrre vp, or moſt conueniently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed
with their ſtate and condition: wherein, foreſéeing the
tearme of their delytes to be but ſhort, as moſt aſſured that
the warres would reuiue, they erected by common conſent
a lawe to viſite one another mutually and generally, vnder
this ſpeciall couenaunt, that as the huſbandes ſhould not go

be a common communion of delyte and benefite in that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,

ſort of companie, euery one contented, and their progreſſe

by ſuch meanes to recouer the arrerages of that pleaſaunt
ſeaſon, which fortune had kept from them ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the warres. This was their beginning and entrie
into their common wealth of delytes: but, as they were not
all of one conformitie, eyther by an inequalitie of yeares or
maners, ſo euery one made choyſe of his pleaſure according
to his complexion and nature: the elder ſort for the moſt

            <p>Amongſt the reſt,<note place="margin">Three chiefe men in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue.</note> there were in this companie thrée yong

not to ſéeme exempted from the thing which moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

<hi>Glaphyro</hi> better ſtayed than the reſt, enterneyd the Ladies

               </gap>r with the deliuerie of all Iermany, without
ſtroke of ſworde, for the onely feare of him to whome the
whole worlde is promiſed: The Auncients folowing their
eſtate of yeares and diſcreſſion entertayned graue diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſometimes in matters of a common welth, &amp; ſometimes
touching the courſe and condicion of our life, but aboue all,
they decyphered the nature of this earthly fragilitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
when we accompt vs moſt neare the reſolute ſucceſſe of
our buſineſſe, it is then we are founde oftentimes by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
miſterie, no leſſe farre from it, than afore we held vs
ſure of the ende. With theſe voluntarie ſpeaches was alſo
drawne into argument this Queſtion, howe it happeneth
and that by many examples of proofe, that a Capitaine,
who in the firſt race of his lyfe carying (as it were) fortune
vpon his ſhoulders, and happelie preuayling in many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes
of equall perill and pollecie, ſhoulde, in riper age
which with long vſe ought to (aſſure a more full and perfit
experience) be in one inſtant, as though Fortune were
wearie to fauour him any longer, ouerthrowne euen by a
young man, to whoſe courſe and conſent of nature, ſhould
be alſo a leſſe lykelyhoode of proofe and experience in ſuche
affayres: here was <hi>Alexander</hi> eſtéemed moſt happie aboue
all his felicities, for that in the glory and flower of his yeres
he gaue ende by one ſelfe meane, to his lyfe and vertues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
and had not as then felt the ſmarting whippes of
fortune, who no doubt at length had philed him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role
and prepared aſmuch for him as for others of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
and place. This argument ranne thorowe the whole
companie and founde authoritie by many and ſundrie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as ſome tranſferring the guilt of ſuch defaultes not to
fortune, but to our ſelues, who féeling vs rayſed and puffed
vp with all felicitye, doe oftentimes ſo far forget our ſelues
as being blinded with ſo many happie chaunces, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:22781:8"/>
(as it were) out of breath in our ſelues, without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
how the wit and pollecie of other men lyeth alwaies
in waite to aſpire to that degrée, wherevnto, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeneſſe
of our youth and carefull diligence, we labored
in pretence to come, which reaſon as ſome of them iuſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by manye examples, as in the perſonne and ſucceſſe of
<hi>Hanny ball,</hi> when he gaue himſelfe ouer to the delightes
of <hi>Capua:</hi> ſo other paſſing further, layd the whole occaſion
and cauſe to nature, who in all thinges of this worlde doth
encreaſe according to our proportion by little and little euen
vntill the degrée of extremitie, and then beginnes to decline
and yéelde to infirmities, ſo as it ſéemes, that ſucceſſiuelye
we all play arſiuerſie. A thing to be veryfied not only in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler
men, but alſo by moſt huge monarchies, wherein is
founde the age of infancie, virilytie or manhoode, and ſo
olde age which leades them to theyr ruyne and fall: ſo
that ſeeing nature is their guide, it is not to be noted
ſtraunge, if men, whoſe buſines in their ſeaſon haue happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuccéeded, &amp; drawing to extréeme age, though they grow
ſtrong and mightie in councell, yet become weake in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
and benefites of fortune. This was the maner and
matter of diſcourſe of theſe Gentlemen, who ſéemed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
to prognoſticate ſomwhat of the preſent tyme, albeit
with ſuch modeſty, that without preciſe diligence and héede,
the intent of their reaſons coulde not be eaſilye diſcerned:
wherein albeit they were not vnderſtande of euery one, yet
were they harde with ſinguler and ſetled cares, with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
that euery one gaue his iudgement a part as beſt
agréed with his peculiar fancie. But as they thus continued
in varietie of matter, falling eftſoones into freſh occaſions to
entertaine their arguments all that after dinner, <hi>Phylopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
(after the table vncouered) weighing (as it ſéemed) in an

theſe good and auncient Capitaynes, who after a long proofe

their eſtates and rule in cities, doe chooſe the fielden
lyfe as there to entertaine the reſidue of their tyme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue

and at length that great Emperor <hi>Dyocleſian,</hi> to whom
if the citie ſéemed a kinde of priſon, what belongs to vs to

otherwayes, as in exerciſes of actiuitie &amp; value of the

(for ſo ſhall be hir name at this tyme) are you yet to

it belonged to hir both in reaſon and honour, not to denie

if eyther I were worthie for companie, or méete in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
I would it might not offend you to name me a thirde,
not to holde equall place and ſocietie with you, but onely to

<hi>Charyclea,</hi> who perhaps was no leſſe wearie than

ſimple conſent at the firſt, than vſing the pollycie of long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
to be conſtrayned in the ende to condiſcende to your

obeyed, not as in your requeſt, <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> to play
the Regiſter as you require, but rather to ſtand me in ſtéed

where at the firſt, they encountered the poore <hi>Monophylo,</hi>
languiſhing in heauie and doubtfull thoughtes, to whome

vndertaking the ſpéech of all hir company, framed hir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
to the poore paſſioned <hi>Monophylo</hi> and ſayde vnto
him: Albeit (ſir) in the argument, and outwarde vewe
of your diſtreſſe, I finde no leſſe cauſe of compaſſion
than my ſelfe redily inclined therevnto, yet I can not but
prepare complaint againſt you, as ſeeing you wholie reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into a ſtate of ſorow, and that in theſe fieldes of ſolace,
who (in reſpect of their delightfull vewe) ought not onelye
to drawe you to a diſpoſition of ioye and pleaſure, but alſo
to conſent with this honorable company in the exerciſe of
their moſt honeſt diſportes: wherein by how much you ſée
vs delight in this paradiſe of ioye &amp; mutuall comfort, by ſo
much we finde you to ſettle and giue place to your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
the ſame making vs ſuſpect, that eyther you gréeue
in our common pleaſure, or elſe languiſhe in ſome peculy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
and ſecret heauineſſe of minde, which if it pleaſed you to
communicate, I beléeue there is not one of vs whoſe ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſhould not be offred to eaſe your burthen, wherein I
preſume to vndertake and proteſt for theſe two gentlemen:
But if that which I iudge worthie of pittie in you, is but a
pollecie of nature, your ſelfe may as ſpéedily cure the cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:22781:10"/>
as you ſéeme cunning to diſſemble the ſmart, wherevnto
I leaue you, with this laſt aduiſe, that the readieſt meane
to releeue a greefe, is to will to be eaſed: Madam ſayth
<hi>Monophylo,</hi> it is an aſſured libertie to a frée minde to giue
aduiſe, but very harde for a man in miſerie to admit anye
councell, and let death be a due iuſtice to hym, who vnder
pollecye will deſſemble torment, albeit ſome euilles carry
this reuerent nature rather to be concealed with griefe,
then reuealed in hope of remedye, and it is a common wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to be as willing to be eaſed, as loth to ſuffer ſmart,
wherein for my part (good Madam) I yelde you manye
humble thankes, &amp; no leſſe to the Gentlemen, aſſuring you
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if there were vertue in you to giue order to my ſorowes
by how much leſſe I haue deſerued it, euen ſo much larger
ſhoulde my bonde ſtretch to labour to be thankefull: And
yet I praye you haue this opinion of my care and trauell
of minde, not to diſtende by chaunce, but by a naturall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by which I am guiltie of mine owne euill: Theſe bée
but ſpéeches at pleaſure (ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) neyther can
you make me beléeue that heretofore I haue not ſéene you
better diſpoſed, and therefore am ieylowſe that you haue
ſome eyle vnder the rocke, which bicauſe you will
not diſcouer, bréedes you this confuſion and dyuiſion of
minde: And be it you confeſſe it, as the better to defende
your condition, giuing it ſuch vertue or qualitie as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
it, your gréefe woulde continue in one conſtaunt
eſtate and as it is, where in diſcouering it, woulde (with
the canker) ſpred further, not vnlike the nature of a gréene
wounde, or a diſeaſe to whome the ayre is forbidden: yet
(vnder correctiou) the reſemblaunce agréeth not: for albeit
the diſeaſes of the body require the abode and felowſhip of
the houſe, the ſickneſſes concerning the ſpirite (according
to the opinion of the Phiſitions of the ſoule) who be the
Philoſophers, deſire of the contrarie, ſkope and ayre, as
moſt proper for their recouerie: So that in greateſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22781:10"/>
of loue (from whome in my fancie diſcendes the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of your preſent greefe) albeit they haue commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
thrée thinges, to bée ſolytarie, ſecret, and carefull, yet
the better to direct theſe paſſions, they haue not forbidden
the ſocietie of an other them ſelfe, into whoſe boſome they
may aſſuredly diſtill the ſecret paſſions of their mindes, as
by that meane the rather to giue ſuccours to a thouſande
ſmall diſquiets and indiſpoſitions falling howerly into our
fancies, eyther by a falſe ſuſpicion, or faint feare, which
ſome call ielowſie, without the which loue can no more
bée, than a body without a ſoule: here <hi>Monophylo,</hi> ſéeing
an entrie into the fielde wherin he moſt delighted to walk
(as to ſpeake of loue the onely moouer of his diſquiet) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to enter into a freſhe ſtomake, and as one cunningly
clawed, wher it pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ytched, prepared himſelfe to play
his part, when by good aduenture, and to entertaine for an
houre my inconſtant thoughtes, I was alſo withdrawne
thyther without any ſuſpicion at all of their purpoſe, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
ſéeing their manner, arguing their further intent, I
ſhrouded my ſelfe ſubtillie in a tuffe of young trées the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to impart with their diſcourſe, vſing rather ſilence than
offer of ſpeache, the better to vnderſtand their yſſue which
fell out in ſort, as you may reade in the ſequell of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aloge:
For <hi>Monophylo</hi> conſidering the importunitye of
their requeſtes, and vnder what conditions they require
him to diſcouer the cauſe and ſtate of his ſorowe, breake of
at laſt his wearie ſilence, and began to vnfolde in what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
&amp; eſtimation he held loue, &amp; alſo that to him only belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to ſpeake of him &amp; his lawes: But to deſcribe him in
dede in his true degre, I think there was neuer any ſo déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pinched with the miſeries of loue, nor more honored him
in his common behauiour than this <hi>Monophylo,</hi> in whom
was ſetled ſuche a reſolute iealouſie, that onely he (in his
fancie) was worthie to ſpeake of loue, whoſe heart langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and laboured in the preſent motion, or at leaſt had

ſometyme in his lyfe made experience of his ſtinges, and

               </gap>e heauie and groſſe iudgementes, who taſting onely
the outwarde rynde, had neuer the facultie to decerne the
true ſenſe and vertue of loue: ſéeing, to ſuch people it was
alwayes forbidden to ſpeake of loue, according as we reade
of the prieſtes in olde tyme, who bicauſe they woulde not
haue the myſteryes of theyr <hi>ſacroſauntos</hi> prophane, would
not ſuffer ſtraungers to handle or vſe them: by whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Monophylo,</hi> as a true and ſimple miniſter in loue,
ſtryuing ſtill to ſounde and make further way to the ſpeach
of <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> ſayd vnto him: ſuch philoſophers (ſir) haue
iudged, as blinde men deſcerne of colours, euen ſo they are
to be pardoned, as men at vnwares ſpeaking impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For as they profeſſed no inclynation to loue, ſo, ſtanding
inexperienced in ſuch fittes as you note in me, they muſt
néedes be alſo ignoraunt eyther howe to gouerne him or
guyde themſelues. I know not, ſayth <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> in what
ſort you direct your opinion, but in my fancie and common
reaſon, it is farre more eaſie to ſuch as beſtowe their tyme
and ſtudie in contemplation, to iudge in theſe affayres, then
to any who haue no further ſkoape than within this <hi>Deda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
where they labour in ſuche varietie and confuſion of

of all ſenſe, braine, and ſpirite, yea ſometymes they looſe
euen the remembraunce of themſelues. You knowe, that
to get the name of a good Phiſition, is not requiſite to lye
long ſicke, and to merite the prayſe of an excellent Lawyer,
is not méete to haue manye ſutes in his proper and priuate
name: But of the contrary, in reſpect of the motions and
troubles traueiling diuerſly the minds of men, it ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the common order of phiſick, that the Phiſition cure
himſelfe, or miniſter by his owne counſayle onely: and to
the Aduocate it is defended to pleade in his owne cauſe, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22781:11"/>
in regarde of a certaine imperfection of ſpirite vnknowne
to him: and laſtly experience and nature agrée, that our
iudgementes are more ſounde and vpright in caſes of
ſtraungers, than in our owne cauſes. This compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
(ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) albeit at the firſt ſhowe appeares
not impertinent, yet, touching the caſe which is offered, I
pray you let me aſke you, <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> whether it
were not ſuperfluous to giue counſaile in loue to ſuch, who
being exempted from his lawes, ſeeme alſo voyde of neede to
be eyther warned or inſtructed: wherein, if in ſuch reſpect,
ſuch Philoſophie is no leſſe improper, than inprofitable,
would it not become a greater ſcorne and mockery to any,
who neuer proouing the rules and vſe of Geometrie, would
yet vndertake to giue precepts of that art afore <hi>Ptolomeus:</hi>
Likewiſe, who in the profeſſion of an Orator or eloquence,
would offer to inſtruct <hi>Cicero,</hi> or who liuing alwayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vſe &amp; iudgement in armes, and no leſſe in exercyſed in
the guide and charge of an armie, woulde direct <hi>Hannibal</hi>
in matters of warre, ſhoulde not he be valued with <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi>
that is rude and groſſe, as <hi>Phormio</hi> was iudged by
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he preſumed to leade that worthie Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in the Arte wherein ſtoode his greateſt ſkill and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
If theſe be notes of vanitie in theſe inſolent men,
what leſſe imputation of folly can you lay to your worthie
ſchoolemayſters, whome you will haue to inſtruct ſuch, as
being alreadie forwarde and aduaunced in loue are able to
learne more in a moment of themſelues, than by the bookes
or perſwaſions of all thoſe ſmatterers of Philoſophie, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
without experience that way. And, in the truth of
your owne fancie and conſcience, I aſke you <hi>ſeigneur Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo,</hi>
to which of theſe two woulde you giue more fayth,
eyther to an <hi>Amadis</hi> of gawle figured by our Romaynes
for a patterne of true and loyal loue, or to <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> who
hauing not ſo much as a noſe to ſmell the true ſent of loue,
may rightly be compared to a ſtone, for that vſing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="tcp:22781:12"/>
one night with a Gentlewoman ſingularly fayre, was
not of power ſo much as to touch hir, notwithſtanding hir
delicate and intyſing allurements. And yet you will erect
ſuch one to preſcribe vs preceptes of gouernment in thys
Art: wherein offering to paſſe further, <hi>Charyclea</hi> intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, as not willinge to giue hym further libertye of
ſpeach till he had ſatiſfied hir in one poynt. And ſéeing (ſayth
ſhée) our mutuall talke of one to another, ſéekes in this ſort
to ſuccéede to matter of argument, I will leaue the motion
and purſute of your diſputations, grounded (as it ſéemes) to
ſift the cauſe of your proplexitie, and referre to your good
and wiſe diſcretions the reſolution of that, wherewith you
ſéeme to torment your ſelues in vaine, in which <hi>ſeigneur

vpon whome I am to giue the charge, if (as they ſaye)
you ſupplie not the pageaunt with an other part, becauſe
your laſt ſpeache (as I thinke) tendes to a falſe blame of
the good Philoſopher <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> as not to incline readily
to the will of a woman, notwithſtanding ſhe was fauoured
with euery perfection in beautie: woulde you maintaine,
that a man poſſeſſing ſuche happie place, merits ſiniſterly,
if he depart eyther without doing ſacrifice to his pleaſure,
or adding execution to the aduauntage of his tyme and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22781:12"/>
place: what doe you knowe whether this <hi>Xenocrates</hi> had
his heart conſecrated to another Ladie, and being ſo, would
you (as you ſeeme) make it a ſtraunge and rare vertue, or
woonder at his chaſte gouernement, as to obſerue loyaltie
where he had alreadie pawnde his fayth, or that he with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie

without offence: yea this triall paſſing naturall perill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

duly requiſite in a man, and aſſures his affection to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

with ſuch modeſtie and behauiour of delight, that the whole

<hi>Monophylo</hi> tooke it ſo, and that your ſayings caried truth,
would you thinke notwithſtanding that opinion to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious:
touching my ſelfe, I would iudge him of ſlender wit
and leſſe diſcretion (what profeſſion of loue ſoeuer he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

Libertie of ſpeach (ſayth the Ladie) diſcouereth truly
the inconſtancie of thoughtes, and wordes pronounced for

which rightly is verified in you, in the matter of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I doubt not, differs ynough from the conſent and
iudgement of your thoughtes. But what ſay you <hi>ſeigneur
Monophylo,</hi> what fayth can you afoorde to his ſayings?
Oh Madame (ſayth he) God defend that my mouth ſhould
deliuer ſuch ſpeach: yea, if I were guiltie but in thought, I
woulde reſtore the fault with criminall penance, and laying
<pb facs="tcp:22781:13"/>
my ſelfe vpon the ſentence of all Ladyes, I would endure
mortall puniſhment as a mylde iuſtice. Neyther ment I
to reprehende <hi>Xenocrates</hi> for ſuch dealing, if his deuotion
were vowed to another ſaint, ſeeing that as his vertue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites

conſcience) I proteſt here to abhorre his opinion,
notwithſtanding it be grounded vppon good and auncient
lawes, drawne out of the Regiſters of <hi>Venus</hi> Temple at
Rome, whoſe tenor bare expreſſe permiſſion to execute our
actuall will on all as occaſion offered: hauing alſo for my
ſelfe the aucthoritie of cuſtome ſetled by long diſtent of time
into the mindes of men, to the which it were lawfull for
me to haue recourſe if the lawe ſhoulde fayle me. But I
feare greatly, ſayth <hi>Chariclea,</hi> that lawe neuer founde
place in the Chapter houſe, albeit it were enrolled in the
temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> nor publiſhed thorow the whole temple,
but onely to ſuch as ſtoode on the ridge and battlements of
the Churche and not to others, who choſe their reſidence
within the heart, and they eyther may pretende the law not
to be generall, or at leaſt alledge ignoraunce to vnderſtand
it: And touching your recourſe to cuſtome (as you threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
you are not now to know that ſuch corruption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
gotten by an vſurped vſe, doe not merite the name of
cuſtome: for ſo (to ſhadow and couer our faultes by nature
and worldly infection) might we holde by the ſame reaſon,
that the vices wherevnto we are inclyned ſince the ſinne of
our firſt father, haue woonne the name of cuſtume lawfull
and valable: which ſpeache ſo ſhaked <hi>phylopolo,</hi> that fore
bearing to offer any further queſtion, they founde matter
ynough to treate vppon. And therefore renuing the charge

vpon <hi>Charyclea</hi> agaynſt loyaltie, I feare Madame (ſayth
he) that if you and I ſhoulde enter this combate, the
iſſue woulde ſtande ſo harde betwéene vs, as the doubt
woulde followe who ſhoulde glorie in the victorye, ſéeing
indifferent errors woulde riſe on both ſides: And I thinke
ſingularitie is no leſſe diſpleaſing to God, than if a manne
made diuiſion of his hart to many women, ſéeing amongſt
the reaſt, it bringeth this lothſome inconuenience, that
the loue of men to women béeing extréeme, and a rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other paſſions, makes vs oftentimes forſake the
loue of God, and ymagin our God to reſt in them, as if we
ſhoulde doe worſhip to Idols, whoſe nature is vnder vaine
reſemblances, to corrupt the deuocion of men: a thing ſo
common in example, that to a ſenſible iudgement, a ſlender
reherſall may ſuffice: onely I pray you remember many
millions af great eſtates, whoſe lyfe (ſo long as they were
gouerned with numbers of Concubines) neuer fell into
actuall ſtaine or populer obloquie, but when they layde
themſelues vpon the rule of one onely, they became ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed
in fancie and affection, that by the teſtimonie of the
hyſtories, their confuſion prooued not onelye hurtfull to
themſelues, but hatefull to their common wealth and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
as what buſineſſe (in common experience) ſuccéedes
moſt commonly more vnhappily, then where the affection
is parſhiall, and the partie led in a ſinguler councell, which
may be corrupted eyther in aduiſe or action. We ſée alſo
by naturall reaſon, that a thing diſperſed and diſſipated, is
neuer ſo ſharpe and cruell, as that which is vndeuided:
And therefore Madam I thinke it not inconuenient to the
humour and appetite of man, and far better for the ſuerty
of his delight, to make a generall eſtimation of all Ladies,
then vnder a ſhadowe of loyaltie, drawing after one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
ſcent, to mooue his owne ſkorne to all the worlde.
Here <hi>Monophylo</hi> to whome as the cauſe of loyaltie was
more déere than to the Lady, ſo he chalenged afore hir the
<pb facs="tcp:22781:14"/>
reuenge of this blaſphemie in this ſort: marke good Ladye
I beſéech you, with what rethorike this Gentleman ſéekes
to cloake a huge vice vnder a high couer, which is God:
Why did he not inferre by the ſame meane, that mariage
is not good according to the preſent obſeruation and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the holy lawes, but rather (after Mahomets or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
to giue a libertie of many wiues at one time, to thende
that ſparing to ſet our heart vpon one, we put not alſo in
hazarde to forget our loue to God: Bée your owne iudge,
<hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi> and pronounce ſentence againſt your
owne error, which in effect, reſembles the auncient <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nikes,</hi>
who in their fonde imagination of a common welth,
woulde erect a communitie of women, and that in generall
vſe and degree. Which opinion notwithſtanding (as it well
deſerued) was baniſhed from all frée ſtates well gouerned:
But why doe I ſtande vppon ſtrange contemplations, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Citie of Chriſtendome doth warne vs ſufficiently
in this: For reade we not on all ſides that the coniunction
of one man, to one woman is onely required: yea, albeit
ſeconde mariages are tollerated by Gods lawe and mans
pollecie, yet were they neuer founde ſo ſwéete a ſacrifice
eyther to God or men, as the firſt, and that in reſpect of this
corporall communion diſtributed into manye places: God
gaue to Adam at his firſt entrie into this worlde, one wife
and no more, which he drew out of his bones, as to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
vs of the indiſſoluble amitie which we ought to beare
to our wiues, yea, he commaundes vs to forſake father
and mother (to whome notwithſtanding all law of nature
prouides a ſouereigne obedience) to ſticke one to a nother:
And therefore me thinkes <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> with great
wronge you labour to exempt vs from this extréeme amity
of one to one, which God himſelf hath not only recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but ſtraightly commaunded vnto vs: It maye bée
you will choake me here with a ſiniſter conſtruction of this

            <p>At the firſt, when all mariages were eſtabliſhed vnder a

this diſtinction amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt men, till by corruption of times ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
began to decline, when alſo crept in this difference in
loue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame being at the firſt introduction of dowries when
the lawyers (incenſed vpon a wicked conſideration) to draw
men the rather to this reciprocall coniunction (wherevnto
nature ſufficiently inclined them) brought them into their
common wealthes: and for the ſame reſpect &amp; reaſon, were
inforced to prouide infinite lawes for adulteries, bicauſe
that proouing the inconueniencie wherein by indiſcreſſion
they were falne, as to haue taken from mariage part of
his accuſtomed amitie (and ſupplyed it with their hurtfull
dowries) neceſſitie driue them the better to entertaine their
diſeaſed common wealth, to ſéeke out a newe medecine,
which was by reſtraining ſuch as ſhould defile thoſe mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
notwithſtanding their owne conſtitutions had made
them alreadye corrupted: for a true teſtimonye whereof
you ſhall finde it iuſtified in the common wealth of <hi>Sparta</hi>
where the wiſe lawmaker <hi>Licurgus,</hi> would rayſe no lawe
agaynſt adulterie, as not to bringe that vice into the
knowledge of his Citizens: And what was it that kept it
from their knowledge: not that they were not mooued with
the ſtinges of nature, aſwell as other people and nations:
But rather this excellent and holye ordinaunce. By the
<pb facs="tcp:22781:15"/>
which that graue lawgiuer and Philoſopher ſhutting all

ſuch as enter that holy ſtate at this day defiling their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

this difference in loue to the great blemiſhe and often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice

cuppled, ſée their wiues for the moſt part delight in
an other, to whome it ſéemes the heauens had predeſtinate
them from the beginning: But now <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi>
if in mariage (which at this daye contractes not but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a deſire of wealth and goodes) there be required another
dutie and care of loyaltie, ſuer we are bounde in ſimple
loue, yea, euen on the behalfe of a maried woman, if our
affection chaunce to ſettle or drawe that way wherein if I
waded yet further, as well the matter it ſelfe as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencye
of my meaning, are to cléere me of imputation, and
to maintaine a truth, all ſpéech is tollerable, ſéeing the truth
it ſelfe caryeth ſuch a modeſt countenaunce, that though
ſhée vſe ſilence, yet ſhée ſatiſfieth by ymagination, ſo that if
I ſpare to enforce further proofe, I hope you will not turne
my modeſtie to want of matter, no more than the hounde,
that forbeares to hunt when he hath killed the chaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues
to be rebuked. And ſo perſwading that the lawes
ciuill are not of equall force with the inſtinctes of nature,
it ſhall ſtande as the opinion wherein I will ſettle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue,
with this laſt leſſon, that who in a true and indeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
loue, hath bequeathed his heart to any ſinguler
Myſtreſſe, is bound to no leſſe chaſte behauior to all other
Ladies, in reſpect of hir, than ſillye <hi>Zenocrates</hi> to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22781:15"/>
to aunſwere in this ſort: I ſée well <hi>ſeigneur Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo,</hi>
that in vs ſhall be veryfied the olde ſaying, that one
fable drawes on another, ſéeing that by howe much you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
the authoritie of your matter, by ſo much doe you
ſommon me to maintaine the defence, not onely touching
the poynt of our preſent queſtion, but alſo in others accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the varietie of your proofes, which if I woulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
as I might, and the matter requyres, I feare that
as well you as I ſhould eaſily ſlip into a Quagmire, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the deliuerie or iſſue would be harde: and yet I will not
altogither aunſwere you with ſilence, ſpecially where the
matter it ſelf fauoureth my opinion. And albeit your places
and textes of maryage which you haue here preferred to
giue your mutuall loue, a déeper authoritie, concerne lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing our purpoſe, yet as farre as my facultie will
ſtretch, and your conſent incline, I will ſpeake my fancie,
and leaue you ſatiſfied. I reſemble (you ſay) <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who allowed many wiues at one time, or elſe the auncient
Cinykes, amongſt whome the communitie of wyues was
tollerable: onely I wiſhe it had ſufficed you to applie their
authorityes, albeit they are neither proper to your purpoſe,
nor apt to the matter, and forborne ſimplie their names,
whoſe remembraunce cannot be without hate. But I pray
you, how haue you learned that the maryage of one to one,
is better, than that of one to manye, but of the lawe? the
which notwithſtanding, if by waye of argument it were
lawfull for vs to exempt, (as our thoughtes are frée) thinke
you, my laſt mariage is not armed with defence as well as
your firſt: wherein if amongeſt all other creatures, nature
rayſed vp man onely, for the procreation, inducing vs, (the
better to entertaine this humaine ſocietie) to cope one with
another, can you denie, that the coniunction of one with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is not greater, than to couple felowſhip with one onely
woman: and yet <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> I ſtande not reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in that opinion, ſéeing, that beſides we haue the lawe
<pb facs="tcp:22781:16"/>
written, which in this behalfe bindes both our thoughte
and wordes, yet in vpright iudgement, the knot of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryages
woulde remaine imperfect, for that in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the man would find out an aduauntage aboue the wife:
ſéeing, that béeing all reciprocally enclyned to the ſtynges
and motions of nature, which one of vs could euer be able
to furniſhe contentment and lyking to them all: and ſo
ſhould this coniunction bée defectiue, but not vnfurniſhed of
apparaunce and likelyhoode of reaſon. But what néede we
runne ſo farre into maryages, with the which our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
hath nothing common, ſauing, that hauing no better
meanes to approoue your goodly loyaltie, you were glad in
the beginning to make them ſtande you in turne, but now,
with the knowledge of your fault, you haue alſo confeſſed
the error of them, as not only cutting them of in the ende of
your ſpeache, but alſo that you enter into termes agaynſt
theyr part. And touching that you lay agaynſt me, for the
communitie of wyues, I ſtande as frée from ſuch meaning
as farre from that thought, (albeit I coulde marche vnder
the authoritie, not onely of the Cynickes, but of the Stoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
togither with all theſe people and nations ſometymes
called Meſſagettes, yea euen with <hi>Platos</hi> doctrine, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
ſtyll, that in a common wealth, he is more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
&amp; of nearer affinitie to the vaine Cynikes, who apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his pretence and practiſe to one maryed Gentlewoman
(as you eſtéeme) to the ende to faſhion hir proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to himſelfe, than another, who without ſtay takes hys
flight into all places, according to the offer and fauour of
euery happie wind: a thing wherof I promiſe you to make
declaration, hoping by the ſame meane, that of your ſelfe,
you will applie to your ſelfe the wrong, which wrongfully
you heape vpon me. To mainteyne ſimplie any good order,
or ciuill pollicie to be in the communitie of women (as the
Cynikes holde) woulde appeare to euery one but froth of
ſpeach, not much vnlyke to ſuch, whome tyme and varietie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22781:16"/>
of argument can not make wearie, in the queſtion whether
a confuſed conuerſation of goodes be more conuenient to
mankinde, than a deuiſion, in ſort as we obſerue it at this
day: and what profite would ryſe to put in controuerſie a
thing that could not happen in vſe: and yet there be ſortes
of people, wherof ſome deſire generally of goodes, and ſome
delite in communitie of women: wherein afore we paſſe
further, was not (I pray you) that communitie of goodes
better eſtéemed in the auncient common wealth of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,
where theftes and pillage were tollerated,
then in the ſtate of Rome, where theeues and robbers were
double puniſhed: wherein as I will not enter into your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
ſo for my ſelfe, I preſume euer vpright iudgement will
conſent with me in opinion, no leſſe for the qualitie of the
matter, which in it ſelfe is aſſuredly graue, then in reſpect
of the conformitie of the reaſons and proofes aſſiſted wyth
vndoubted authoritie. Let vs then diſcende from tranſitory
goodes, to women in generall (which ſéeme to haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
reſemblaunce one of the other) &amp; ſo we ſhall find with
whether of the two common wealthes your opinion hath
moſt conformitie: you allowe loyaltie, with tolleration alſo
that a woman maryed giue hir ſelfe to hir peculiar friend,
the ſame reſembling the ordinaunce of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> who by
a priuie theft would practiſe to himſelfe a thing which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
by the law belonged to another: wherin what
confuſion doe you indiſcretely admit, as to leaue nothing in
particuler to men, but that wherevnto your nature doth
drawe you, and hauing conquered the good will of a Ladie,
you will haue Idolatrie committed, and that rather vnder a
vaine and fonde ſelfe fancie, then in any true tytle of the
loyaltie you ſpeake of: wherein <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the errour of this communitie wherein you are ſlipt
vnaduiſedly) you comprehend not rightly in my iudgement
the order of euery nature. For if al things in the world haue
their ſeaſons, wherein they fall ſucceſſiuely from one to an
<pb facs="tcp:22781:17"/>
other, may it not ſtande with the ſame reaſon, that béeing
come to the marke wherevnto we did pretende, we reſigne
and giue vp our place to another: if the fower ſeaſons of
the yeare ſhould ſtande in this difference, as the one falling
into ſeaſonable oportunitie with vs, and his terme expyred,
would not make place to another, as the Spring tyme to
Sommer, the Sommer to Autumne, and laſtly Autumne
to Winter, woulde you not thinke the fatall ruine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſement
of the worlde to be at hande: euery thing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by heauenly influence to take his time, as we haue
ſéene in example moſt mightie Monarchies by an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge
and reuolution of thinges, to be tranſlated from
one people to another, as the Aſſyrians to the Medes, the
ſame to the Perſians, then to the Greekes, then to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes,
and laſtly reuerted once againe to the Greekes, ſo
that you dreame in vanitie, if that you thinke to eſtabliſhe
an eternitie in this world, and much leſſe plant a perpetuall
will ſo long as you abide vpon earth: neyther doth nature
ſuffer it, who to declare to vs howe much ſhée delighted in
this great varietie, became diſguiſed hirſelfe in an hundreth
thouſand ſortes for our vſe: and not onely in thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

For my part, as I eſtéeme moſt in a man, diligence
and high courage, the better to merite and winne the price
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22781:17"/>
of ſuch a pray, ſo alſo, dwelling in the conqueſt of it, without
ſtomacke eftſoones to venture in a victorie of more maieſtie
and ſtate, cannot eſcape the note of a cowardly minde, not
vnlyke the barbarous peaſant, who noſeled in vile and baſe
exerciſes, dare not lift vp his minde to aſpire to greater
thinges: why then ſhall any man be of ſuch negligent and
low ſtomacke, as to bring his minde within ſinguler lymit,
ſéeing the more conqueſtes he perfourmes, the further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds
his value and eſtimation: if <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſufficed
in the mightie eſtate of his owne kingdome, had he euer
come to poſſeſſe the vniuerſall Monarchie: and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
with the generall Empyre, he ſought ſtyll to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
his victoryes to attemptes of farre more high and deepe
perill if eyther by the power or pollecie of man, he coulde
haue ſought out more worldes: wherein as (by his example)
it ſtandes not with the nature of a valiant minde, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a little, ſo he that limittes his glorie, is vnworthie
of it, and he leaſt meritorious of commendation with whom
ſingularitie ſtandes in value, and will not enforce a further

this humaine ſocietie: haue you not heard of the compariſon
whiche the auncient Romaine exhibyted to the people of
Rome, to make them knitte and enter coniunction with the
Senatours, as repreſenting vnto them the bodie of man,
which no doubt would eaſily diſſolue and grow to end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

that in acknowledging the benefite which I receyue, the

héede <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> and ſticke not to repoſe credyte
in my councell, that being (as you profeſſe) a generall
traficor, and borowing at a highe intereſt, that when you

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22781:18"/>
with a doubble vſurie: the ſame béeing the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the preſent time, that who burnes with the

your part (<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>) albeit I had no intent at
all to make my ſelfe any partie to your quarell (ſéeyng you
ſtood on my ſide) but rather to leaue it to the cenſure of you

with you in all the reſt, I feare ſhall hardly fauor your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that our louer pretend and mainetaine a perfect loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

prouided a behauiour of the huſbande towardes his wife of

had ſtande as an indoubted authoritie: But to agrée wyth

to him which loueth perfitlye and is not maried, or to
the huſbande who onely is induced to take a wife in reſpect
of ſubſtaunce and wealth, wherewith (for my part) I can

not conſent, ſéeing that albeit, a huſbande be imperfect
in manye thinges, to allure and drawe loue, yet it is a
Chriſtian duety in the wyfe to loue him onely bicauſe God

the ſuttle tie of him, who hauing intiſed a woman to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that the Oxe, houſe, or feelde of hir neighbour being
better than hir owne, ſhoulde be alſo more acceptable and
welcome to hir, woulde therefore ſucceſſiuely conclude
(ymagining to holde hir in his nettes) that ſhe ſhould owe
more loue to hir neighbour, if he ſéemed of better taſte, than
to hir huſbande: his error being monſtrous in it ſelfe, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to be defaced with ſundrie reaſons: for the wife albeit he
for whome ſhe is prouided, is neyther riche, fayre nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned
with equall cauſe of delight to others, yea be it that
without conſent of affection ſhe be thruſt to him, yet in the

had not tolde him the yll ſauour of his breath, which in
ſtraunge company was ſtraungely reproched againſt him:
in good fayth huſbande (ſayth ſhée) I thought all other
mens breathe caryed the lyke ſauour: ſo that a woman
ought to make the beawtie and bountie of hir huſbande a

and therefore for our better aſiſtaunce, the lawes
are deliuered as a bridle to our fleſhely deſires, which wée

for all that they muſt not be reſtrayned in anye ſorte: in

it was lawfull for them in ſuch foyſon and maſſe of welth,

Will you then confounde your ſelfe, and reuerſe your

ſiniſterly in your minde: if in your common wealth of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia
(whoſe authoritie you haue vſed) the people

(ſo peculyarly eſtéemed aboue the reſt) woulde haue

ſuffreth ſometimes to taſte vnholeſome brothes, to the ende

ſhoulde reſtraine or tie him to one ſinguler obſeruation of
his ſtraight preceptes, his perill might prooue mortall, and

who in a generall corruption of maners applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
oftentimes to the willes and humours of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
finde it neceſſarie to tollerate vice, in reſpect to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
vertue and good things, the ſame happening in the
example of dowries, which for ſuch reſpect and reaſon haue
bene founde neceſſarie in mariage, being no other thing
than a common ſocyetie: And if amongeſt marchauntes,
the better to entertaine their traficke, yet be lawfull for one
to furniſh the charge, in counterchaunge of another that

affordes his diligence, what ought we to thinke in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation
of man to woman, whereof (as I haue ſayde,)
all the brunt and matter touching this humaine practice
dependes on the witte and pollicie of the man: ſure (<hi>ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur

then this little that I haue ſayd, ſuffice to prooue a neceſſitie
of dowries in the courſe of mariages, and yet not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
as vnder colour of a corrupt nature, eyther man nor

ſpeaketh, loue muſt kéepe ſilence, ſpecially where ſhée
contendes agaynſt him: as for example, howe can all our

<pb facs="tcp:22781:21"/>
this proximitie of bloud and parentage which we haue one
of another, ſo long as we reſt vpon earth: it may bée you
will ſay, that for ſome fault or offence, they will ſometime
bereaue vs of the right which ſeemes to belong to vs by the
meane of parentage: but they cannot cut of conſanguinitie
by which we are knit togither from our natiuitie: Bicauſe
nature onely, and not the lawes hath layd that foundation,
and perfected the worke: euenſo in a maryage contracted
onely vnder a pretence of dowrie, you muſt not thinke that
the lawe who admittes ſuch tolleration, hath any power at
all to wreſt the courſe of our true nature: not that I would
faſhion a <hi>Chaos</hi> in common wealthes according to mens
ymaginations: obedience and ſocietie are due to huſbands
by ciuill bande: but the ſinguler affection to oure pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
friendes, is within the compaſſe of a naturall dutie,
wherein I beléeue that the lawes (albeit they haue made no
publike determination) are notwithſtanding couertly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with ſuch reciprocall friendſhips: and if in times
paſt (as alſo at this day) onely in reſpect of a naturall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
inducible to pitie, haue excuſed the execution of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
vpon any act of oppreſſion, yea though it ſtretched ſo
farre as murder, which of it ſelfe is puniſhable by all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and pollicie: what ought we to eſtéeme of loue, who
(being no other then a ſelfe nature) caryeth oftentymes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
our willes, our affections, with conſtraint to loue
diuerſly: neither doe I thinke that the paine and ſtatute for
adulterers (the onely remedie for maryages) was rayſed
agaynſt ſuch, as in a violent affection doe vow their hartes
to one myſtreſſe: but rather to brydle theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thinke you ſhall finde iuſtified in the common wealth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
wherein for a tyme, it was ſuffered to the women,
not able to conceyue by hir huſbande, to rayſe generation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22781:21"/>
with an other whome ſhe loued, with this prouiſion, that
the fruite ſpringing of hir ſhoulde be eſteemed the act of hir
huſband, by which (in my opinion) the common wealth was
neuer the more diſordered, but rather gouerned with more
quiet and concorde of mynde and maners, bicauſe that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying
their ciuill ordinaunces, they contented withall,
thoſe which nature onely (without other meane) taught
them. And yet coulde I be better contented, (the better to
incercept all ſuch occaſions) if, cutting of altogither our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of dowries, we entred this yoke of maryage vnder
a ſimple pretence and motion of affection only: for touching
where they may be mainteyned &amp; made neceſſarie in reſpect
of a pollitike eſtate, I doe not onely diſalowe it, but alſo of
the contrary, I thinke they are the firſt &amp; originall ground
of the greateſt part of diſquietes that thunder vpon maried
men. And for your eſtate pollitike, I praye you of what
dependes this humaine felowſhip, which we haue named
mutuall entertainment, if not of a reciprocall friendſhippe
which we ought to beare one to another, the ſame being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
by this wicked inuention of dowries. For if I chaunce
to ſettle in affection with a mayde of baſe condition, and by
a tollerable ſuggeſtion of nature, procéede with hir in holye
maryage, ſhall I not runne into a populer obloquie, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming
in me an act and example of wilfull folly? yea my
friends will conteſt agaynſt me: my companions concurre
in common imputation: and my parents eſchew me and
my choyſe with vnnaturall grudge, as to haue myngled
my diſcent with a matche of inferiour eſtate (ſuch is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

that in this I haue found my Paradiſe, and by the other I
ſhould haue runne hedlong into hell, for as well the one as
the other, are comprehended vnder the name of maryage:
But if in a gréedie deſire of golde and tranſitorie droſſe, I
practiſe a Ladie of equall place and value to my ſelfe, then
that blind ignoraunce commendes and congratulates with

though by my portion of .xv. or .xx. thouſand frankes, I were
able to gouerne the earth: where others, of déeper inſight
into the cares of mariage, ſtand aloofe and lament with me,
that byting (with the fiſhe) at a golden bayte, I ſhoulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
ſwallowe vp the hooke of continuall torment and
bondage: oh tyme, oh maners to much corrupted, wherein
money muſt vſurpe the name of mariage, and the coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which I ſtill maintaine to mooue originally and wholye by

cutte of all the paynes and traueyles which we ſée at thys

woulde prooue farre more conuenient, than your commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
(ſir) which you haue alledged in the adminiſtration of
a familie: you doe nothing in preparing the way to mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
if you doe not aſſociate them vnder a mutuall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
neyther ſhall any citie or ſtate be happie, vntill (with
the example of our aunceſtors) we eſtabliſhe our mariages
vnder one hart, as by which meane and not otherwayes, we
ſhall baniſhe not onely all the errors of ſuch coniunctions,
but alſo euen purge the whole common wealth, who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

neuer enioy hir felicitie, ſo long as (in place of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
ſhe findes ſecret ſimulation betwéene man and wyfe:
which if it be ſo, and that by this maryage copulation your

pollecie and whole common welth be brought to the bayte,
(ſeeing that in the beginning the worlde being deuided but
into the vnitie of two perſons, it multiplyed by little and
little into villages and walled townes:) ſure if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch boundes be corrupted, the whole buylding muſt
neceſſarily fall to ruyne: wherein to giue you my fancie in
plaine ſpeach, I cannot otherwayes thinke, then that from
this corruption of maryages (whiche ſuccéede in no other
meaning than for money, ſéeing in all other reſpectes there
is no reſemblaunce betwéene the partyes) doth come the

good and faythfull example to others, not to marrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to goodes, but to men according to the conſent of loue

whome, as there was none that pretended intereſt

where he mainteyned ſo ſharpely, that loue paſſed all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces

the delicatie of his complexion, whome in this I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

two extremities ſo thorowly debated betwéene you. For as
farre as I can gather of your contention (as one matter
drawes on another) from loue ſimplie, (as you terme it) you
are diſcended to maryage. In loue (ſeigneur <hi>Monophylo</hi>)
you maintaine a coniunction of one to one, without enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

And in loue alſo, you (<hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi>) defende the

ſéeing adulteries are forbidden, not onelye in theſe

to fall into our thoughtes, to beare loue to hir, whome the

ſuche vehement affections ought not to fall in mariage,

nor pollycie, nor aſſiſtaunce of any time, ſhall you be able

<pb facs="tcp:22781:25"/>
thoſe defaultes which you note, and much leſſe ſhall you
be able to let, that many of frée and diſpoſed myndes (I ſay
not voluble and light) by continuance of tyme, doe not
faſten their loue on another, aſwell as they fixed it on you
in the beginning: By which meane and reaſon, I coulde
haue better alowed, if to warrant mariages, and entertaine
them in this loyall friendſhip, you woulde haue faſhioned
their beginning, not by this loue, which you ſpeake of, as
being to light, but by good &amp; graue aduiſe, &amp; counſell taken
at large, the better to knowe how to liue &amp; loue, afore they
enter into that indiſſoluble conuerſation: For euen as a
good man of warre preparing himſelfe to an enterpriſe
where he pretendes to make proufe of his proweſſe and
value, afore he buie horſes, he runnes them, traynes them,
and makes manye tryalles of them, refuſing the vnlyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and making choyſe of ſuch as he lykes, at what pryce
ſo euer he buyeth them: euen ſo in this ſhort race of lyfe
which we meane to performe with our wyues in comfort,
ſolace, and pleaſure, we muſt not ſo much ſtande vppon
contemplation of a wauering loue, which poſſiblye crept
into vs in a dreame or at vnwares, as with déepe aduiſe
and conſideration, waigh the maners and conditions of the
Ladie with whome we pretende that waye, conſideringe
withall hir parentage, and maner of bringing vp from hir
youth, by which order of choyſe, we ſhall eaſily finde meane
to make hir entertaine the thing which ſhe ought to holde
in moſt deare eſtimation, which is hir honor, the ſame being
the glorie of hir huſbande, as in his honor is conteyned the
eſtymation of his wife: The man of warre examynes his
horſe with great conſideration, albeit he may depart with
him at his pleaſure: But we are negligent to cyfte and
ſearch our wyues with preciſe iudgement, with whome we
are tyed to an eternall ſocietie and abode vnto death: wée
reade the mariages in time paſt, diſſolued vpon verie ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
occaſions, ſome renounced their wyues, bicauſe they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22781:25"/>
went amongſt companie without their vailes or barefaced:
ſome for that they ſatte at gaſe without the knowledge of
their huſbandes, and ſome bycauſe they went to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Bathes: Which kinde of people, as they had good
meanes to reléeue themſelues of the paines in mariage, ſo
they ought not to ſtande in example with vs, who drawing
at this day in another courſe, as reſtrayned of that lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
both by Gods and mans lawe, are bounde to another
conſideration in the highe interpriſe of maryage, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
is eyther to reuert to our full felicitie, or elſe
reſolue to our extréeme torment and miſhappe: I haue
heard often an olde perſwaſion of the people, that, who hath
a pretence of mariage, ought to enter therein wyth hys
eyes cloſed: But for my parte, if I had eyther ſo manye
ſightes as olde <hi>Argus,</hi> or were able to beare no fewer eyes
than the ſkye hath ſtarres, I ſhoulde holde them all inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to direct me in my choyſe, as being a matter of moſt
high iudgement and déepe in ſight: neyther can I alowe in
this behalfe, the conſideration of the Romaines, who gaue
lybertie to their daughters at twelue yeares, and leaue to
their ſonnes at fortene to marrie: reſpecting more the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie
of the body, than capacitie of the minde, as eſtéeming
thoſe ages moſt fitte for copulation to multiplye the world.
At thoſe yeares they ſuffered man and woman to alyenate
their bodie, and yet in all other contractes, they forbad aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enacion
of lands and benefit vntill twentie and fiue yeres:
They ſayde maryages ſhoulde onely knitte by a frée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the minde: and yet they tollerated contractes in a
ſlender knowledge and diſtinction of good and euill: yea,
they almoſt ſuffered mariage, when there was no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of pleaſure: For a childe (ſpecially in ſuch age) is
like a tender ſlippe or plant, who plyes alwayes with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
winde, lyking all encounters, as his firſt motions leade
him, to whome manye things at the firſt are delyghtfull,
which tyme tranſlates to a frowarde diſdayne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
Better could I agrée with the inſtitucion of <hi>Plato,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22781:26"/>
who in his common welth did not admitte man to mariage
but in rype yeares, which with hym were thirtie fiue, and
the woman, in reſpect of hir forwardneſſe, excéedinge the
man in readineſſe and rypeneſſe, at eyghtene, and nintene,
which rule if you account eyther to ſtraight in the perſons,
or ſeuere in example, chuſe your tyme in the man when
you thinke him in his moſt maturitye, as of beſt knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to conſider his commoditie: This is the cauſe whye
our lawyers haue wiſely foreſéene, that no mariage ſhould

               </gap>entes, who inclyning to
our profite more faythfullye then our ſelues, ſtande as a
reléefe to oure wanton weakeneſſe, as not ſufferyng
vs to practyſe a Wyfe, whome they eſtéeme not for
our honour and benefite: For albeit (as you perſwade
<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>) maryages be made vnder a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
of loue, which is no other thing than an inwarde
paſſion of torment, and that for the beginning they flatter
vs with ſhadowes of ioy and pleaſure: yet when our deſire
ſhall be ſatiſfyed, and our diſordered will cloyed, we retyre
forthwith into continuall penance (the only running plague
and canker of the minde) which will prooue ſuch a coreſey to
the beſt partes in vs, that our expectation of pleaſure being
baniſhed as a fayre forme in a flattering looking glaſſe, wée
ſhall liue plunged in a Laborinth of infelicityes, which (to
our worthie confuſion) of our ſelues, we brought to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
In your fancie, you faſhion a wife, of the molde and
mettall of pleaſure, with perſwaſion to finde in hir all the
felicityes of the worlde. But beware of the ſtorme that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedes
the flickering calme, and (with the wiſe Arthitecture)
when you prepare a plot to buyld vpon, be ſure to ſée in your
mind the toppe of your pallayce, afore you pitch your foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
For if your wyfe be wanton, if ſhe be vnchaſte, if
diſobedient, if ſharpe in wordes, and ſubtill in abuſe, if eaſie
to deceiue, and doubtfull to truſt, if rude in bringing vp, and
rough in behauiour, if froward at home, and fooliſh abrode,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22781:26"/>
if vaine in lyfe, and voyde of will to be ordered, if laſtly ſhe
haue no other conformitie with your conditions, then to hir
owne liking, wil not theſe griefes come in counterchaunge
of your frayle pleaſure, yea alas they are poyſons of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and galles whoſe bitterneſſe can neuer be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye:
if you once ſée hir diſpoſed to deuide the pleaſure
which you chalenge peculiar to your ſelfe, ſhal you not then
to late finde your ſelfe deceyued in your vaine thought: to
whom for rewarde, is reſerued a gnawing repentaunce, as
due to your light and raſh choyce: yea oftentymes a ſweete
kiſſe receiued of a delicate Ladie, breathes ſuch a poyſon, as
there is no arte to purge it. And in a little glaunce of hir
eye is harbored ſuch power (with the nature of the <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>)
to pearce you, that blaſted with that inchauntment,
you ſéeke to die afore your tyme. And then, if the ſooner to
enforce and effect your lothſome deſire, you aduaunce mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with that pleaſant enchauntreſſe, thinke you not on
your haſtie execution, there attendes a wearie and lingring
repentance? and that your choyſe of folly for that one day,
ſhall not be redéemed with a price of cares ſo long as you
liue after: It is an experience in nature and reaſon, that all
thinges take diſſolution, from whence they had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
as our naturall beings originally framed out of
earth, reſolue eftſoones to the ſame ſubſtaunce: goodes euill
gotten, ſuccéede not well, and friendſhips kindled in ſuch a
light heate, doe ſoone diſſolue to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as matters of no long
continuance, where ſuch as reſt vpon the immoueable pillor
of vertue, are neuer ſubiect to ruine, ſo long as the bodie is
ſubiect to life: which in déede ought to be the ſtate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of loue in a good and loyall maryage, the rather to
induce both the one and other to a conſtant felicitie. And
as that loue which you preſcribe <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> by
his heate and vehemencie in the beginning, hath no long
aboade, ſo that whiche I diſcouer in maryage begunne
by the plot and meanes I haue layde, doth hoyſe more and
<pb facs="tcp:22781:27"/>
more hir ſayles, and euen in the laſt day (when one of vs
muſt yéelde tribute to nature) is of no leſſe force, than the
firſt night wherein he offered his ſacrifice to loue vnder the
guide of the mayſter of ceremonies <hi>Hymeneus:</hi> yea, and
for a further diſproofe of your opinion, I ſay, that for a man
to fall in maryage into the handes of hir whom he had long
purſued in loue, is the thing which aboue all other he ought
moſt to feare: for where afore he profeſſed the ſtate of hir
ſeruaunt and ſlaue, with a prompt readineſſe to runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hir commaundements, his condicion being now chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by reaſon of maryage, he altereth alſo his authoritie,
chalenging an empyre and ſouereigntie ouer hir, whervnto
ſhe is hardly brought conſidering hir experience in hir for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
preheminence. And ſo where afore there was a <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathia</hi>
and concordaunce of friendſhip, both the one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are now tranſlated into lothſome ſpirites, ſtryuing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them to maintaine and poſſeſſe their right. The man
being now careleſſe of his former pretence, for the which he
had in ſo many ſortes diſguiſed himſelfe, ſéekes to be huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
both namely and actually: as alſo the wife on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide
lothe to leaue hir late ſoueraigntie, ſtriues ſtill
to kéepe him within the ſtate of his former ſeruitude: which
difference of mayſterſhip, where it concurres togither, there
can be no concord, and where wantes conformitie of willes,
there can be no perfite friendſhip: Beſides, as we further
conſider herein, we ſhall finde more inconueniences ryſe,
as where the wyfe (afore hir maryage) becommes obedient
to the will of the man, what a Bées neſt doth ſhée bréede in
the heade of hir huſbande, who when tyme hath mortyfied
his vnbrideled heate, will not ſticke to bring in memorie the
pleaſures he coolled of hir without other merite than a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
and light will, wherein iealouſie playing hir part,
will not ſticke to leade him in a ſuſpicious minde, to make
his wife as prodigall to all men, as ſhe hath bene liberall to
him: as for example in generall, it is prooued in common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22781:27"/>
that things which ſometime ſéeme good to vs, by
a better aduiſe and conſideration become of ſlender regard,
the ſame happening by our blinde paſſions which make vs
vnable to diſcerne the good from the euill: to a fooliſhman
ouer ruled with a burning deſire, nothing ſéemes impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but to the wiſe man, all things are harde, till by long
and graue aduiſe he hath made them eaſie: Euen ſo loue
hath victorie ouer all things, and making his ſubiects able to
high enterpriſes, he qualifies all impoſſibilities to aduaunce
their pretence, but his great heate being reſolued to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
colde, they ſtande to complaine their former follie,
and can not cure their preſent euill. And notwithſtanding
their ſundrie importunities, which (with the Camelion) they
can diſguiſe in all ſortes ſauing true meaning, yet they are
no ſooner put in poſſeſſion of their deſire, than as well the
thing it ſelfe, as their affection to it, conuerts into an other
qualitie, as beginning then to know the ſmall value of the
cauſe of his late torment, and of leſſe merite in his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
albeit of ſpeciall reſpect touching hir, for that on it
is grounded the dutie of hir honour: wherein alſo as theſe
things lye hid from him, till by a charme of prayers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubtiltyes apt to entice the ſimplicitie of women, he
hath brought hir within his power, as the Hawke ſtowpes
to the Lewer at the voyce of hir kéeper: So, when mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
reueales an vnderſtanding of them, it is then he giues
iudgement agaynſt hir tractable obedience, as ſo ſoone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
hirſelfe to his mercie, without other bonde or merit,
than a ſimple perſwaſion on his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>de, with this minde that
by the ſame meane ſhe may as eaſily proſtitute hirſelfe to
others, as ſhe was willing to encline to him: which wyll
prooue ſuch an indifferent torment to them both, that the
felicitie which they expected in maryage, will turne to a
curſſe of that holy inſtitution. In which reſpect, it can not
but be better to eſtabliſhe your mariage vnder a wiſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the maners and conditions of your wyfe (which
<pb facs="tcp:22781:28"/>
is a contentment continuall and incorrupt) then vnder a
ſhort and paſſible pleaſure, whoſe end concludes with farre
greater griefe and bitterneſſe, than the beginning brought
ioy or delight. And grounding your mariage in this ſort, it
will bring forth ſuch a vertue in the man, as vſing chaſtly

ende to communicate with the honeſt pleaſures therein, but
(in mine opinion) with the moſt yrkeſome encombers that
the witte of man can deuiſe: was there euer man, to whom
at the firſt (notwithſtanding he had a more luſt to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22781:28"/>
wealth, than lyking to the woman) nature hath not giuen a
facilitie to flatter with no leſſe ſhow of friendly behauiour,
then if he ment perfite friendſhip in déede: for nature hath
giuen to men a face to ſerue as a viſor the better to diſguiſe
their thoughts: albeit it is good pollecie to vſe an Antidot to
pourge a poyſon. But if euen wiſe men can ſooner foreſée,
than eaſily eſchew the malice of their euill diſpoſed enimies.</p>
            <p>By greater reaſon, how can a yong mayde diſcerne him
that loues hir, amid ſo many diſſimulations in the worlde.
But admit, he that pretendes hir in maryage, loue hir vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faynedly,
is it méete for all that that loue fall into the minde
of ſo weake and tender a creature: Nature created woman
with hir eyes downewarde, and to man ſhe hath giuen a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of vpright looking, aduiſing vs by that, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould not be bolde to rayſe the liddes of hir eyes, but
holde them alwayes in a modeſt behauiour inclyned to the
earth, to the ende ſhe ſhould not haue the facultie to iudge
of the countenaunce of men. And if ſhe be capable to know
what loue is, by the ſame capacitie alſo many other mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may enter into hir, wherewith it néedes not that ſhee
perticipate: For, if I might faſhion a Mayde entering into
mariage, I would frame hir either ſimple not to know good
from euill, or at leaſt ſo tractable, as to encline altogither to
the fancies of hir huſbande, and not to learne or ſtudie any
thing which ſhould not tende to the common quyet of them
both: and béeing ſuch one in hir ſelfe, and rightlye mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by hir parentes: oh happie, and twiſe happie mariage:
oh lyfe agréeable to God, and plawſible to the worlde: oh
bleſſed couple of louers, enioying a temporall felycitie
which will lead you to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlaſting paradiſe: this huſband
ſhall inſtruct his wyfe without grudge, and ſhe applye to
his will wythout compulſion: he ſhall commaunde and
finde no reſiſtaunce, and ſhe obey him with all reuerence,
if ſhe intreate, he aloweth hir reaſons, and wyll not denye
hir requeſt, if any thing offende him, ſhe eyther ſubmyts,
<pb facs="tcp:22781:29"/>
or vſeth modeſtie to perſwade: and ſo lyuing both in one
nature, and conformytie of maners, as this huſbande wyll
not ſearch the lyfe of his wyfe inciuillye, ſo hir ſimple inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
ſtandes alwayes to defende hir from thoſe inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
in maryage, which all men feare, and moſt men
finde, vſing rather an vnſtayned loyaltie wyth an honeſt
loue vnfayned in them both, then ſuch a diſordered will as
you haue diſcribed: For if in any other reſpect, a man enter
this holy eſtate, let him not grieue, if by ſucceſſion of tyme,
his wyfe chuſe. A ſecret friende againſt whome I wyll not
erect ſuch harde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as you (<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi> deſire,) wherewith I fall
eftſoones vpon the matter of loyaltie by you preferred: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
afore I enter into the fielde of that argument, bycauſe
I wyll not couple ſo prophane a thing as loue, wyth the
holy profeſſion of mariage, it may pleaſe you (Madam) to
vſe pacience to heare, and modeſtie in concealing your
iudgement. But heare <hi>Monophylo</hi> not content with the
matter, and leſſe lyking the maner of the man, as one with
whome loue ſtoode in more deare value, then all the other
felicities in the worlde: you haue <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro</hi> (ſaith

wyth ſpeach no leſſe impertynent to the matter, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
eſtranged from the generall purpoſe of the company,
bycauſe in my aduyſe to hym that woulde marrye, I dyd
not pretende in my plot of ſingularitie, to bring in queſtion
that poynt, vnleſſe by the waye, and (as it were) at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
neyther vnder hope to ſtande long vpon it, nor to
helpe my opinion the rather: albeit, ſéeing you ſéeme to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in it, your chalenge ſhall not offende me: and yf you
had well waighed the nature of my reaſons, I thinke you
would haue gyuen them a higher merite, then thoſe which
by your ſelfe are reuealed, the ſame contayning no leſſe
diſtinction in themſelues, then there is common difference
betwéene lyfe and death, ſéeing your mariage is grounded
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22781:29"/>
vpon a voluntarie or rather artyficiall conſideration, and
myne marcheth vnder an inclynation of nature, which we
cannot reſtraine: wherein by how much leſſe facilytie the
bondes of nature are to be vnknit, then thoſe which we ſée
Arte doth couple and conioyne, euen by ſo much more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
do I aſſure and grounde my mariage aboue yours.
And I praye you <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> (to auoyde wearie
ſpeche) how many diuorſes, iarres, and houſholde ſtrifes,
doe you ſée happen daylye betwéene the honeſt and chaſte
wyfe, and hir huſbande: yea, I knowe at this daye, a
wyſe and diſcréete Lady (if there be any) equally ſprinckled
with the fauors of nature, and lyberally endued wyth the
vertues and qualyties of the minde, whoſe race of youth
hath runne vnder an honeſt and obedient name with hir
huſbande, and poſſeſſed betwéene them a number of fayre
children, yet ſuch is his inequalitie and difference of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with hir, that notwithſtanding the continuance of
their loue many yeares, with ende honeſt and chaſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
requiſit in the office and part of a wife, he cannot be
induced to honour hir with the affection of a huſbande:
wherein, béeing cyfted in the cauſe of this diſagréement,
when he can not prooue proſtitution or other ſuch cryminall
error in maryage, he alledgeth onely that as he neuer lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hir with his heart, ſo, yet if another man had the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
intereſt of maryage in hir, he coulde then drawe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thyther, is not this man ſo much the more worthie
of rebuke, as eyther his wordes be hatefull, or his example
hurtfull to a common wealth, but aboue all his offence is
the greater, for that vertue (with the nature of the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant)
drawes to hir euen people vnknowne: But for my
woman, being ſuch one as I haue figured, I will loue hir
chaſtitie and vertue, and not hir proper perſon, onelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my minde cannot applie therevnto. I will honor and
eſtéeme in my wife that wiſdome which God hath breathed
into hir, and not ſuch as of it ſelfe will offende me: often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes,
<pb facs="tcp:22781:30"/>
happening into argument of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maryage, amongeſt
ſundrie men and women; I heare not ſeldome as well the
one as the other ſort to marueyle of the pleaſant and ſweete
agréement of ſome maryed men with their wyues: for (ſay
they) if ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman, had chaunced to my
lotte, we ſhould haue agréed euen as fire and water. So
that what other cauſe knittes this equalitie and concorde
betwéene them two, who, being deuided coulde hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
with others: but a loue, a conformitie, yea a kindly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
betwéene them, which could not holde concorde wyth
others. For if you require a preciſe perfection of maners
in your wyfe, wherewith perhappes your ſelfe is not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
neuer looke to agrée with hir in conuerſation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
other then as the Lion with the Lambe, whereof
the one is of humble and méeke condition, and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued

all hir honeſt traueile yéeldes but a deſperate fruite, bicauſe
you ſtande eſtraunged from hir in heart: our nature neuer
chaungeth in vs, and (with the opinion of the Philoſophers)

behauiour to hir huſbande, as their conuerſation
ſhal be no leſſe frée from reproch, than their whole life farre
from example of diſobedience. In which eſtate, were it not
better to liue in ſuch ſort and pleaſure, (albeit the one be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in his opinion) then dwelling in the condition you
haue preſcribed, to be alwayes plunged in paine and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This loue doth ſo dazell and leade our ſpirites in a
iudgement of affection and fauour, that we value all things
in the beſt, and eſtéeme nothing inconuenient on the behalfe
of them whome we loue: where this wiſedome which you
wiſhe: ſtandes vpon ſuch delicate and preciſe reſpectes, as
ſhe holds nothing acceptable, yea though in your wife were
euen the very vertues of <hi>Iudith,</hi> or the rare conſtancie of
<hi>Penelope:</hi> wherewith the Ladie noting their vehemencie,
me thinkes (ſayth ſhe) you leade the companie wrongfully
in a cauſe of doubt, albeit the nature of the matter requires
it. But to leaue you mutually contented, my iudgement is
that you dwell ſtill in your ſinguler opinions, ſéeing in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is a cleare reſemblance of a truth, like as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience and practiſe of things, that which is proper
in one place, we find oftentymes moſt inconuenient in an
other behalfe, and that by the varietie of maners &amp; order of
ſuch as handle them. And therfore ſéeing there is a diuerſity
of fancie betwene you, let euery one féed on his priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
without ſéeking to diſenherite his companion. But for
your part (<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>) if you ſhould be driuen to
abandon and exchaunge your lot (I meane your Ladie and
Myſtreſſe) to marye the rycheſt woman in the worlde, I
thinke it woulde diſgeſt with you as an vnſauerie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yll in a

if you were to chuſe a wyfe onely for wealth, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
for loue, ſo that (as I ſayde) my ſentence runnes
ſtill to reſtrayne you of ſpeach, and leaue you onely a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and contentment in thought recommending vnto you
<pb facs="tcp:22781:31"/>
(<hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro</hi>) a newe memorie of your olde promiſe
to procéede in the matter of loue, whereof you haue giuen
vs as it were a pleaſaunt taſte, and ſéemes nowe to faint in
the chalenge, when you haue kindled our deſires leading
our appetites in imagination, as though you would warme
vs by a painted fyre: only I pray you be not wearie in well
doing nor harde to encline to honeſt requeſtes, ſéeing there
is no leſſe vertue in the one, then the other conducible to
merite of them by whome you are required: your requeſt
(Madame) ſayth he, is no leſſe iuſt in it ſelfe, then meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
on your owne behalfe, and your reaſons ſo neceſſarie,
as if I ſhoulde denie them, I ſhould be holden eyther igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
or obſtinate, and ſo leaue you vnſatiſfied in my dutie,
and fulfill in my ſelfe an example of imperfection touching
the partes requiſite in a Gentleman. And yet Madame,
your requeſt ſéemed a fléeing authoritie, ſéeing it preuented
me in matter, but not in meaning: yea, if I had not a
grounded knowledge of you, I ſhould iudge you with thoſe
delicate creditors, who, if their day be not kept, doe ſalute
vs ſodenly with their Sergeants or officers of areaſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
you ſhall be ſatiſfied as apperteyneth, vpon
this charge and couenaunt that you receyue my money in
payment as it is, ſéeing I will giue you no other then ſuch
as I cull out of mine owne coffers. And ſo as farre as I
remember the degrées of our beginning, <hi>ſeigneur Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo,</hi>
allowes loue mutually of one to one, and of the
contrarie <hi>Phylopolo</hi> would loue in many places: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Madam, if I giue my fancie eyther ſimplie, or as I haue
partly learned of you, I craue onely to be defended in my
right as well as they two. To make ſuch baſe marchandiſe
of his bodye, as to bequeath it to the firſt (according to the
deſire of <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi>) me thinkes is neyther good
nor ſéemely, &amp; euen ſo I can leſſe condiſcend to hold ſo hard
a hande of the bridle, with ymagination of ſuch an Idoll of
conſtancie, as you (<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>) require: onely I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22781:31"/>
could better alowe a meane, as the Lawyers vſe in cauſes
of contention: I will not denie that the principall poynt in
loue, and the marke whereat euery one ought to ſhoote, is
not loyaltie towardes our myſtreſſe, yet conſidering this
great frayltie which nature hath grafted in vs, as to be all
in all and pertaker more with mortalitie, than diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes,
ſéeing our mindes be wrapped in the vaile of thys
fleſhly droſſe, if purſuing our neceſſarie occaſions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
we chaunce into a long abſence from our My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
&amp; applying the fauor of the tyme to our deſires, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to rowe in another ſtreame, I cannot make that light
ſcape a déepe offence, nor ſuch exchaunge of pleaſure only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation
of mind, &amp; therfore no other fault then eyther may
be pardoned or excuſed: ſéeing that dwelling ſtill in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
minde and will towardes hir, albeit I ſupplie a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſuggeſtion and actuall appetite which nature ſtyrres
in me, yet with that diſordered will, I doe not tranſlate my
heart to other then to the Ladie and Myſtreſſe of my firſt
thoughtes, to whome I beare a conſtant reuerence as well
abſent as preſent, wherein as the Sunne kéepes alwayes
his cleareneſſe, although ſomtimes he enter into a clowde,
euen ſo may it be of him who ſometimes viſites a ſtraunge
Myſtreſſe, to whome he yéeldes no other affection then to
ſerue his preſent turne. To be ſhort, ſéeing friendſhippe
reſtes in the heart, and not in theſe ſmall intemperances of
nature, me thinkes loue cannot be violated by a neceſſitie
forced of an inſtinct which mooues and kindles by nature.
And yet will I not eſtabliſh any libertie (vnder the ſhadow
of ſuch neceſſitie) to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But being here to diſpute not according to popular fancie,

of loue did he ſhow in this experience: yea ſuch a force and

reaſon. And albeit this Gentleman, is not in ſome reſpect,
without his merite of prayſe, yet will I not phyle him vpon

without touche or inclination of diſhonour, ſhall not
or cannot a true louer (by the only memorie of the pleaſure
he encountreth in dreaming or thinking of his Ladie, in

an other although occaſion and oportunitie conſent: what
numbers coulde I recken (if numbers were neceſſarie to

to whome their alleageance to their Ladyes were ſo

although I coulde make example of ſome of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce

in all the actuall pleaſure in the worlde: which laſt wordes
he coulde not bring forth without ſome teares, (albeit hée
wiſely diſſembled his paſſion) the ſame aſſuring the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that in himſelfe was ment the example and partie of

bare to ſuch loues, diſſembling withall not to haue
vnderſtand his wordes, vrged an incredulitie to his tale, as
holding all his diſcourſe for fables, not of our time (ſayth he
ſomewhat ſmyling) but rather of that firſt age called the
golden ſeaſon, when men (if we may beléeue <hi>Heſiodus</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in infancie the ſpace of an hundreth yeares: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as ſuch men as you deſcribe vnto vs, might retaine lyfe
two hundreth yeares, and liuing in ſuch maner, might
dwell in eſtimation both of beaſtes and children, who for
want of knowledge in any thing, and inhabilitie of theyr
age, ſtoode néede to be fedde: euen ſo alſo we may well loue
ſuch men in compariſon with <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who in the middeſt
of water, and oppreſſed with a vehement deſire to drinke,
ſuffered himſelfe to die of thyrſt: which fables albeit they
allure fayth with ſome, yet they can perſwade no credite at
all to me. Neyther doe I meane to traueile with you to
ſuch purpoſe (ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) yet if by your ſelfe and
not by me, you were well and duly inſtructed in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ſeruitude which in loue we beare to our miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
for feare to offende them, it may be, though you were
not fully of my opinion, yet you would not altogither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

we can preferre, which (aſwell to you as to all others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

you, what ſlaunders, how many iarres, what ſortes of yrk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
inconueniences in loue may ſpring, if, as you holde,
vnder pretence of (I knowe not what) diſordered appetite
<pb facs="tcp:22781:34"/>
ſhadowed with your long abſence, you ſéeke to defrawde
your miſtreſſe of that which is onely due to hir, and you
duly bounde to reſcrue for hir: would you not the vnitie
of our hearts to take other ground then of a ſimple and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſence, as though abſence could holde no loue, and men
vnſéene become negligent in affection, ah how farre is that
from the office of a loyall minde, howe lamentable to bée
heard of, howe daungerous in vſe, yea an hereſie moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
in a comunion or ſocietie of faythfull friendes:
for my part, by theſe handes and teares which are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of my zeale I proteſt and prooue the contrarie, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is ſuch a torment in our mindes, that the more wée
ſtande bereaued of the pleaſant philoſophie, flowing from
the ſwéete breath and ſpeache of our Ladies, the more doe
we honour their vertues in contemplation, and the ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
we gouerne the actuall motions of their quicke and
ſparckling eyes, the more doe we trauaile in deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
them, ſo that it cannot be that we decline in good will,
ſéeing (with the nature of fire long kept downe with ſtraw)
abſence reuiueth our affection, enforceth our deſire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth
our hope, which truly vſed, is neuer without hys
true merite: Herein I haue the helpe of Philoſophie, in
which this is one principle, that more doe we deſire thoſe
thinges which we leaſt commaund, then ſuch ouer whome
we haue a frée gouernement, the ſame perhaps being the
cauſe why many eſtéeme the Italians moſt conſtaunt in
their loue (and yet in my iudgement not without their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
that way) bicauſe that poſſeſſing onely the fauour
and vſe of the eye, without other benefite of ſpeach or ſecret
familiaritie, they alwayes continue in loue, and increaſe in
deſire: which is alſo the very nature and operation of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
not for all this, that I mainteine preſence to procure
any default or diminiſhing of loue, ſeeing the onely preſence
of your Ladies, ſty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

paſſed, is nothing in reſpect of the pleaſure which hir onely
ſocietie brings, and the ſame (as an indifferent vertue) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
it ſelfe into a mutuall felicitie to you both, faſhions
ſuch a fift heauen in you, that you leaue hir not without a
vehement deſire eftſoones to ſée hir, as a ſtomacke whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
encreaſeth by a reſtraint of meate: This is it which
<hi>Amadys de Gawle</hi> hath figured vnto vs in his .viij. Booke,
when <hi>Nyquea</hi> preſenting before hir eyes in a looking glaſſe
hir <hi>Amadys de Grece,</hi> was ſo rapt into preſent conceytes
of ioy, that the onely viſion in the Glaſſe defaced all other
pleaſures with hir, but the forme being taken awaye, the
effect alſo did vaniſhe as a ſhadowe on a wall which is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by the reflection of the Sunne, and all hir former
ioyes turned into a mountaine of ſmoke by the onely loſſe
of that diſſembled cauſe: The like alſo happening to <hi>Anaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarax,</hi>
when he could enioy no more the preſence of his <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea:</hi>
Did <hi>Penelope</hi> I pray you, for all the importunities
of ſo many Princes, corrupt the duetie of hir wiuehoode to
hir huſband for his long abſence of .xx. yeares: and ſhe was
not induced to this conſtancie by any feare of hir huſband,
bicauſe in ſuch a diſtaunce of place and tyme, ſhée might
conceale hir fault: no, the extremitie of honeſt and carefull
loue to hir huſband kept hir in that vertuous courſe in hys
abſence: And euen as good olde <hi>Seneca</hi> is woont to ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he knewe is offence woulde be concealed not onely
from the worlde, but euen from God himſelfe, yet (ſayth
he) would I not ſinne, for the onely hate I beare to ſinne:
euen ſo, the true louer (notwithſtanding your voluble fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie)
although he knowe his offence ſhall not come to the
knowledge of his Ladie (a thing of verie harde aſſurance)
yet ought he to eſchew the inconuenience you ſpake of, in
a reuerent regarde to the perfect loue he beares to his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.
So that as their preſence procures to vs a pleaſure
and moſt perfite contentment, ſo abſence leades vs in an
inſatiable deſire towardes them: the ſame being a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:22781:35"/>
meane to call vs backe from all other temptations: yea
this onely deſire and conſtant remembraunce of them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all the delites we can ymagin euen in all the other

that by it we forget all other paſſions and fancies, &amp;
are made as halfe Gods in ſuch ſort, that in reſpect of our
great fragilitie, we are not able to drawe our ſelues from
theſe intemperaunces whereof you ſpeake (although God

and preſent afore our eyes, we ſhall not ſwarue or decline
one iote. And nowe touching the latter part of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that loue conſiſtes not but in the hart, &amp; not in theſe
inclinations of nature, wherewith neceſſarily we are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
your opinion is not altogither without the ſocietie of
reaſon, wherein (as I thinke) you might alleage that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothegma</hi>
ſometimes attributed to <hi>Aelyus Verus</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Rome, who, to couer his wanton and licentious
factes, ſayde it was not lawfull by the honeſtie of mariage,
to execute his paſſions vpon his owne wife, and therefore
(to preſerue the honour of wedlocke) he allowed himſelfe a
conuerſation with other publike women: euen ſo might
you allude as not to contamynate this precious cloake of
true loue, a lawe or libertie to doe as much on the behalfe
of them on whom you had not fixed your heart: Albeit you
make a further reſtraint of your ſelfe, as not deſiring the
execution in ſuch thinges, but onely when by a naturall
violence, you are forced to doe it. But I pray you tell me
<hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> if you had maryed a wyfe not for any
ſetled affection towardes hir, but onely in a gréedie regarde
to the greatneſſe of hir wealth (as we haue ſayde before that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22781:35"/>
maryages tooke their beginning) and ſhe gloſing with you
in affection, and profeſſe a preſentiall obedience to you, and
ſecretly proſtitutes hir ſelfe to another, would not hir dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
be of hard diſgeſtion with you: yea albeit, you maye
aunſwere that it belonges to euery wife dutifully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
hirſelfe altogither to the pleaſure of hir huſbande,
and not to ſéeke to delite the reſidue of the world, yet, would
not hir abuſe ſéeme intollerable with you: wherein then if
you tooke your wife vnder pretence of gaine, without anye
conſideration of loue, what would you ſay if ſhe, whom the
heauens ſéeme to haue reſerued for you, imparted hir bodie
with another: Oh lamentable deſtinie, oh griefe without
compariſon, oh dealing might you ſay, whoſe bare remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
bringes with it a horrible ymagination of death:
for my part, albeit I make no carefull inquirie in ſuche
things, yet, in nature and reaſon, I holde it the greateſt
wounde that can happen to the heart of man: ſo that you
muſt not thinke <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> that reciprocation is
not founde in your Ladie, who feeles no ſmall ſmart of
minde as often as you releeue ſtraungers with the almes
which ſhe accomptes proper to hir ſelfe: where as be it that
ſhe be ignoraunt, yet ought you not to pretende worſe to
hir, then you would ſhe ſhould performe agaynſt you, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is peremptorie in Gods iudgement to rewarde
finne with his merite, and returne to euery one the ſame
meaſure wherewith they haue ſerued others. And this is
one poynt (ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) which might giue place to the
queſtion, wherein perhappes I will one day offer you the
chalenge, as finding it ſtraunge that you will make march
vnder one Methode the man and the wyfe: albeit, for the
preſent I will reſerue it to another ſeaſon, onely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my ſelfe now agaynſt <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> who for
the better authoritie of his opinion, ſéekes to make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande,

<pb facs="tcp:22781:36"/>
which he ſayth are nouriſhed in our mindes: ſure <hi>ſeigneur

conſtruction touching the force and vertue of loue, ſeeing,
ther was neuer louer, who loued not to this end which you
ſo far eſtraung &amp; baniſh from the park of loue: what other

how many examples haue we reade in antiquitie, amongſt
whome we finde no one louer, who at length hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of his myſtreſſe that poynt which we call the fruite
of loue, the ſame (in mine opinion) being the motion and
onely purpoſe of this extréeme loue: nay rather it is euen
loue it ſelfe, which is none other thing then a deſire to vſe
and poſſeſſe. Great ſurely and gracious is the effect of the
eye, hande and heares, but not of ſuch force, as that in them
we may finde a full reliefe to the torments we endure: but
rather with <hi>Mars</hi> when he poſſeſſed frankely his <hi>Venus,</hi>
let vs directly ſéeke out the marke wherevnto loue leades
vs. And albeit from the eyes and lookes doe flowe no ſmall
contentment, yet they are but dymme ſtarres in reſpect of
the other light, wherein I holde him altogither inſenſua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who vnder anye other conſideration pretendes to profeſſe

vnderſtanding my reaſons woulde haue condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

And albeit I haue nowe to reſt in quiet with him for the

ſomewhat vnthankefully the benefite you haue
preſented to me) you and I ſhall not ſo eaſily accorde, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22781:36"/>
(in my iudgement) as you ſéeme ſiniſterly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende
all the nature of loue, ſo I will not reſiſt that the
louer ought not to thurſt for the thing which you holde in
ſuch eſtimation. But that to loue onely for that reſpect, is
eyther true loue, or friendſhip of continuance, I maintaine
agaynſt you and all chalengers, hoping you will take it
as from him whoſe nature cannot be diſguiſed from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a true louer: we ſee by experience many men who,
pretending onely that marke and ende in loue, after they
haue brought their pretence to a matter of effect (as men
whoſe natures chaunge in a moment, they become no leſſe
colde in deſire, than earſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him onely vnder a contentment to frayle, he being in
himſelf ſo diuine and wonderfull, and the pray after which
they hunt, ſo paſſable, and of no abode: indéede this I will
confeſſe that nature, to multiplie this huge and rounde bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
which you ſée, doth kindle in vs by a ſecrete wiſedome
certaine motions or ſtinges, which with good right, ſome
haue called brutall as béeing common to vs with other
creatures, and not onely with them, but euen with trées
and things not ſenſible, which ſéeme to bloome and become
fruitfull for the encreaſe of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

if it had not bene neceſſarie alſo in vs, this huge

This is the cauſe, why, intercepting our willes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our affections by theſe diſordered appetytes which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie

and they likewiſe to vs: the ſame happening in ordinarie
example, ſéeing there was neuer perſonage of ſuch defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
(if I may charge him vpon his fayth and conſcience)
who naturally receyues not (ſpecially in a conformetie of
things) more contentment in the companie of women, then
<pb facs="tcp:22781:37"/>
in the felowſhip of men: For our nature doth euen reioyce
in them, as ſéeing hirſelfe (by an honeſt and lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of one to another) immortaliſed: So that by this
meane is founde an affection verie vehement which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
wée beare to all women. But not this perticuler
friendſhip of one to one whereof you ſpeake, which in my
iudgement conſiſtes as a more vyolent cauſe then that
which you alleage: wherein I will lay my ſelfe vpon the
relation of certaine noble minded men, who albeit doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
their Ladyes with a ſetled affection, pretending with
all pollecie to conquere the extréeme marke and felicitie in
loue, yet I haue noted them to reſt beſt ſatiſfied with the
onely vſe of the ſight, preſence, and ſpeach of theyr Ladyes,
and that bicauſe they feared, that being poſſeſſed of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible
paradiſe, their loue would conuert into ſome chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
then much leſſe that they eſtéemed it to be the onely cauſe
of their affection: yea it is a common perſwaſion among
the populer ſort, that hauing woonne that point vpon a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
loue (which the ſonne when he is at the higheſt)
beginnes to decline, and then better is it to hunt the chaſe,
then obtayne the pray: ſo that (according to the purpoſe of
their reaſons) the ſelfe ſame ſubiect, which (as they iudge)
is the very ſpring and original of loue, is alſo the whole and
onely reuerſor of the ſame: ſéeing their building being pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vpon a frayle foundation, the worke and matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues
in it ſelfe, the ſame happening oftentimes to ſuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
louers, who reſt no leſſe deceyued in their enterpriſe,
than their thought was vayne: But nowe <hi>ſeigneur Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyro,</hi>
let me aſke you this rouing queſtion, if two louers,
not ſetting their minde vpon this contentment which you
meane, and yet one of them betray his affection, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
prodigall of his bodie elſewhere, doe you thinke this
abuſe is not a tyring griefe to his myſtreſſe, if by chaunce
ſhe come to the knowledge of it: This I ſay, becauſe that
you, eſtabliſhing your loue in the heart, eſtéemes theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

intemperaunces as you call them not to touche or
hurt in any ſort ſuch as doe loue: wherein (for my part)
ſuche is my opinion (and in it is ſome conformitie with
yours) that loue kéepes his true and only abode in the hart,
not ſtyrring by ſuche intemperaunces, but by a certaine
greater cauſe, as ymmediately I meane to prooue, and yet
neyther one of our ſayde two louers can impart wyth a
ſtraunger without our extreeme diſpleaſure: bicauſe that
as the lyfe of two louers dependes mutually one vpon an

likewiſe repoſing onely in him, ſo they could not but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
both in equall griefe, if others beſides themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
woulde preſſe to giue pleaſure, not onely ſuch as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
kindles in vs, but generally, to their Ladies, as their
Lordes: And yet they ſpare it in themſelues, as in a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
regarde delyting farre rather to féede themſelues
with a ſweete and ſugred deſire which by this appetite they
haue, then with a cloyed fulneſſe gathering the pleaſaunt
fruit one of another: yea we are ſo déepely vowed in them,
and they aſſured in vs, that if it happen in a dreame, their
ymaginations haue deceyued them, as thinking to haue
communicated with vs (ſuch is our pleaſure to thinke that
felicitie mooued in them by our occaſion and meanes) wée
tryumphe in no leſſe inwarde ioy and gladneſſe of minde,
then if we had béene preſent to performe and execute our
willes: For (to vſe a iudgement in ſimple truth) the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
doth not ſo much mooue vs in our ſelues, as the deſire
we haue to be the cauſe of that wherewith our Miſtreſſes
may participate, ſeeing as we are borne for them and not
for our ſelues, ſo we liue in them and not in our ſelues, and
die in them, to be eftſoones reuiued in them: lyke as alſo
the benefite which we promiſe our ſelues to receyue of
them, although in it ſelfe, it conteyne ſinguler greatneſſe
and merite, yet is it not ſo highly perfite, as that which we
hope to procure to them: and ſo doubt not at all (ſir) that
<pb facs="tcp:22781:38"/>
there is any one in loue who is not extréemely gréeued,
when his pretended friend or ſeconde himſelfe, findes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
with any other whatſoeuer: not that theyr loue
(as I ſayde and ſtill maintaine) be grounded vpon ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce:
In déede we deſire and thurſt after that poynt, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nature vpon great cauſe &amp; conſideration hath taught
vs ſo to do: But as we deſire it by nature, ſo loue by a more
violent reaſon teacheth vs a modeſt gouernement, what is
more to be ſayde: Although there were no hope to enter
that common hauen, and that my myſtreſſe had made mée
altogither deſperate in accuſtomed expectation, yet I ſtand
in the ſame dutie and regarde of ſetled loue that was rooted
in me before, albeit vnder this ſinguler perſwaſion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce
in my ſelfe, that there was no default of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but rather ſome greater reaſon tending to entertaine
our loue which induced hir to denie me: wherein alſo if
other occaſion ſhould leade hir, as to be more affected to an
other than to me, or holding me leſſe deare, than eyther I
haue hoped or ſhe profeſſed, yet my loue ſhould not diminiſh
otherwayes then by a Metamorpheſis or tragi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhe wiſhed, more in contemplation and regard of hir,
than of my ſelfe, who if my loue did not aſpire but to that
poynt, I woulde neuer reſt till I had aduaunced the iſſue
and conquered that happie effect: and yet in thruſting for
it, I deſire it not, as in deſiring it, I doe not long for it, but
as a voluble affection, I make it farre inferior to other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes
I repoſe in hir: You may aſke me here what is this
true loue, whoſe pleaſaunt torment ſo throwes the worlde
into paſſions: wherevnto the Philoſophers ſhall aunſwere
for me, who in a déepe inſight, thinking to attaine to the
vnderſtanding of nature, ymagined loue to be a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22781:38"/>
forme or plot, excéeding generally the conſideration of
man, and therefore did figure vnto vs an <hi>Androgina,</hi> by
whome they ment a man compoſed of the Maſculine and
Femenine ſexe, and he ſtanding in his ſtate of perfection,
ſwelled in ſuch mortall pryde agaynſt the Gods, that by
that meanes he was afterwardes deuided into two.</p>
            <p>But it is moſt manifeſt, that this vnitie of the two
halfes, is not ment by a coniunction of the bodyes, but by
the communion of the myndes: bicauſe this ſuperficiall
forme of bodie which we ſée in our ſelues, is not the man of
whome we ſpeake, but an organe of the man which we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in our ſelues, like as we note euen from the beginning
of the worlde, that God hath formed vs to his owne lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as alwayes inuiſible and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ided from all corporall

If <hi>Plato</hi> were the firſt that preferred this opinion
of <hi>Androgina,</hi> as I am not reſolute that he ment the onely
coniunction of myndes, ſo I dare fully aſſure my ſelfe that
he figured ſuch a myracle, to repreſent vnto vs ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
matter in loue: wherein it may be diſputed of it in
ſuch ſort, as one, by whoſe ſearch and traueyle in Egypt,
he had commoned with the prieſtes of the lawe in the hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of <hi>Moyſes</hi> touching his <hi>Geneſis:</hi> But what néede wée
acknowledge this <hi>Androgina</hi> in the Gréekes and forraine
Philoſophers, who onely (as it were) by certaine chinkes

of it, was eyther ignorauntly or by ſtealth which they
haue diſguiſed ſince, as not to be ſeene to borrow any thing
of other ſtraunge nations which they call barbarous. The
true and onely <hi>Androgina</hi> is that which was preſented
vnto vs, not by a hyſtorie or ryding tale, but by a maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

onely to himſelfe, framed of one bodie, and one ſpirite, two
<pb facs="tcp:22781:39"/>
bodyes and two myndes, which prooues this amitie to bée
more deuine and heauenly than the common ſort can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume:
Albeit if you will that I declare more at large (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
already in ſhort reuealed this excellent myracle vnder
the which is comprehended the Image of true loue) what
libertie God hath left vs ſince, to loue one another, and the
cauſe why we traueyle in affection: Aſſure your ſelfe <hi>ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
Phylopolo,</hi> to note no leſſe confuſion in me, then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him, who vndertaking to diſpute vpon the nature
of God, referred it alwayes from one day to another, as a
thing incomprehenſible to our myndes: Oh God what
thing is loue: may I ſay it proceedes of a ſimilitude maners:
or that he takes his beginning of a conſtellation or influence
of the ſelfe aſcendantes vnder the which we are borne: No,
no, for then, in both the one and other maner it muſt néedes
follow by infallible conſequence, that no man louing ſhould
be deceyued in his loue, but be encountred with reciprocall
action, I meane, euery one that loued, ſhould be alſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
And to eſtabliſh loue vpon a ſelfe education and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
nouriture, woulde ſéeme no leſſe farre from reaſon,
then frée from all conformitie to truth, ſéeing mutuall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture,
kindles a cuſtume and certaine ſparkes of priuate
familiaritie: but neyther one bodie, nor one ſpirite, ſure,
<hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> the more I aſpire into conſideration
of this great diuinitie which we ſpeake of, the more am I
rapt into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion, with ſuch ghaſtly amaſe, that me thinks
it were better for me to iudge that loue is not, then rayſing
my thoughtes aboue the reach of nature, to ſéeke to flie into
his dwelling, to diſcouer the force wherewith nature hath
armed him euen from the beginning of the worlde: And
euen as who pretendes to comprehende the ſubſtaunce and
maieſtie of this vniuerſall maker and creator of vs all, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth
in himſelfe his moſt infinite myracles, as thys
rounde and firme plot of the earth, and the voluble courſe
of the ſkies aboue, &amp; ſo diſcending from one woonder to an
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22781:39"/>
other, fyndes at laſt, by the greatneſſe of theſe effectes that
the great GOD is not to be diſcerned by the facultie of
mortall iudgement, but that he contaynes an eſſence exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mans conſideration: euen ſo, to whome ſo euer it
laye in deſire to vnderſtande at large what loue is, it is
needefull he enter into a perticuler contemplation of all
his woonderfull effectes, and ſo, reſolue and ende that it is
a thing, whoſe knowledge can not enter into the ſpirite of
man: So that ſéeing loue takes his being, neyther of a
heauenly influence, nor conformitie of conditions, nor laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
of a cuſtome or mutuall conuerſation, what other
thing ſhall I tearme him to be, than a mocion ſturring I
know not how, which is farre more eaſie to be felt in our
hartes, then vttered by ſpéech: yea it ſo knittes and vnites
our mindes, that being the cauſe of a perpetuall death,
yet it reuiues vs in an other, making vs forget our proper
condicion, to remember our ſelues eftſoones in an other, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
our ſelues, and drawes vs beſides by a deuine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
with ſuch a ſtrong and indiſſoluble bonde (returning
to the firſt <hi>Androgina</hi> of our father Adam) that he diſtils
two ſpirites into one bodye, &amp; by the ſame miracle brings
to paſſe that two ſpirits be made one minde in two bodies,
(is not this I praye you) a moſt ſoueraigne and extréeme
miracle, wherein to the ende to draw you to a better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of my ſaying and not to thinke it a fable, is it
not (as it were) to haue one ſpirite in two bodies, when
a man and woman differ not in deſire of thinges but appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
in conformitie of willes and affections, the one doth not
deſire but that which the other doth wiſh, and yet being one
minde in two bodies, they become in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende by a ſinguler
metamorpheſis &amp; exchaunge two ſpirites in one body, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my miſtreſſe ſtanding in full poſſeſſion of my hart, &amp;
I likewiſe ruling ouer hir affections, I can not but eſteme
my ſelfe to poſſeſſe both mine owne and hirs, and ſhe lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to gouern them both, ſéeing that like as if I be named
<pb facs="tcp:22781:40"/>
Lorde ouer hirs and hir, I may rightfully meane my ſelfe
the onely poſſeſſor of both our heartes, ſo, albeit we ſéeme
both depriued of two mindes and two hartes, yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and poſſeſſe both the one and other in our ſelues:
And therefore who can ſaye that the knowledge of loue is
hable to happen into our mindes: or that wée haue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
to diſcerne the true ſubſtaunce and matter of loue.
This is the cauſe why the auncient fathers and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
amongſt the <hi>demons</hi> which they eſtabliſhed (the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ſearchers out as they thought of our thoughtes and
actions) called loue <hi>Demon,</hi> as to aduiſe vs thereby that
it is a thing enforced by a natural inſtinct, &amp; (as it were) by
an impreſſion which we kéepe of our auncient ymage,
without other conſideration, a thing to be diſcerned by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
example: ſéeing that euen as, when we encounter
vpon a ſodaine any of our olde friends, whoſe long abſence
leades vs in a want of knowledge of him, we wauer in
iudgement, and yet being aſſured in the ende that it is the
ſame of whome we doubted in the beginning, we embrace
him with plawſible ſignes of ſo happie a méeting: euen ſo
reſeruing ſome knowledge of that auncient cuſtom, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſéemes the heauens (if we may vſe the phraſe of the
Philoſophers) did conſent to vs, as ſoone as our eye hath
taken holde of hir to whome our nature doth drawe vs, we
beginne as all amazed to enter into knowledge and (albeit
not wel aſſured otherwaies than in féeling ſome litle ſpark
of the auncient coniunction) fortifiyng our ſelues in our
ſelues by little and little (as being then aſſured to haue
founde againe the obiect whervnto the heauens haue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs) we delight, we congratulate and become familiar
with euery pleaſure end contentment: wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
I doe not holde, that after ſuch carectes engraued
within vs, and that the two louers be tyed togither in one
minde, by I know not what benefite, which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not (for ſo hath loue taught me to ſaye) we do not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22781:40"/>
deſire after a long vſe &amp; conuerſation togither, a coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the two bodyes one in another, the ſame being that
appetite which nature hath infuſed generallye into vs all
and that we finde it better in our Ladies, than in anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
woman whatſoeuer in reſpect of the great <hi>ſympathya</hi>
and bound of friendſhiſh which is betwéene hir and vs, the
ſame retayning ſuch a force in action of our loue, that if
after ſuch a valyaunt beginning, we chaunce to be called
to perticipate in the pleaſure, much leſſe (in mine opinion)
that our loue diminiſhe or fall into any default, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that it will take new force and alwaies encreaſe more
and more: Where if euen in the beginning we had not
trauelled but for that poynt, the conqueſt had béene loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and the continuaunce none, ſéeing when the deſire
had béene ſatiſfied, our delight woulde haue vaniſhed, as
the ſmoke diſſolues when the fire forbeares his action, and
euery effect mortefieth when the cauſe is taken awaye: ſo
that as I can not alowe that loue (if loue it may be called)
eyther conſtant or of continuaunce, whoſe onely purpoſe
is to poſſeſſe that poynt: ſo alſo he is weake in opinion,
whoſe feare makes him doubt that the greatneſſe of hys
loue will diminiſhe by this meane, and therefore dare not
intreat his miſtreſſe in that reſpect: Loue is then a power
lying betwéene the two worſe extremities, not ſetting his
originall vpon this common luſt, and yet, though long hée
doe reiect it, at laſt he doth admit it: the ſame being the
cauſe (as I beléeue) why all our church lawes in the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a true mariage (wherein ought to conſiſt the
marke and ende of true friendeſhip) require not but the
conſent of the parties: as though this true loue of mariage
ought not to paſſe but vnder a conformitie of mindes, and
not by any luſt or ſuggeſtion of the fleſhe: Thus ended
<hi>Monophylo,</hi> not without a ſinguler contentment to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea,</hi>
who to witneſſe how déepely ſhe fauoured his ſide,
wiſhed ſhée might warrant his opinion with ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:22781:41"/>
as ſhe woulde, the rather (ſayth ſhée) for that with the
propertie of Archars, who aduiſedlie direct and leuell their
arrowes to a little white, in reſpect of the white, which
of it ſelfe is a ſmall ſubſtaunce, but in a certaine ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of honour to come néereſt that little marke: euen ſo
albeit your louer aſpire miſtically to that laſt and deſired
ſacrifice in loue, yet it is not the principall purpoſe that
firſt induced him to loue: wherein ſuer as your reaſons
holde ſuche conformitie with truth, that if loue himſelfe
ſhould diſcende from his temple to diſpute herein, he could
not more liuely touch the very white of this buſineſſe, ſo I
beléeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in your mouth are preſently reuealed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oracles of
<hi>Cupido,</hi> whereof <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> according to my
prerogatiue, I inſtitute you from thinſtaunt, archebiſhop.
Euen now began <hi>Phoebus</hi> to chaunge complexion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting
his rayes of warme reflexcion into a darcke diſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricion,
inclined (as it prooued to releeue the earth with ſome
pleaſaunt dewe or ſwéete ſhower, which notwithſtanding)
had no power to offende in any ſort theſe fower valyaunt
champions of loue, who by his deuine prouidence had ſo
well pauiſhed them with trées and leaues intricatelie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced
togither, that neyther the ſunne had any hurtfull
power ouer them, and much leſſe the winde coulde vſe his
vyolence, by meane whereof, the Ladye, after a little
pawſe, fell eftſones vpon the matter of hir laſt ſpeach: If
(ſayth ſhe) <hi>Cupido</hi> be drawne to fauour you in reſpect of
your argument, I ſtande in doubt whether the ſunne hath
reaſon to reſt contented, as ſéeking to quenche the fire
which you begunne to kindle in vs touching the deuinitie
of loue: which perhappes he doth for malice, as ſéeing this
little mightie God doth blowe vp more flame within our
hartes than he that is eſtéemed the generall ſtarre to giue
light to the whole worlde: vnder your correction Madam,
ſayth <hi>Glaphyro, Monophylo</hi> hath brought the ſunne eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
into memorie of his auncient loues, which I ſée hée
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22781:41"/>
can not remember, without theſe ſwéete teares which you
ſée hée lettes fall, to recorde the great vnthankefulneſſe
he receyued of his Ladie <hi>Daphne</hi> after ſo many infinite
merites: And ſo let him be excuſed (ſayth <hi>Charyclea</hi>) only
this condition I promiſe and make, what teares or ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſo euer he let fall, not to depart from this place till our
argument be further enlarged, and drawne to an other
yſſue: and alwayes will I allow your reaſons <hi>ſeigneur
Monophylo,</hi> wherein you haue not onely deuinely ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the deuinitie of loue, but alſo erected a notable method
and meane, not how the louer ought to behaue himſelfe,
but (without difficultie) how he may maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
his chalenge wherein I doubt not but theſe gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
will not onely approoue the matter, but ioyne with
me in voyce, to commende your iudgement. Onely <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo,</hi>
to whome theſe contemplacions were of careleſſe
regarde, as delighting rather in a libertie of minde, and
generall aſſemblyes where he might liberallie ſlent with
all women and put them in ſome waſpiſh humour, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
here to playe an other partie with the Ladye, and
conuert his weapons not againſt <hi>Monophylo,</hi> but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
to touche hir, I coulde with all my heart, Madam,
ſayth he, paſſe my conſent to the opinion of <hi>Monophylo,</hi>
as by that meanes to be acceptable to him for the matter,
and not hatefull to you that ſo allowes it, but ſéeing you
take pleaſures to ſounde me ſo déepely, I pray you let me
haue fréedome of ſpéeche with fauour, and rather equitie
in iudgement, then diſdaine to heare my ſhort opinion:
I haue liſtened, with no ſmall dilligence to his tedious
reaſons, whereof as I finde ſome good, other paſſable, and
the moſt part impertinent and lothſome ynough: ſo aboue
all I finde the chiefeſt marke wherevnto he ſéemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende,
was, to make vs approoue loyaltie of one man to
one woman: wherein, <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> albeit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie
hath hither vnto brydeled in me, that which deſire
<pb facs="tcp:22781:42"/>
offred to enforce, the rather when you fell vpon that poynt
wherein you haue giuen ſuch a gloaſe to fayth: yet ſéeing
you are ſetled in this voluntarie pawſe, I can doe no leſſe
(with the preſent oportunitie) than enter the fielde againſt
you, the matter of your retoricall aunſwere to <hi>ſeigneur
Glaphyro,</hi> whome you haue eſtabliſhed iudge in his cauſe
as to know, if his Ladie commit hereſie in loue againſt
him, whether he coulde quietly diſgeſt it or not: hoping by
ſuch pollecie drawing the worme from his noſe, to make
him confuſed in his ſaying: But ſéeing in a ciuill and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of high curteſie you ſeeke to beare the ſtate of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
generall to the communitie of Ladies, I hope my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
will not ſeeme intollerable, if vnder the like affection
of nature, I ſewe to be protector to maintaine in their
rightes, the condicion of men: wherein I doubt not with
ſuch reaſons in my ſelfe, and honeſt conformitie on your
ſide, to make you ſée and know, that albeit loyaltie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in the woman to the man, yet that men are not
loyable to ſuch lawes, although women (for many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
reſpectes) ſtande ſubiect to their awe. I thanke you
(ſayth <hi>Glaphyro</hi>) for that of your ſelfe, without anye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
or merite of mine, you vndertake the defence of my
cauſe, wherein (according to your liberall offer to ſtande
me in this pleaſure) me thinkes <hi>Monophylo</hi> maye well
aſſure himſelfe, that albeit, in the charge you meane to
lay vpon him, he haue the better of you, yet ſhall he with
much difficultie mainetaine his proofe, that loue conſiſts
not but in a thing, which he cannot vnfolde, ſéeing ſuche
formes as are not to be reuealed doe ſeldome happen in
loue: Here, I gouerning (as I haue ſayde) their excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
and therefore concealed my ſelfe, as rather to vſe
mine eares than my tongue, ſéeing them paſſe ouer ſo
lightly the laſt ſpeaches of <hi>Monophylo,</hi> and deſirous to
ſupply their default, concluded at laſt to breake my firſt
purpoſe of ſilence: and therewith rooſing my ſelfe in my

amazed aboue the reaſt with my ſodaine approche,

you are not touched in example, and ſo, if you can not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
partialitie in iudgement, at leaſt let modeſtie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
your ſpéech, leaſt either you innouate your purpoſe
or deſerue to haue the law of ſilence layde vpon you: for
we haue alreadie paſſed ſentence on <hi>Monophylos</hi> ſide as
alſo <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> hath alowed his reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to whom belongs
a déeper intereſt in the matterthan to you: wherevppon
<hi>Phylopolo</hi> (after the company had ſomewhat ſaluted my
ſodaine comming) proteſted in his owne behalfe, that it
ſhould not be long of him, that I vndertooke not for hys
ſake, his defence: And if (ſaith hée) I haue necligently paſt
ouer any diſcourſe of <hi>Monophylo,</hi> it was not for that I
did conſent with him, but onelye vpon a new occaſion, that
I myght charge him with innouacion of matter: therfore
it may like you (good Madam) not to alledge my ſelfe in
preiudice of mine owne condicion, and muche leſſe that
necligence make me to loaſe my caſe, if there be iuſt cauſe
of fauour: I aunſwered to be as frée from ſuch meaning,
as farre from the fact proteſting rather to liue in ſilence all
the reſt of my lyfe with the contentment of Madam <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea,</hi>
then to hazarde hir diſpleaſure by anye libertie of
ſpeach, by which ſute ſhe was content to graunt me audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
albeit vpon this charge, that there ſhoulde be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectacion
of reply, if perhaps any matter ſuccede to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduauntage
of <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi> whoſe argumentes
ſéemed more acceptable to hir (although they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and voyde of reaſon,) then all my proofes, figured
in the ſubiect I pretended, what ſence and methode ſo euer
they conteyned: whoſe lawe albeit I allowed, as eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
hir worde, aperemptorie warraunt, yet <hi>Phylopolo</hi>
(after ſome waſpiſh and reciprocall iarres) denied hir to
haue any ſuche ſoueraignetie ouer that little felowſhippe,
and gaue me an inckling to beginne, as in whome hée ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to repoſe his protection: No rather the defence of
loue himſelfe (ſayde I) and that againſt him, who, vnder
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22781:43"/>
a pretence to protect him, thought by a certaine art to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue
him, when in déede he hath altogither mortified him
wherein notwithſtanding I halfe excuſe him, as impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the cauſe with loue, who albeit will make himſelfe
familyar with vs, chooſing his ſeate in the verye intralles
of our hearts, yet he will in no wiſe that we knowe hym,
but couering more and more his nature, he leaues vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
a iudgement according to our perticuler affections for
loue being as a Camelion chaunging diuers coulours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ſundrie obiectes, euery one hath his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
opinion according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> varietie of paſſions that are in
him: and yet in this diuerſitie, I neuer knewe louer, who
eyther more or leſſe aſpired not to this laſt poynt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
vſe, according to the ſuggeſtion of the paſſion which
he endured: For euen as in all thinges wée pretende to a
certaine ende, ſo loue muſt neceſſarilie containe a laſt
effect wherein our mindes reſt ſatiſfied: All men trauell
to eate, and ſupplie the neceſſities of nature, the Captaine
to winne honour, incurres perill of death, and the penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
fouldiour runnes to the warres to haue part of the
ſpoyle: yea there is no ſort of operation how light ſo euer
it bée (vnleſſe it procéede from a mad man) wherein is not
a hope of gaine and ſpeciall pretence of a reſolute ende,
the which as it procéedes not but of a luſt that falles in vs,
ſo the more we are tormented in it the more doe we ſettle
our heart vpon it: So that it is neceſſarye there be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ende in loue, wherein albeit we féele our ſelues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
according to the varietie of our paſſions, it is néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
there be a generall cauſe by which, or for which wée
loue: But leaſt we be abuſed by the meane of equalitye
procéeding of the proximitie of cauſes; you ſhall here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> that all the Philoſophers
maintaine (as certainelye is true) that in all the thinges
of the worlde there be two principall cauſes, <hi>efficiens,</hi> and
<hi>finalis:</hi> that they name efficient or originall, wherof the
<pb facs="tcp:22781:44"/>
thing is, and by the other is ment the cauſe, why and in
whoſe fauour the thing is: which wordes albeit to ſome
delicate ſtomackes maye ſéeme to ſmell ſomewhat of the
ſchoole, yet they are not impertinent to the preſent queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as alſo neceſſarie to who ſoeuer ſéekes to vnderſtande the
knowledge of the truth: oh thriſe and thriſe happie is hée,
who vnderſtanding theſe cauſes, hath the facultie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the one from the other, the ſame being the want
(as I geſſe) which hytherto hath kept you in this fowle
errour, for to take away this impreſſion from the people
that this luſt and deſire of the fleſhe is not the cauſe why
we loue, you ſéeke to prooue it to be a thing accidentall,
(which notwithſtanding) procéedes aſſuredlie of the true
&amp; pure ſubſtance of loue: The efficient or originall cauſe
by the which we loue a Ladye, is in déede the ſelfe ſame
inſtinct which you ſay bréedes in vs as it were by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of heauen: but the ende and purpoſe why we loue
is, to poſſeſſe whollye, pleaſauntlye, and abſolutely, and
ſo euery one of vs doth loue, as one daye to poſſeſſe at our
pleaſure, and the cauſe, by which we are induced to deſire
this coniunction more with our miſtreſſe, than any other,
riſeth of I know not what, which you ſay is more eaſie to
féele, than able to be expreſſed, which we imprint in vs,
by a certaine opinion we conceaue of it, making thereby
a péecemeale or confuſion of reaſon with paſſion: This
is the cauſe wherefore our common and generall mother,
ſought to deuide vs from all other creatures, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcretion of that which pleaſeth them, but puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
by their firſt motion, tending to the conſeruation
of their kinde, ſéeke indifferent conuerſation with their
females, not knowing what it is to loue, bycauſe in them
doth want opinion, the chiefe cauſe that bréedes loue, ſome
notwithſtanding will not ſticke to maintaine that they
haue a certayne ymagination and ſparke, to whome, if
they haue prooued the condicion of beaſtes, I leaue the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22781:44"/>
matter to their beaſtlye iudgement, ſéeing it is not for the
reſpect of beaſtes I ſpeake, but for men which loue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Phylopolo</hi> diſſembling his thought, yet haue I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alwayes (ſayth he) that louers were beaſtes: I know
not (quod I) eyther what ſortes of louers you meane, or
with what formes of beaſtes you reſemble them, but well
may I vaunt for my ſelfe, by the honour and loue which
of long I haue borne, and yet with all reuerence do owe to
a ſinguler miſtreſſe of mine, of a ſimple ydyot, I am bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
better inſtructed, then if I hadde runne ouer all the
preceptes of the Courtyer. But not to wander in variety
of matter, as I holde with you (<hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>)
that loue kindles of this naturall inſtinct, ſo there reſtes
onelye in proofe betwéene you and me, and the ſame to be
handled by ſome ſufficient meanes, whether the onelye
ende of loue conſider the ſweete vſe, wherein if I might
ſtrengthen my ſelfe by the common opinion of the worlde
you ſhould not onely loaſe your chalenge, but reſigne at
one inſtaunt both the fielde and the fight: for (except your
ſelfe) what is he in the worlde that loues not chiefelye for
that ende, and yet (ſir) not to aſſure my ſelfe vpon ſo fraile
a iudgement, I praye you tell me, if the loue of a man to
a woman pretended not but to the minde, why ſhoulde we
féele the ſame to paſſion vs, ſometime with a whire winde
of ioye, and from thence to a ſtorme of ſorrowe, and then
ſodainelye become as ouerwhelmed with quaileneſſe of
feare. And in the friendeſhip of man to man, we are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with no ſuch torment, ſauing that in this laſt wée
holde our ſelues ſatiſfied to be beloued of them, and the
ſame béeing knowne vnto vs, we haue alreadie touched
the poynt of our pretence: but in the laſt, beſides the mind
we accompany our deſires with a hope which leades vs in
a promiſe to bring vs one day to the porte of pleaſaunt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
Beſides I pray you tell me, if this loue were gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely by a bonde and coniunction of mindes, ought wée
<pb facs="tcp:22781:45"/>
not, by naturall iudgement, rather loue him whome God
hath faſhioned in euerie degrée like to our ſelues, then to
folowe the woman whome it ſéemes he created one degrée
inferiour to our ſelues: But we prooue the contrarie in
common example and experience, ſeing (without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
wée rather doate of the woman, than loue the man:
yea we ſée (by this feminine loue) that the lawe of true
friendeſhip, which was betwene man and man, hath béene
violated and corrupted, wherein I coulde commende vnto
you the tragedye of <hi>Gyſippus and Tytus,</hi> which <hi>Tytus,</hi>
notwiſtanding the auncient and ſetled friendſhip betwéene
him and his companion, which was ſuch, as their ſéemed
to remaine betwéene them a common will in all things, yet
ſuch was the violent furie of loue towardes the future
ſpowſe of his friende, that it diſſolued that ſtrong and long
league betwéene them, and notwithſtanding the order and
helpe of his companion, he prepared his owne deſtruction:
the ſame moouing, for that he proued in his minde two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of contrarie qualitie: albeit the one more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
than the other, which was loue, whoſe ſharpe
ſtinges ſo prickt him forwarde, that albeit he woulde haue
refrayned in fauor of the friendſhippe to his déere <hi>Gyſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
yet he hadde no power to applye other remedye,
than by his death, wherevnto he prepared him ſelfe: A like
example doe I finde in Iuſtine, of the ſonne of a King, who
defyling all lawes of men &amp; nature, was ſo enchaunted in
loue to a ſtepmother of his, that notwithſtanding his office
of obedience to his father, yet coulde he neuer be purged of
that euill, but eyther by the accompliſhment of his deſire,
or that death had applyed a playſter to his raging ſore:
what ſet abroche theſe veſſelles of frenſie in theſe two men
(for ſo maye I call them, as by whome was violated all
right of friendſhip and nature) but that in the friendſhippe
of man to man is comprehended but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie of minds
and this loue contaynes a <hi>ſympathia,</hi> communicating
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:22781:45"/>
both with the minde and the bodie, I meane (as touching
the bodie) this fleſhly copulation, the onely ende and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of our loue: for euen as in all other thinges being
come to the ende we aſpire to, we reſolue into a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and abſolute quiet, euen ſo by this onelye meane,
theſe two afore named attained to the execucion of their
paſſioned deſires, and not onely they but all others arriuing
in that deſired port of pleaſaunt vſe: wherein, in place and
proofe of our former perplexities in theſe extreame deſires,
being in this hauen, the ſtormes of our violent paſſions, do
eyther abſolutely diſſolue, or partelye qualefie, and loue
takes in vs a newe forme and habite as our nature is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
abyding ſtill notwithſtanding in his eſſence of loue:
this is the cauſe why the Ethnicks haue figured the ſame
<hi>Androgina</hi> by you alleaged, as when the two parts &amp; moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſeperated, ſéeke to reioyne themſelues, as an auncient
poet of that time helde that the ſowles were therevpon coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
togither, to whoſe opinion you coulde willinglye haue
condiſcended (were it not you feared to entangle your ſelfe)
when you confeſſed to vs, that the <hi>Androgina,</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to vnite and knitte the two moyties being deuided: and
if you will diſcende to that which God from the beginning
of the worlde propoundes vnto vs (whereof you haue
thought to make your profite albeit vpon credite) is it not
prouided in the ſame, that we ſhould be rather two mindes
in one bodie and one fleſhe, then one ſpirite within two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
I will not denie, that to forme <hi>thandrogina,</hi> both the
one and other are requiſite, but the ſame is to proue vnto
you, that if you deſire one minde onlie in two bodies, you
ſéeke to mak this our <hi>Androgina</hi> defectiue and imperfit:
And wherevpon the yſſue of your diſcourſe (to giue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace to your opinion you ſéeme to alleage the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of your lawes, as in that they require the onelye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to eſtabliſh mariage: I ſay that conſent procéeding of
this coniunction of mindes not common, bréedes and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
<pb facs="tcp:22781:46"/>
this loue, but the communion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies conſomates
and makes it perfite: for ſo did our lawes vnderſtand, who
in euery reſpect maintained the true ende of mariage to bee
the multiplying of the worlde: and yet I ſtande in ſome
doubt in what ſence they conſtrued this conſent you ſpeake
of: ſéeing we haue in example that it hath béene ſuffred to
men and women to enter mariage euen in the age of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreſſion,
wherein they ſéemed not ſo preciſe in knowledge,
ſo that onelye there were habilitie of cohabitation: and
therefore it ſéemed the lawes vnderſtoode by this conſent,
a mutuall foreknowledge to this coniuction of the bodies:
the ſame being proued in many lamentable treatyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
where if one part be founde colde or imperfect, the
bale diſſolues at the will of the other, which in other reſpect
had not béene ſuffred neyther by the decrées of our holye
Popes, nor our good Ciuilian lawyers to whome I referre
this argument: onely let ſuffice you that mariages are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the conſent you ſpeake of, but faſtned by the actuall
copulation of the body: and where you ſeeme to eſteeme loue
a thing farre to heauenlye to take his grounde in a matter
which in your opinion pertakes ſo déepely with an earthlye
or baſe ſubſtaunce: ſée in what errour you fall, and euill doe
you acknowledge the great felicitie which is in loue, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
onelye to ſo happie a ende by the which is procured an
immortalitie in our mortall bodies by the propagation of
our ſelues into our likes: in which poynt nature reſembles
the wiſe and diſcréete mother, who forſeing the benifite, that
in time to come will prooue neceſſarie for hir childe (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his ſlender age makes him ignoraunt) by giftes, preſents
ſwéete and pleaſaunt ſpéeche, with other allurements apt to
entiſe his youth, ſhe pampreth and draweth him on (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that he thinkes of it) to direct and tende to the purpoſe
which in hir ſelfe ſhée hath layde and ymagined, vntill by a
long aſſiſtaunce of time and ripe confirmation of age, this
childe is faſhioned fitte for the purpoſe of his mother to both
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22781:46"/>
their great contentmentes: euen ſo Nature our wiſe and
foreſeeing mother, pretending in hir ſelfe the increaſe of the
worlde, doth ſowe in vs from our beginning, certaine little
ſéedes of loue, which we ſuffer eaſilie to ſucceede in vs, till
they congeale to a ripe and perfite fruite, which is not that
pleaſure which we holde in communitie with other creaturs
but rather as I haue ſayde, <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi> to make
vs immortall in our mortalitie: and as ſhe doth hyde and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this ſecret with the vaile of the firſt pleaſure offred in
this mutuall communion, ſo aſpiring further, we knowe at
laſt by a more great and iteratiue pleaſure that this ende
tended to a higher ende, which was to haue children: in whom
(as hauing fulfilled our laſt purpoſe) naturally we delight
with more pleaſure, than in all the other thinges of the earth:
which ende is an end interminable, and ſubiect to no ende, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nature is neuer wearie of hauing children: And ſo do
renewe within vs continually the luſtes of pleaſure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
(by the ſame meane) deſire, which then doth not ſuggeſt
with ſuch paſſion, bicauſe that after this pleaſant coniunction
we ſtande aſſured of ſpéedie remedy, which we durſt not ſo
much as promiſe afore, wherein as before, we flote betwéene
hope and feare, ſo now we liue in aſſuraunce to commaunde
that ende, wherevnto all our thoughtes tended: ſo that loue
remaines alwayes, albeit he put on diuers qualities, bicauſe
that if at the firſt he might be called deſire, garniſhed with
hope, now he may be named deſire accompanied with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
I ſaye then that loue (I meane that loue which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
men) is a paſſion conceyued of an opinion procéeding
of a certaine inſtinct which is printed within vs tending to
the corporall coniunction one of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that let loue bée
an inſtinct according to your perſwaſion <hi>ſeigneur Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo,</hi>
but yet let him not be without a deſire to be reioyned,
and likewyſe lette your deſire marche alwayes with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
ſo ſhall we perhappes ſatiſfie certaine men, who (by
reaſon of this luſt that encountreth here) maintaine, that loue
<pb facs="tcp:22781:47"/>
ought not to be inueſted with that name till the acte of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
vſe be performed: wherein for my part, albeit I make
no great profeſſion of tearmes, (being vnderſtanded of you)
yet methinks ſuch men are not without their ſeuerall errors:
for albeit we are not as yet entred into this poynt of corporal
vſe, yet there is an other thing which in our ſelues we enioye,
by which wée merite the name of louer to our Ladies, and
that is a naturall and inwarde impreſſion and opinion of
their vertues, which as we couer ſecretly in our mindes; ſo
for them, we loue them aboue all other women? And to ſpeake
ſimply, of this inſtinct loue doth principally depende, bicauſe
he ſeldome aduaune<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th himſelfe without the ſocietie of this
naturall luſt which we haue to knitte togyther: where of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
we luſt for this operation of nature in manye wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
without reſpect of loue, but guided (as it were) by a
certaine brutalitie without any other conſideration than to
paſſe and purge our coller: But to returne to my matter,
that loue is a paſſion, I beléeue you doubt not of it as by
your owne diſcourſe you haue halfe confeſſed: And touching
this communion of the bodies although you are harde to bée
ſatiſfied, yet I thinke I haue ſayde aſmuch as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly
requiſite in the matter: But touching the inſtinct, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
it cannot well be diſcouered, yet I ymagin there is none
of vs which knowes not, that naturally we are inclined more
to ſome perſons, then to others, wherein as our naturall
iudgementes are diuerſe, ſo alſo doe we perticulerlie bequeth
our heartes, euery one as nature leades him: from whence
I may ſaye, doth ſpring the diuerſitie of opinions, ſo as to
ſome it ſeemes the truth lyeth drowned in the bottome of the
pitte, bycauſe euery one of vs hath a iudgement not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to truth, but as our inſtinct moues vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that albeit
I cannot diſcouer from whence this inſtinct proceedes (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of our owne nature, bycauſe we nouriſhe ſo

               </gap> reaſon doe teache mee, that it is the onelye
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22781:47"/>
keye that openeth the doore to loue: And if (as it may be)
many men fall into affection with one woman, it is bicauſe
they haue ſome reſemblaunce or affinitie wyth a common
influence. This diffinition I haue vſed for the time, of loue,
notwiſtanding, I am ſure there is an other kinde, which
ſéemes to holde of nature, and yet procéedes of the inſtinct we
ſpeake of, as we ſee it hapneth ordinarilye, that albeit of our
ſelues we are not enclined to ſundry perſonages, yet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
to our forethoughtes wée feele our ſelues induced to beare
them a certaine affection, bicauſe onely we ſée them diſpoſed
in good will to vs: wherein our vnthankefulneſſe woulde
iudge agaynſt vs, if we ſhoulde not be reciprocall in regards
of friendſhippe. This is a kinde of loue, but not of ſo liuelye
condicion as the other, ſéeing (to giue him his proper nature)
hée pertakes more with pittie, than with loue: for euen as
it is familiar to euery one to gréene in the diſpleaſure of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(yea, ſometimes to haue ſorrowe for our enimies when
wée ſee them afflicted) and that not in reſpect of any affection,
like to the friendeſhippe we owe to others to whome our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth inuite vs: euen ſo I cannot aſcribe to this laſt loue
I ſpeak of, other dignity than an ordinarie compaſſion, which
wée take of ſuche whome we ſée tormented in our fauour,
without any touche at all of that diuinitie which is rightlye in
the other, of whoſe perfection, albeit I haue not ſo largely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as the worthyneſſe of the matter requires, and that I
ſtande doubtfull with what mynde you diſgeſt my reaſons,
yet I holde my ſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſfied with that little wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it hath pleaſed you to heare mée: aduiſing you for ende,
that what ſo euer I haue preferred, containes matter of no
ſmall contemplation, vnleſſe to ſuch as hauing leſſe prooued it
then I, vnderſtande better his nature, ſéeing it is eaſie to bée
iudged that ſtanding (as I doe) in this ſtate of ſeruitude for
hir who is not vnknown to you (Madam) I can haue no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of iudgement to diſcerne neyther in this high matter, nor

I aunſwered, that I hadde no other ſchoole than amongſt
the multitude, to whoſe libertie of life (Madam, quod I)
is ioyned a higher capacitie in thoſe thinges, than to ſuche
who wandering in this darcke priſon, haue not the facultie

you ſhall haue neuer the more autoritie for all that (ſayth
ſhée) ſéeing euen in the beginning of your diſcourſe, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
ſentence againſt your ſelfe, as ſéeking to inſtruct vs,
that ſuch as delt in the argument of loue, had no other method
of ſpéeche, than according to their paſſions: But if they had
made no proofe of him, they ſhoulde be leſſe credible ſéeing
they ſpeake as Clarkes of armes: ſo that by your owne lawe
you cannot be beléeued of vs: Wherewith <hi>Monophylo,</hi> to
whome ſilence was a trouble, you maye in your owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Madame giue him aſſuraunce of no fayth nor credite,

him vnable to aunſwere me: by which occaſion, with
ſundrye ſhowes of indignitie towardes mée, he made manye
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22781:48"/>
offers of reuenge which the Lady, vnder a certaine prety waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe
anger, cutte of, willing him at laſt to ſuffice, that I
was but extraordinarie in that felowſhippe, and not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſed
amongſt them: and therefore <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi>
(ſayth ſhée) it is not vpon him you ought to ſtaye, ſéeing (in
a more reſpect to honour) you haue to remember the alaram,
which euen now theſe two other Gentlemen offred you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whome it lyeth you vpon to ſtande vpon your garde,
and not to féede the time with this newe warre, which being
without feare, requires no great pollecie: I woulde Madam
ſayth <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> who with <hi>Glaphyro</hi> had heard with ſilence
all our reaſons, you woulde remooue the vayle of your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and giue at laſt the honour where it is beſt deſerued:
well well ſir (ſayth ſhee) of all the reaſt you haue the leaſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in this chalenge, onely prepare you to performe your
enterpriſe which you vndertooke afore the comming of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier,</hi>
to the ende that <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro</hi> may alſo ſuccéede
in the matter of this attempt: This matche Madam, ſayth
<hi>Monophylo,</hi> me thinkes is vnequally made, ſéeing vnder
your offer to fauour my weakeneſſe, you pretende my whole
deſtruction, as ſparing me to enter the fielde againſt one
enimie, and ſtirres vp at one inſtaunt theſe two valyaunt
Capitaines to commit me to vtter ſpoyle: this feare (quod the
Lady) is without néede, ſeeing aſwell the goodneſſe of the cauſe
as the value of the partie, doth warraunt a contented ſucceſſe:
But now <hi>ſeigneur Phylopo,</hi> by whome is opened the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this quarrell, I praye you make vs iudges whether
you be as roughe in execution, as forward in enterpriſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(in my fancie) you haue ſome neceſſarye reaſon, as to haue
choſen a burthen whoſe waight (if you well forſee not) will
ouerthrowe you, ſéeing you maintaine (as a ſinguler paradox)
that loyaltie is not requiſite aſwell in a man as in a woman:
<hi>Phylopolo</hi> aunſwered that albeit he feared leaſt vnder his
pretence to fauour &amp; helpe the opinion of <hi>Glaphyro,</hi> he ſhould
procure to himſelfe a ſelfe wrong, yet Madam waighing with
<pb facs="tcp:22781:49"/>
the nature of your importunities, the dutie of mine owne
promiſſe, I will giue you my fancie in fewe wordes, and that
onlye to declare to <hi>Monophylo</hi> (vnder the reuerent correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole felowſhip) that where he aſked, whether wee
delighted in our Ladies, vſing proſtitution with others, and
likewiſe what eſtimation we ought to haue of them, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our ſelues to ſtraungers, this compariſon in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath no place: not that I meane to offer any oppreſſion
to the noble ſex feminine the rather to extoll ours, but onelye
to adde a certaine newe memorie to our auncient proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
that as women are not placed in ſuch degrée of libertie
as men, ſo many things are made lawfull to men, which are
not ſuffred to women: I meane not as touching gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of common wealthes, exerciſe of armes, and charges
ouer pollitick ſtates from whence they haue béene repulſed as
inſufficient for ſuch vſes: onely the auncientes haue deſired
in them a certaine chaſteneſſe, which onely vertue they haue
eſtéemed a ſupplie ſufficient to all other thinges, of which, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
our lawes ciuill as naturall, had depriued them, which
hath not bene required in man, as being nothing ſo frayl and
ſliding a ſubſtaunce as the woman, wherein nature, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by good and reaſonable meanes, hath pronounced many
thinges as improper to women, which ſhe hath eſtabliſhed as
matters of prayſe to men: touching which lawe if I were vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to giue a more full reaſon, I coulde not otherwaies aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
than that nature hath proclaymed it: neyther was I
borne or preſerued hethervnto, to make a baſe eſtimation of
your ſex, of whome the greateſt part of my felicitie and lyfe
doe depende (which perhaps he ſpake ſkoffinglye) onely let it
ſuffiſe you, that ſuch a thing being imprinted from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
within our hartes by a naturall inclynation, there is no
néede to applye to one, that which maye be appropryed to an
other: O ſmooth ſtyle and farre from the matter, O ſimple
countenaunce and no ſuch meaning, O ſhort diſcourſe, quoth
the Lady, and yet nothing forgotten: I ſée nowe your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22781:49"/>
is ledde by your owne opinion, and that which earſt the
worlde noted as a reſpectiue modeſtie in you, I ſee turnes to
a vomit, and you infected with a popular errour. But where
is <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> will he leaue vs in this plaine
waye without ſuccour: ſuer I muſt appeale to you the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that vnder this generalitie me thinkes is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
that goddeſſe which you daylye worſhippe, where ſo
euer ſhe abyde, yea though ſhée ſitte euen in the middeſt of
your heart: and for my part I coulde not thus long haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayned
from aunſwere, were not that both I muſt not
pleade in mine owne cauſe, and alſo it was latelye defended
by your goodly ordinaunces: it is not Madam ſayth <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo</hi>
long ſince you preuented that, when you tolde vs
that wée ſtoode not now vpon ſuche ſcrupulous iudgement
beſides, in encountring <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> you ſhall not
be noted to defende your proper cauſe, but to giue charitable
ayde to me and mine ſéeing it pleaſeth you to endue mée
with that honour and eſtimation: here the Ladye tooke ſome
pawſe, as though ſhe eyther doubted the matter, or feared
the ſucceſſe, which I thinke might be rather layde to hir
want of exerciſe in ſuch affaires, and therfore ſhe wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
that hardly ſhée ſhould gouerne hir affection to the cauſe.
But <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> vſing the offer of his oportunitie, vrged hir
eftſones with this ſeconde chalenge: I ſée (ſayth he) your
cauſe is like to quaile for want of a good Champion, if your
ſelfe vndertake not the defence of your quarell, which in it
ſelfe is ſo perilous, that by good reaſon, <hi>Monophylo,</hi> eſchewes
the liſtes, leaſt hée be made recreant: wherewith the Lady
kindling in a ſoft anger, as appeared by a freſh bloode drawne
into hir face, tolde him, ſhe would rather put hir ſimplicitye
on the iudgement of the companie, than ſuffer him to ſteale
awaye the victorie from hir in a cauſe of no leſſe equitie on
hir ſide, than altogither vniuſt touching his part: wherein
(ſayth ſhée) (ſomewhat riſing from the ſeate where ſhée ſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

albeit by your wiſdome you thinke to reuerſe the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb facs="tcp:22781:50"/>
of my cauſe, yet if I fayle in force, I hope the matter will
not faint in value and goodneſſe, as being in it ſelfe hable to
defende it ſelfe without eyther orator or aduocate: and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the ſpéeche of that libertie which you laboured to
attribute to men, you are diſtended into many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
far impertinent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of your ſurmiſed queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will not prepare to ſatiſfie onely the motion of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
argument, but euen all the reſidue of your reaſons, to
the ende your ſelfe maye iudge that you haue put nothing to
mée of credite, nor I vnwilling to repaye it with money no

neceſſarie conſideration of the difference in our two cauſes,
I doubt not (neyther is my fancie vaine) but you will finde
them of no leſſe inequalitie and diſſemblaunce, then betwene
a paineted ymage and a liuely creature: For as your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are grounded vpon tranſitorie opinions of men, ſo I
haue euen nature hirſelfe to enter defence with me, who to
prooue ſhe hath not altogither exempted vs from actes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and worthyneſſe: I praye you looke into the liues of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myramys</hi>
and <hi>Tomyrys</hi> for the direction of a pollicie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth with infinite others, by whoſe womanly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
not onelye their Monarchies and ſtates haue bene well
eſtabliſhed, but alſo had ſuch a valyaunt dexteritie in armes,
that by them their poſteritie is made noble ſo long as the
worlde remaines a worlde: we reade alſo of <hi>Panthaſile,</hi> and
the <hi>Amazones</hi> of high renowne for actiuitie in warrre: for
the gift of <hi>Poeſie,</hi> we haue <hi>Sapho,</hi> and in our owne time a
Ladie of high memorie <hi>Margeret de valoys,</hi> beſides the
learned rowte in Italie, whoſe works remaine as lanternes
to guide the ſtudies of learned wittes: if you ſéeke for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of eloquence (the verie pillour of euerie common welth
well guided) beholde what maieſtie the Romaynes haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and fame to <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> to the ayde of whoſe
naturall wittes, was ioyned ſuch facilitie in eloquence that
they were valued with the beſt Orators in Rome, yea what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22781:50"/>
numbers might alſo be founde in theſe dayes of equall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
that way, were not for the malicious lawes of men, who
knowing the great mindes of women, weake notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in bodilie force (euen with the example of the ſillie
fiſhes who are deuoured by the great) forbidde vs all charge
ouer polliticke ſtates, making vs of ſo frayle iudgement that
we are bereaued from all libertie of grauntes and alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our goodes, without the expreſſe conſent of our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes:
And yet oh howe common is the experience, that
great and mightie howſes decline by the wilfull prodigalitie
of men, which are eftſones reſtored and entertayned by the
wiſe foreſight and behauioer of the women, the ſame being a
probable inducement, that if it were lawfull to vs to applye
our wittes with your exerciſes (if the direction of a publike
ſtate, may reſemble the order of a priuate or familiar family)
our capacitie may ſtretch aſwell to the greater, as we are
thought ſufficient to gouerne that of common moment: But
to leaue the examples of the Ethnikes, what ſtate of more
maieſtie haue you, than the ſupremaſie and throne of Rome:
wherein notwithſtanding we haue read that a woman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the attire of a man, hath diſcharged a gouernement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with any that ſuccéeded hir: yea it was neceſſarie both
to hir and <hi>Semyramys</hi> aſwell to content the worlde, as to
intercept the popular opinion, to diſguiſe themſelues in the
proportion of a man, which ſtate ſo long as they exerciſed,
nothing was euill done, all their attemptes were vertuous,
and helde for true examples of high magnanimitie: But as
ſone as they fell into the diſcouery of men, and that they were
knowne for women, their auncient praiſe of vertue, proweſſe
and holineſſe, began to take contrarie qualities, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
no leſſe loathſome, than the parties hatefull, by whom
they were performed: ſuche is the ſetled malice of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
vs, that fearing, leaſt by our vertue and wiſedeme,
they might perhappes fall into ſome decaye of credite wyth
the worlde (with the maner of tyrauntes, who deſtroye all
<pb facs="tcp:22781:51"/>
ſuch as they feare) haue taken from vs the poſſeſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we had as large an intereſt as they: it may bée, you will
encounter me heare with the heriſies of theſe two women
by me alleaged, as the one pretending an vnſeemelye luſte in
the perſon of hir ſonne, and the other in the ende ſtained with
manye groſe follyes, for ſuch is the common ſaying of men
as thinking by this onely reaſon to triumph ouer our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
But Oh holy argument, Oh well diſpoſed people, Oh
ſubtitye worthie your ſex: as if euen thoſe of whome you
holde moſt, eyther for valyauntneſſe or wiſedome, haue not
more fallen into theſe vices: as firſt, your worthie Hercules
by whoſe meane you might well haue vaunted to haue killed
all the monſters in the worlde, if he had killed himſelfe, when
in place to weilde his heauie maſe, he was commaunded to
vſe the ſpindle. What ſay you then to your ydolatrous <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
to whome albeit was giuen a ſinguler wiſedome, yet
the hiſtories chalenge his life in manye other loathſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes:
wherein how farre I coulde further enlarge with
examples of like reſemblaunce, I make your ſelfe iudge,
though (in a worldely cuſtome) you had rather defende your
proper errors, than confeſſe a ſimple truth: But let vs cutte
off theſe fonde opinions no leſſe inconuenient to you than
hurtfull to vs, yea, if you weigh them in a preciſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
moſt preiudiciall to you, as being induced by God,
(according to your generall opinion) with a more ſounde
and ſtable witte than wée: and falling eftſoones vppon my
ſpéeche of opinion and nature, will you haue a more wiſe
Philoſopher than <hi>Socrates,</hi> who coulde not winke at the
wrong which was offred vs, but holdes vs no leſſe capable of
euery vertue and ſcience, than euen the beſt of you: <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
alſo by his lawes accuſtomed women to déedes of armes
with all other exerciſes wherein you men chalenge a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
peculiaritie: and now in theſe dayes we are left onely to
our rockes: if I ſhewe you that in <hi>Lycya</hi> in olde time thoſe
actes which now you make proper onely to vs women, were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22781:51"/>
the common exerciſes of men, ſhall it be a ſufficient example
to prooue that ſuch thinges conſiſted not but in mortall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo that <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> where onely your tyranny
hath taken from vs the lawfull vſe of ſuch actes and vertues
you muſt not wronfully blame nature from whome we haue
no leſſe capacitie in all ſciences than you: in déede Lady ſayth
<hi>Phylopolo,</hi> you halfe perſwade mée to beléeue it, although
it is contrarie to my will, ſo that what by the naturall
reſemblaunce of your examples, and force of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
which I coulde hardely haue thought coulde haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into the braine of a woman, I am almoſt alured to holde

not in cauſes concerning the actes of women (as <hi>Heliogoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

when your common wealth ſtandes in neceſſitie of ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
(ſayth ſhée) I doubt not of ſufficient numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

you haue the voyce of the whole companye, both to allowe
your reaſons, &amp; commend your order, &amp; for my part, I think
your ſelfe of ſufficient authoritie, without forraine examples,
to deface the opinion of ſuch with whome your ſex ſtandes in
a necligent or careleſſe regarde, wiſhing you onely might
ſtande in place of a worthie <hi>Achylles,</hi> to aunſwere all ſiniſter

am fully perſwaded (according to the matter of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
that the ſame hath bene the cauſe why the auncients
<pb facs="tcp:22781:52"/>
Poetes induyng euery thing of the worlde with his peculiar
God, woulde not alſo leaue them without their goddeſſes,
as for the matter of warre they erected <hi>Bellona,</hi> aſwell as
the God <hi>Mars,</hi> ouer ſcience and wiſedome, they eſtabliſhed
<hi>Pallas</hi> aſwell as <hi>Mercurius,</hi> the diſpoſition of richeſſe they

were as famous as <hi>Phoebus,</hi> ſignifying to all the worlde
vnder the cloake or meane of <hi>Poeſie,</hi> that aſwell women as
men did aſpire in déepe capacitie of the artes and ſiences
and all other thinges which are comprehenſible with men:
yea a little further, bycauſe nature deueſting them of bodily
force, ſéemed of right to ſupplye them with the abundaunce
of the minde, as béeing not coyffed or ouercharged with ſo
heauie a burthen of the earth as wée, but drawne forth of
a matter more purified, as taking their beginning of vs, and
wée groſely rayſed of the corrupt earth without anye forme:
which ſurely is a miſterie which ought to figure vnto vs the
maieſtie of that worke of nature, when ſhée faſhioned the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
for euen as wée ſée in Limbeckes, from groſe matters
are drawne and diſtelled ſwéete and delicate waters, albeit
not in ſo great quantitie, euen ſo women, being as it were

women, when all that people (vnder the conduct of <hi>Cyrus</hi>)
ſéeking to warraunt themſelues by flight againſt the furie of

afore his entrie into that towne, out of the which the women
made ſuch valiaunt yſſue, ſhoulde giue to euerie woman
Citizen of that place, a certaine ſumme of ſiluer according to

Italie when their huſbandes were gon of forraging for vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
entred into common accorde, aſwell touching their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reaſt and quiet, as profeſſing a preſent benifit, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce
of honour to their poſteritie, and determined at
one inſtaunt to burne all their veſſelles and ſhippes: which
being put to execution by the councell of one of them named
<hi>Roma</hi> (in memorie of which fact the towne of Rome, tooke
and hath continued hir name) they gaue occaſion to the
Troyans to eſtabliſhe there, their abode and dwelling: So
they began to erect kinges, who adding diuerſe names and
qualities, as albania, and then Rome, became by ſucceſſe of
tyme, to be abuſed, and yet (ſuch was the ſuffraunce of deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,
who hatched in it ſelfe a newe forme of common wealth,
by the meane of <hi>Lucretia</hi> defiled by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> this monarchy
chaunged into a populer eſtate, ſuch as was after obſerued by
the ſpace of fiue hundreth yeares: here you may ſaye, that
kinde of common wealth was not iutroduced by the wiſedom
or councell of women, euen ſo it maye be aunſwered that
vpon them fell the lotte and meane to direct that Cittie in an
other forme, more profitable for the common ſort: But as
there is no eternitie in mortall doinges, ſo this common
wealth declining into corruption by the licentious ambition
of potentates, to whoſe peruerſitie of maners was required
a newe pollecye, there roſe vp a <hi>Iulius Ceſar,</hi> who in a haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſtoutneſſe, inuerting all auncient lawes tranſlated eftſons
the order of this cittie into a monarchie: but what monarchy
maye we name it: if not an empire of perpetuall tyrannie
diſguiſed ſometimes by the goodneſſe of a fewe, who againſt
their willes were called and choſen to that dignitie of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:
and yet it was not for the regarde of men, that the
Gods prepared ſuch reformations: But now to a laſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of familiaritie, it is not yet ſixe ſcore yeares paſt, that in
one of the greateſt monarchies euen in the heart of chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
a ſimple mayde (ſent by gods prouidence) was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
to deliuer the whole country from a general ſeruitude,
<pb facs="tcp:22781:54"/>
wherein they had long liued, ſo that it ſéemes God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to women the beſt part of honorable victories as not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to vs to poſſeſſe but their ſmall remainder, and therefore
with wrong our aunceſtors ſought to oppreſſe this ſex, as
thinking to rayſe our owne, which (not to diſguiſe the truth)
comes not néere their excellencie by a million of paces: For
this haue I to giue you thankes (ſayth the Ladie <hi>Chariclea</hi>)
although thankes be no ſufficient rewarde to ſo great a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and by thys is worthyly prooued your noble condicion,
which I promiſe you ſhall remaine with me in no ſmall eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
onelye I am now ſorie I vſed my authoritie hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo preciſelie ouer your ſilence, ſéeing by howe much I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned
you to ſpeake, by ſo much was I a ſecret enimie to
my ſelfe, which open wrong to your déepe iudgement tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a modeſtie of ſpéeche not ordinarie to the moſt ſort of
Gentlemen: But hauing yet to ende mine owne Caruer,
touching the iealouſe language of <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> which tended
to prooue that chaſtitie was more requiſite in women than in
men, I praye you lette me aſke him by what law men haue
that priuilege aboue women, if it by the lawe of God, eyther
you vnderſtande it not rightlye, or alleadge the text necli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
ſéeing the ſcripture abhorres the ſame againſt chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
aſwell in the man as in the woman: And if you chalenge
it by the ſtatutes of man, you can not alleadge them to my
preiudice, vnleſſe in this cauſe you will hold an eſtate both of
iudge and partie: But be it eyther ſort, I will not muche
impugne your ſaying: not that I will confeſſe ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
(for ſo may I call it) to procéede by bonde or naturall
lawe, as you maintayne, but by a certaine honeſtie, by which
we women plaſing it before our eyes, are alwayes more in
ſtudie to garde our chaſt honour than men, to whome it is
a cuſtome to bequeath their heartes vpon credite vpon the
leaſt ſuggeſtion that mooues, wherein if by our wiſedome
we haue learned to bridle our naturall luſtes, and you men
(as in a poſſeſſion and cuſtome without memorie) doe ſlacke,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:22781:54"/>
the raines to your loathſome deſires, to the firſt that offreth,
I ſée no reaſon to allowe you (in the matter of loue) any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
aboue vs, ſéeing alſo (if I may waigh my reaſons
with the opinions of the worlde) that as by common voyce
the woman is eſtéemed aboue him who offereth court to hir
(as ſhée being called miſtreſſe, and he ſeruaunt) ſo it ſtandes
him more in duetie not to offende his Ladie, to whome he is
bounde then ſhe to feare him, whome ſhée maye commaunde
lyke as in common reaſon there is alwayes more libertie
alowed in generall reſpectes to the mayſter, than a ſimple li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to him that profeſſeth the ſtate of a ſeruaunt, and yet
for my part, bicauſe I will be no partie to that fonde opinion
I neyther can nor will perſwade, that in loue there is or
ought to be prorogatiue of power: For where the woman is
not equallie plunged with the man, nor he likewiſe as déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched with affection as the woman (how ſo euer they
embrace one another) yet ſuch colde banquets can no waye
merit the name of loue, but rather méere diſſimulation, ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
I know not by what motion, whoſe continuaunce is
not long: I can make no reckening of that woman, who ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hir poore friende endure extréeme paſſions of loue for hir
ſake, will ſometimes embrace him, to drawe him the rather
within hir nettes, and then vpon the ſodayne will turne the
cart againſt the horſe, and not vouchſafe one looke of fauour
vpon him: For my part much leſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can commend this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſéeing, if I were alowed preſident in that cauſe (as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo</hi>
woulde haue earſt eſtabliſhed me) hir crueltie ſhould
be puniſhed with a continuaunce of baniſhment from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of all honeſt Ladies: I cannot denie for all this, that
ſometimes we ſhall not be conſtrayned to receyue ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in loue, as it is poſſible then to entertaine our Ladies or
friendes as wée were woont, but in that we ought to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt,
and much loſſe procéede by any artificiall pollicie, the
ſoner to giue them a Bée to buze withall) but rather by a
certaine naturall inſtinct ſturred vp of an extréeme loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:22781:55"/>
the which are comprehended feare and ſorrowe: Thus
much I holde (Gentlemen) againſt the opinion of ſuche, as
raſhly pretende inequalitie in loue, which I can neuer admit
and much leſſe alowe that the woman be called myſtreſſe of
the man, vnleſſe in like ſort, he bee in déede the peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
and Lorde of the hart of his Ladie: maintaining alſo
by the ſame (contrarie to <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) that it is no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the man than to the woman, vnder couler of my
fonde opinion, conceyued amongſt men to communicate
themſelues in manye places: Indéede (Madam quod I)
you may well call it opinion, but not nature how ſoeuer the
common ſort eſtéeme of it, wherein (for a better declaration)
I wiſh <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> to looke vpon <hi>Solon</hi> a true folower of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

participate not but with one onelie: if I ſhould aleage vnto
you the cuntrie of Cipres, wherein maydes win their dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by the ſweate of their bodyes, woulde you holde our
cuſtome to be more founded vpon nature than that: yea if
I ſhoulde bring forth <hi>Plato,</hi> in whoſe common wealth was
ſuffred a communitie of women, woulde you not aſſure your
ſaying vpon worldelye opinion, ſéeing that great Philoſopher
thought he ruled himſelfe altogither by the reaſons of nature
I lyke not of that lawe ſayth the Lady (by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

theſe good dames enforced their ſute to the Senate,
and I doubt they woulde not haue béene contented with two
huſbandes, but abuſing that libertie woulde at length haue
fallen into the vice of all thoſe women which paſſed through
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22781:55"/>
the handes of thoſe two erraunt Knightes <hi>Aſtolphe,</hi> and
<hi>Ioconde</hi> repreſented within that excellent Italyan <hi>Homer
Arioſte:</hi> herein you are diſceyued (ſayth <hi>Chariclea</hi>) for if
all thoſe Ladies had béene ſtricken with ſuche loue as wée
ſpeake of, they had neuer fallen, and in mine opinion, we
finde more felicitie in one frinde ſimplie and truly affected,
than in a number others, whoſe loues be eyther ordinarye,
or for neceſſitie, wherein what better example can I aleage
that out of the place you ſpeake of, for the ſame <hi>Aſtolphe</hi> &amp;
<hi>Ioconde</hi> choſe in the ende one Ladie to content them both,
and yet a little <hi>quidam,</hi> who afore had gaged the veſſell of
loue to them both, notwithſtanding their preciſe héede, did
cutte the graſſe from vnder their féete, the ſame bicauſe loue
by this former ambuſhe, had giuen him a firſt conqueſt
there: But as theſe examples doe not touche me in care, ſo
are they alſo out of the courſe of my firſt argument, which
tenden onelie to this ende, that as I woulde not alowe to a
woman libertie of communion with euerye one, ſo that I
woulde not alſo haue you to thinke that the ſame is cauſed
more by a naturall reaſon (wherein you may eſtabliſh ſome
aduauntage to our preiudice) than by a bountie and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of hart, which guiding vs therevnto, in time doth ſo ſettle
in the heartes of moſt men, that if we offer to withſtande it,
they make it a matter of ſiniſter ymputation to vs: albeit
in déede the act it ſelfe there is neyther cauſe of diſcredite nor
reaſon of ſuch diſaduauntage as you pretende, but rather it
includes matter of honor and commoditie to our honeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings:
in déede Madame ſayth <hi>Glaphyro,</hi> it can not but giue
you a ſinguler value of honor. But for my part, I beléeue
that lawe was neuer erected, but to our great confuſion, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe I ſée anye other cauſe why a woman ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſed
or counted by ſo manye honeſt perſonages, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the ſwéete vſe of their pleaſaunt attemptes, but the
tyrannie of this wicked lawe, rayſed (as it ſéemes) in deſpite
both of man and woman: bicauſe the woman fearing the
<pb facs="tcp:22781:56"/>
note of diſhonour, by the worlde, dares not performe the laſt
acte of the league: but by woonderfull pollicie: heare <hi>Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo</hi>
ſtoode ſtill vpon the iuſtructions of nature, and that we
were not directed by mans ordynaunce, wherein he layde the
examples of beaſtes, amongſt whome, notwithſtanding the
long purſute of the male to hys mate, yet is ſhée hardlye
brought to obey his will: by whome (ſayth he) we maye be
taught, that the woman ought not to be ſo familiar that way
as the man: This is but a voluble fancie (ſayth <hi>Charyclea</hi>)
and rather an error by ignorance, then a true iudgement of
the propertie of beaſtes, of whom the example of the turtle is
againſt you, in whom (be he male, or be ſhée female) is ſuffred
no ſinguler prorogatiue one aboue an other: wherewith the
Ladye retyred to ſilence, not as wearie with any long ſpéech,
but (as it ſéemed) bicauſe <hi>Phylopolo</hi> in an inreuerent light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
intercepted hir further diſcourſe, a thing no leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſaunt
to the whole felowſhip, then ſingulerly grieuous
to me, who, wondering at the readie ſhift of learning in this
Lady, could not but ſay in my ſelfe, oh ſinguler wit, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to women, oh déepe iudgement aſpyring ſupernaturally,
oh modeſtie worthye of the ſubiect wherein thou abydeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oh

(notwithſtanding the malicious murmure of the worlde) the
nobylitie of thy minde, by which thou doeſt not onely enoble
all thy ſex, but alſo defaceſt that little worthyneſſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned
to vs: And albeit, during this whole diſcourſe, I
ment not to play other part, then to diſcharge the office of a
faithfull Secretorie to ſo honorable a company, yet according
to my deſire to doe good to my power, (in this oportunitie of
matter and place) but call all you deare damoſels ſtanding
in the profeſſion of honor and vertue, to beholde as in a
glaſſe the conuerſation of my <hi>Charyclea,</hi> whoſe example I
wiſhe might leade you in no leſſe modeſtie of behauiour, then
by hir diſcourſes, I wiſhe you drawne to a deſire of equall
knowledge: And yet, I doubt not but ſome will be eſtéemed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:22781:56"/>
euill employed (as in reſpect of the maieſtie of hir preſence
and chaſte honor to hir ſex) to be the firſt rayſers of the ſpéech
and talke vttered in the fauor of loue: to whome I aunſwere
for hir, that it is no leſſe commendable to ſéeke out the true
propertie of loue, wherein nature, euen from the begynning
of our age, hath hid within vs a ſecret inſtruction: then by a
diſſembled arte, to be guyded and taught by an Orator or
Phiſition, who in tymes paſt haue bene dryuen out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealthes, the one for corrupting the bodyes, the other
for infecting the mindes and manners of men: where loue
being imprinted in vs, by ſo excellent a miſtreſſe and worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
hath had alwayes an Empire ouer vs: by him the
worlde had his being, and in him it hath multiplyed: and by
him euen trées and other inſenſible things ſéeme to take their
encreaſe one of an other: ſo that right neceſſarie and noble
is the deſire of my <hi>Charyclea,</hi> to ſéeke out his condition and
nature: And for myne owne part, hauing thus enregiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
their reaſons, I hope that no one man will turne that to
a ſinguler vice in me, by which all men receyue a common
profite, or at leaſt an honeſt pleaſure, but me thinkes, I heare
ſuch as know me not, chalenge thys exerciſe as inconuenient
to the ſtate of my profeſſion, to whome (if they will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie
with the honeſtie of my meaning) I aunſwere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
it be indecent to my facultie, yet not impertynent to my
yeares, who, afore their tyme are loath to participate wyth
olde age: And heare, I put my ſelfe of the beadroll of the
happieſt crewe in the worlde, ſeing it is the pleaſure of the
mightie God of loue, to choſe me for one of his, to the ende
to inſtruct and acquaint me with his armes, which hereafter
wyll be more intollerable to me, than if he had called me to
his trayne, when eyther by age or other néedefull occaſions,
I ſhould be leſſe apt to attende him: And herein (good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
you may beleeue me, (as one to whom vntrue reportes
are hatefull) that ſuch is the ſtraunge and haggarde nature
of loue, that if we defie him in our tender yeres, he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
<pb facs="tcp:22781:57"/>
our olde age with ſuch ſharpe paſſions and plagues of
his power, that (in the common gaſe and ſkoffe of the world)
he will bring vs at laſt to marche vnder his banner: being on
the other ſide of ſuch compaſſion and iuſt conſideration, that
if he haue entertayned and nouſſeled from his youth a good
and loyall ſeruaunt, and knowing him to be ſetled in ſome
ſtate of perſite rypeneſſe (according to the maner of olde ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours,
whome their common wealth after many good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
doth make frée from all charges of warre) he gyues
vs ſome releaſe and conſolation, as not to match his tyranny
with the iudgement of the people, who if they had not proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him, may one daye runne vnder a ſmarting experience:
wherein laſtly, I beſéech that God by whome I was firſt
mooued to employe my Pen in theſe exerciſes, that if anye
crabbed <hi>Saturnus,</hi> chaunce to ſteale a pyll of hys confection,
that he may finde it of hard digeſtion, and ſo to my Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whoſe moſt ſpéeche (if I be not deceyued) gathered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to this point of loyaltie, which <hi>Phylopolo</hi> would not
ſhould be ſo requiſite in the man as in the woman: by which
occaſion <hi>Charylea</hi> in waſpiſhe termes wiſhed him one daye
to fall vppon a wyfe in whome in ſteade of mercy, he ſhould
finde a minde equall to this merite: I hope (Madame) ſayth
<hi>Phylopolo,</hi> your wordes are without meaning of curſſe, or
at leaſt your curſe not to carie ſuch enchauntment as you
wiſhe me, but in his am I beſt contented, that being at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
I meane neuer to come in bondes: bycauſe I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
dwelt in this opinion, that as it is a thing impoſſible to
make of a common, a perticular, ſo if a woman once corrupt
hir bondes of honor with proſtitution of hir bodye to one,
ſhe maye vſe the like libertie of fauour to another, then to a
thirde, and ſo become generall: ah ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi> (to
whome this iudgement was moſt hatefull) God forbid that
in my preſence I ſuffer you ſo inaduiſedly to blaſpheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the truth: howe meane you (<hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi>) to
make of a common, a peculiar, the ſame being the common
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22781:57"/>
error of the people, who thinke to ſacrifice loue by that onely
reaſon: as though it were impoſſible that loyalty could abide
in the braine of a woman, in which who woulde alledge to
you infinite honeſt Ladyes (wherewith the hyſtories doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
ſwarme) that haue conſecrated their honor to one
ſaint, I thinke you would eyther holde the authorities falſe
or ſuch women for monſtruous: yea, you woulde eſtéeme
them rare monſters, as neuer proouing the vertue of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
otherwayes then by the report of the worlde, which for
the moſt part is malicious: But for ſuche in whome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath planted an vpright iudgement, they will rather
repoſe a reſolute loyalty in their Ladies, than once preſume
of ſuſpicion of treaſon: And yet your argument is to weake
to reuerſe true loue, ſéeing yf my hart be alreadie ſetled in
one place, there followes not by that reaſon any duetie of
diuiſion into diuers places: But of the contrarie, bicauſe
naturally it inclines to one, me thinkes the ſame ſhoulde be
a ſufficient bar againſt all other, as hauing imprinted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it this true loue, whereof we ſpake euen nowe: yea, this
degrée of pryoritie (as I thinke) is the onely cauſe, why we
ſée at this daye ſo many poore ſuffring louers not to atchiue,
the happie plot of theyr intentes bycauſe indiſcréetelye they
dreſſed their vowes and offeringes to Ladies, who afore
were conſecrated to other ſaintes: To auoyde this daunger
(ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) I ſaye as before, a pleaſaunt libertie,
is a precious price, and by ſo much the dearer to me, by how
much my nature is impacient, beyng denied what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde,
and therefore if I be enforced to make loue, I will
eyther angle with an enchaunted hooke, or at leaſt fiſhe in
that ſtreame which wil giue me no cauſe of complaint: This
is your libertie of ſpéech (aunſwereth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) by which
you reueale your naturall ignoraunce in loue, as the fonde
man, in his owne braine ymagines he maye diſpoſe all the
worlde: you will not loue, you ſay, otherwayes than in an
imperiall reſpect to chooſe and commaunde: I would to God
<pb facs="tcp:22781:58"/>
the choyſe were in our powers, or our diſcreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hable to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
our authoritie: defie not that, <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi>
wherevnto we are drawne by nature and deſtinie, ſeeing
when you accompt you moſt frée from the motions of loue,
you ſhall finde your ſelfe moſt forced with his violence, and
ſo ſharpely perſecuted, that (in diſpite of your wanton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtaunce)
you ſhall be enioyned to doe ſmarting penaunce
for the blaſphemie, which now (without aduiſe) you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
as eyther to like loathſomely, to loue deſperatelye, to
chooſe vnaduiſedly, to poſſeſſe Ielouſly, to liue poorely, or to
hate extréemelye: of all theſe ſayth <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
plague is to loue and not be encountred, ſéeing in our
lyking, we haue reaſon and iudgement, afore wée chooſe,
wée eyther knowe or enquire: in our loue we haue tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
to auoyde iealowſye, touching our ſtate, we ſtande
vpon Gods prouidence: and to hate is improper to a man
of reaſon, without great cauſe: ſo that next to deſperation,
in loue, a loathſome mate is the ſeconde infelicitie, which I
doubt not to auoyde by the helpe of nature who drawes vs
all to deſire the fayre and leaue the foule: But take héede
ſayth <hi>Monophylo,</hi> leaſt ſéeking to enter into the rules of
Philoſophie, you ſtumble not vpon <hi>Thequiuox</hi> for I neuer
as yet hearde of louer, who eſtéemed not his Ladie fayre,
wherein notwithſtanding there is a ſingularitie in fayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſome ladyes of greater beawtie than others, yet,
we ſee the ſillie heardeman or poore Peaſaunt, woulde not
leaue his preatie Katie for the fayreſt Lady in the realme:
and why? bicauſe in hir hée hath layde vp his heart, and
ſhée (in his rurall fancie) appeares more contenting fayre,
than all the dainetie dames of the traine. And yet perhaps
he is no leſſe ſtudious in beawtie than you, but his minde
being fixed in one place by an opinion which he hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the partie (as of late <hi>ſeigneur Paſquier</hi> well approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
albeit in hir doe reſt all the inciuilitie and rudeneſſe of
the worlde, yet he conſters hir and hir qualitie to a ſinguler
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22781:58"/>
wiſe and ſéemely behauiour: wherein what better example
can I prefer then out of <hi>Angeliqua</hi> figured within <hi>Arioſte</hi>
in his booke of <hi>Furius:</hi> ſhée, who had béene beloued courted,
and purſued by numbers of the beſt knightes of the world,
without vſing any mercie vpon them, in the ende when ſhe
thought hir ſelfe moſt frée from paſſion, it was then ſhe felt
hir ſelfe ſo déepely enclined in affection to a meane ſouldiour
(not comparable to the leaſt of the other) that euen in hir
was forced the office and indeuour of the man, which is to
require and demaunde: here <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> deſired him to
paſſe no further in that example, leaſt (ſayth hée) you blinde
vs all with that which earſt you doubted in mée, which is
<hi>Thequiuox.</hi> For by the nature of your preſent example,
the author of <hi>Furius</hi> ſekes to teache vs no other thing then
that the naturall inclination of a woman, is not (with
the man to chuſe the better, but (as children) addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
alwayes to the worſſe as wée ſée the ſhée Woolfe, who
amongſt the whole troupe of Woolues, doth commonlye
make hir ſinguler choyſe, of him in whome appeares leaſt
likeyhoode of habilitie to ſatiſfie hir appetite: euen ſo the
experience is common in many women, who rather then
they will yelde to the honeſt friendeſhippe of ſome worthie
man, will diſſimule to be a <hi>Penelope,</hi> but hauing the place

ignoraunt in the ſecret nature of the Woolfe, in whome (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

a moſt full and familier inſtruction to loue, and to whoſe
example we ought chiefely to apply the maner and meaſure
of our affection (if the ſame were in our power) for ſuche is
the condicion of the ſhe Woolfe, that being purſued by many
dogge Woolues, chooſeth out of infinite numbers the moſt
leane and euill fauoured amongſt them, euen he which firſt
began to follow hir when ſhe entred into hir heate, and who
by a weary purſute and infinite labours is ſo mortified for
hir, that to recompence his deformity procéeding for hir ſake,
ſhée ſéemes to receyue him afore all the reaſt, as hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the reaſt, beſt deſerued: whoſe maner I wiſhe might
ſtand in example to certaine Dames, to whome the martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of a poore afflicted louer is a ſinguler felicitie: a thing
(in my iudgement) ſo abhominable to God and men, as I
thinke the heauens cloſe their gates, &amp; the earth vomits cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
againſt ſuch vnnaturall in iniquitie. And yet (Madam)
I may wrongfully lay this fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, ſeeing they haue
to alleage the ſupremacie of <hi>Cupido,</hi> who onely lyes in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhe
to ſteale our heartes, to the ende that leading them in
his authoritie, he may diſpoſe them at his pleaſure: For ſo
doth this little Godde entangle himſelfe with our doings, by
whome all Ladies falling into ſuch inconuenience, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
withall, and the whole guilt layd vpon him, who (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
to vs wretches) infectes the beſt and ſoundeſt partes
in vs, without any libertie of health but ſuch and in whome
it pleaſeth him to graunt it: This is the cauſe why the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes
made him an archer without eyes, as hauing no
reſpect to the qualities of perſons, doth oftentimes dazell our
ſight, and blinde our ſences, that without any conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we tranſlate our heartes to ſuch as the common people
(murmuring at our deſtinie) holdes vnworthie of vs, who as
blinde iudges, laye the fault to our owne mocion and cléere
this little inuiſible théefe, by whoſe traines our heartes are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22781:59"/>
betrayed: and yet <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> if ſome fewe miſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
chaunce to fall into that inconuenience, God defende
that eyther in their example or iudgement ſhoulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
a generalitie of women, as you ſéeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
which if it ſhoulde be ſo, into this common errour
ſhoulde wee fall, to thinke that neuer manne of honour
and value was beloued of a woman, but ſuche onelye as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
the names of villaines, then many hundred thouſand
gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were neuer beloued, then men of noble &amp; high at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
were neuer eſtéemed, yea then any ſort of people in
whome nature had planted a value of minde, haue bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
withall which is not onelye vnlikelye in common
reaſon, but altogither vntrue in familiar &amp; common proofe.
And yet I will not denie that manye valiaunt and noble
knightes, yea euen the verie Peragons of a kingdome, may
not ſometimes and in ſome places beſtowe their loue in
vaine, and euen ſo againe without longe or manye
matches receyue a pleaſaunt rewarde of their painefull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
the ſame lot or deſtinie being altogither gouerned by
that little god <hi>Cupid,</hi> who in his quiuer doth cary two ſortes
of arrowes whereof the one is tipped with golde to molyfie
and allure the heartes of his ſubiectes, and the other dipped
in leade, to harden the heartes of ſuch to whome we pretend
moſt affection: by which fiction I finde no other ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then that the one féeleth himſelfe in a mocion ſtricken
with deſire of a thing which he ſéeth in the other: the ſame
by a certaine ſecret inſtinct drawing him vnto him, and in
the other I can diſcerne nothing by which he may cleaue to
his loue: Here you haue preuented mée, ſayth <hi>Glaphyro,</hi>
for that (according to my promiſſe) I had prepared freſhe
charge for you as to reuerſe your opinion, that loue is not
kindled but by a certayne thing, which you coulde not well
expreſſe, wherein I hadde thought to haue contended
with you bythe authoritie of certaine olde Philoſophers,
who holde that loue dependes not but vppon a certaine
<pb facs="tcp:22781:60"/>
deſire of beautie: wherewith he directed his ſpéech and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
to me, as to whome (as he ſayde) this cauſe did
moſt duely appertaine: ſéeing as in my difinicion of loue,
he charged me to haue giuen that nature: ſo hauing ſet forth
a large and generall purtraict of him, it belonged to me alſo
to diſſipher at full his ſeuerall qualities: But I tolde hym
this ſeaſon of after dinner was due onely to him wiſhing him
to remember the felicitie that fortune had purchaſed for him
as to haue conquered the fauour of hir, who ſtandes as
iudge ouer our exerciſes: in whome (happie <hi>Monophylo</hi>
quod I) you néede doubt no fauour to heare, nor delaye in
iudgement, ſéeing I feare ſhe will entangle his eſtate of a
iudge, with the office of an aduocate to defende you: God
forgiue you <hi>ſeigneur Paſquire</hi> ſayth <hi>Charyclea,</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of any cauſe is a iudgement in it ſelfe, ſo that you nede
not bée ielouſe of my inclination to <hi>Monophylo,</hi> whome I
take to be of that merite, as I can not thinke my ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
if I beare him fauour: ah good Madam aunſwereth
<hi>Monophylo,</hi> that the effect of this friendeſhippe which you
pretende to beare mée, might be reſerued for mine abſence,
ſéeing I doubt not ſo to moderate the preſent ſeaſon and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oportunitie,
as if you finde want of dutie in action, you ſhall
not fayle of readie good will, which onelie is in my power to
performe, which if it bée not ſo much as I ought, and you
looke for, at leaſt I hope you wil ſatiſfie in my good meaning
But to drawe <hi>Glaphyro</hi> out of ſuſpence, ſéeing <hi>ſeigneur
Paſquire</hi> ſéemes to feare the touche, I am content to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
him in the poynt of beautie whereof he thinkes loue
to take his beginning, and not that inſtinct which you haue
preferred: albeit, afore wée wade further, I praye you let
vs haue your fancie howe and in what ſort you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
this beautie: I am conſent ſayth <hi>Glaphyro,</hi> and to
leade you to a more ſubtill and true ſenſe of it, you haue
to note that beautie lyeth not altogither in the bodie, but
hath alſo hir reſidence in the partes of the minde: the one is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22781:60"/>
called beautie ſimplie, and the other good behauiour, which
conſiſtes not onely in good maners and outward faſhions of
conuerſation, but alſo hath a ſpeciall perticipation wyth
vertue, euen as the beautie of the bodie reſtes not altogither
in the lineamentes and feature of the face, but alſo in a good
compoſition and vniuerſall proporcion of all the other parts
of the bodie: And thus beautie being vnderſtanded as it is
by this ſhort and true ſignification, my opinion is that the
verie firſt daye wherein we are betrayed by loue we féele a
certaine ſparke of this beautye which is in our Ladies, a
thing which afterwardes by ſucceſſion of time ſetles ſo in
vs that with our ignoraunt confuſion to all other reſpectes
we come euen to loaſe the knowledge of our ſelues: wherin
as there is diuerſitie of beauties, ſo alſo euerie one enclining
according to his perticuler fancie, ſome delightes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the minde, other takes pleaſure in the perſonage,
to ſome the ſtate and maieſtie of the countinaunce are a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler
felicitie, and to other, the facilitie and promptneſſe of
ſpéeche, is the onely cauſe to kindle affection, but aboue all,
the eye hath a ſupreme power, about the which the little
<hi>Cupid</hi> flies and fléetes in ten thouſande ſortes and ſhapes:
By this I perſwade we delight not in foule things, neither
can any be allured to loue hir, in whome is a want of all,
theſe qualities, ſo that as an imperfect and counterfeit wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
cannot ſet hir ſelfe forth with cauſe to be beloued, ſo
I thinke ſhe is exempted from all fortune and fauour of any
to honour hir as a miſtreſſe in loue: this is the poynt in
which I taried for you (ſaith <hi>Monophylo</hi>) ſéeing by your
talke you ſéeme to eſtabliſhe certaine kindes of beautie, a
thing notwithſtanding, not to bée done in déede, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conſent with you, that euerie one pretendes to
the fayreſt, but in caſe of loue, to holde that one thing
ought to be fairer then an other, is a manifeſt errour: ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
euery woman ingenerall, findes a friend to endure loſſe
paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for hir ſake, than may happen to any ſpecial louer on
<pb facs="tcp:22781:61"/>
the behalfe of ſome ſinguler Ladie more fayre and perfit
than ſhée, and if your opinion ſhould chalenge place of a law,
we might ſay that onely ſhée is honoured with ſeruauntes
in loue, to whome is alotted by nature a ſingularitie in one
of theſe proportions you ſpeake of, and the more ſhe is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, the more doth ſhée make hir ſelfe to merite in
the fancie of men, although we ſe the contrary in euery ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of time: wherin let vs make an example by two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen,
whereof the one by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon iudgement is thought
to be ſingularly fayre, &amp; to the other is giuen a comendation
of meane or indifferent beauty: if wée be inticed (as you ſay)
by this beawtie, it is likely we ſhoulde rather encline to the
ſinguler beauty, than to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other: albeit we prooue often times
the contrarie, ſéeing loue (to make knowne vnto men his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
authoritie) will as often pitche his aboade in hir of
meane and indifferent beautie, as in the other to whome
nature ſéemes to haue giuen a ſinguler perfection: But for
a more familyar example, I praye you <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro</hi>
looke into the choyſe of one of your olde companions, and
my auncient friende, and tell me, what varietie or ſhift of
witte, what ſhape of perſonage, what notable enamell of
complexion or fauour, what ſwéete deliuerie of ſpéeche, yea,
what fauour of nature aboue hir common regarde to all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
women, hath ſhée for whom as you know our friend
labours in no ſmall torment of bodye and minde: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(in an ydolatrous regarde to hyr) he blaſphemes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all other women, as not to holde value and compariſon
with hir, in whome (if loue be to be meaſured by that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
you ſpeake of) there is no one ſparke or part of ſuche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
ſometimes againe he ſets hir in his minde as an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or Goddeſſe of contemplacion, rayſing hir euen vnto the
higheſt heauens, with hymnes &amp; prayſes, drawing hir excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
into partes, &amp; (as it were with a penſell) leauing no
part vntouched with high reuerence &amp; deuocion: But if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you or I ſhould be called to iudge of this Goddeſſe, &amp; hir
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22781:61"/>
excellencie, I feare we would note more folly in hir friend,
than worthineſſe in hir to deſerue his affection: So that
what other thing cauſeth this faireneſſe in hir, if not the
inſtinct wée ſpeake of, which hath drawne this oure
friende to ſuch an extremitie in conceyt, that he eſtéemes
his miſtreſſe to be euen beautie hir ſelfe: And ſo <hi>feigneur
Glaphyro</hi> you ſée how we aſpire to this fayreneſſe, and
beautie, alſo being no other thing then as we are guided by
our naturall inclinations, ſuch inclinations, by infallible
conſequence muſt néedes be the verye motions and cauſers
of loue: For to holde (as many pretende) that the excellency
of the eye conſiſtes eyther in gréene or blacke, or the talle or
meane perſonage: to be eſtéemed one aboue an other, bée
notable abuſes moouing of the affections which we beare
more to one than to an other, whome bycauſe we eſtéeme ſo
we woulde that euerie one woulde conſent with vs in wyll
and fancie: wherein to giue you my plaine iudgement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
long and much confuſion in my ſelfe, with no leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie
to iudge and diſcerne this difference, I ſwere vnto
you, I ſtande in indifferent doubt whether beautie be the
moouer of loue, or our affections kindle by that which ſéemes
fayre vnto vs: But bicauſe onelye that thing that is fayre
doth beſt pleaſe and agrée with vs, I muſt néedes ſaye, that
the perfection in loue, is the onely meane that makes ſome
thinges appéere more fayre to vs then others: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there was neuer father, who in his owne fancie founde
not his owne children fayreſt, albeit in common iudgement
nature had made them imperfect: what other thing drawes
him to this perſwaſion of beautie in his children, but loue,
yea that loue wherevnto only nature without other cauſe,
doth leade and induce him: the like may we conſider in our
Ladies, obſeruing alwayes the ſuggeſtion of our inſtinct, by
the which we both loue our Myſtreſſes, and holde them in a
value of beautie aboue all others, yea, farre otherwayes
then the father doth by his childe, for that when by a long
<pb facs="tcp:22781:62"/>
abſence, not acknowledging himſelfe as ſonne, the affection
of the father will decaye and conuert into a common eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
where euen at the firſt, and as often as wée ſettle
our eyes vpon our Ladies, wée féele ſuch a tranſlation of
affection, that it is without our power to reſolue what
mooues vs to loue them: yea though they had in them all
degrées of deformitie, yet by this inſtinct, their carectes
and ymages would ſettle ſo ſuerlye in vs, that in deſpite of
vs, we ſhould both loue them and eſtéeme them the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
creatures in the worlde: heare you ſéeme (ſayth <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo</hi>)
to figure vnto vs a loue, reſting rather in ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
then in truth? yet methinkes it ſtandes with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent
neceſſitie, that there ſhoulde be ſomething which
ſhoulde be called fayre, and the ſame to conſiſt in the pure
truth, and not in the opinion of men, as you ſéeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
I haue in déede maintayned it, and ſtill will defende
it (aunſwereth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) ſo long as I liue: Not that
I meane to denie you that there is not ſomething which in
it ſelfe ought to be called fayre, but if there bée, I ſay it is
the onely creator which hath knowledge of it: who albeit
by his déere grace, doe make diſtribution of ſome ſparkes
of it to men, yet thinke not (<hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi>) that it is
in vs to knowe it: we can not but confeſſe with one voyce
that in all thinges there is one truth, but what is hée who
durſt aſſure himſelfe at any time to haue founde it, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God, who ſéemes to reſerue it in himſelfe, as meaning
that, that title &amp; name ſhould onely remayne to him and to
none other: and ſuche hath béene our puniſhment, ſince the
offence of the firſt man, that from thence hithervnto, it
hath continued as a matter of continuall ſucceſſion from
the father to the ſonne: For where our nature afore was
perfit and not corrupt, nor blaſted with ſuch whirlewindes
as we are now driuen to féele, yea, being bountie it ſelfe and
ſtanding (as it were) in a ſtate of moſt pure innocencye:
ſince declining by this delight to corruption, kéeping not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:22781:62"/>
ſome ſparckeling memorie of hir former fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
there remaines onely an appetite to enter into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that is to ſéeke to aſpire and pearce into this bounty
and beautie (which haue a ſocietie togither) and yet of
our ſelues we are neuer hable to attaine therevnto: the
ſame perhappes being the cauſe why certaine notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,
ſought in olde time to vſurpe the ſtate of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
and not to beare the name of wiſemen, profeſſing
onely to be zealors and ſeachers of wiſdome which they
coulde neuer finde (notwithſtanding) by all their ſubtill
<hi>Sillogiſmoes,</hi> but ſpeaking generally of that high benifit
(wherevnto we all pretende) they diſputed ſeuerally euery
one according to his perticuler fancie. So that if you aſke
me who hath euer poſſeſſed it, I muſt aunſwere with the
deuine, that onely he hath pearced into it, who (acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the incomprehenſible eſtate of God) confeſſeth by an
extréeme faith not to be able to reach the knowledge of this
high ſcience, which lies onelie in the handes of the ſoueraine
eternall: For albeit nature hath made vs pertakers of a
ſoule reaſonable in it ſelfe, to ſtudie to knowe the truth,
yet ſhée hath ſprinkled hir with paſſions which greatly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hir heauenly exerciſes: The auncient <hi>Platoniſtes</hi> were
of opinion that our ſoule occupied in vs two ſeates or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whereof the one they beſtowed in the braine, which is
reaſon, and the other they ſay poſſeſſeth the inferior partes,
which they name luſt or deſire: wherein albeit that which
occupieth the partes more noble, ought to aſſiſt the other,
as being moſt wiſe and forſéeing, yet (ſuch is our ſhare and
part with this maſſie earth) being tickled by their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and deceitfull paſſions, communicating with them
hir ſecrets and (as it were) conſpiring ſecretly againſt hir,
ſubmittes hir ſelfe oftentimes to their mercie to hir great
confuſion: For example, who ought to haue bene more
deueſted of all humaine paſſion than our originall father
Adam, being in his innocencie, ſéeing our mortall nature
<pb facs="tcp:22781:63"/>
was as then in his moſt great perfection: and yet was not
he rather ouer ruled by concupiſcence then guided by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
when in an ambicious humour, he rebelled againſt the
will of God: But if we diſtende more familiarly: by what
other effect I praye you are we deuided from beaſtes, but
by this reaſon onelie, which (notwithſtanding) we ſée ſo
abuſed in thouſandes of men, that they ſéeme to pertake
more with beaſts than with humanity, wherin what better
teſtimonie can we produce than the doinges of wiſemen,
and ſuch as are inraged &amp; repleniſhed with furie in whome
notwithſtanding that luſt or deſire neuer fayled, which
kepes reſidence in vs all, which makes me think that when
this mightie &amp; generall architector began to faſhion man,
he framed him deuided, as it were halfe diuine &amp; halfe bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
ſo that, as he would not make him altogither ignorant
in things paſſed, nor directly to foreſée chaunces to come, ſo
he intercepted him to flie with the winges of his minde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
conſideration concerning only himſelfe, which is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, but ſéemes contented only with our faith
and credulitie: And ſo in the matter of beautie, wée néede
not much to meruaile if our iudgement wauer, ſéeing it
hapneth in all other humaine actions, which I thinke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedes
by the great prouidence of God (yea euen in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our preſent queſtion) bycauſe ſuch women as of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
are eſtéemed fowle, ſéeme ſufficiently fayre to others,
as not to be wholy abandoned being as neceſſarie for the
encreaſe of the worlde, as thoſe that ſtande in a greater
eſtimation of beautie: And yet we muſt thinke that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this opinion loue makes himſelfe common with
all other thinges of the worlde, yet he containes a certaine
nature in himſelfe, by which he is made altogither heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For except this generall league of pollicie, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedes
of the vnitie of our heartes (whereof I will not now
ſpeake) I haue alwaies learned of ſuche as imagined the
heauenlie felicitie, that the contentment that moſt wée
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:22781:63"/>
founde in this ſupernall region, is a perpetuall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this deuine eſſence, which makes vs forget our
ſelues: wherein albeit I ought not to applie ſo high a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
to the ſubiect we ſpeake of, yet if we be ſuffred to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
in our heartes an ymage of that diuinitie, I may well
ſay, that the impreſſion we haue of the formes and figures
of our Ladies, doth ſo rauiſhe vs in them, that by them
we doe not onely holde all the ioyes of the worlde as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie,
but alſo they take from vs the knowledge of the
very cauſe why we loue, as being rapt in woonder in them,
euen as by a dilligent beholding the ſunne, we loaſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
light of our owne eyes: I conſent to all you ſaye
(ſayth <hi>Glaphyro</hi>) confeſſing withall, that as by the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
of our ſences, it is not lawfull for vs to flie or aſpire
to this truth, ſo I beléeue alſo that it is the onelye cauſe of
the diuerſitie of lawes altogither contrarie in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And yet you cannot denie to me, that in the queſtion
of beautie, there be not thinges, which by common conſent
of the worlde, are not allowed moſt fayre: as who in a ſelfe
obſtinate fancie will giue vnto the crooked and wrinckled a
more ſingularity in beautie, then thoſe whome nature hath
created vpright and perfite hath (in mine opinion) no leſſe
mayme in his ſight, then imperfection of reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I ſpeake not of monſters (ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) but of
thinges common and indifferent: for ſéeing nature hath
created vs all vpright, I will not entangle our queſtion
with ſuche ſort of people as you ſpeake of, affirming that
in what proportion ſo euer we are framed, if we procure to
our ſelues no other defect of members then according to
Gods generall diſtribution, we are a ſubſtaunce ſufficient
ynough to be beloued: Bicauſe all other accidents happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
appeare not to vs, eyther fayre or foule, but according
to the diuerſitie of our humours which leade vs to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
yea, we perſwade often times a thing to ſéeme fayre
in ſome ſeaſon which in an other appeares foule and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:
<pb facs="tcp:22781:64"/>
So that <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> if this generalitie vary
according to the diuerſitie of tymes, let vs not thinke
ſtraunge if our mindes (in the ſame reſpect) differ perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly:
wherin touching women on whome your late ſpéech
did runne, I can hardelye beléeue, that in this varietie of
opinions, they finde not ſome friende in affection, albeit not
ſo commonly as others, bicauſe they are further eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from our common nature: herein you are both decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
(ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) for nature neuer created thing ſo
rare, but for admiration: And albeit (in regarde of their
bodies, ſuche women are not ſo generally delitefull to vs,
yet they haue alwayes a helpe of the minde to ſatiſfie that
default: for God was neuer ſo niggardly bent to any, but if
he rayſed an imperfite bodye, he ſupplied it with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
excellencie of minde: as in the nature of inſenſible
thinges, we haue an example of the Vine, who albeit
ſeemes moſt crooked and counterfeyt of all other ſortes of
woode, yet he contaynes euen in his ſuccéeding effectes the
ſpirite and minde of vs men: This is ſomewhat to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

wherein all this afternoone you haue taken your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
pleaſure: beſéehing you all my Gentlemen and
déere friendes, to ſuffer this laſt ſpéeche of <hi>Phylopolo</hi> to
cloaſe vp our long queſtion of loue, wherein <hi>Monophylo</hi>
ſéemes to chalenge a ſinguler triumph: who leaſt he ſhould
ouer wéene in himſelfe, I thinke it is not impertinent ſo to
moderate the ſtate of his proſperitie, as by our meane, hée
hoyſe not ſayle aboue our power, to embaſe it by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
wherein I holde opinion with an auncient Capitaine
of Athens, who being aſked, if he tooke not pleaſure to
learne the art of memorie: no rather (ſayth he) I delight
in the art of forgetfulneſſe, bicauſe (in his iudgement) hée
preſerued well all thinges in his minde, which (being lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22781:64"/>
he forgat not: But aboue all, if a thing once engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in vs, cannot be defaced without great paine, loue only
once rooted in our heartes, is moſt hardly, yea impoſſible,
drawne from vs by any humaine art or pollyſie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I holde it no leſſe neceſſarie to learne the meanes to
eſchewe ſuch a place, then profitable to knowe the cauſes
for the which we enter into it: A ſmall perſwation (Madam
ſayth <hi>Glaphyro</hi>) woulde drawe me to your opinion, but
let vs take héede leaſt offering to make a roade or inuaſion
vpon loue, the night charge vs not behinde, whoſe darcke
miniſters may doe vs more harme, than any way we can
gréeue him, vpon whome we haue made this warre, and
therefore (Madam) as the preſent ſeaſon requireth, it were
better to make a ſafe retraict, than a perilous follye, vnder
this charge notwithſtanding, if the companie ſo like, to
renewe this warre the next morning, when I doubt not
the pleaſaunt dewe, as the teares of <hi>Iupiter</hi> diſtilled will
no leſſe delight vs, than the Sunne hath ſpecially fauoured
our exerciſe this afternoone: And ſo this little band of amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſouldiours fearing the ſwift approche of the night,
and finding withall a neceſſarie appetite to reléeue theyr
bodies, aſwell as their mindes were delighted with
pleaſaunt diſcourſe, approoued the counſayle of
<hi>Glaphyro</hi> and alſo his condicion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

familiar with the Fathers of olde time, who, by
how much they repoſed a dignitie in their workes,
by ſo much were they curious to chooſe patrons of

Metamorphoſis, and all thoſe great perſonages eftſoones

the trauell of writers is a monument of perpetuitie,
and the indeuour of the penne preſerues memorie aboue

ſoule, and giues ayde to the frayle infirmities of the

ſuch ſucceſſe and ſequelle to our preſent procéedings, that
albeit, it import ſome ſiniſter aduauntage to vs, yet it maye

that if they grudged in the matter of the former exerciſes,

argued according to the ſuggeſtion of his thought: But for

the maieſtie of that little God whoſe ſlaue I am, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
contrarie to my opinion of him, as being for this

plot of my determination: wherein as I maye reſemble
thoſe good and auncient inſtructors, who leading vs by their
diuine exhortacions to the contempt of honour, prepare to
themſelues a readie pathwaye to an immortall glorie. So
ſeeking to mortifie in others by the ſpeache and diſcourſe
of our foure Champions, the true rootes of loue, I ſhall kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the ſparkes more and more in my ſelfe, and with the
Salymander bathe my limmes in the flames of hote affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
aduertiſing you notwithſtanding (Madam) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they conſpired not onely the ouerthrow of loue, but alſo
to reuerſe me altogither, yet (ſuche is Gods ordinaunce)
that there is infirmitie in their pretence, and their wicked
will without force, as profeſſing if you looke into their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges)
rather wordes of threates, than matter of effect: ſo
that I dare promiſe in my ſelfe that loue hath the leaſt
cauſe to be offended: Aſſuring you for ende, that according

giue him the honour of this dayes exerciſe with this

of my familier conuerſation in this ſolitarie place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the beſt warraunt hée can giue to aſſure his behauiour,
wherein as we proteſt innocencye in thought and act, ſo
our hope is, you will not defile your diſcreſſion with anye
corrupt iudgement, as to note vs inciuill in that, wherein
if wée ſéemed inſufficient in duetie, yet not vnreadie in good

your opinion to enter ſocietie with vs ſhall not loſe hir ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
which I beſéech you let leade you in ſuche iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

honour towardes you, wherein it maye pleaſe you eftſoons
to ſettle vnder the fayth and promiſe of thoſe to whome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more déere then to doe you duetie and ſeruice: I
accept your condicions (ſayth the Ladie) and beléeue your
promiſe, albeit I coulde not otherwaies ſaye of <hi>Phylopolo</hi>
then I both finde and proue, which I entreated him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare,
leaſt he kindled occaſion of complaint, and to holde

cuſtome hath giuen a grace and name of modeſtie to
others, though you make me guiltie in rude behauiour:
And if the exerciſe of yeſterdaye was wholye conſecrated
to the commemoration of loue, what newe offence can be
enforced if you &amp; I dreſſe a ſacrifice to him by a reciprocall
pleaſure one of an other by which ſhoulde be made perfect
the dedication of this place: which laſt wordes he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

bringes occaſion to eſchewe their ſocietie, or at leaſt

to labour to auoyde it: and yet I dare not bring, Madam
<hi>Chariclea,</hi> within the compaſſe of that condicion: whether
ſhée be or not (ſayth the Ladie) I accompt you without
commiſſion to enquire, and my ſelfe without reaſon to yeld
your reckoning: And yet I hope you wil not note it ſtrange
in mée, if (according to the care I haue ouer the ſtate of
poore louers, the ſame concurring with the nature of our
preſent exerciſe) I vſe the compaſſion of my ſexe and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
to wiſhe them rather a plawſible libertie, then this
darcke and hydeous priſon, wherin I ſée them ſo martired:
not that I chalenge any propertie in theſe ſpéeches or that
ſuch matters reſemble me aboue the reaſt (as you thinke)
But becauſe I haue dwelt alwayes in this minde, that
notwithſtanding the pleaſures diſtending with loue, is
great in the higheſt degrée, in reſpect of other felicities, yea
&amp; without compariſon: yet, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience it comes
not néere the leaſt part of the ſorrowes &amp; tormentes, which
of it are nouzled and trayned, as a thouſand ſuſpicions, ten
thouſand ielowſies, with infinite diſtempered feares (the
proper ſubſtitutes of loue) with whome (as raine in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
wind) is brought ſuch paſſions &amp; panges, that to a man
of ſounde iudgement there ſéemes no difference betwéene
the laborinth of this endeleſſe traueyle, and the infernall
gulphe which continually caſtes vp nothing but loathſome
vapors and flames of ſulphur. For my part, I neuer knew
louer fauored with anye hower or moment of happye time
which he bought not both before and after the act, at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
price and vſurie. For before he trauelles in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
with incertaintie of ſucceſſe, as being not yet
come to the aſſurance of his vnbrideled affections: and
after hauing got with charge, that which he kéepes with
care, he lyues in feare to loaſe what he hardelye holdeth:
in déede the perfite louer, who ſtandes aſſured in his felicity,
liues without the compaſſe of thoſe doubtes: But whome
maye we tearme this aſſured louer, yea, who can giue
<pb facs="tcp:22781:69"/>
vnto himſelfe, ſuch certaine warraunt of the will of his
Ladie, as of his owne fayth and conſtancie: I ſpare here
to aleage vnto you the ſpeeche of the people, which (for the

               </gap>e ought to ſatiſfie: For if
ſuch be the malice of the worlde now a dayes, as a ſimple
conuerſation of a young man and a woman, doth drawe
people into opinion and ſuſpicion, what trauell of minde,
and inconuenience of pollicie is he tyed vnto, who being
vowed to a myſtreſſe, muſt both ſupplye hir will, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie
the popular ſpéeches, ſéeing the nature of loue making
men properly ſilent and ſorrowfull, ſerues here as a proper
trumpet to diſcouer their paſſions: What make you heare
alſo of a ſharpe repulſe, after a long ſute, yea, how diſgeſt
you a falſe reporte, whether of ſpite touching your ſelfe to
your myſtreſſe, or of diſdaine of hir to your ſelfe: Suer
thoſe pilles and ague fittes are of more bitter qualities,
then all the pleaſures that can be ymagined in loue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
felicitie, and albeit the ioyes be great in number,
and pleaſaunt in condicion, yet are they not without their
continuall propertie of fretting melancholie. I coulde here
enlarge further in the ordinarie accidentes in loue (whoſe
number is no leſſe infinite, then their qualitie intollerable)
and theyr actions moſt true in example, were not I ſhoulde
doe wrong to the experience of your other Gentlemen,
whoſe practiſe proues you in thoſe affaires déepe iudgement
onely in my knowledge I neuer ſawe or knewe any one
truely tranſfigured into the ſtate of a perfite louer, on
whome (notwithſtanding he had poſſeſſed the actuall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in loue) did not attende inwarde perplexities, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
diſquietneſſe, confuſed counſayles and careleſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
broken ſpéeche and vnſounde iudgements, yea,
ſuche a generall necligence in all his actes and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of lyfe, that in a due conſideration of the effectes of loue
in his example, it may be eaſily diſcerned that there is more
gall than honye, leſſe pleaſure then payne, farre more care
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22781:69"/>
care than commoditie, and more want of courage, than
any true commendation of a noble minde. You are not
far from the truth ſayth <hi>Glaphyro,</hi> and for that ſelfe cauſe
certaine auncient Philoſophers fayned loue to be borne of
<hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Penius,</hi> as making him the ſonne of aboundance
and penurie, to figure vnto vs, that louers, in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
contentment, are notwithſtanding miſerable, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
inſatiable luſt: yea euen he that poſſeſſeth, is neuer
abſolutely contented, and that was the cauſe aunſwered
the Ladie, why I woulde wiſhe this louer to finde ſome
iſſue in loue, if it were to be founde. Here <hi>Monophylo</hi>

I meruell that by the ſame meane you deſire not
that children ſhoulde not be borne, ſéeing the more wée loue
and eſtéeme them aboue others, ſo much the more doe they
bring vnto vs care and gréefe: doe we not feare, deſier,
hope, and trauell our bodies and mindes for their ſakes:
wée deſire to ſée them great, as then to become the ſtaye
and comfort of our old age, wherein wee employe no
<pb facs="tcp:22781:70"/>
ſmall diligence: wée feare their venterous youth, as not
to fall into daunger of body or infection of minde by lewde
conuerſation, and for that cauſe we prouide tutors to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
their raſhneſſe: ſuche is our torment and care of
minde for them, that wée euen féele the diſpleaſures they
ſuffer, and endure a ſhare in their woes and miſeries: yea
if wée waighe in euen ballaunce the gréeues diſtending
with ſuch as we bring into this worlde, with the pleaſures
wée receyue by them, we ſhall hardelie iudge the difference
and yet ſuch is the vehement nature of our affection, as it
makes vs forget the ſorrow and trouble whereof they are
the cauſe: it is impoſſible that in matters by which wée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
extreame contentment, that ſometimes alſo they
turne vs not to heauie gréeues and annoyes: what one
thing in the worlde doth more neceſſarilye delight vs then
the fier, and yet by it wée ſée ſtately cities and pallaces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed
and conſumed: who denies water to be moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the neceſſitye of man, and yet it is the element in
which much people periſh, and great treaſure is deuoured.
So that notwithſtanding the perillous accidentes happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by theſe two elementes, yet to hinder or take awaye
their vſe, were to driue nature from hir courſe, and confuſe
the thinges of the worlde: euen ſo is it of loue, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
you wiſh vs to leaue for certaine light inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
accompanying him by circumſtaunce, and nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſoueraigne benifits which ſecretly lie ſhrowded
and hidde within him, wherein to offer you familiaritie of
experience, why wiſhe you not in like ſort, that wée were
not borne at all, ſéeing that as béeing once entred into this
worlde, our conuerſation runnes vnder infinite and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
miſeries: euen ſo our deſtinie caries this condicion
that the higher we are rayſed into degrées of felicitie, the
redilier we encline to reuolution, and féele with more
gréefe the pinching ſtinges of diſpleaſure: which (Madame)
me thinkes might drawe you to a fauourable conſideration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22781:70"/>
of loue, by whome if ſometimes wée are lifted into actes of
high and perfit pleaſure, it is not out of reaſon if at other
ſeaſons he leade vs in effectes of more harde and ſtraunge
nature ſéeing that if at one time the pleaſure ſhould be litle
euen ſo at an other ſeaſon, the diſpleaſure coulde not but be
leſſe, for ſo hath God vnited and payſed the one with the
other, as to bridle our preſumption in vaunting to be happy
on all ſides, and therefore he doth drawe ouer our calme of
pleaſure and felicitie, a darcke clowde of gréefe &amp; calamitie:
and yet our voluble pleaſure is farre more great without
compariſon (in the reſpect of our preſent controuerſie) then
the inwarde gréeues which wée féele: for where the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
teares, the ſtrayned ſighes, the broken ſorowes, which
oftentimes wée poure out in loue, are not enforced by other
occaſion or meane, then as perticipating of our mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſubiect to all infirmitie and miſerie: the pleaſures, on the
other ſide which like ſwéete honye diſtilles by his ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
laye vs in reſemblaunce with Aungelles, as though
in that contemplacion, we imparted with the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
powers, and to vſe a direct truth, loue would eſtabliſh vs
(as it were) in a perfite felicitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, were not that his
pleaſaunt mocions be ſometimes mingled with certaine
light diſquietes: Wherein maye be diſcouered a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God, who (to laye afore vs our humanitie) hath
tempered our delightes with pilles of ſorowe, and prouided
our riuer of tranſitorie ioye to runne in a ſtreame of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe
and gréefe: not that thoſe ſmall accurrauntes ſhould
challenge ſuch authoritie and force as, for them, it ſhoulde
bée néedefull to deueſt our ſelues of ſo great beatitude:
But it behooues, amid ſuch diſtreſſes, to prooue the heart of
a true and loyall louer, euen as golde is tryed in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
ſéeing that to whome ſo euer liuing continually nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in pleaſures, ſuche as eyther he woulde haue or can
wiſh for, without proofe of diſpleaſure or gréefe, it is a hard
experience to haue a true taſte of the ſwéete fruite which
<pb facs="tcp:22781:71"/>
the gardaine of ſuch delightes doth yéelde: yea it ſtandes
not with incongruent neceſſitie (to make his taſte and
iudgement more perfite) to entangle his pleaſures with
ſome eaſie and light annoyes, like as to giue a good ſeaſon
to meate, is required not onely ſugar and ſwéete thinges,
but alſo ſome ſharpe ſpices (of qualitie, to be hardelye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted)
which applyed and tempered with other drugges,
doe giue a good and perfite taſte to that which otherwayes
woulde carrie no ſeaſon at all: Ah <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi>
ſayth the Ladie, ſuche is your force in ſpéeche and reaſons
to perſwade, that I could euen ſettle in your opinion, were
it not that for you alone ouer whome a voluntarie force
holdes the heauie yoake of loue, there may be founde thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes
and ten thouſandes, who bitterlye doe waſhe their
mouthes in curſes and complaintes, againſt the daye and
hower wherein they tooke firſt footing in that miſerable
pryſon: yea, ſuch is eyther theyr naturall blindeneſſe, or
prouidence of deſtinie, that albeit they beholde their owne
ſpoyle and ruine, yet the miſſery of their thrall eſtate holdes
ſo ſtrayght a hande vpon them, that neyther force nor pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
can delyuer them, euen like vnto the Déere entangled
in nettes, who the more he ſtriues, the faſter contendes he
againſt his deliuerie: Why hath nature then, ſayth <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo</hi>
(who valued louers with brute beaſtes) indued
man with a ſoule of reaſon, as to deuide him from beaſtlye
creatures, if he loaſing the cuſtome of reaſon, enter wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
into a place, which afterwardes (without hys great
confuſion) he cannot eſchewe: the ſame reſembling the
condicion of the ſillie birde (albeit more excuſable) to whom
onelie belonges to complaine of nature as taking from hir
all knowledge to reſiſt the ſwéete charme of the fowler, by
whome if ſhée eſcape death, ſhée is ſuer at leaſt of captiuity:
where man drawing to himſelfe, hys ſelfe deſtruction,
without other power of remedy then to late a repentaunce
wherein I praye you, is he to be deuided from other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

but only in the outward eface vnder the which hée
couereth his great beaſtelineſſe: What ſyr aunſwereth
<hi>Charyclea,</hi> who here though good to cut of his ielouſe ſpéech
wiſhed him not to preſume ſo far of his owne felicitie, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had neyther pollicie nor ſpeciall prerogatiue aboue
others to auoyde the miſterie if the miſchiefe fell vpon him:
For ſayth ſhée, euen as the experience is common that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Marinors vndertaking a long voyage, commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the ſea vnder a ſhowe of fayre weather, ſmiling
at the firſt vpon them, albeit their hope being turned to
heauineſſe, they ſtande at laſt ſo déepe in the daunger of
the tempeſt, that (notwithſtanding their indeuours) they
are enforced to abandon their ſhippe to the mercie of the
waues, without meane of remedie: euen ſo ſtandes it with
our louer, who oftentimes indiſcréetlye, yea, when hée
thinkes to ſléepe in moſt ſafetie, ſlippes into the charme of
the intiſing eyes of ſome Ladie, who leades him with great
delyght into this huge ſea of loue, where in the ende hée
takes a miſerable comfort in to late a repentaunce: oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
mariner ſo long as he ſayled vnder a fauorable clymat,
oh thriſe happie louer, vntill his ſonne diſguiſed his light:
But oh wretched condicion of both the one and other when
a contrarie winde and common deſtinie caſtes them vpon
the ſandes of <hi>Charibde</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> monſtrus women (with
the Poetes) whoſe cuſtome is to chaunge into forme of
beaſtes, all ſuche as vnhappily rub vpon their ſhoare, when
the poore louer finds his pleaſure tranſlated into a qualitie
of bitterneſſe, and his hope ſo turned into diſpayre, that he
hath no other refuge then in death, and yet in him he harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
findes medicine, what thinke you then of the authoritie
of loue whoſe ſwéete baytes as they are ſwallowed vp euen
by the moſt wiſe and ſubtill that bée: ſo he hath alſo a ſecond
power, that hauing once made himſelfe Lorde ouer vs, hée
takes from vs all knowledge both of himſelfe and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
bathing vs (as it were) in a conſuming flame, farre
<pb facs="tcp:22781:72"/>
leſſe quencheable than the continuall fire of the hill of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylie,</hi>
yea, ſuch is the vertue of this indiſſoluble knot of
perfect loue, that it is without power or meane to vs morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
and that which worſe is, it hapneth in often experience,
that ſome man labouring long in an amorous traine with
a Ladie, and ſhée perhappes no leſſe touched with the moci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and paſſions of loue than hée, yet in a neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to hir honour, ſhée is driuen to aunſwere his deſire
with modeſtie, and dare not aduenture to bée thankfull to
his demaunde: I praye you iudge by your ſelfe (if his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
pretende altogither to poſſeſſe:) the condicion of this
louer and the languiſhing panges that long ſute ſturres
vp: yea, what medicine woulde you applye to his diſeaſe?
I would not that for my repulſe he ſhoulde alter the nature
of his affection to his Ladye, and much leſſe be necligent in
his meanes of obedience and humilitie: But let vs finde
out ſome happie operation or droage, by which wée maye
helpe to qualifie his paſſions, and yet not diſcontinue his
loue: for ſo ſhal we make liuely in him the pleaſures which
by ymagination he ſhall conceyue of his miſtreſſe, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
choake vp thoſe ſorrowes which elſe woulde deuoure
him with infinite deathes. Your diſcourſe (quod I) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
matter of to high condicion, as to demaunde a thing
that is not to be done, which is to loue without paſſion: and
it is as eaſie to drawe out of the foure elementes that
<hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> from whence the Philoſophers deriue the
originall of our ſoules, as to hope to ſatiſfie in anye one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
your preſent deſire, which albeit I cannot but eſtéeme
of high merite, as procéeding from a minde ſo well affected
to the miſerable eſtate of louers: yet in all reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
I cannot holde it leſſe impoſſible that loue ſhoulde
be without paſſion, then a man without a ſoule, the Sunne
without light, fire without heate, and water without moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
which thinges as they are ſo naturall and proper,
as without them neyther man, Sunne, fire, or water,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22781:72"/>
can be in their perticuler: euen ſo if you leade loue in hys
true degrée, you ſhall neuer ſée him marche without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as his familiar ſubſtitutes and companions: In which
reſpect me thinkes it were matter much impertinent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
vpon a forme in our mindes, which neyther hath bene
nor can be: onlye let vs applie our ſpéeche to things not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
leaſt with the loſſe of time, our exerciſe alſo bring
forth nothing but vanitie: And touching your opinion that
a woman making an eſtate to loue, and yet will maintaine
hir honoure (or at leaſt that which ſhée eſtéemes hir honour)
although in ſuch a caſe it woulde bée harde that loue ſhould
euer bring forth his full and abſolute effect: yet in ſuche
proofe I wiſh the example of the amorous Poet might bée
remembred, that for two, thrée, or manye repulſes, hée
muſt not thinke himſelfe denied, but turning modeſtie into
importunitie, ſolicite his Ladie with encreaſe of dilligence
and meanes: who albeit at the firſt (vnder a light feare to
make a wounde in hir honour) ſtandes doubtfull to bequeth
hir ſelfe to our mercie: yet doubt you not but ſhée trauelleth
inwardely in a ſinguler felicitie and ioye of minde, to ſée
hir ſelfe ſued and required of him whome ſhée honoureth
moſt, and ſpecially in a thing which ſhée woulde chiefelie
deſire, were it not for that ſtrong bulwarke and rampire
of ſhamefeſtneſſe, which notwithſtanding is not ſo defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
but béeing battered it may at the laſt become vincible
by vehemencie of loue to whoſe power all worldlye forces
are but weake: herein alſo, reaſon ſtandes moſt peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
(ſpeciallye in the preſent caſe that mooueth) bicauſe
this honour conſiſtes not but in the opinion of men, &amp; loue
is drawne altogither out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regiſters of nature, by whom
we are induced to it: wherein bicauſe you ſhall not iudge
ſtraungely of my opinion, I make you this reſemblaunce:
if our enimies become affable by our humilitie, yea if brute
beaſtes voyde of reſonable conſideration, be drawne to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
tameneſſe, by our ſofte ſtrokings and alluerments,
<pb facs="tcp:22781:73"/>
I praye you what belonges to him in duetie, which holdes
vs in déere regard, which cheriſheth vs, &amp; who loues vs no
leſſe then himſelfe: doe you thinke a woman is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to loue aſmuch or more than a man? yea, euen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
vpon thinges which are expreſlye forbidden hir:
did not <hi>Byblys</hi> loue hir brother, <hi>Mirrha</hi> hir father, and
poore <hi>Paſiphae</hi> was ſhée not rauiſhed in luſt with a Bull?
And yet I thinke it was neuer harde that a woman (what
paſſion of loue ſo euer poſſeſſed hir) aduentured to ſolicite
or require, but being gouerned with a certaine ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
woulde not ſo muche as be required, and yet being
required woulde make no doubt to conſent: and therefore
I haue hearde it often ſpoken of people well experienced in
thoſe exerciſes, that the beſt is to bée ſparing in requiring,
but in requiring, to vſe ſuch an honeſt boldneſſe to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the ſpiritualtie, and lawyers ſpecially in theſe affayres
wherein the ſpéeche, how couertly ſo euer it runne, is farre
more ſhamefaſte and harde to diſgeſt then the effect: the
ſame in my opinion being the onelye meane to come to the
full of their purpoſe, which being well practiſed, is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
without his deſired fruite: ſéeing (with reuerence I
ſpeake it) the number is verie ſmall (and they borne vnder
an vnhappie ſtarre) whoſe loue in the ende hath not happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ſuccéeded. Here <hi>Phylopolo</hi> obſeruing his oportunitye
to moleſt women, allowing his reaſons, began in ſpéeche
to iuſtifie them further: for (ſayth hée) if women were as
haggardlike as they ſéeme, and as manye poore fondelinges
in loue, full ſimplie doe beléeue, their pompe and vanitie
woulde be leſſe in attire, and themſelues not ſo Popingaye
like in conuerſation, as now a dayes we ſée them: For

it is written that the good Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>

a more fitte ſeaſon to warne hir, whome when hée
founde an other time in habit more ſimple and conuenient
(as he thought) for the condicion of women: oh (ſayth hée)
how far more ſeemelye is this attire for the daughter of
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> then that which ſhée ware the other daye to the

ſhew howe wrongfully women are charged with theyr
ſumptuous attire, when both their eſtate requires it, and
their huſbandes conſent to it: For to that, ought they to
apply their fancie, &amp; not to delight the eies of ſtraungers, to

the ſame reaſon) to wynne a contented huſbande: ſeing
that ſo precious a vertue is chaſtitie, eyther in mayde or
maryed wife, that it is as eaſily defyled in garmentes,
thought, and the eyes, as in the act: For if ſhe reapoſe in
hir attire ſuch a ſpeciall bayte to allure a huſbande, ſhe may
on the otherſide accompt hir ſelfe ſo much leſſe lykely or
worthye, as he ſéeth hir vanitie and voyde of true argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of chaſtitie: what néede we anye more diſguiſe or
ſuſpende our purpoſe, ſeing ſuch ſpiced follies were neuer
inuented, but to aduaunce the laſt act in loue: For, to God
hath bene alwaies more acceptable a woman in hir ſimple
modeſtie, or modeſt ſimplicitie, then being imboaſt with
ſuch curious inſolencie, which we reade hath bene paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
forbidden to the wiſe matrones in Rome, as the onely
encomber of their common welth, as fell out in example
when by little and little it gat footing amongſt them: great
is the follie of that huſbande (if we may touch the maried
eſtate) who not content with that bewtie which nature
hath giuen his wyfe, will ſet a newe forme vppon hir to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
himſelfe, and make hir deſired of others: if ſhe be
fayre, may not hir naturall bewtie content him: if ſhe be
fowle or deformed, forbeare to reſiſt the will of God, in
ſéeking to ſuborne in hir an other forme then according to
hir firſt creation, leaſt in gyuing an edge to the tongues of
the multitude, he be alſo ſubiect to the common deſtinie of
the maried ſort: by this he helpes forward the rumours of

the people, to whome euerie light occaſion is matter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſet abroche their veſſels of infamous ſpéeche: yea,
by this, the euill ſort will take ready cauſe to make court to
his wyfe, in whome pyed attyre is like a marke in the

in peculiar, ought not to concerne others in common
talke, the rather if to him onely belong the vſe and benefite
of the bewtie of his wife (how excellent or imperfect ſoeuer
it be) what néede he to blaſe it, and ſo bring it into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre
of the worlde, whoſe nature is daungerous to allure:
ſuch lipſubtill people I maye laye in compariſon with that
auncient <hi>Candaules,</hi> who leſſe prouident then was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
and more arrogant in the bewtie of his wife, then

But what, ſuch people are not perhappes to be reſembled

ſeing of the contrarie, thoſe that I ſpeake of, more happie
then wiſe, receyue vpon credite a thouſand fauors for their

they beſmeare with all painted brauerie: A thing ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God, and abhominable in reaſon, that who ſuffreth
<pb facs="tcp:22781:77"/>
it merites euen with beaſtes: But whye ſtande I ſo long
vppon this matter, which is ſo conuenient for vs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
to huſbandes: let them féede and flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with ſo fonde ſuffraunce, and we in the meane while
as errant knightes, will trauayle in the conqueſts of their

ſumptuous pompes were fyrſt drawne into vſe, were a
faith without a reaſon: But to holde them inuented onely
as a viſor to couer their wantonneſſe, is no leſſe lykely in

how farre I differ from you) that leſſe is the wydowe to be

blynded him in manye reſpectes to hys wyfe, which
lye naked to the worlde, whoſe propertie is to vſe the eyes

eyther to ſpeake, or execute, fauour not ſo familiarly
the maried women, as the wydowes, who depend not but

to loue (as well for the oportunitie, as in a naturall heate
and forwardneſſe, to that buſineſſe, whereof the mayde
hath made no proofe, and the maried wyfe fyndes ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction
with hir huſbande) it is alſo more conuenient for
them to vſe garmentes neceſſary for loue, then the other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22781:77"/>
two: Here the Ladie ſuffring with a modeſt impacience
this chalenge of their prerogatiue in attyre, tolde him
that his reaſons might fynde place in ſuch as woulde agree
that this curioſitie of attire was inuented as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or occaſion to loue, the ſame beyng neyther indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in truth, nor likely in reſemblance, as being a weake
grounde in iudgement to reſolue vpon an inwarde effect by
an outwarde apparaunce of cauſe, ſeing (with the olde
prouerbe) as the feather makes not the byrde, ſo our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
ought not to be aſſured but vpon vertue: For as the
Frocke makes the Fryer neuer the more deuoute, but is
rather a ſigne of religion, then a proofe of hys holyneſſe:
ſo in the attyre of a woman lyeth no true argument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie,
and much leſſe ought hir garmentes to bréede
any opinion of lewde lyfe: And albeit they are matters apt
to wher the ſuſpicions of the worlde, yet our conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſpéeches, then that they are rather of cuſtome then of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite:
Beſides (ſuch is the bable of the enimyes to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour)
if a Ladie ſhould attyre hir ſelfe contrarie to the

of the preſent faſhion, or at leaſt an hypocrite in hir
conuerſation: and no leſſe blame ſhoulde ſhe haue of the
multitude who amid ſo many pompes, would diſclaime the

the Courtier among a companie of ſeuere Noones: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
if all ſuch newfangled deuiſes carie a propertie of

ſuch authoritie, that they are as eaſilie diſgeſted as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

accorde, ſome vppon a lewde will, and others without

you knowe alſo how commonly it happeneth in our
worldly experience, that any thing howe good ſo euer it be,
yet if it be wreſted to euill, may be as eaſily faſhioned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
as to good, whereof the example is more then lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
euen in the goſpell, the which (with griefe I ſpeake
it) we wreſt and apply according to our wauering affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And ſo <hi>ſeigneur paſquyor,</hi> to cut of this waſpiſhe
and wearie diſcourſe, I praye you worke vs out of thys,
encombred laborinth, with a freſhe onſet of your fyrſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
leaſt with wandering in vnknowne wayes, we
loſe the lynes that ſhould leade vs to our fyrſt entry: Then
Madame (quoth I) my opinion holdes it impoſſible, that
a woman throughly touched with loue (notwithſtanding
all reſiſtaunce at fyrſt) be not brought at laſt to reaſon, and
made tractable to the will of hir friend, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
I wiſhe you to holde my iudgement imperfite, if
the loue be not reciprocall betwéene the two parties, as
we preſume: for if it ſhoulde want on eyther ſide, (a thing
likely to happen, eyther by a preuention of ſome other, or
by a diſconformitie in the perſons) there is no leſſe impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie
to plant affection there, then to kyndle a flame
where is no fyre: a ſentence notwithſtanding which I will
not iuſtifie to the death, ſeing I haue ſéene ere now moſt
ſtrong Caſtels (inuincible by imagination) brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
by time and pollicy: ſuch Ladies (ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>)
would I practiſe with the Engine of <hi>Phylip</hi> king of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
whoſe common ſaying was, when he came afore
any towne inaſſaultable by force, that if an Aſſe loaden
with Golde could enter, he and his armie woulde not be
kept out, as aduiſing vs thereby that what friendſhip or
force coulde not mollefie, might be made ſoft by money,
who gouerning the thinges of the worlde, doth alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
oure men: euen ſo I beléeue there are fewe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22781:78"/>
whoſe vertue are not vanquiſhed by this meane, and
in whome although loue can worke no power, yet money
(bearing the nature of the Adamant) is an inſtrument to
drawe them to the pleaſures of men: ah <hi>ſeigneur Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo</hi>
aunſwered I, how vnnaturall is ſuch pleaſure, whoſe
price and value being vyle in it ſelfe, the loue alſo is moſt
abhominable that runnes vnder ſuch hope, yea they are to
be condemned with the damnable pollicies of ſuch, who by
magicall brothes and drinkes, ſéeke to force the nature of
women, as a meane to induce them to loue: For loue,
reſting not but in the heart, of ſmall value is the vſe of the
body, where wantes the conſent of the minde: and as
what Ladye ſo euer bequeathes hir bodye to vſe vnder a
price and pretence of money, cannot merite better than
with a common ſtrumpet: So, of the contrarie, the honor
were greater in hir, not onely to withdrawe all affection
from ſuch a friende, but alſo to ſettle in hate agaynſt him,
as to holde hir in ſuch vile eſtimation, that rather money
then other merite had power to leade hir affection: yea,
this ought to ſtande in ſuch high conſideration with Ladies
as not once to fall into the thought of any noble mynde:
the ſame being the cauſe whye ſome making a queſtion,
whether it were better to offer loue to a gentlewoman or a
Marchaunts wife, maintaine that to the gentlewoman
belongs a more propertie to loue, as whoſe fancie is not
defiled with vile reſpect of money, nor hir pleaſure ſubiect
to other tribute then loue for loue: and yet I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
thoſe people of their errors, ſeing that as we ſée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
good &amp; high flying Hawkes of all ſortes of plumes,
ſo I haue heard that the effect of money is no leſſe hatefull
to many marchauntes wiues, then to moſt gentlewomen,
on whom in this caſe may be throwne a more ſuſpition, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their eſtate being great and of nature like to birdes
deſiring coſtly feathers, requires a highe proportion, and
continuall ſupply of money, where the condition of the
<pb facs="tcp:22781:79"/>
other being leſſe chargeable, hath alſo leſſe néede of reliefe,
and yet both liues and loues in no leſſe felicitie then the
gentlewoman: and yet for my part, I can not iudge ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of thoſe women (hauing their affections ſetled in
places worthie of them) to owe more delight to welth, then
deſyre to the perſons: And therfore to a man not being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
and yet continuing in his purpoſe to poſſeſſe hir
whome he purſueth, a moſt proper and fitte waye were,
(in my experience) to ſtande vpon encreaſe of merites,
and by his readie ſeruices, to declare the vehement nature
of his loue to his miſtreſſe, ſeing that nature teacheth vs,
to holde reckning of ſuch as be our well willers, as alſo to
be deſirous of reuenge againſt thoſe who prepare violence
againſt vs: yea, euen as God (faſhioning man of matter
more maſſye) indued him with a force, which the woman
doth want, ſo hauing framed the woman with a nature
more tender and ſubtill, hath made hir moſt familiar with
mercy and pittie: ah ſayth <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> how eyther you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
your experience, or are ignoraunt in the condition of
women, to whome in all other reſpectes, mercie and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
are moſt familier, but in this their tirannie excéedes
the naturall crueltie of beaſtes: yea, ſuch is the violence
of their ſpite, that with the <hi>Salymander,</hi> they ſéeme to
haue a felicitie in the torment of their ſeruauntes, whoſe
preſence they féede with a flattering hope, and in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
make a ſkoffe at their honeſt affection. This I ſpeake
not without cauſe, as being warranted by the maner of
many Ladies, who albeit haue their hartes ſetled in anye
one place, yet being courted by diuers honeſt gentlemen,
and deſirous (in a common humour) to be ſéene to haue
many ſeruaunts ſue to them (the ſame being in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
the chiefe teſtimonie of their bewtie) they will not ſtick
to imbrace euerye one with a perticuler affection, and that
with ſuch cunning, as the wiſeſt ſhall be ledde in a blinde
hope of their good willes: yea ſuch is the violence of this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22781:79"/>
cooſſenage in loue, that their louers falling from one hope
to an other, into infinite fancies, happen at laſt into miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
paſſions, eyther incurable in déede, or at leaſt of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
remedie, and yet <hi>ſeigneur paſquyer,</hi> if you thinke that
for all theſe extremities, ſuch women are drawne to anye
pittie, you are deceyued in their propertie, and the truth
not knowne to you, ſeing (with the Vipor) the more they
ſée you tormented for them, the heauyer martyrdome will
they heape vpon you, and yet neuer diſmiſſe you, but with
hope to returne: ſo that where deſtenie (or rather our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
folly) brings vpon vs this miſerie, let counſell bée
applyed afore ſuch paſſions take déepe continuaunce, ſeing
loue (with the propertie of the Mariegolde), who being
growne by the ſunne, diſcloſeth as the ſunne aſcendes into
degrées of heate: ſo our thoughts and cares doe more and
more increaſe, if at the fyrſt we reſiſt not loue, the originall
mouer of our diſquiet. And euen as a materiall fyre, if it
be not quenched in the beginning, vſeth his propertie to
encreaſe in ſuch daungerous flames, that euen riuers of
waters can not commaunde it, notwithſtanding in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
it might be put out without difficultie: euen ſo
if this naturall motion be not reſtrained in the beginning,
our ſuffraunce will turne to our ſmarte, and our ſelues
reſt miſerably ſubiect to his authoritie: And albeit by ſmall
coldes and ſlender froſtes we hope to deface him, as by
ieolouſies and other inconueniences in his behauiour, yet
in the ende we ſhall prooue (alas to late) thoſe flattering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
to bréede (with water ſprinckled vpon hote coales)
but a renuing of the fyre and flame of our loue. And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you ſhall not thinke my counſell to concerne onely
ſuch as finde not a reciprocall loue in their Ladyes, I wiſh
my aduiſe might warne all other in whome is pretence to
enter vnder the yoke of loue: bicauſe that if once they ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
downe his trayterous baytes, it ſhall be alway impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to diſcerne truely the loyall miſtris from hir that hath
<pb facs="tcp:22781:80"/>
no fayth, and that as well by a blindeneſſe in their owne
paſſions, as that they ſhall ſée moſt women diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in ſo manye ſortes, that they ſhall finde it harde to
diſcerne euen their colours: So that I holde &amp; mainteyne
him to be moſt wiſe, who, notwithſtanding he thinke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
ſome rewarde and hyer of his Ladye, eſtraungeth
himſelfe euen in the beginning, and not ſuffer his minde to
enter into captiuitie: wherein albeit this pleaſaunt vſe of
hir bodye be of ſuch ſwéete ſauor, as it may take from you
all taſt of my councell yet (beſides the many lamentable
paſſions in loue wiſely reuealed by the Ladye <hi>Chariclea</hi>)
make you no reckoning of a vaine loſſe of your time, a
contynuall traueyle of your body, an infinit care of minde
a deuouring charge and conſuming of your ſubſtaunce,
and laſtely, that to followe altogither the allurementes of
loue you muſt fall from all other exerciſes of vertue and
honeſt facultie: I accompt him happie, who poſſeſſeth in
loue. I holde him wiſe that moderates that vaine felicitie:
But I eſtéeme him moſt happie and wiſe, in whom though
loue bréede a fancie, yet he forſake him afore he enter into
his furie: And as certaine auncient Philoſophers helde him
moſt happie that neuer was borne, giuing a ſeconde felicity
to him that was formed impotent or deformed, ſo I laye
him amongſt the number of the happieſt who eſchewing al
occaſions forbeareth alſo the practiſe of loue, and I will
ymitate the other, who although he haue dipped his finger
in that vnſauory broth, yet, fearing to be altogither ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
draweth backe to his honour and profitte: And yet,
he that dare aduenture vnder the vayle of ſuch hope as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
pretende, I could better allow the gentleman to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
that trade, then ſuch who profeſſe the modeſt attire of
the longe gowne: not that I will derogate more the one
than the other, eſtéeming them both of one degrée, euerye
one in his qualitie: onlye me thinke the eſtate of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
(which is to follow armes) is more tollerable in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22781:80"/>
loue, then our frockemen, whoſe profeſſion lyeth chiefelye
in ſtudie, altogither vnfitte for loue: neyther can the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
ſo farre tranſgreſſe from any worthye enterpriſe,
as the other, ſéeing in him loue is oftentimes one ſpeciall
cauſe of courage, to attempt great thinges for the onelye
ſeruice and remembraunce of his Ladye, in whoſe reſpect
he laboreth in many worthy exerciſes altogither concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
armes, who ſéeme to take their originall mocion (or
at leaſt their greateſt encreaſe) in the opinion of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
in whoſe fauour we arme our ſelues for the iuſtes,
torneyes, and other actes of high actiuitie: ſo that it ſéemes
almoſt neceſſarie that ſuche ſortes of youth be ſprinckled
with the dew of loue, the better to prepare them to armes:
the ſame (in mine opinion) being the cauſe why the Poetes
aunciently painted out <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> vſing their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
togither, which hath bene eft repreſented vnto vs by
all the Romants eyther ſpaniſh or french: to ſuch kinde of
people then I will not much defende the practiſe of loue if
they liſt: but touching the others I hold it as inconuenient
for their trade, for the Merchaunt to confuſe his traffike
of forrayne wares with the ſtudye of Phiſicke: All of the
contrarie ſayth <hi>Phylopolo:</hi> For from what other cauſe
procéede the effectes of ſo many excellent wittes both of
auncient memorie, and preſent experience, yea, ſhyning
amongſt the other monumentes of the worlde, as the
Moone amid the ſtarres, but that they were kindled and ſet
on fire by this brande of loue whoſe drawing violence as
an adamant or loadeſtone, firſt entiſed the pen of <hi>Petrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,

perfection in their ſeueral phraſe &amp; methode of ſtile, hath
drawne vnto them a name of ymortalitie, &amp; tranſlated as it
were the gift and diſpoſition of poeſtye from ytaly (the late

wittes, what other meane hath rayſed them to the tip
or hygh ripeneſſe of perfection, but onely loue, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

if you take from men of ſtudie the practiſe of loue: it
were a doubtfull opinion, ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi> to holde that
thoſe kinde of men had ſypped on the cup of loue, ſeing, if
we may meaſure the diſpoſitions of others, by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fancyes, I thinke it woulde proue harde that a man
entangled in his ſnares, coulde at pleaſure diſcouer the
ſtate of ſo high a conceyte as the writinges of the Poetes
ſéeme to diſcloſe by figure: for as it is a true experience
that they onely commaunde their ſences moſt, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
bée fréeeſt, ſo there are none in whome libertie of
ſpéeche hath leſſe power, or the wittes furtheſt enſtranged
from their due office &amp; function, then where loue hath a ſole
ſoueraignetie and gouernement, the ſame being an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of opinion to me, that the better to aduaunce their
glorious excellencie in a ſubiect excéeding all conſideration
of manne, euerye one of thoſe voluble writers did faſhion
and chooſe a woman friende, as in whoſe prayſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
they rayſed ſo many excellent monumentes in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
if in ſuch reſpect onely (ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
theſe writers heaped ſuche famous exerciſes, mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
their wrong was no leſſe to the dignitie of their
learning, then their actions moſt intollerable in example,
ſéeing they might haue choſen many matters of much more
worthyneſſe, than to become vaine worſhippers of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie
ydols, as though their iudgementes were ſo baſe,
and their wittes ſo vilely inclined, as without the ſubiect of
women, they coulde bring foorth no ſubſtaunce of learning:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22781:81"/>
ah quod I, beware of haſtie iudgements, ſéeing wée maye
eaſelier ſlaunder their doings, than knowe their pretence.
For as wée haue reaſon to thinke that all theſe great loues
which in their young and gréene yeares they diſguiſed in
themſelues vnder the ſhadowe of poeie, doe promiſe more
waightye exerciſes as they riſe into more ripeneſſe of age,
ſo conſidering how all thinges haue their time, and euery

their rhymes according to the ſubiect reſembling
their preſent youth, they ſuborned certayne paſſions and
pangues, and ſawced their volumes with varieties of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
miſeries, the better to ſerue as a looking glaſſe for all
the worlde, as for ſuch as profeſſe loue to finde neceſſarie
rules for their inſtruction, &amp; to ſuch as hate him, to abhorre
hym more by their example, the ſame being ſo much the
more conuenient in them (as whoſe age is not prepared for
other ſtudies (as their indeuour brought foorth a fruite of
common commoditie. This ſpéech ſayth <hi>Glaphyro,</hi> is
impertinent to our preſent purpoſe, and yet, to whoſoeuer
woulde demaunde a reaſon of their writinges, I thinke
the Poetes would aunſwere, that it was the moſt highe
and excellent theame that coulde be deuiſed, bicauſe loue
hath alwayes caried ſuch ſoueraine power, that the higheſt
elementes that euer were, yea euen the auncient Gods
themſelues haue vouchſafed to be led in triumph vnder his
banner: And for my part, if they trauelled in thoſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as men in experienced in his authoritie, and but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
only to reueale the paſſions which he hiteth in himſelfe,
I eſtéeme them ſo muche the more worthy, as the matter
was haughty and harde (I meane to ſpeake ſo properlye
of loue hauing made no proofe of his nature) but if they
haue béene lymed with the fethers of his winges, &amp; prooued
the burthen of his power, it were not amiſſe, no leſſe for
the furtheraunce of their ſtudy, then to fauour their health
and quiet, that they reſigne their pretence, ſéeing it brings
<pb facs="tcp:22781:82"/>
ſuch daunger in practiſes wherein they haue this aſſured
and infallyble meane, if afore they loaſe the vſe of their
ſenſes, they perſwade no poſſibilitie to attaine to the end:
yea, albeit there be power to poſſeſſe, yet let them fixe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this as vpon the north ſtarre, that the pleaſaunt vſe
(being the ende and marke of all their pretence) is no other
thing then an opinion of pleaſure rayſed of an affection
which is borne more to one woman than an other: and
laſtelye that all women haue affinitie with the humors of
their firſt mother Eue, who was not without hir frayle
and ſlyding infirmities. I confeſſe that in this meane or
medicine is neyther ſuch facilitye nor conſtancie as maye
be deuiſed, bicauſe who hath once imprinted an opinion of
a woman in his conceyte, may aunſwere that he makes
no value or eſtimation to vſe or poſſeſſe, but onely bycauſe
of an affection which is extreme towards his miſtreſſe: yea,
if cauſes be indifferently meaſured, you ſhall finde no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
betwéene the pleaſure we receyue of a publike
woman to whome we beare but a vile and ſquirilous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in reſpect of the delight we féele in our peculiar friend:
ſo that the beſt aduiſe I can giue to hym that woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
loue, is to faſhion at the firſt a deſperate impoſſibility
to poſſeſſe, ſéeing that to warraunt vs from the paſſions,
amongſt which loue raignes, we haue a double medicine,
the one, if in beléeuing the ſuggeſtions of reaſon purelye
and ſimply wée doe ſupplant all affections leauing neyther
roote nor rynde in vs, the other, if when paſſions kindle and
preuaile ouer vs, we fight againſt our proper willes, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
a ciuill warre in our ſelues, vnder the leading of
reaſon, accompanied notwithſtanding with ſome contrary
paſſion: the firſt was familiar with <hi>Socrares,</hi> who (by a
deepe and heauenly Philoſophie) being armed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
contempt of all thinges, obſerued ſuch conſtancy
that neyther proſperitie coulde make him ſwell, nor aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitye
cauſe him to ſtoupe: This remedie ſéemes ſo muche
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22781:82"/>
the ſtraunger as our ſoule being compoſed of reaſon and
paſſion, our paſſions oftentimes doe carye awaye our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
And therefore we muſt with diligence reſort to the
ſeconde medicine: when reaſon (enuironed with paſſions,
and not able of hyr ſelfe to ſhifte them of, takes ayde of
a contrarye paſſion, which albeit of it ſelfe be not good, yet
enclyning in this hehalfe to reaſon, wyth ſeruiceable
duetie as to hir ſoueraigne myſtriſſe, can not be called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
bycauſe affections be not euill, but when againſt the
order of nature, they ſéeke to beare rule ouer reaſon: This
was the medicine which the Phyloſopher <hi>Carneadus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to our inſtructions, as aduiſing vs that amydde the
froth of our mortall delightes, we ſhoulde remember the
myſeries of the worlde, to the ende that brydeling by that
meane our vnbrydeled pleaſure, we maye temper the one
with the other: This was the wiſhe of <hi>Phylip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
who receyuing in one daye newes of the birth of
his mightie ſonne, and report of two victories obteyned to
his vſe, craued that Fortune would mixe his great felicity
with ſome ſharpe accident, leaſt his fleſhe vſed hir proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
the wiſe <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> notwithſtanding nature ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to delight ſingulerly in the lyfe of his childe, yet
his extreme ioy was ſo moderated with a continuall feare
of our common frayltie, that his death was not grieuous
when he remembred he had begot him in the ſtate of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</p>
            <p>Theſe two wayes in déede are no leſſe commendable for
their excellencie, then moſt conuenient to defende men
from ſuch ſortes of furies: And yet touching the firſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in other affections it may preuaile by a continuall
vſe and meditation, yet I ſtande in doubt to aſſure it anye
place in loue, for that he is a paſſion ſo ſubtill, that we ſée
him no ſooner enter into vs, then we haue aduertiſement
of him: yea euen <hi>Pallas</hi> the Goddeſſe of wiſedome fell
one day vpon a ſodaine into the nettes of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cupide</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22781:83"/>
choyce of place, we ſhall reliefe our griefe and releaſe the
bondes of our firſt ſorrowes: it may be this pollicie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pleaſaunt to <hi>Monophylo,</hi> whoſe reaſons yeſterdaye
conteyned matter of ymputation againſt ſuch as were
defyled in thought onely againſt their Ladies, but for my
part, much leſſe that I fynde cauſe of offence therin, ſeing
of the contrarie, (and yet I am not farre eſtraunged
from your opinion) I holde it the onely and readie meane
to loue well and perfitely: For if this loue as you ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
from a heauenly power, can you haue a better meane
to knowe hir, whome deſtenie and prouidence haue
prouided for you, then chaunging from one to another,
to fall at laſt vppon hir in whome your ſenſes doe ſettle
and your affections reſt ſatiſfied: Thys is a perſwaſion
amongſt the <hi>Genetliake</hi> Phyloſophers, that to knowe
the eſtate of our prouidence and followe our influence, is
required chaunge of habites, names, and diuers countries:
and their to pitche our ſtaye where we encounter our beſt
contentment, and not to be obſtinately bent to one place,
wherein if we looke to thriue we muſt reuerſe the reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heauens, who ſéeme to encline vs an other way:
And therefore <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo,</hi> it were an error in
all men of highe courage, ſo to encomber his minde with
peculier ſubiection, that he had rather moue hys owne
ſpoyle in the daylie purſute of a woman not predeſtinate
to him, then to ſearche his choyce ſeuerallye elſewhere,
whoſe fauours he ſhal obteyne at the firſt, bicauſe both lot
and deſtenie will incline to his affection: This diſcourſe of
<hi>Phylopolo</hi> enuironed with miſeries as to couer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion
which he vnderſtood better by effect then by ſpéech, ſetting al
the company on a pleaſant laughter, was ſodainely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Lady, who vnder a ſmooth anger told him he née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not adde an othe to make hir beléeue him, &amp; muche leſſe
that himſelfe was without experience of his owne remedie
in whome ſhée doubted not there was fulfilled a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22781:83"/>
warraunt and witneſſe than in any of the companie:
which he denied, aſſuring hir that he neuer embaſed hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo much as to become the ſeruaunt of one myſtreſſe
onely, eſtéeming it an act of great vnthankefulneſſe to all
the reſt of that ſex, for the reſpect of one onelye, to abandon
the loue of infinite others to whome perhappes is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
and dutie of obedience, then to hir in whoſe regarde
wée entangle our credit and conſume our goods and tyme:
all of the contrarie (aunſwered I) for ſinguler loue or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

a readie behauiour of generall curteſie to the reſt, where

where you ſhall finde the moſt perfect and loyall louers to

howe many men doe we ſée impotent in forme, of mettall

cuſtome nor example of wiſe conuerſation, can worke any
honeſt alurement to honour, yet loue, whoſe entiſements
are proper ſpurres to ciuilitie, hath ſo tranſnatured him as
if hée were caſt in a newe forme, by which meane he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
no leſſe ciuill in life and maners, then before he
excelled in dumpiſh and lyther diſpoſition, the ſame agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the common ſpéech and perſwacion of the people,
that to faſhion a yong man is neceſſarie to ſhrowde hym
vnder the winges of ſome Lady, of whome he is amorous
as a ſufficient meane to drawe him to honour and ciuilitie:
for ſuche is our common fault that being cladde with the
miſtie coulours of <hi>Philaſtie</hi> and ſelfe loue to our ſelues,
wée cannot enter into our owne errours, whereof as our
Ladies do giue vs often knowledge, ſo their warninges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

making their ſleight corrections of farre more authoritye
with vs than if wée had bene warned by any ſeuere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
in a pulpet: And albeit (loue being once as déepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſetled in the woman as in the man) it is not vnlikelye
that ſhée maye be no leſſe blinded in the manners of hir
friende, then himſelfe, and that (with the follye of parents
towards their children) for friendſhip ſake ſhe paſſe ouer
necligentlye his imperfections, yet the deſire we haue to
pleaſe the eye and iudgement of our Ladies, is alwayes a
quicke and cleare lantorne to leade vs to that behauiour of
honor which we ymagine woulde ſatiſfie them: And euen
as a good Captaine prepared to aſſault a towne, reapoſeth
not altogither in his people (who notwithſtanding are his
chiefeſt ſtaye and ſtrength) but neceſſarilye applieth the
cannon &amp; other engines of warre, euen ſo runneth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion
of the true louer, who pretending to batter the heart
of his Ladie, doth not onely prepare loue to vanquiſh and
poſſeſſe hir (which is the principall of all) but leades hir in
many exerciſes of ciuilitie and honour, as worthie pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecies
to prefere his enterboſe the ſame being the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that auncient Poet in his art of loue, who inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him whome he would haue to faine loue, giues alſo
ſtraight charge to him that loues indéede to vſe his aduiſe
without other art but ſuch as he learneth of loue onely,
who may ſerue vs ſufficiently as a Maſke or Viſor to play
ſuch a part: Theſe matters (ſayth <hi>Phylopolo</hi>) are no leſſe
ſtraunge to me in ſpéeche, then their ſence of harde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
wherein if I ſhoulde wade déeper, I ſhould
but heape confuſion and rather ſpeake by heart then by the
booke, as being altogither inexperienced that waye: But
bycauſe I gouerne not my ſelfe in theſe matters ſo much
by the booke, as by mine owne contemplation (and my
fancie is not without ſinguler pleaſure) I praye you tell
me what other ſigne or marke of curteſie can you diſcerne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22781:84"/>
in theſe madde louers then a moſt ſolitarie and continuall
care, a diſtraughting of the witte, a diſtemper of the
body, and laſtly a generall contempt of all other thinges
except hir to whome his thoughtes are addreſſed according
to the late inſtruction of <hi>Monophylo:</hi> So that <hi>ſeigneur
paſquier,</hi> you can hardly eſtabliſhe honeſtie in your louer,
who you ſée holdes the worlde in contempt, and all thinges
therein in hate, yea they are eyther ſo rauiſhed in paſſion,
or reſtrayned from reaſon, that with the contempt of the
worlde, I haue ſéene them beare ſuche hate euen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
that their Ladies haue loathed their condicion and
béene aſhamed of their follye: and being ſometimes rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by them for ſuch franticke behauiour, what was the
excuſe of theſe poore fooles, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing no power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
their onely felicitie depended vpon the preſence of

to haue ſpéeche with them, oh howe wylde are
they in countenaunce, howe vnquiet in minde, yea, their

ſome hurtfull ſpirite: and if they fall into the abſence of
their miſtris, you ſhall neuer ſée them ſettle in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

themſelues in their proper coulours: wherein ſeing I am

neceſſarie they make loue, neyther am I againſt <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyro,</hi>
aduiſing men of armes to doe the lyke to prepare
them the better to actions of vertue and honor: And for
myne owne part, I ſée no reaſon to reſtraine any degrée,
whether he be a rounde cap or a long gowne, ſeing that
albeit ſtudie is their principall profeſſion, yet the exerciſe
of curteſie can not be inconuenient to them, if neyther they
turne their ſwéete time into ſpoyle, nor their ſenſes into
ſubiection of the rage and follie of that imperious aungell
<hi>Cupide:</hi> by theſe obſeruations they maye eaſily attaine to
the ciuilitie requiſite in all Gentlemen, and by this meane
are they apte to bée acceptable not onelie to Ladies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to all other people of any qualyty: and to exchaunge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion
for fancye, or to runne ſo headlong in the humour
of their will, that they loaſe not onely the due knowledge
of others, but euen be blinde in themſelues, as we reade of
<hi>Salomon, Hercules,</hi> with many others of excellent wittes
ſo long as they ſtoode frée from this paſſion, but being once
embrued with it, their ſtate declyned, their condicion
chaunged, their fortune reuerſed, and laſtely themſelues ſo
generallye tranſformed, that (except the ſhape) they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no reſemblance of men if theſe had bene men acording
to their name, or their wiſedome exerciſed in due &amp; worthy
ſorte, they had rather gouerned loue, then become thralles
to his power, they might better haue diſſembled with him,
then ſo vilely incline to him, &amp; ſo might they haue eſchued
the populer obloquie rayſed to their confuſion. But what
ſuch accidents are the true fruits of loue, &amp; to who ſo euer
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22781:85"/>
treades that deſperate laborinth, it is an ordinary deſtinye
of a wiſe man to take the habite of a foole, of a carefull
manne, to become negligent, of a valyaunt manne to
be ſo weake, as to ſtande in awe of a worde of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
of a prouident man, to loaſe all pollecye, of a yonge
man, to become withered, of a well ſpoken to ſtutte, from
a good ſhape, to be cladde with deformities, of a frée man,
to bée miſerablye bounde, of a pacient man to become a
murmurer or elſe to beare the burthen of an Aſſe, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
man, to be an ydolater, of a riche man honoured, to
be made poore and ſkorned, of a liberall man inclyned to
charitie, a diſdainer of the honeſt neceſſitye of others, of
a quiet man according to chriſtianitie, a miniſter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
in the filthye cauſe of his minion, and laſtely euen
to loaſe the knowledge of hymſelfe, God and the worlde:
whereof the contrarie, hée who by wiſedome can auoyde
the rage of paſſion, and applye himſelfe to the honeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
requiſite to allure the heartes of Ladies, ſhall haue a
thouſande aduauntages aboue the other ouerwhelmed
with the burthen of loue: as firſt by his wiſedome he ſhall
not ſuffer himſelfe to be ouer ruled with paſſions: his care
ſhall not be turned into necligence, his courage into cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardneſſe,
his youth into age, his ſwéete ſpéech into ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
his libertie into thraldome, his pacience into mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
his fayth into hypocriſie, his wealth into want,
his deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into deuilliſhneſſe, his ſufferance into reuenge,
nor laſtely, he ſhall be neyther blinde in himſelfe, ignorant
of God, nor vnthankefull to the worlde: he ſhall bring
no ſtaine to his ſex, as being a man to ſuffer himſelfe to be
conquered by the fragilitie of a woman, whome God hath
not created, but as an inferior companion to the man, and
much leſſe ſhall runne into the babble of people, eyther for
himſelfe or his miſtris, which the louer perplexed or enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with paſſions, can not eſchewe, although he thinke
he walketh in the clowdes: as for example, ſo ſoone as he
<pb facs="tcp:22781:86"/>
entreth into ſpéeche of his myſtris, howe eaſily maye we
ſée the coales of affection kindle in his face, as both by
chaunge of coulour, and alſo partialitie of ſpéeche ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
alwaies to raiſe hir worthyneſſe, the ſame beyng one
cauſe (I ſuppoſe) why the Poets figured loue all naked,
bicauſe he doth ſo eaſely diſcouer himſelfe to all: where of
the contrarie, he that vnder an artificiall pollecie, wyth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
&amp; familiar behauior, can rather pretend then make
loue, ſpeakes not wythout modeſty of hir whom aboue the
reſt he meaneth to court, yea if neceſſity ſo require, he is
ſo curious ouer all cauſes of ſuſpition, that <hi>Argus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
can not deſcrie in what reſpect he traueyleth: And
who doubtes that a woman to whome hir honor ought to
be more deare then all the values of the worlde, eſtéemeth
not better of ſuch one, then eyther of a blabbe, to whoſe
tongue ſilence is a paine, or a fantaſite fléeter, who, with
himſelfe, forgettes alſo the eſtimation of hys myſtris:
wherein if theſe reaſons ſuffice you not to prooue the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
louer to be leſſe acceptable to his Ladye, then he
that but dallyeth or diſſembleth in loue, let vs I pray you
conſider the proper nature of a woman (I ſpeake not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally)
whether ſhée applyeth more frankely to the will
of him with whome ſhée ſtandes in ſecret and deare value,
or to him of whome ſhée is moſt made of: for my part I
holde with common experience, that he is beſt welcome,
that beſt can gouerne hir with ſwéete and pleaſant deuiſe,
in whome is moſt ſhowe of thankfulneſſe, who beſt can
make court to hir, who ſooneſt can finde hir humour and
wiſely féede it, in whome laſtly is a moſt readye facilitie of
tryfling flatteries, with ſuch other outwarde varieties of
delight: for touching the inwarde reſpect, women (for the
moſt part) holde little or no care of it, albeit they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
a deſire of loyaltie, which notwithſtanding they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téeme
but as a ſuperficiall ceremonie: No, the more ſhée
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22781:86"/>
ſéeth you plunged in paſſions for hir, the leſſe carefull is
ſhée of your contentment, where if ſhée finde you growe
colde in loue, it is then that ſhée entereth into the heate of
hir affection, being of nature like to a diſeaſe, whoſe cure
comes by a contrary medicine: So that ſeing women (euen
by their owne confeſſion) ſtande in condicion contrarie to
our willes, and that by cuſtome they take pleaſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
the true louer with blaunched ſignes, were it not
farre better with the loſſe of libertie, to eſchewe alſo the
ſcorne: And truely I can not (althoughe to our proper
ſhame) but accuſe here the common weakeneſſe of men,
as to encline ſo eaſely to the will of women, whoſe cuſtome
of diſſembling dealing, deſerueth a counterchange of lyke
qualitie: And herein I wiſhe my example might induce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to vſe the friears hypocriſie, and (with the women
themſelues) to preferre manye ſortes of curte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, which
being applyed in their apt ſeaſon and accompanied wyth
ſuch ſhowe of loyaltie, that they thinke all is done in their
fauour, may happily encline them as we beſt wiſhe them:
it is harde for a woman to reſtraine hir affection from him,
who is ciuill in behauiour, ſecret in fact, modeſt in ſpéech,
wiſe in all chaunces, and profeſſing to loue that which his
Ladye liketh, with a diſpoſition to conceale not onely all
thinges of generall importance, but alſo to be circumſpect
euen in the ſmall fauors which he receiues of his myſtris:
Theſe thinges are eaſie to be done of him whome I haue
figured vnto you, and of harde compaſſe to the other, by
whoſe proper beaſtlineſſe he moues his owne ſcorne in the
worlde, as to hunt after the fancie of a woman, whoſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
is his griefe, for that he ſéekes ſo much to pleaſe
hir, yea (ſeing him alreadie bleared) ſhée enforceth hir
pollecie to make him more blinde, choaking him with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
wordes, with the ſubtiltie of <hi>Silla</hi> or <hi>Circes:</hi> which I
beſéeche you (Madame) note not as euill in me, ſeing
<pb facs="tcp:22781:87"/>
cuſtome hath made my opinion more then naturall: and if
in vttering my fancie, I bring offence to your preſence
and maieſtie of this place, I lay my ſelfe vppon your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
whoſe propertie is eyther to excuſe or pardon:
This diſcourſe ſéemed waſpiſhe to one of the companye,
who feeling a newe playſter applied to his olde wounde,
coulde not but clawe, though he rather ſmarted then yt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
aſſuring him that ſpake it, that were not the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
he bare him, and reuerence he reſerued to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
he would tell him, that eyther he had long diſguiſed
his nature, or for the preſent was become a corrupter of
the common welth, as to bring in ſuch magicall hypocriſie,
that no woman was ſo honeſt as to defende hir ſelfe from
his pepered pollecies: But I pray you (Sir) ſayth he, take
héede you fall not into the fortune of him who loſt the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of his countrie, for that he faſhioned ſuch a ſubtill
louer as you ſéeme to deſire: Admitte that ſhoulde happen
(ſayth <hi>Charyclea</hi>) yet woulde I make my ſelfe partie to
his cauſe, not that I allowe his opinion in the generalitie
of women, although I can ſuffer his counſell to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
againſt ſuch, who haue a malicious glorie to bob thoſe
poore ſoules, whoſe follie is rather to be puniſhed, then their
condition pittied: And in déede the world ſo ſwarmes with
numbers of that ſort of women, that I am halfe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to beléeue his report, although it tende to our great
diſaduauntage, for nowe we haue (beſides our apron La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Citie) many popingay pratlers elſewhere, who
as they take it for a marueilous vaunt and bragge of their
bewtie to haue many ſutors, ſo their propertie is (with the
Iuggeler, that hath for euery company chaunge of Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeane)
ſometime to interteyne one with ſpéeche, to
court an other with lookes, to be familiar with the thirde
by ſignes, to lure the fourth by a falſe traine of cloaked
honeſtie, féeding them all with one vnſauerie hope, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22781:87"/>
him ſhée makes hir Aſſe, that beares hir moſt affection: So
that I ſtande not nowe to marueyle, if many (made wiſe
with your counſell <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo</hi>) ſéeke to diſguiſe
with women, ſeing in themſelues is bredde the example,
neyther is the reuenge vniuſt, if with the precedent of
their owne deceites, they encounter the like pollecies, and
hauing ſatiſfied the ſubtill deſires of men, they ſlip forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
into the ſlaunder of the worlde: yea Madame aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
<hi>Monophylo</hi> (the onely protector of women) and
many there be who wrongfully backbite women, boaſting
oftentimes to haue the poſſeſſion of their whole bodye,
which they had neuer ſo much credite as to touche with
their little finger, and that for a reuenge of an honeſt and
chaſte repulſe: an other ſort there are alſo, who, to winne
the name of iolie Gentlemen, will not ſticke to ſay, they
haue and doe gouerne hir, of whome they neuer receyued
worde of light qualitie: And therefore I wiſhe all women
of this ſtraight regarde, that afore they depart with the
thing which they can not call againe, they conſider with
two mindes, and beholde with thrée or foure eyes. For the
firſt woman being ſeduced by haſtie credulitie, was the
cauſe why our auncient father was deceyued: and at this
day, men are not without their reuenge, and much leſſe
vnfurniſhed of meanes to exerciſe it, as turning it to their
great glorie to diſguiſe their behauiour, and all to deceyue
a ſimple and innocent woman with preſent imagination,
that as ſoone as they haue faſhioned a woman in their
minde, ſhe is due to them as it were by obligation, and
therefore they take ſmall aduiſe to commit their fancie to
execution: But if ſhée, for the more ſuretie of hir honor,
will not condiſcend to their importunities, then they eyther
giue hir the name of fine miſtris dainty, or elſe to be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellie
ſimple, that ſhe had rather chuſe a little <hi>quidam</hi> of
meane value, then admit into fauour a gentleman of ſo
<pb facs="tcp:22781:88"/>
luſtie eſtate as he wéeneth in himſelfe: Oh <hi>ſeigneur Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolo,</hi>
what hereſie is in theſe opinions, what blaſphemie
in their doings, ſeing that as to the man is alowed a ſimple
power to aſſaile, ſo the lawe hath left to the woman an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
libertie to defende, and as the man hath onely a tong
to require, ſo nature hath lent the woman two eares to
heare, to the ende that if he make it lawfull to ſue, ſhée
hath no authoritie to denie: But if you will haue it ſo, that
the woman (with the trée that inclines to euerie winde)
abandon hir ſelfe to euerie requeſt, what prerogatiue (I
pray you) allowe you to ſuch as are the firſt in date: what
preheminence deſerue they, who by a perfection in loue,
and long and loyall purſute, haue wonne the poſſeſſion both
of the bodye and minde of their miſtris: coulde it ſtande
eyther with reaſon or honeſtie to diſpoſſeſſe them of the
thing ſo well deſerued: here <hi>Charyclea</hi> vſing hir authority
tolde <hi>Glaphyro</hi> that if he intercepted not the quarrell,
<hi>Monophylo</hi> was like to giue the Canueſado to <hi>Phylopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
and therefore as well to cut of their grudge, as ſatiſfie
the reſt of the ſocietie, ſhe wylled him to renue his late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
touching the remedie of a louer: wherevpon <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyro,</hi>
whoſe quiet hearing of their controuerſies, had
brought him to a ſetled iudgement of their argumentes,
although he made it harde to iudge in ſo doubtfull a cauſe,
yet he tolde them generally that it were beſt not to loue at
all, but to giue ſpéedie remedie to hym that were alreadie
entangled, was in the hande of God, of whome onely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
is to be taken. But ſeing (ſayth he) you will néedes
haue my medicine applyed to your louer, I ſay (as before)
let him retire with ſpéede, leaſt his miſerie be incurable:
For encountring the cauſe in the beginning, he eaſely may
gouerne the effect, neyther néede he any medicine to reſtore
him againe to his nature: But if he be ſo farre ſpent with
paſſion, that his forces are to weake to helpe his deſire
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22781:88"/>
out of that perill, then let him reſort to a good and long
dyot, I meane an abſence long and farre from the place
of his infection, and with (the pollecie of <hi>Gallen</hi> to eſchue
the place) let him flée farre, tarie long, and not returne,
till eyther chaunge of ayre haue purged his minde, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraunce
of time ſeaſoned his diſeaſe: This medicine albeit
in the beginning may carie a little taſt, yet his effect is not
leaſt pleaſaunt and moſt ſoueraigne of all other againſt the
ſtate of this daunger: for if the preſence of our Ladyes
kindle and féede the flame of our torment, it can not be but
abſence (as an antidot to purge a poyſon) brings health,
or at leaſt mortifieth our paſſion: And albeit to ſome, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is rather a bellowes to renewe the coales of affection,
then a ſufficient lyquor to quenche them, and that abſence
ſtayeth the courſe of all other ſorrowes, ſauing onely the
miſerie of manye conſumed louers, whoſe reprobate ſtate
prooues it without force againſt their condition: yea it may
be that generally our firſt dayes griefe of abſence, maye
ſéeme more intollerable then a whole yeare: yet ſinguler
experience makes no generall authoritie, nor the miſerie
of one prooues no communitie of deſtenie: and by reaſon
we finde that there is no loue ſo violent, nor ſorrowe ſo
vehement, which giue not place to time, who eſtraungeth
all things from their preſent nature, onely in this remedie
muſt be obſerued a conſtant and continuall pacience: For
if for one, two, thrée or foure Monethes you abſent your
ſelfe, and then fall into the preſence of your Ladye, it is
as if you ſhould caſt ſéede into a grounde, and not giue it
conuenient time to rype, to the ende you might reape per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
fruite: ſeing in this newe preſence are renewed ſuch
ſparkes of your olde miſerie, that you are not onely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in your late preſeruatiue of health. But (with the
nature of hote ymbers ſprinckled with droppes of waters)
you fall into a more violent heate then before: All Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:22781:89"/>
feare much the ſeconde returne of a ſickeneſſe: And
euen as a ſicke man to whom the ayre is forbidden, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
afore his time, falles into a more daungerous feuer,
ſo if your diſeaſed louer be not well confirmed when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth,
a ſecond preſence of his miſtris, his pollecy of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
wil profite him nothing, where if he be well purged
and cleared of all paſſions (which time and diſcreſion will
bring to paſſe) then with no paine and leſſe feare, he maye
ſafely encounter hir, and yet not indure to much felowſhip
with hir, ſeing to a delicate ſtomack, a ſurfet comes as ſoone
with to much of a good meate, as to eate a very litle, of that
which is euil: So that euen as a little ſight is much daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
if he be not altogither cured of loue, ſo notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he be thorowly healed, yet to much familiar ſocietie
can not but bring him great diſquiet: ſeing the eyes of our
Ladies (I knowe not by what arte) are farre more hurtfull
to vs then the mortal ſight of the <hi>baſilic<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan>,</hi> by whom we die
but of one death onely, but with the eyes of our miſtris,
we are ſtriken ten thouſande times a daye without power,
notwithſtanding to dye, conſidering that euen the beſt
partes in them, are to vs more venemous then the bytings
of a poyſoned Serpent, and where they ſerue to them for
a bewtie and neceſſarie ſence, it ſéemes (of the contrarie)
that nature hath not placed them there, but as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of our common deſtruction: I may reſemble the
miſchiefe in them with the miſerie of <hi>Promotheus,</hi> whoſe
lyuer did daylie increaſe, notwithſtanding <hi>Iupiters</hi> Egle
prayed daylie vppon it: yea it is woorſe then <hi>Syſiphus,</hi>
whoſe penaunce is without ceaſſing, to turne and role a
ſtone: and more horrible then the monſter <hi>Hydra:</hi> So
that let him be wiſe, who ſtandeth of himſelfe to vanquiſhe
theſe paſſions, ſeing his trouble will be no leſſe (if they be
once rooted in him) to ſubdue them, then to that valyaunt
<hi>Hercules,</hi> againſt the forces of the monſter: And therfore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22781:89"/>
let him ſtande ſpecially vpon his garde, that if he haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contynued
the preſence of his myſtris ſome long time, he
renewe not eftſoones hir company, but with preciſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
leaſt eyther the charme in hir eyes, or enchauntment
of hir tongue, ſet a newe edge of thoſe ſorowes, which time
had made dull.</p>
            <p>It maye be <hi>ſeigneur paſquier,</hi> that my aduiſe caryeth
ſmall credite with you, and leſſe authoritie with <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo,</hi>
as both the one and the other being without proofe
of ſuch a medicine: But as all other things ſtande in awe
of time, ſo doubt not but time alſo makes loue waxe olde,
according to the example of a fertill ſoyle, which for want
of due tyllage, falles at laſt into ſterrilitie: euen ſo, loue
being not enterteyned of his ſinewes, nor fedde w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th that
which ſhould mainteyne him in his iolytie, becomes no leſſe
colde in his heate, then the grounde withrede in fruite:
Al things haue their time, which time is the proper trompe
to ſounde euery ſecret, and therefore a Ladye cannot take
ſufficient counſell againſt the daunger ſhe entreth into,
when ſhe bequeathes hir bodye to the mercie of a man, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as the worlde ſayth) the value of a woman conſiſtes
in the innocencie of hir honor, and hir worthyneſſe of no
longer date then that treaſure is kept vndefiled: And not
onely (as you ſayde earſt <hi>ſeigneur Monophylo</hi>) for the
diſguiſings of men, which is a right good conſideration,
but alſo in reſpect of others pretending for a time a better
affection to them: for that as men, like men be fraile and
weake in their counſels, ſo their willes are full of variety,
and the moſt wiſeſt nowe a dayes not leaſt infected with
reuolution or chaunge: And ſeing (Madame) your chiefe
requeſt runnes that we procéede to mortifie loue altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I coulde not auoyde the name of vnthankfull, if I
ſhould ſpare my counſell, to ſuch who (perhappes) haue
nothing to doe with him, I meane all honeſt Ladies, whom
<pb facs="tcp:22781:90"/>
I warne eftſoones (albeit to my great diſaduauntage) that
the thing which they ought moſt to feare, eyther towardes
their beſt beloued, or on the behalfe of ſtraungers, is not
to loſe the authoritie which they haue wonne of them: For
a woman (to reſemble hir properly) is as a tender glaſſe,
which in his fragilitie is pure, neate, and cleane, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
to euery one, ſo long as he ſtandes in his integre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
But if it be once cracked or broken, it falles into the
contempt of euery one: euen ſo a woman being corrupte
in that, which ſhée ought to kéepe as a precious treaſure
loaſeth (with the ſame) the eſtimation of hir ſelfe, whoſe
glorie afore ſtoode not in ſuch highe value, as nowe (to hir
griefe) hir flower withereth, and hir plumes fall euen into
contempt with ſuch, who earſt being euen ſlaues to hir
will, ſtande now in a ſtate of ſouereintie ouer hir and hirs:
The hyſtories diſcouer at large the auncient diuiſion of
man, who from his originall, being formed with foure
féete, as manye handes and two heades, was deuyded by
the Goddes, whereof the one part was made the male, and
in the other moytie the female founde hir name. And (I
haue redde in many authors worthie of faith, that the great
God <hi>Iupiter</hi> hauing applyed to euery of them their proper
and perticular qualities, amongſt other memories worthy
to be marked, he gaue the charge of virginitie to the
mayde, and the garde of chaſtitie to the wyfe to ſerue them
for aſſured pauiſes againſt the aſſaultes of the worlde:
Then what paine I praye you is due to hir, who is negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in a charge of ſuch high importaunce: it may be you
note this phraſe inconuenient in me, as though I ſéeme to
ſhake the eſtate of our common commoditie: but howe ſo
euer you attyrs your opinion, my indifferencie appeares
in this, that I warne as well the man as the woman, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my ſpéech brings preiudice to our ſex: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I wiſhe you Ladies to ſeaſon your ſtomackes wyth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:22781:90"/>
other dyet, then with the peppered allurementes of loue,
in whome if there be daunger to the man in reſpect of his
paſſions peculiar and proper to himſelfe, he is double peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to you, whoſe weake nature ſuffereth their ſorrowes
as well as your owne ſmart, beſides the blemiſhe of your
renowme, which as you ought to waighe euen in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of your lyfe, ſo if you loſe it, you ſtop the riuer that
féedes the fountaine of your eſtimation: if theſe feares be
inſufficient to reſtraine you, eſchewe in time all intiſing
occaſions, as both the diſſembling lookes, and deceytfull
eares of ſuch as you ought ſo neceſſarilie to feare. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſhamefaſtneſſe of women requireth to embaſe their
eyes and beare their ſight lowe, as not to deſire any thing:
And if vpon a vaine preſumption, ſhe raiſe hir ſelfe into a
ſelfe hope and promiſe to conquer loue, ſhe ſhall no leſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
ſlippe into his ſnares, then lightly ſhe ſuffered hir
ſelfe to be poſſeſſed with that ouerwening opinion: The
Monkes encloſe themſelues in their cloyſters, to conquer
the fleſhe, and the Hermittes leade a ſolitarie lyfe in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes
and groaues: howe then can a woman lyue in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
to brydle hir frailtie ſtanding euen in the middeſt
of worldly delightes: ſhe laughes, ſhe ſpeakes, ſhe hath
conuerſation with yong men, ſhe thinks ſhe is not ſought,
bicauſe hir ſelfe doth not deſire, and yet ſhée ſéeth not how
ſhe hatcheth vnder the wing of thoſe familiarities hir own
deſtruction: farre better were it for hir, and more for hir
honeſt profite to eſchewe ſuch ſocietie who ſéeke but to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the caſtle wherein is kept the aſſuraunce of hir ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:
and aboue all, let hir cloſe hir eares from him, who
by corrupt giftes, ſettes a ſtale to intangle hir, as the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
enchauntes the byrde, or the Fiſher by his worme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes
the ſtelie Gudgeon: euerye holde enclyning to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monce,
with long parle ſéemes willing to conſent to hyr

of hyer for my traueyle, bicauſe I lyue bounde in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
duetie to all Ladies, whome as I dare aſſure general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(if they learne and followe my principles) of increaſe
in honor with perpetuitie of name, ſo the neceſſitie of my
counſell I commende onely to ſuch as haue béene prodigall
of their libertie, vnleſſe they knowe an other lyne to leade
them more directly then mine, who (in this ſmall diſcourſe)
did not pretende to apply to the contentment of euery one,
(for ſo my burthen woulde prooue intellerable) but onely
to diſcouer a ſhort remedie which I haue alwayes eſtéemed
moſt proper for the health of a louer, which is abſence,
with firme purpoſe neuer to treade the path of his miſtris
againe: and this remedie is enforced rather, by an arte
and induſtrie guyding vs, then once procured by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature or motion: But euen as you (<hi>ſeigneur Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo</hi>
and <hi>Paſquier</hi>) by your ſeuerall diſcourſes, haue
earſt taught vs, not the meanes to loue, or by what arte
we ſhould moderate our affections in loue, but rather haue
layde open the ſubtill maners, by which that little théefe
ſeaſeth of our heartes, when we leaſt thinke to be his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes:
ſo I will here preſent you with: an other meane, not
as by counſell, howe we ought to eſcape loue, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
howe without thinking we are conſtrayned to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
him: it is diſdaine, I meane an almightie diſdaine,
which hath power to put this loue to mortall vtterance,
And this albeit be moſt certaine and iuſtefyed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples, yet as <hi>ſeigneur paſquier,</hi> laying open the
partes of loue, gaue him diuers natures, according to the
diuerſitie of paſſions: euen ſo this diſdaine takes ſundrie
effectes, according to the qualitie of louers, ſometimes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22781:91"/>
more and ſometimes leſſe, euen as they are touched wyth
vyolence: And if you will knowe whereof this diſdaine
takes his beginning, I will not ſatiſfie you with mine
owne experience, bicauſe I neuer made proofe of it, but by
reaſon, I will deriue him from two heads and fountaines:
The firſt is, (and that of no meane importance) when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long ſute and ſeruice to our Ladies with manye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent
obediences, we finde them not onely vnthankfull,
but alſo (making a ſcorne of our ſeruice) they tranſlate the
merite of our martyrdome to an other, and ſo make our
griefe the inſtrument of their delight: which albeit at the
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt we hardly receiue into iudgement, and as it were ſée
and not ſée, yet their dealings entring into cuſtome, and by
little and little vanquiſhing our partialitie, it is moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that ſuch loue chaungeth habite and takes the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of a hate farre aboue the nature of the former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
according to the witneſſe of <hi>Reguier</hi> diſcouered by
<hi>Boccace</hi> in one of his Nouells: oh daungerous diſdaine,
oh ſpite whoſe power hath brought manye noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to ſuch extremitie of furie, that defyling their hands
with the bloud of their Ladies, they haue alſo at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt
bene the vnnaturall homicides of themſelues: For
(with <hi>paſquiers</hi> rule) there is ſuch a naturall <hi>simpathya</hi>
of humours amongſt men, that euen as we loue ſuch as
like of vs, ſo alſo our fleſhe and mindes riſe againſt them
in whome is grudge againſt vs or ours, as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
or prowde man louing no other then himſelfe: the
ſame being the cauſe (as I thinke) why the auncient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
allowed in their lawe of nations, this deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
as falling by nature into the mindes of all men:
and albeit by Gods decrée we are defended to vſe reuenge,
yet our nature holdes hir ſwéete courſe to vomite poyſon
againſt ſuch as hate vs: And therefore no marueyle if a
woman hauing once charmed our affections, and after, by
<pb facs="tcp:22781:92"/>
certaine outwarde actes we prooue their diſguiſed nature
towardes vs, that then we turne courſe, as being inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the precedent of their pollecies.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt kinde of this diſdaine, whoſe power is
farre more violent then the other which procéedes of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ymagination of the minde, or elſe by a light beliefe
of falſe reportes made of our Ladies, and this diſdaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
is nothing ſo mortall as the other, yet increaſing by
ſucceſſion of time, his effectes in the ende prooue nothing
inferior to the firſt, and therefore in his beginning, he is
called ielowſie, which although in his prime age is nothing
elſe then a renewing of loue, yet as he rypeneth by little
and little, and by degrées riſeth to perfection, he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
condition, and leauing the name of ielowſie, vſurpes
the nature of diſdaine in manye perſons, I ſaye not in all,
bicauſe for the moſt part, our affection is ſo great, and our
weakeneſſe ſo generall, that oftentimes we are conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to diſgeſt it, as a weake ſtomacke indueth a harde me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
and all bicauſe there remayneth certaine ſparkes
of the loue we beare to our miſtris. There be alſo ſundrie
other maners of diſdaine, as that which riſeth of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
repulſe, with farre ſundrie others, which I am content
nowe to paſſe ouer, as hauing neuer taſted their condition
or nature.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> albeit he commended the meanes
which <hi>Glaphyro</hi> preferred to diſſolue loue, yet (ſayth he)
if that charge had happened to me, I would not haue doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to haue applied more neceſſarie medicines to ſuch an
euill, and with more eaſe haue cured the cauſe, and with
leſſe daunger gouerned the effect: he brings in a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
accompanied with a deſire to ſteale out of this priſon
of loue, and then a light diſdaine whoſe cauſe commeth
manye wayes. But (in my fancie) he is farre from the
marke, and his reaſons nothing incydent to the neceſſarie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:22781:92"/>
pointes of the preſent purpoſe: <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> an auncient
Phiſition, was not approoued of manye others of that
facultie, bicauſe he affirmed in opinion &amp; argument, that
the arte of phiſicke, or meane to cure pacients, might be
wholy mainteined without any potions or medicines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pownded,
but leauing all artificiall helpes, he referred all
men to fiue infallible and moſt neceſſarie cures, that is,
temperate exerciſe, moderate vomit, reaſonable ſléepe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
walking, and a good and long dyot: which reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in déede, were not impertinent to ſuche as were in
helth and not infected with diſeaſe: But to him who labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a long and hote feuer, I ſée not in what vſe they
could ſerue: euen ſo I can not finde howe this long dyot
and abſence commended ſo much by <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi>
can worke any neceſſarie vertue in ſuch, who are alreadie
ſtriken and touched (as it were) to the death: And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſdaine which he alleadgeth, bicauſe his remedie
in that is more caſuall and by chaunce then otherwaies, I
will leaue it to worke in louers, euen as their nature can
brooke and beare: And for the meanes I haue promiſed you
I will vſe the common methode of moſt Phiſitions, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
you a potion or drinke, wherein is brued the whole
and abſolute cure of this our diſeaſed louer. Let him then
drinke of the flood of <hi>Lethes,</hi> other wayes called the lake of
obliuion, of which the Ladie <hi>Chariclea</hi> hath cunninglye
brought into our memorie towardes the ende of hir ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrake.
And if this meane eyther faile him, or he faint in
the execution, then let him reſort to the circle of the moone,
where perhaps he ſhall incounter a great part of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
diſtraught ſince he firſt made inuacion vpon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Cupide:</hi> But if this way be eyther hard to finde,
or vneaſie to holde, let him at laſt practiſe the counſell
of the Phiſitions, and vſe a little <hi>Helbora,</hi> an herbe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
dedicated to ſuch vaine and ſonde miſeries: For if
<pb facs="tcp:22781:93"/>
euer anye ſort of people were robbed of their wyttes, it
is the miſerable corporation of louers, whoſe blindneſſe is
ſuch, that the ſunne ſéemes darke to them in the plaine day,
and in the night, they iudge the moone a thicke clowde:
whereinto to confeſſe a ſimple truth, it is to be doubted,
whether that miſerie procéede more of their owne indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſion,
or is deriued of the naturall ſubtiltie of women,
who haue ſuch a drawing power ouer the hartes of men
(this he ſpake ſimply to vrge the opinion of <hi>Chariclea</hi> and
<hi>Monophylo</hi> hir protector) that it ſéemes the Deuill hath
incorporate himſelfe in them, the better to delude men not
of baſe or low condition, but euen ſuch as by long vſe haue
wonne the name of riche, wiſe and worthie Monarkes and
kings of the earth: oh what partialitie ſhewe you here
(ſayth <hi>Monophylo</hi>) that to giue ſeaſon to your vnſauerie
wordes, you forbeare not (euen without occaſion) to forſake
the lymittes of our argument: and yet you could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſcouer our common beaſtlineſſe, then by the diſcourſe
you haue made and ſo inconueniently applyed: ſeing that
by ſo much are we rude and weake in condicion, by howe
much we ſuffer them to ſubdue vs, and their wiſedome the
more aſſured and commendable, by howe much they can
warrant themſelues from the wrongs which ſo caſtlye
they laye vpon vs. But yet <hi>ſeigneur Phylopolo,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo, nor your opinion ſo generally true, but it may be
diſprooued by many examples: For if ſome by women haue
falne into the bable and rebuke of the worlde, yet we haue
<hi>Medea, Phyllis, Dido,</hi> with manye other infortunate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
who by the treaſon of their diſloyall <hi>Iaſon, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
and <hi>Eneas,</hi> are made (alas) ſorowfull groundes of
vnworthy obloquie, both to their vnhappie cotemporians
or time fellowes, and alſo their lamentable poſteritie, and
therefore me thinkes your wrong is without reaſon, which
ſo partially you will laye vpon that ſex of whome we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:22781:93"/>
in comfort, commoditie and felicitie: and without
whome, as we coulde haue had no originall being, ſo were
it not by them, we could haue no preſent conuerſation nor
lyfe: in déede ſayth <hi>Phylopolo,</hi> they are a neceſſarie euill:
and therin replyed <hi>Monophylo,</hi> are you no leſſe ouerſéene
then in all the reaſt, and your error more hurtfull: But
you <hi>ſeigneur Glaphyro,</hi> notwithſtanding the cauell of
<hi>Phylopolo,</hi> I wiſhe not to diſcontinue your diſcourſe, the
ſame being no leſſe neceſſarie to intercept his hereſie, then
moſt conuenient to confyrme the reaſt of the felowſhip:
But the Ladie conſidering by the height of the ſunne, that
their longer aboade there, might bring offence to the reſt of
their companie, whoſe cuſtome (during this progreſſe)
was to obſerue good howers for their repaſte: tolde <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylo</hi>
what wrong he practiſed to himſelfe, in vrging <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyro</hi>
in a matter (as ſhe thought) of ſo ſmall aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to himſelfe, ſeing withall (ſayth ſhe) that the time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
you fauour, as thereby to ſommon you to reſolue
our long controuerſie, wherevnto as I prepared the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſo am I nowe to interceſſe for loue, of whome I
take more pittie, then he vſeth compaſſion to ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
his mercie: And ſo breaking of ſo indifferentlye, I
hope there is neuer one of vs all who reſtes not ſatiſfied,
<hi>Glaphyro</hi> to haue runne ouer ſo much matter in ſo fewe
wordes: we to haue bene edified by his acceptable ſpéeche,
you (<hi>Monophylo</hi>) to ſée ſo ſhort an iſſue of all, and laſtly,
the reaſt of the companie, not to be offended with our long
exerciſe and aboade here: wherevpon they diſcryed at hand
foure yong Gentlemen of the generall trowpe, comming
to warne them of dinner, who being informed of the eſtate
of the arguments paſſed amongſt them all that morning,
grudged with their fortune to reſtrayne them from ſuche
honorable felowſhip, albeit if the exerciſe renewed at after
dynner, they ſued to be admytted, and alſo others more
<pb facs="tcp:22781:94"/>
auncient of the bande, who being alſo receyued, prepared
themſelues againſt the hower of appointment, but ſuch
was their ſodeyne occaſion, neyther looked for afore it fell,
nor welcome when it hapned, that they were driuen to
chaunge hoaſt, where, with the oportunitie of a new place,
they renewed efteſoones the matter of their late ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
whoſe ſucceſſe I leaue at large,
as being ſodainely eſtraunged from
their ſocietie by myne
owne occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
