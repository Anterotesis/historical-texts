            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 1. Reflections upon the <hi>Eaſt-Indy</hi> COMPANY.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MOnopolies</hi> are the moſt wicked, tyrannical and injurious Uſurpations over other Men, and the greateſt Violations of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of any other, and are ſo much worſe than Robbery, by how much the Quality of them is worſe, and the Extent farther. A <hi>Monopoly,</hi> is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating a Power of Working or Trading, by one Man, or Company of Men, excluſive to all other: Here conſider, that all Men are born naked, and the generality of Mankind have nothing but their Labour, Induſtry and Ingenuity (I do not mean undue Craft and Deceit) to Feed, Cloath and Provide themſelves an Habitation with; and therefore for one Man, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men, to impoſe upon all others beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a <hi>Negative</hi> of not Working or Trading, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely reſolves into all others, who, if this Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had not been, might have not only ſubſiſted in theſe Trades and Imployments, but alſo have enlarged and improved them by their Induſtry and Ingenuity; for all Arts are infinitely improvable, and one Man in the preſent Time, and another in future Generations, may proceed further in any Art than was known or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61161:3"/>
underſtood in former Ages, which will be loſt, if this Man ſhall be Excluded from having any benefit of it, or be puniſhed for working in it.</p>
            <p>If one Man, or Company of Men, rob another, or more Men, this extends no farther than the Loſs of what theſe were robbed, which it may be is eaſily Repairable: But for any Man, or Company of Men, to arrogate to themſelves a Power of Robbing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in thoſe Imployments, which they Aſcribe to themſelves, for ever Ruins multitudes of Men and Families, which might have been imployed in them: And let any Prince conſider the conſequence of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Monopolies</hi> to his Subjects; for if any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which might have been imployed, if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Trades had been free, ſhall, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Neceſſities, Steal or Beg; the ſame Prince hangs and puniſhes theſe poor People for not Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when before he had given others a Power to puniſh them, in caſe they did Work.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe <hi>Monopolies</hi> leſs impolitick than wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and injurious; for the greateſt Benefit which any Country or Kingdom enjoys, is by the Imployment of the Inhabitants, which being reſtrained to a few, the reſidue become a Burden to that Country to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and theſe alſo become dangerous to that Country for want of Imployment: From whence it follows, that they muſt either ſeek unlawful Means to ſubſiſt, or flee into other Countries to get Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there, which was denied them here, and this will be in double proportion, as much to the Benefit of that Country, as a Loſs to this. Beſides, <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> I ſay, are injurious to the reſt of the Inhabitants of the Kingdom and Country within, and to the Vent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61161:3"/>
of the foreign Trade of them; for by their Reſtraint, the Inhabitants ſhall pay dearer for worſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than if the Trade were free; and being dearer and worſe than in other Countries, enables the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of thoſe Countries to vend theſe in foreign Parts, whilſt theſe are neceſſitated to be conſumed at Home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any finds out a new Invention beneficial to the Country, in any Myſtery (which he could not have done, in caſe he had been reſtrained from working in it) the King, by Act of Parliament, may grant him the ſole uſe of it for 14 Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then where there is no Myſtery for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Subject found out, the King can grant no Patent, or <hi>Monopoly</hi> for any other, or the Law had been in vain, if the King could have granted ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that it is great Wiſdom in any King and State, to give all due Encouragement for improving any Art or Myſtery beneficial for the Country; but this of Granting a Patent for the ſole Uſe of it for Fourteen Years, is of all other the worſt, and will be of little Uſe to the Country; whilſt the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of other Countries, will have manifoldly more Advantages by it: For when this Myſtery ſhall be practiſed, it will neceſſarily be known to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61161:4"/>
the firſt Projectors, and ſo cannot be contained in the limits of that Country; and when this ſhall be known in other Countries, where the Working it ſhall be free, this will be ſo much cheaper Wrought and Vended, than where it is more reſtrained; and therefore I have heard that the <hi>Dutch</hi> (who are Wiſe in their Generation) will give Noble Rewards to any who ſhall find out any New beneficial My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but then they will permit the Uſe of it to be free.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, in the firſt Year of his Reign, <hi>viz. May</hi> 7. 1603, iſſues out a Proclamation, calling in ſeveral <hi>Monopolies;</hi> and in his Speech at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Parliament of his Reign, exclaimed mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt them; and in the ſecond Year made Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſolely (the <hi>Dutch</hi> then being at War with <hi>Spain)</hi> enjoyed a more beneficial and enriching Trade than any other.</p>
            <p>But the King had no ſooner made this Peace not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Proclamation and Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but he Incorporated the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive to others; which the Wiſdom of Parliament, in that celebrated Law 3. <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 6. made free for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that Trade is a Nationall Intereſt, and the Support of the Nation, is to be upon a Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and therefore the Incorporating the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, to a few, enfeebled the Publick Support of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It would ruine infinite Numbers of Artificers, whoſe Labours would be maintained, if the Trade ſhould be free, which could not be if it were reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a few, and theſe would have a Prerogative of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61161:4"/>
giving what Prizes they pleaſed unto poor Artificers, otherwiſe they ſhould not be imployed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Incorporating this Trade, would reſtrain the Navigation of the Nation; to the manifold ruin of many mariners, which otherwiſe might be imployed in it, and alſo multitudes of Ship-wrights, and Ship-Carpenters, which may be imployed in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Incorporating this Company, would cauſe a Dearneſs upon all ſorts of Commodities returned in this Trade, the Corporation being hereby enabled to ſet what Prizes they pleaſed upon them, otherwiſe none could be had.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Incorporating this Trade, would ſo much more leſſen the King's Revenues by Cuſtoms, as the Trade hereby ſhould be diminiſhed; and all theſe Reaſons are as ſtrong againſt all other Companies which trade excluſive to other men, whether it be to <hi>Hamburg, Muſcovey,</hi> or to the Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms within the <hi>Sound,</hi> as in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade; and, I ſay, it was this moſt beneficial Law which has enabled this Nation to continue the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade to this day, whilſt it hath loſt thoſe.</p>
            <p>And if this King were ſo looſe of his Royal Word, almoſt ſo ſoon as he made it, it cannot be doubted, but that he will be more conſtant of it afterward; for in the Parliament, in the Eighteenth Year of his Reign, no leſs than 37 <hi>Monopolies</hi> were Voted Grievances, and damned; and as the Father laid the Foundation, ſo his Son built upon it; for in the Year 1640. when King <hi>Charles</hi> marched to <hi>York</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who then had Invaded <hi>England,</hi> upon the the Complaint of the Northern Gentry, he recalled by Proclamation thirty one Monopolies; and then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61161:5"/>
he did not know how Greivous they were to his ſubjects, becauſe he was Governed by ſuch (I cannot ſay) Counſels, that no man durſt before complain of them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Monopolies</hi> granted by theſe two Kings, we proceed to that of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> in his erecting this now <hi>Eaſt-Indy</hi> Company, <hi>An.</hi> 1657. to Trade to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> excluſive to all others of the Nation; but before a further view be taken of this Patent, its fit to ſee the Extent of it, under the Title of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and if I miſtake in it, it is in the power of the Company to correct me.</p>
            <p>Their Patent extends from <hi>Cape Bon Sperance,</hi> to the North of <hi>China,</hi> taking in the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>China;</hi> together with all the Iſlands which lie between the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> and the North of <hi>China,</hi> which I ſay is more, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Coaſt on both ſides of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> than half the circumference of the Globe of the Earth; and that their Power may be as unlimited, as the Extent of their Dominion, they doubly impoſe an Oath upon every Member, to be true to the Company: How <hi>Oliver</hi> was endued with ſuch a Prerogative, needs not be diſputed, becauſe he would have his Will to be Law; but I do not find any King of <hi>England,</hi> ever aſſumed ſuch a Power, nor any other, but the Convocation, which impoſed the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> without Conſent in Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 1640.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Oliver</hi> would, in his Zeal, have the Pope to be Anti-Chriſt in exalting himſelf above God, and in diſpoſing the Kingdoms upon Earth, wherein the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61161:5"/>
Pope and he were <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy;</hi> but herein the Pope and he differed: The Pope would have all his own Tribe to Partake of his Bleſſings; whereas <hi>Oliver,</hi> by this Patent, excluded all the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in this Trade, but permitted the <hi>Dutch, French, Portugueſe, Hamburgers,</hi> &amp;c. to Trade in it, It may be, becauſe he could not help it; yet I do not find he, or his Company, ever made War upon them for ſo doing, though his Company has upon the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and that with ſuch Barbarity, as was never Practiſed, by <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> or any other <hi>Infidels</hi> upon them; Its too long to recite them here, this Parliament has heard thereof ſufficiently; and are particularly ſet forth by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> in his <hi>Account of the Trade to the</hi> Eaſt Indies.</p>
            <p>But though the Company have not been pleaſed to make War upon any other Nation but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for Trading to the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> yet they were pleaſed to make War, without any Declaration, or Cauſe, upon the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> and the <hi>Mogull;</hi> and rob the <hi>Mogul's</hi> Subjects to carry on the War, as Mr. <hi>White</hi> Obſerves, and whileſt the Company have thus rent themſelves from the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, they patiently ſubmit to the <hi>Dutch</hi> in forcing <hi>Poloroon</hi> from them, cauſed by their own neglect and avarice; from which the <hi>Dutch</hi> are become the ſole Proprietors in the <hi>Spice Trade;</hi> and alſo from the Trade to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi> for Pepper, whereby they are forced to Trade for it to the moſt unhealthful parts of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> (which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> forbid) whereby we loſe more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men than the Trade is worth, which is little regarded by this Company; and whileſt they are making their Cauſeleſs Wars, upon the King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61161:6"/>
of <hi>Syam</hi> and the <hi>Mogul</hi> they permit the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> whoſe Predeceſſor <hi>An.</hi> 1621. granted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the half Duties of all Nations, Trading into the Gulph of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and which in the year 1672 came to 80000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> (I would know by what Right this Company Claim theſe) to reduce them to 3000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> And is it not ſtrange this Company ſhould exclude the reſt of the Nation from trading to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> becauſe of the Charges of their Forts; and yet for 15 years receive more from the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> than the value of the Stock they traded thither with.</p>
            <p>For the further Frauds which this <hi>Company</hi> exerciſes over the reſt of the Nation, in the Returns of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> and how being a <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly</hi> in the whole, they Monopolize the Sales by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Contract among themſelves, to the farther Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Subject. I referr the Reader to Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s <hi>Account of the Eaſt Indy</hi> Trade, too long to be here inſerted.</p>

            <p>AS <hi>Oliver</hi> eſtabliſhed this preſent <hi>Eaſt Indy</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and excluded the reſt of the Nation from trading into that half of the World, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany call the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> So King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2 <hi>d.</hi> erected this preſent <hi>African</hi> Company, excluding all others of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation from trading to <hi>Africa,</hi> from the Country of <hi>Suſa,</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope;</hi> ſo that if you take the extent of this part of the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> its little leſs than a Quadrant of the Globe, being above 80 Degrees; ſo that the prerogative which theſe two Companies claim againſt the reſt of their fellow Subjects in theſe two Trades, extend to two thirds of the circumference of the Globe of the earth, and herein both are at peace with all the world beſides, and only in a ſtate of War with the reſt of their fellow Subjects, in Caſe any of them preſume to trade to either. Here let's ſee firſt the Conſequences of this Reſtraint, upon the Nation in the foreign vent of our domeſtick manufactures: Secondly, in reference to our <hi>American</hi> Plantations; and Thirdly, in reference to the returns, which this Company imports into
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61161:7"/>
               <hi>England</hi> from that part of <hi>Africa,</hi> wherein they Trade,</p>
            <p>I am not ſure of the Companies Patent for this Trade, they know better, nor will I take notice how far the export of our woollen manufactures have been reſtrained in other Countries of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall only take notice of it from the County of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> Before this <hi>African</hi> Company was Incorporated, the Cloathiers in <hi>Suffolk</hi> yearly vended 25000 Cloths to <hi>Africa,</hi> but about two years after this Company were Incorporated, the Clothiers in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, endeavoured to have vented their Cloths in the <hi>African</hi> Trade, but they were not permitted, and the Company would take off but 500, and thoſe at ſcarce half the Prizes they were ſold before: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both the Great Inqueſt of <hi>Suffolk</hi> (the <hi>Guildalle,</hi> and the <hi>Franchiſe</hi> of <hi>Bury)</hi> at their next Aſſizes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this as a Grievance; and Imployed Sir <hi>Jervais Elvais</hi> (who is now Knight of the ſhire for <hi>Suffolk)</hi> and ſome others, to repreſent this to the King and Council; but the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being preſident of this Company, no Redreſs could be had; and ſo the Caſe now ſtands at this day. So it is ſubmitted to the Wiſdom of Parliament, whether this Exaction by this Company, be not the ruine of many Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Artificers; and gives the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in them, as well as Navigation to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> with theſe, to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>I am aſſured that this Company (and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may Inquire into the Truth of it) after it was Erected, carried it ſo that the Planters in our <hi>American</hi> Plantations, were not permitted to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61161:7"/>
Buy <hi>Negroes</hi> but of the Company, and the Planters muſt buy only ſuch as the Company would ſell, and at the Price of 30 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more than they did before; ſo this is ſubmitted to judgment, whether this will not reſolve into a dearneſs of all the Products of our <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and thereby enable both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are Competitors with us in theſe Trades, to the Endangering the Loſs of them, ſo far as either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhall carry on Theirs in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with us.</p>
            <p>The Returns into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Africk</hi> are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>Gold-duſt,</hi> which is ſo much leſs as the reſtraint by the Company is more. <hi>Elephant's Teeth</hi> and <hi>Bees-wax</hi> I ſay nothing of <hi>Bees-wax,</hi> but I ſay the Company raiſed the price of <hi>Elephant's Teeth</hi> ſo high, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> could bring them in chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſo work the Manufactures of them cheapor than the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> could work them; and this being a Manufacture of <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> by the <hi>Act of Navigation</hi> may Import them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon ſeveral of our Artificers in <hi>Ivory,</hi> for ſeveral Years, I'll name two of them, Mr. <hi>Jole</hi> in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> in <hi>Colemanſtreet,</hi> were neceſſitated to go into <hi>Holland,</hi> and work them there, and then bring the Manufactures into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and whether this be not a grievous tyranny of this Company over multitudes of poor Artiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>Ivory,</hi> is ſubmitted to Judgment: Yet this, as well as the <hi>Eaſt Indy</hi> Company, have the Confidence to petition the Parliament, to have this abominable Tyrannies over the reſt of their fellow Subjects, to be Eſtabliſhed by a Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61161:8"/>
As theſe two Companies are <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> in their Wickedneſſes over the reſt of their fellow Subjects, in the Exerciſe of their Dominion, ſo are their Pretences the ſame for their ſo doing, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe Trades cannot be managed but by a <hi>Joint Stock,</hi> to the excluding the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which is a Lye diametrically to their Practice; for then Interlopers could not Trade in either, which, above all others, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, by ſeizing their Ships and Cargoes, and Impriſoning their Perſons; and its Well they eſcape ſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, That they are at great Charges in erecting Forts, for ſecuring theſe Trades: If they have any ſuch Forts, as the <hi>Eaſt Indy,</hi> the Fort of St. <hi>George,</hi> and another at <hi>Bombay,</hi> for which they pay Ten Pounds a Year to the Crown; yet I fear the <hi>African</hi> Company have not the ſame Plea, now the <hi>French</hi> took from them their Fort this laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at one of the Mouths of <hi>Gambo;</hi> but the Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> and that at <hi>Bombay</hi> are of no uſe in the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, being quite out of the way; and if they be of uſe to the Company, is this a Reaſon that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> but themſelves ſhall Trade to near half the known World. The <hi>Zealanders</hi> have built a Fort, in the <hi>Scheld</hi> called <hi>Lillo,</hi> whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all other Nations, but the <hi>Dutch,</hi> from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant, &amp;c.</hi> Yet ſure it would be a ſtrange Impudence in the <hi>Zealanders,</hi> to forbid the reſt of the Inhabitants of the <hi>United Netherlands</hi> to Trade to any part of the World, becauſe they have erected a Fort in the <hi>Scheld</hi> called <hi>Lillo;</hi> yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61161:8"/>
they may do this, as well as theſe Companies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Trade to <hi>Africk</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> becauſe one Company has Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> and the other a Fort at one of the Mouths of <hi>Gambo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a difference between the <hi>Zealanders</hi> and theſe Companies; for they permit the other <hi>Dutch</hi> to Trade up the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and reſtrain Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; whereas theſe Companies permit Foreigners to Trade in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and only forbid the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> upon pretence of their Forts. And ſure it is juſt with God, that theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies which have thus Rent themſelves from the reſt of the Nation, and inſult over their fellow Subjects, ſhould themſelves be Subject to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and Injuries of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſonable Proſpect of relief from this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo treated by them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of the State of the Nation, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Law</hi> againſt <hi>Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> enjoying the Liberties of the Natives of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Glory and Majeſty of every Kingdom and Country is founded in the Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the well Ordering and Governing of them: So that as the Loſs of any of the Subjects, is a Diminution of the Grandeur and Strength of that Country, ſo is the Addition of more Subjects, an Encreaſe of both; and therefore it is not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Extent of a Country which makes it formidable, but the Number, and well Governing of the People: So that though the Kingdoms in <hi>Spain,</hi> Subject to the now King, be one hundred fold greater than the <hi>United Netherlands;</hi> yet theſe are five fold more formidable by Sea and Land than all thoſe Kingdoms in <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein they cannot Raiſe an Army to defend <hi>Catalonia</hi> againſt Thirty Thouſand <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61161:9"/>
And as the Strength and Grandeur of every Country is founded in the Number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſo is the Riches and Trade of it, for every Man s Neceſſities is ſupplied by Trade; ſo that though men be poor, and maintained by the Loſs of Particulars, yet in the whole, Trade is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, yet more or leſs, as Men live more or leſs in Society and Converſation; and therefore wherever People are thin, or few, they are poor, lazy, rude, and of little uſe to the Publick, yet a publick Charge: As in <hi>Spain,</hi> it may be the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are tenfold more than in <hi>Holland;</hi> yet by Reaſon of the vaſtneſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Inhabitants are few and thin in proportion to it, ſo as all the Wealth of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> cannot ſupport the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Maintaining them; whereas in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the People are numerous, and daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Buſineſs, every Man is a benefit to the Country, as well by Strength and Trade.</p>
            <p>We have formerly compared the State of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> from not unlike Cauſes; for as <hi>Spain's</hi> Expelling the more, and the Inhabitants excurſion into the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> has exhauſted the Inhabitance of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> debarred it of a Supply; ſo hath the Peopling our <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and the repeopling <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the Maſſacre, and late Wars, ſo much diſpeopled <hi>England,</hi> as the Peopling them hath been more; and the Law againſt Naturalizing Foreigners as a greater bar for a Supply, than the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61161:10"/>
As the Law againſt Naturalizing Foreigners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars the Nation from a Supply for the exhauſting the Nation in peopling <hi>Ireland,</hi> and our <hi>American</hi> Plantations; ſo the Priviledges of Corporations, exclude all the reſt of the Nation, but the Freemen, from Trading in them; whereby theſe Men Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their own Intereſt, from the poor Eſtate they are thereby reduced to, daily decline to worſe, whereby it becomes impoſſible to encreaſe the Strength and Trade in them beyond the power of theſe men in them.</p>
            <p>To ſupply this Defect, the Commons in the third <hi>Weſtminſter-</hi>Parliament, the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>December, 1680. Gave Liberty to bring in a Bill for a General Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization of all Alien Proteſtants, and allowing them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Exerciſe their Trades in all Corporations.</hi> So did the Commons laſt Seſſion: And is not there as much Reaſon all Native <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have the ſame Liberty?</p>
            <p>But why muſt this Liberty be permitted only to Proteſtant Artificers and Traders? For my part, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand but little Benefit can accrue to the Nation by it, now the <hi>French</hi> King has expelled theſe out of <hi>France;</hi> for as the Caſe ſtands, <hi>Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are the places from whence we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any benefit by this Liberty: In <hi>Holland,</hi> Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Traders are as free, as they can expect to be in <hi>England;</hi> but in <hi>Flanders,</hi> though they be an induſtrious and honeſt ſort of People, yet they are all Popiſh, and I am confident, if they might enjoy the exerciſe of their Religion in <hi>England,</hi> multitudes of them would ſeek an <hi>Aſilum</hi> here, to be freed from the Inſults they are always ſubject to from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61161:10"/>
               <hi>French;</hi> and its not unlike, but Multitudes would free from the Tyranny and Oppreſſions of the <hi>French</hi> in their <hi>New Conqueſts,</hi> if they might uſe their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretend to love <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men above all others, and it becomes them ſo to do; but in our practiſe, this Love is both partial and unreaſonable; I ſay, it is partial by the Freemen in Corporations, excluding the reſt of their fellow Subjects from working and Trading in them, which is a prime Cauſe of their Poverty; and I ſay, it is unreaſonable to exclude Foreigners from being a Supply for thoſe ſent out of <hi>England,</hi> into our <hi>American</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Suppoſe a Man is ſo in love with his Family that he will not imploy any other in managing his Farm whereby half of it lies waſt; Is it not unreaſonable that he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy none of his Neighbours to help him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to the beſt Advantage; or if by Fire or Rapine he cannot by his Family preſerve his Houſe or Goods, yet would it not be prudence in him in ſuch Caſe to make uſe of his Neighbours? Is not the Caſe ours? Have not the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the matter got from us all the Fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Iſeland, Weſtmony, Greenland,</hi> and the <hi>Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and are our poor Port-towns, by excluding the Natives and all other, in a Condition to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them herein, much leſs to retrieve theſe Fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61161:11"/>
Suppoſe any one of theſe Corporations ſhould loſe one half, more or leſs, of their Ships and Freight, Would not this be ſo much a Loſs and Weakning to it? Convert the Propoſition, and admit like number of others Ships and Freight, ſhould ſet Up and Trade in that Corporation, Would not this be as much an Enriching and Strengthing to it? And therefore if in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junture of time if it pleaſe God ſo to bleſs his Majeſtys Arms, that the <hi>French</hi> could not, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great hazard, trade in the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Fiſhery, and to <hi>Green-land;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> might more ſurely manage theſe Fiſheries from our Ports, whereby many of the <hi>French</hi> ſhould buy fiſh from our Ports, would be as much a ſtrengthing and Inriching to this Nation, as it would be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing and weakning to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we ſhould permit Foreigners to purchaſe Lands in <hi>England,</hi> the Nation without any haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard would get ſo much Treaſure, as the Purchaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money is more, which had it not before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lands ſtill, which it had before; and be ſo much more ſtrengthened as the Purchaſers are more; whereas a Merchant in acquiring Wealth, runs hazards of being Undone and gets no new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>Ambitious Princes venter their own Dominions to acquire New by War, and that by Oppreſſion, Rapine, Murder, Deſolation, and making Men miſerable; whereas by permitting Foreigners the Freedom of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Native, we Conquer without a War, run no hazard, and Enrich and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61161:11"/>
the nation; and all this in double propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſo much as the Nation hereby gains, and is ſtrengthned, ſo much are thoſe, which may be Enemies to us, impoveriſhed and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in <hi>Cyropoedia,</hi> Says, That by reaſon of the Goodneſs and juſtice of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Reign many nations became Subject to him, and was <hi>Cyrus</hi> the leſs Great and Glorious by it? why then ſhould this Law debar ſhe Nation the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which it might enjoy by <hi>Naturalizing Foreigners,</hi> whereby the Nation would be ſo much more enriched and ſtrengthened, as this Admiſſion of theſe Foreigners ſhall be more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we ſhould admit popiſh Foreigners the Freedom of <hi>Engliſh-</hi>Men, it might endanger the Peace of our Church and State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my Part, if I thought ſo, I would never Plead for it; for I do as much abhor the popiſh Superſtition, as any Man, and am as fearfull of the Uſurpation which the Pope Arrogates over princes, and the Conſciences of Men; yet I apprehend no danger of either, by permitting popiſh Artificers to work and trade in <hi>England,</hi> as well as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61161:12"/>
For it is one thing for popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits to make it their buſineſs to pervert Men to their Sentiments; and another thing for poor People to make it their buſineſs how to Subſiſt, which will take up their whole time; eſpecially where they are in a ſtrange place, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the People, unleſs by accident in their Dealings for their ſupport, and alſo to the Language of the People where they live: I would know what inconvenience has followed from permitting <hi>Brewer</hi> in the Year One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Six hundred and ſixty ſeven, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which were all Papiſts, to inſtruct our Natives in making and Dying Fine Cloths; and in all the Tumults and Wars in the late times, after the Year One Thouſand Six hundred and forty, let any ſhew any one Inſtance wherein the <hi>Walloons,</hi> or their Deſcendents, planted in <hi>London Norwich, Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> Contributed to either of them, however they had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thereto by the Biſhops <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Wren.</hi> Beſides if theſe Men cannot be prevailed upon in their Perſons to alter their Sentiments in their Religion, their Poſterity may, if our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will make it their buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Can any man believe that all Sciences and Arts, or the improvement of them is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale; or would it become us, as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> did, to eſteem all the World beſides to be barbarous?

               <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was the moſt Generous and Nobleſt Prince of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, and did not he, notwithſtanding the Law againſt Naturalizing Foreigners, and againſt his own Profit, introduce the <hi>Walloons,</hi> who inſtructed the Natives in making Woollen Manufactures? And is this benefit leſs valuable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, becauſe it was introduced by Foreigners.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Kett's</hi> Rebellion in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> became almoſt deſolate; and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, it was often debated in Council, whether it ſhould be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as being a Receptacle of vagrant and idle Perſons, and ſo dangerous to the Government. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (the moſt Noble Princeſs of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Race) when the Rage of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, drove numbers of the <hi>Flemins</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Planted them chiefly in <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> who inſtructed the Natives in making <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, and <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bays, and are not theſe above all Places in the World become the

Or are the Benefits leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, becauſe the Natives were firſt inſtructed in them by Foreigners; So King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d (as is ſaid before) entertained in the year One Thouſand ſix hundred and Sixty ſeven, <hi>Brewer</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who inſtructed our natives in making and Dying Fine Cloths, Thirty Pounds <hi>per Cent:</hi> cheaper and better than before; and is this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement leſs valuable, becauſe the natives were inſtructed in it by Foreigners? I dare ſay at this day above an Hundred Thouſand people (Men, Women and Children) are imployed in ſilk weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſilk throwing in and about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which was firſt taught by Foreigners, are theſe therefore leſs valuable? And is not the famous Engineer Sir <hi>Martin Beckman,</hi> a <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger?</hi> or are the benefits the Nation now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys by him leſs valuable, becauſe he is a Foreigner? or would the benefits which the Nation may reap by Foreginers inſtructing our natives how to Cure white Herrings, Pilchards and Codfiſh be leſs valuable, if they were inſtructed in them by Foreign people <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>IF I have but Superficially, yet to the beſt of my Ability, diſcourſed in this little Treatiſe, ſo that the end deſigned by it, be not ſo Manifeſt, but that a better and more intelligent Perſon may make it more; yet it may be a Ground-work for another to do it better; I am ſure the Deſign is Noble the end being the Publick's Good.</p>
            <p>I was the rather induced to this Undertaking, becauſe the Circumſtances of the Nation, as the Caſe ſtands, render it very difficult to have the State of it truely repreſented: For the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, Clergy and Lawyers, whoſe Intereſt it is to have the Nation and Trade of it encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby the value of the Lands of it, would be ſo proportionably; do not make it their buſineſs to enquire into it; and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants who underſtand it to be the Intereſt of the Nation to enlarge the Trades of it, yet their Intereſt, eſpecially thoſe which trade by excluding the reſt of the Nation, is to continue the Trades of <hi>England,</hi> as they now ſtand; for thereby they take off the Manufactures of the poor Natives at what prizes they pleaſe, and no more then they pleaſe, whereby the Artificers in them, are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Poverty in Working, but cannot be
