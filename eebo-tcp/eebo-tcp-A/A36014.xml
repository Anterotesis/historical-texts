            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am not inſenſible that many Objections may he made againſt theſe following Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; tho I ſhan't trouble my ſelf to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 'em, leſt by that means I ſupply ſome ſort of people with Weapons, that otherwiſe cou'd not furniſh themſelves.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall ſay by way of Preface is, That theſe Poems were never deſign'd for the moroſe ill-natur'd part of Mankind; but for the Men of Pleaſure and Generoſity. And ſhou'd ſuch perſons as theſe find any thing in them that can contribute to their ſatisfaction, I know my faults will be eaſily Pardon'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46692:3"/>I have, to the beſt of my power, familiarly adapted my Authors to our preſent Circumſtances of Time and Cuſtom, ſo that their notions might be reliſh'd with as little expence of Thought as poſſible. If they will bear the peruſal with the ſame eaſe, freedom and pleaſure that I found in writing 'em, 'tis enough for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 'Tis true I have taken a great deal of liberty both as to the manner of Compoſure, and as to the Matter itſelf, and may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem to be very foreign from the ſubject propos'd. Indeed 'tis my Opinion that Alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do properly admit of this ſcope, as ſoon as the hint is receiv'd, I think the Alluder may be allow'd to follow the Thread of his own Fancy.</p>
            <p>If any are Curious to know why I Publiſh 'em, I willingly confeſs, that it was not either from the importunity of Friends, nor to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf from Errors of Surreptitious Copies, nor indeed to eſtabliſh any great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but for a Reaſon worth a hundred of 'em, and for the ſame Reaſon, if my Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
<pb facs="tcp:46692:3"/>
finds encouragement by this firſt part, the World may expect to be troubled with more; tho for her own ſake, we are at preſent at ſuch odds, that I would not beſtow a ſtroke <hi>gratis</hi> upon her, were it only to ſpit my Venom in Railing. Whenever ſhe proves more Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to me, like a true Poet, I'll grudge her no Adulation. In the mean time let her Rub on, and ſo will I as well as I can.</p>
