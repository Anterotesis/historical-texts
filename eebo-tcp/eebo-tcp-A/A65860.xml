            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do hereby sincerely and in good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science declare, that 'tis not for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy's sake, nor in love thereto, that I am so much engaged therein; a Peaceable and Amicable Conversation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men, and their Quiet Behaviour, (though of different Perswasions) being far more desirable and acceptable to me: Nor am I the beginner of these Controversies or Contentions, being wholly defensive in my Concern therein; but for the living Truth and an Innocent Peoples sake, to remove
<pb facs="tcp:106641:3"/>
those gross Aspersions which are cast upon both, chiefly by Contentious Apostate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, which are of the most disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and malicious, who are more skilful in Perverting and Aspersing, than Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; their Pamphlets being stuft with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling and Railery, not with Argument. And if I did not really believe a necessity laid upon me (in point of Conscience towards God, and love to his People,) to discover and oppose their foul Abuses, bitter Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and gross Calumnies, they might rail on against my self and others, till wearied and out of Breath, and the Fire of their own Envy consume them. But the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is not Personal only, but the Holy Truth is concerned, our Christian Faith and Religion is concerned, our Holy Profession is concerned: And these furious Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will needs concern, (and would fain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense) the Civil Government with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective Pamphlets against us, to render u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Discord and Strise amongst Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and consequently to weaken the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of King and People? Let the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Impartial judge. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> F. B's. rendring our <hi>Declaration</hi> to the King and Parliament, (<hi>for the Divine Authority of the Holy Scripture,</hi> as inserted in the Act of Exemption) <hi>Deceitful</hi> on our part, and to <hi>serve a turn,</hi> in his <hi>New Rome Arraign'd,</hi> p. 40, 42. This is to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to invalidate and destroy a principal Condition of our present Liberty: And is not this to Confront and Oppose the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments acceptance of our said Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All which, with many more misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations and Calumnies against us in <hi>F. Bugg's</hi> Pamphlets, greatly bespeak his Deadly Malice, Revengeful and Unchristian Spirit, which we hope no Rational, Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or moderate Man, will Countenance or Encourage. To be sure such malicious Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must needs be odious to all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and Merciful Men. And seeing I could not with all my late and earnest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, obtain a Meeting for a free and fair Debate with <hi>Fra. Bugg,</hi> (when lately
<pb facs="tcp:106641:5"/>
in <hi>London)</hi> about the Controversie he has begun and published between us. I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Two Ministers (<hi>viz. William Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> of <hi>Cripplegate</hi> Parish, <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Isaac Archer</hi> of <hi>Milden-hall</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where he lives,) with these (and other) his Abuses and Misrepresentations aforesaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, to try if they would put a stop to his farther proceeding therein; shewing them by Letters wherein his Abuse and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies against us, would affect them, (he having the Reputation of a <hi>Convert,</hi> and his writing against us, approbation among some of the Clergy, by his own Confession.) But his last Pamphlet being in the Press before my Letters to them, I suppose they had not opportunity to prevent or stop that. However it will concern them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to stop his Malicious Attempts, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I am perswaded his work will not be to their Credit or Reputation: But the more to the contrary, if they do not stop, and lay him aside, and provide better Tools to work withal, if minded fairly to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Matters with us, or otherwise to let us live quietly, and on all hands to endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:106641:5"/>
for Charity one towards another as much as we can.</p>
            <p>And seeing <hi>F. B.</hi> has presumed to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his last Pamphlet, stiled <hi>Quakerism Withering,</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> falsly charging the Teachers of the Quakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with <hi>Damnable Heresies,</hi> even <hi>Denying the Lord that bought them.</hi> And yet as one both uncertain and doubtful in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Attempts against us, proposes this <hi>Offer</hi> and <hi>Submission</hi> to the said Bishop in these Words, <hi>viz. I therefore do most humbly offer what I have wrote to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's perusal, and shall most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit to your Censure, the Matters therein contained. And if for want of Judgment in the Matters controverted, I have wronged the Quakers, I shall most willingly retract and make them publick reparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, I and another Friend, <hi>i. e. Samuel Waldenfield,</hi> lately took occasion to repair to the said Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reputation of a moderate Person,) and shewed him <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi>'s said Pamphlet and Epistle dedicated to him, and this very
<pb facs="tcp:106641:6"/>
Passage of his <hi>Submission,</hi> as not knowing but he had delivered it first in Manuscript to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for his <hi>Perusal</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> Which when I enquired of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, the Bishop answered, he had never seen it before, nor knew the Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I shewed him how preposterous it was for <hi>F. B.</hi> to expose his said Pamphlet in Print to general Judgment, before he had the Bishops Judgment about it, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with his said offer of his Book to his <hi>Perusal,</hi> and submitting to his Censure the Matters therein. How insincere <hi>F. B.</hi> was herein is obvious.</p>
            <p>It seems he was resolved to traduce and asperse the Quakers in Print first, that the Bishop might not have the opportunity to prevent him therein: Though for a Pretext and Colour, he Complements the Bishop with his Conditional Submission to his <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> whether he had wronged the Quakers or not. Did not this tend to make the World believe he had the Bishops Privity or Approbation therein, or otherwise, that he would not have div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and Censure? who knew nothing of it until 'twas gone out into the World. What a Mockery and plain Abuse was this, (tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the Bishop suspected of giving Countenance thereto.) To whom we shewed also <hi>Bugg</hi>'s other Book against us, stiled <hi>New Rome Arraign.</hi> with his <hi>Mock Trial</hi> and Condemnation of <hi>Perjury and Pillory</hi> against us, and the Occasion thereof; which Calumnies the Bishop disowned, and could not allow of such Treatment. And I thought meet to give this hint thereof, to do the Bishop so much Justice, that he might not lye under the suspition of giving Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to this our Implacable Adversary, in these his Calumnies and bitter Invectives against us. As I did in the Postscript of my late Answer, <hi>Innocency Triumphant.</hi> For <hi>Henry Goldwell,</hi> Justice of Peace, and late Member of Parliament, to whom <hi>F. B.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his other Scandalous Book, (stiled <hi>New Rome Arraigned)</hi> without his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Knowledge (as he confessed) and for which he also told some of us, <hi>he severely advertised</hi> F. Bugg, <hi>when he saw it in Print</hi> (with his <hi>Mock-Trial, Perjury and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106641:7"/>
               <hi>Pillory</hi> against us) being sensible it was a Reflection on his Reputation, to be rendred or suspected as the Patroniser or Countenancer of such Scandalous Pamphlets. And 'tis to be much more hoped, that the said Bishop will advertise <hi>F. B.</hi> for endeavouring to shelter himself under his Countenance or Reputation.</p>
            <p>[In point of Civility, I thought meet to shew the said Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Passage, (relating to him about <hi>F. b's.</hi> Dedication) in Manuscript, before 'twas printed, because I had such occasion to make use of his Name in Print, that he might not be offended; which he was not, but took it well from us: <hi>Samuel Waldenfield</hi> being then also present with me.]</p>
            <p>However, whatever we suffer, there is a just and all-seeing God, that will judge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, do rightly, and finally determine the Controversie between the Two Seeds, the Righteous and the Wicked. To Him the Righteous Judge of all, we commit our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Cause.</p>
            <p>Friendly Reader, my Concern in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, is designed only to vindicate Truth according to my understanding thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:106641:7"/>
to do particular Persons wronged, so much right (as to their Principle) as by referring to their own Explications; for where either their Words are perverted, or seem dubious in the manner of Expressions, their own more full and clear Demonstrations ought to be taken notice of, in point of Justice to them. And where the whole Body or People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are wrongfully charged about their Principles from particular Persons, 'tis an absurd way of arguing, whether it be from any one's defective or dubious manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, (or our Adversaries own perversions and misrepresentations.) And in that case, to manifest Truth, and to do the said People right as to their Principles, &amp;c. I find it the plainest way to have recourse to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Testimonies and Harmonies of their Writers and Books, to evince the truth of their Principles to others. And this Method which I do sincerely observe all Religious and Christian Societies will allow of, and not condemn a whole Body of Sober Religious People, or Christian Society, for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular shortness in manner of Expressions; for that were very partial and unjust. And
<pb facs="tcp:106641:8"/>
I doubt not but the Lord our God will stop the Mouth of Iniquity that's open against us, and clear our Innocency more and more, that his Truth may prevail over Deceit and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and the Upright in Heart shall see it, and rejoyce in the Lord, and in the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his blessed Truth, over his and their Enemies.</p>

            <p>TO introduce the ensuing Reflections on <hi>F.

            <p>Observe here, how plainly and positively this his acceptance seems to be of my said <hi>Challenge,</hi> but how insincere evasive and shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was therein, his following indirect Terms shews insisting upon the <hi>Choice of Eight moderate Ministers, giving me my Choice whether to chose the whole number out of the Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Independants or Baptists, or whether each of us one out of each.</hi> And what was his intent in proposing such a Choice? It was that the difference might be referred to such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for them to Judge and Determine; as he confessed at <hi>Jacob Franklings,</hi> the First of the twelfth Month, 1693, in the Evening before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106641:11"/>
several Witnesses. I shewed how unreasonable it was for me to give away Matters of Faith and Conscience, to such Persons of different Perswasion; and how besides the terms of my Challenge for the Persons present to be <hi>Witnesses</hi> only of what passed, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to matter of Fact, and not to refer matters of Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to their Determination; asking <hi>Bugg</hi> if he would refer all the Matters in Difference to Anabaptist Ministers? (whereof <hi>Sprinkling Infants</hi> was one, as he well knew,) He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>he would;</hi> as indeed his own Proposal would have obliged him, if I had chosen the whole number of Anabaptist Ministers. By this those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Clergy, who have encouraged <hi>Fr Bugg</hi> in his Scribling against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> may see what a <hi>Convert</hi> he is, and how litle of Religion or Stability he is come to, in his offering to refer Matters thereof to the Judgment of Presbyterian, Independant, or Anabaptists Ministers, whereby he had been liable to turn Presbyterian, Independant or Anabaptist.</p>
            <p>However, since <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> so plainly had writ that <hi>he accepted of my Challenge, and came to</hi> London <hi>Sixty Miles to meet me,</hi> I closely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him by Letters, thereupon sending one Letter after another for some time, day by day, for a Meeting with him fairly to dispute Matters; and seeing him Dillatory, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Time by his various Terms he had to make one after another, I appointed several
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106641:11"/>
Meetings on purpose, and gave him timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, as many are Witnesses to Six se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters of mine sent him. And this thou <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> knowest in thy own Conscience to be true; and therefore mayest thou not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of thy sorry shifting and evading both my Challenge and thy own Acceptance thereof; and yet in thy own Contradiction art driven to confess in these Words; <hi>viz. Thus far then we agreed as to matter of Debate; I in my Sheet offered to produce every Book and Page quoted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ten or Twelve Impartial Men, and by</hi> G. W. <hi>offered to make it appear before any Six, Ten, or Twelve Moderate Men, that I had wronged them. So that nothing remained now, but my coming to</hi> London <hi>to joyn Issue with</hi> G.

            </p>
            <p>But that Agreement thou made shift to evade by other Terms; one while by urging for <hi>Ministers</hi> of divers Perswasions as before, to be Judges of the Matters in Controversie: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, for a pre-Engagement to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional <hi>Retraction</hi> under Hand; another while to <hi>leave the Matters in Controversie to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of Disinterested Persons,</hi> (as thy Letters shew.) And not only so, but thou woulst have pre-ingaged our Friends, (whom thou hast scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized with thy Mock Tryal and Pillory, as <hi>Perjured Persons,</hi> to <hi>Retraction</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> if proved False Witnesses.

               <hi>being present at the Debate, unless when the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate came under Examination, or called in when any Matter depending thereupon, was under Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> as by thy Letters to me, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my printed Challenge accepted by thee. <q>Thou knowest what Exceptions I made against the inequality of these thy dilatory evasive Terms, and against thy Arrogancy, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self into Competition with a Body of People, refusing therein to make any such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Bargain with thee, to gratifie thy Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.

and Persecutors as thou art. Therefore <hi>Self-Condemned Apostacy,</hi> cannot be so justly charged upon them as upon thee. Thy turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Testimony for the Quakers Doctrine and Ministry, as by thee given in 1686, unto <hi>what thou thought of them in</hi> 58 and 60, is a most base and false Prevarication, as well as contrary to the plain Grammatical import of thy own Testimony given in 1686, (Two Years after thy leaving us, and conforming to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>) which thou confirmest in these positive Expressions, as thy then present Sense, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Thus thou in 1686: How canst thou in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science alter and turn this to <hi>what thou thought of us in</hi> 58 and 60? Oh Hardned Man, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to thy own Conscience; awake, awake to judgment!</p>
            <p>Thy consequence also is very inconsequent and false, <hi>That by our Doctrine, Pious Sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are rendred Apostates for acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves mistaken (upon Conviction) in that they once thought the Popish Doctrine true,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quak.

Ministry were false or erroneous, when thou left us, nor when after thy Conformity thou confess'd it <hi>was a Dispensation of the love of God, and God blessed our Meetings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thy First Charge against the Quakers is, <hi>That they deny Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>who was born of the blessed Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>to be Christ, and the efficient Cause of Mans Salvation.</hi>

               <hi>chiefly</hi> and in the <hi>first place</hi> Christ, as <hi>I.

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106641:15"/>
               <hi>Man,</hi> much more as <hi>God.</hi> And therefore <hi>Fr. Bugg's</hi> inference, that the Quakers would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Humanity from the Godhead is false; they are distinguished but not divided in the entire Being of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also that <hi>they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call him Christ but a Vail,</hi> is falsly infinuated; though his <hi>Flesh</hi> was called the <hi>Vail,</hi> Heb. 10. 20. This Objection has been plainly answered as well as the Question: <hi>Doth not the Name Christ belong to the whole Body,</hi> &amp;c. In our <hi>Charitable Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> p. 4. which <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> gives the <hi>go by</hi> to, without Replication, running the rounds to his old Objection, <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> imposing and begging the Question; he will neither see, nor take Answers, how plainly soever given, thus impertinent and trifling he is.</p>
            <p>But to clear <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> in this Point, he did not deny Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Christ, but sincerely confesseth to the same Jesus Christ in his Works, 2nd Part, <hi>p.</hi> 18. in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Enemy</hi> hath raised up Jealousies and Prejudices against us, as if we denied the Scriptures and Ordinances of God, and that <hi>Christ</hi> that died at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> against which <hi>Isaac P.</hi> Answers, <hi>viz. First,</hi> That we do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Hearts own that Christ who came in the fulness of time in that prepared Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do the Father's Will, (His coming into the World, Doctrine, Miracles, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Death, Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and simplicity of Heart, according
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106641:16"/>
as it is exprest in the Letters of the Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we own no other Christ than <hi>that,</hi> nor hold sorth no other thing for <hi>Christ</hi> but <hi>him,</hi> who then appeared and was made manifest in the Flesh. And <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>ibid.</hi> The Lord hath shewn me in Spirit, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are guilty of that very charge, (and that he will so implead them at his Judgment Seat) which they cast upon us, even of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Christ which died at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be Christ.</q> Thus far <hi>Isaac Pennington.</hi> What more plain and innocent Testimony could Man have given? Where's now either his or the Quakers denial of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> has over and over unjustly charged us.</p>
            <p>Another Instance out of the <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> 
               <q>is that <hi>the holy Body,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of Christ,) was not instrumentally, without a share of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Victory, and holy Priviledges obtained; yet that the efficient and chiefest Cause was the Light and Life, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is so far from either denying Jesus to be Christ, or the efficient Cause of Salvation, that it is a plain Confession that Jesus Christ was both the instrumental, and the efficient cause of Man's Salvation; <hi>Instrumental</hi> in his Holy Body, and <hi>Efficient</hi> by his Light and Life: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we preach no other Light or Life to effect Salvation, but that of Jesus Christ. And we know of no true Understanding Christians, but will confess that it was not the Humanity or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106641:16"/>
Manhood of Christ <hi>only</hi> that effects or works Man's Salvatian, without the <hi>Divinity,</hi> seeing <hi>as Man,</hi> he saith, <hi>I can of my Self do nothing; as I hear I judge,</hi> John 5. 30.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Fr. Bugg's</hi> Inference that they, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Quakars,) <hi>have robbed the blessed Jesus of one of his eminent Attributes,</hi> (viz. <hi>of being the efficient Cause of Man's Salvation,</hi>) is notoriously false and impertinent like the rest, (Jesus Christ is a compleat Saviour.) As also is F. B's other, <hi>That they insinuate by consequence that</hi> Him <hi>that was born of the Virgin, He is no otherwise a Saviour, than other good Men are,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>Which he has flatly contradicted by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance immediately following, viz. <hi>If some Men in Scriptures are entituled Saviours, because of their Contribution of their Trials, Travels and Labours towards the Salvation of Mankind; of</hi> much more <hi>right is that honour ascribed to</hi> Him <hi>who had the Spirit without Measure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>Whereby its apparent, that much more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Saviour is ascribed to Christ, than to any other Men. Thus notorious is <hi>Bugg</hi> in his Contradiction to himself, most unjustly to prove his Lying Charge of <hi>their Denying Jesus to be the Christ, and the efficient Cause of Man's Salvation. Oh Horrible Insolency, and Self-Condemned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Fr. Bugg,</hi> I query of thee,</p>
            <p>1. Didst thou, when a Quaker, deny Jesus to be the Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106641:17"/>2. Didst thou when a Quaker, deny Jesus to be the efficient cause of Man's Salvation?</p>

            <p>4. Didst thou when a Quaker ever hear the Quakers Deny Christ to be the efficient Cause of Man's Salvation?</p>
            <p>5. Nay, didst thou deny Jesus to be the Christ, or the efficient Cause of Man's Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when in the Name of the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, thou confessedst, <hi>That in the beginning the inshining Light of Christ Jesus by his Heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Appearance in the Hearts and Souls of his People, was our Principle, the very Foundation, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Corner Stone of our Building?</hi> See his <hi>De Christ.

            <p>6. Didst thou deny Jesus Christ to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause of Man's Salvation, in thy confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to <hi>this inshining Light of Christ Jesus, as the more sure word of Prophesie; and that there was sufficiency in it, (being obeyed) to lead to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Or in thy confessing to <hi>the vertue and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this holy Unction, and to this word</hi> nigh <hi>in the Heart;</hi> and <hi>to Christ Jesus the Second</hi> Adam, <hi>as he is a quickening Spirit, even to Christ within; and thus People must wait to know him, except they were Reproba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>7. Didst thou by these Confessions, deny Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be the efficient Cause of Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106641:17"/>8. What notorious and gross Contradiction to thy self is it then for thee, to make ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Salvation <hi>chiefly</hi> to the holy <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> in Christ, and unto his Body <hi>instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi> to be a denial of his being the efficient cause of Man's Salvation, <hi>Qu. Wither.</hi> p. 22. Seeing that Light of Life was the Light and Life of the same Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And I think it is a real owning Jesus Christ, who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be the <hi>efficient</hi> Cause of Man's Salvation, to confess that to <hi>his own holy Divine Light of Life, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is chiefly ascribed;</hi> but <hi>Instrumentally</hi> to his Body. And hath not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> the like Distinction, where he confesseth <hi>we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life?</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Here's <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by his Death, and much more <hi>Salvation</hi> by his Life.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Consequence against us, as bringing in <hi>Damnable Heresies, Denying the Lord Jesus Christ to be a compleat Saviour,</hi> p. 23. is a most foul and absurd Slander.</p>
            <p>His instance in <hi>p.</hi> 23, that the Serpent is a Spirit, and therefore that promised Seed which bruiseth his Head, must be Spiritual: And that Seed is Christ. To which I add conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, not only the outward Body or Flesh which he took upon him.</p>
            <p>I cannot understand how this can be <hi>a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, that Jesus Christ himself is the efficient Cause</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106641:18"/>
               <hi>of Man's Salvation,</hi> unless <hi>F. Bugg</hi> doth think that Christ was made up only of that outward Body of Flesh, without any Divine Principle of Light and Life in him; which I suppose he will not attempt to own or prove. For though Christ took upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh, and was the Seed of the Woman that bruises the Serpents Head, even the promised Seed, who through Death was to bruise under, and destroy him that had the power of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> The Devil, yet he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually doth it by his Divine Power, Light and Life, as the immediate and efficient Cause of Man's Salvation: Wherein we still confess his Sufferings and Death in the Flesh <hi>Instrumentally</hi> to Contribute thereunto. Christ Jesus as the promised Seed, who came of a Woman made under the Law, bruised the Serpent's Head, both without us and within us; <hi>without us,</hi> through his Sufferings and Death, (by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimony, Word and Power; <hi>within us,</hi> by his Divine Life, Light, Word, (or Seed,) Spirit and Power, which is all but one Christ himself, not Two Christs, nor to be divided. Else how could we be born again of incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seed? Or how doth that Seed remain in him that's born again? And is not that Seed Christ? And is not the Word of Faith, Christ in Spirit? 'Tis well that <hi>F.

            <p>Divers other absurd Consequences he draws upon us in this case not worth tracing. His other Instances to prove his false Charge of the <hi>Quakers denying Jesus to be Christ, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause of Man's Salvation,</hi> are most gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied and perverted, as (he saith) <hi>by</hi> G. Fox's <hi>assuming Divine Attributes to himself,</hi> p. 26, 27. Which we must needs look upon to be a reiterated aspersion. For where <hi>G. F.</hi> uses these Words, <hi>I am the Light, him by whom the World was made, and doth enlighten every Man that comes into the World,</hi> &amp;c. This he speaks in the Name of Christ, and not of himself; nor in his own Name, as his following Words plainly shews, viz. <hi>If you love the Light wherewith you are enlightened, you will love Christ, who saith Learn of me.</hi> Now <hi>F. B.</hi> Dost thou in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science believe that <hi>G. F.</hi> assumes this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or that he himself <hi>made</hi> the <hi>World?</hi> Or that he himself <hi>enlightens every Man?</hi> 'Tis very sad to see thee so hardened and wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in thus perverting truth.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106641:19"/>
               <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> rationally to produce the Colour of proof thereof. Wherefore I question him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his pretended Allegations.</p>
            <p>1. What Blasphemy or Idolatry was it for any of our Friends to write, <hi>viz. Thou, O North of</hi> England, <hi>out of thee did the Branch spring, and Star arise, which gives Light to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions round about; in thee the Sun of Righteousness appeared?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. How proves <hi>F. Bugg</hi> that <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Disciples or Proselites,</hi> (as he scornfully calls them,) <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed back these Adorations to him;</hi> as calling <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Branch, the Star, the Sun of Righteousness?</hi> Alluding to <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 8. p. 31. I challenge <hi>Bugg</hi> to prove where the Quakers gave these Titles to the Person of <hi>George Fox,</hi> or that he assumed them to himself?</p>
            <p>Observe. I have viewed over that Epistle of <hi>Edward Burrough's, to the Camp of the Lord in</hi> England, <hi>p.</hi> 64, 65, 66, 67, where mention is made of the North of <hi>England,</hi> and where the <hi>Branch</hi> did <hi>spring,</hi> and the <hi>Star arise,</hi> and the <hi>Sun of Righteousness appeared,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>G. F.</hi> is not so much as mentioned, or named in all that Epistle; and therefore <hi>Bugg</hi> has most shamefully belied and scandalized the Quakers in this point also; not only in charging them, that <hi>the Quakers Prophets give Witness to</hi> G. Fox, <hi>instead of Christ;</hi> that they call him the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Sun of Righteousness, and put the North of</hi> England <hi>for the Town of</hi> Bethlehem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106641:19"/>
(<hi>N. Rom. unm. Epist. to Ber.</hi> p. 2.) But also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our Testimony against this Horrid Lye and Abuse; among others, <hi>Bugg</hi> staged Twelve of us, (being Citizens, Tradesmen and others of good Repute,) in his Mock Tryal, wherein he condemns us <hi>for Perjured Persons</hi> to the <hi>Pillory,</hi> with a form thereof, (in his <hi>N. Rom. Arraign.</hi>) to redicule and most grosly defame us, both as to our Christian and Civil Reputations affected thereby. Oh, horrible Insolency and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in thee <hi>F. Bugg!</hi> Thus wilfully to persist in thy Imposing gross Lies and Calumnies upon the World against us!</p>
            <p>3. What <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> did <hi>G. F.</hi> assume to himself, in saying <hi>he wrote from the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> or that he was cloathed with <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?</hi> p. 30.</p>
            <p>5. How proves <hi>Bugg,</hi> that to be a true and entire Copy of <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Letter to <hi>G. F.</hi> which he cites, <hi>p.</hi> 30? I deny his Citation; and there's reason to question the truth of it, being also so often varied in Print; and particularly from the Copy sent me by <hi>John Pennyman;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Date of 1665 given it, in the printed Libel, entituled, <hi>Some of the Quakers Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> &amp;c. gives more Cause to question the Truth of his Copy: For that Date was Two Years after <hi>John Audland</hi> Died, being in 1663, ('tis great Nonsense to suppose he writ it after he Died,) as appears by their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Burials in <hi>Westmorland.</hi> And thou <hi>F. B.</hi> hast <hi>owned</hi> the said Libel and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106641:20"/>
               <hi>composing</hi> of it, in thy <hi>N. Rom. Arr.</hi> p. 10. And didst thou find the Date of 1665, on the said Letters; or didst thou give it, or who did? Answer truly. We may not be imposed upon by thy various uncertain Accounts or Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Matter.</p>
            <p>5. Which of you have the Original Letter of <hi>J. A</hi>'s? And which of you are able to make it appear, by <hi>comparing of Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which of you are so expert in his Hand, that you can make it so appear <hi>ex certa scientia?</hi> I greatly question it. I am sure that <hi>John Audland</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, (and confessed) the true Christ of God, according to Scripture, as is fully proved in his Works, cited in my <hi>Just Enquiry,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29.) and that he esteemed <hi>G. F.</hi> no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than eminently Instrumental in Christ, for his own and others help and comfort.</p>
            <p>6. What Blasphemy and Idolatry canst thou prove against <hi>W. P.</hi> and others, in their Book <hi>Judas and Jews,</hi> and in excusing <hi>Josiah Coa</hi>'s Letter? Thy proofless Clamours will not do, to bear us down, nor thy hideous out-cry and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that <hi>never greater Blasphemies were spoke by Man, than by</hi> Fox. For shame leave these thy Malicious Calumnies.</p>
            <p>7. What Blasphemy and Idolatry provest thou against <hi>John Blackling</hi>'s Testimony, that <hi>G. F. was blessed with honour above above many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> Were there not Elders worthy of double
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106641:20"/>
Honour? And is not that Honour <hi>Eternal,</hi> which God gives, and is from above, and wherewith he Honours them, that Honour him?</p>
            <p>8. And that his <hi>Life Reigns,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Life that <hi>G. F.</hi> partook of,) Is not Christ the Life of all his true Believers and Followers?</p>
            <p>9. <hi>His tender Words in the Lords Love were my S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>If these were <hi>J. B</hi>'s Words, what Blasphemy or Idolatry was in them; as believing <hi>G. F.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in the Lord's Love for his Souls Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?

And did not Christ's Ministers comfort the otints who were in Trouble, by the Comfort where with they themselves were comforted of God? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>Were these Blasphemous or Idolatrous, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posest thou, <hi>F. Bugg?</hi> Oh, how filthy, Loud and Clamourous art thou in thy Charges, and how poor, faint, dull and short in thy proof!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi>'s Third Charge against the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they deny the Scriptures, by speaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptously of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Their Contemptuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Holy Scripture, their contempt of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> p. 32, 33.</p>
            <p>We utterly deny these his Charges, as both Calumnious, and directly contrary to our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. His Allegations are fully answered in these our Three Treatises, <hi>viz. A Charitable Essay; A Just Enquiry,</hi> and <hi>Innocency Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106641:21"/>
But he is so tenacious to his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and so Implacable, that he'll receive no Answer; but repeat and impose his old worn, Reproachful Stuff, over and over again.</p>
            <p>I am sure our Friends Books alledged by him, if impartially viewed, will clear them in this Case, from either <hi>Denying or Contemning the Holy Scriptures.</hi> And even that of <hi>News coming out of the North,</hi> so often objected, doth in divers parts of it clear the point, both by the numerous Quotations of the Scripture in the Margents, as also where its therein said, <hi>the Lord hath spoken by his former Prophets;</hi> and what? <hi>The Scripture.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 8, <hi>Christ Jesus the Substance of the Prophets,</hi> Ibid. <hi>The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Prophets of God, and Apostles of Christ</hi> (<hi>against false Prophets and the Works of the World,</hi>) owned, And <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>The Scriptures and Saints Conditions, and the Words spoken by the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, owned.</hi> And in <hi>Eternal Substantial Truths,</hi> p. 17. <hi>The Life and power of God gave forth the Scriptures,</hi> (he saith.)</p>
            <p>Now could this be any Contempt of Holy Scripture? No, but the Contrary. And where do the Quakers say, <hi>that to preach out of them,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>) is <hi>Conjuration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be true Preaching out of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture by the Spirit of Truth; and there is false Preaching, by perverting the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bugg</hi>'s own instance which is against them that <hi>study to raise a Living thing out of the</hi>

               <hi>Dead; to raise the Spirit out of the Letter, are Conjurers and Diviners, their teaching not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the mouth of the Lord,</hi> p. 34. This is no proof of his general Charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that to preach out of the Holy Scriptures, is Conjuration.</hi> Quer. Where proves he these Words?</p>
            <p>His Observation is also false, <hi>That the Quakers call the Holy Scriptures Death, Dust, and Serpents Meat.</hi> This is a foul perversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing they esteem the Holy Doctrine, to be the Holy Scripture; which he also has granted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to. And our distinguishing between the outward Writing or Books and the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein contained, and between the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. This was no <hi>Juggle,</hi> nor <hi>any Contempt of Holy Scripture,</hi> as falsly suggested, <hi>p.</hi> 33, 36.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Scriptures mentioned amongst those Writings which</hi> I. P. <hi>did bring to the Exchange.</hi> And to this F. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>Surely they could not burn the Holy Spirit; and that it seems they can call the Bible the Holy Scriptures, for a Wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> p. 36. This is impertinent, as well as Malicious; for the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was with the respect to the Doctrine therein contained; for I must tell <hi>F. B.</hi> that it would shew Contempt to Holy Scripture, even to the Holy Doctrine contained in the Bible, if a Person should voluntarily offer to burn the Bible it self, as the King of <hi>Judah</hi> did <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Roll, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. (though he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urn the Word of the Lord.) But to say the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106641:22"/>
Bible or Books made up of Paper and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters will decay and turn to Dust, but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctrine, Word and Spirit from whence it came, will endure: This is no Contempt of Holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet to the Bible.</p>
            <p>His Saying <hi>G. W. holdly imposes upon the World, that though they call the Scripture Dust,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet they do not call the Holy Scripture so.</hi> The first part he falsly imposeth upon me, as he doth on the Quakers.

            <p>Thus he imposeth his horrid and gross Lies (against us) upon the World; as also that the <hi>Quakers never did beg Pardon of God for Christ's sake;</hi> and <hi>that they do prefer their own Books, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Epistles before the Scriptures,</hi> p. 40.

We are not conscious to our selves of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, either in not believing Sprinkling Infants to be of Divine Institution, or in not practising <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, which is that of Water, not mentioned in <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> Mat. 28. And <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> (i. e. <hi>as oft as ye do it.</hi>) But of how long continuance, and till what coming of Christ is the Question? Though we believe this and all other Precepts both of God and Christ were <hi>holy</hi> under their several Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, yet it follows not that we must reeds still practise every thidg that <hi>was holy,</hi> or else be condemned as not believing the Doctrine and Precepts of Scripture to be <hi>holy. F. Bugg</hi> will make no good Logick of such Arguments and Consequences; for that were to bring us back to the divers Washings, Baptisms, Tythes, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Pussovers and Circumcisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under ehe Law; which were <hi>all holy</hi> in their first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Dedication.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis also notoriously false, <hi>that we do prefer our own Books, Papers and Epistles before the Scriptures, (i. e. the holy Scriptures,</hi>) because some of them are occasionally read in some of our Meetings; for both in our Ministry, Books and Epistles, People are often referred to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures for proof, and excited to read them, and that they may understand, believe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106641:24"/>
and live according to the same, by the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God's Holy Spirit. And therefore we esteem and prefer the Holy Scriptures before our own Writings, contrary to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s false Aspersion upon the Quakers; i. e. <hi>That they make void the holy Scripture by their Traditional Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets.</hi> His gross Lies of this kind are numerous; the Lord rebuke his Lying Spirit, and great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Fourth Charge against the Quakers. <hi>They deny the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, as Baptism and the Lord's Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We deny this Charge, as laid down without distinction; and that for our Reason F. B. cites, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>As for Baptism and the Lords Supper, Scripturally considered in their several Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, in the Figure and Substance, we confess and own.</q> To this F. B. presently answers, <hi>This is false as their Books declare, p.</hi> 45. What's false? He considers not he knows not what? He answers very inadvertently, are not Baptism and the Lord's Supper, Scriptural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, both as in the Figure and in the Substance, in the Type, and in the Antitype? I never heard any true Convert Christian, or real Protestant say, this is false before. Was not <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism with Water, a <hi>Figure</hi> of Christ's Baptism with the Spirit? And of the Washing of Regeneration? Which was greater? And was not the outward Supper, Bread and Cup, in Commemoration of Christ's Death, a Figure also of his Inward Spiritual
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106641:25"/>
Supper, Eating and Drinking with him in his Kingdom? Who said he, except ye eat my Flesh, and Drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you. Where then is the <hi>falshood</hi> in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Baptism and the Lord's Supper, in the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Substance?</hi> F. <hi>B.</hi> quotes <hi>E. Burrough's</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>The Bread and Wine is visible and carnal, a figure of a Spiritual thing.</hi> And what then? are they Spiritual, or the Substance which is Christ? That's Popery, which the Martyrs opposed, who esteemed the outward Elements, the Bread and the Cup, <hi>figurative, or a Figure of the Body and Blood of Christ spiritually receivedly Faith.</hi> What great Error then can <hi>F.</hi> B. prove against us therein?</p>
            <p>He farther cites <hi>E. B.</hi> in this point, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>p.</hi> 45, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>For Christ never since he was sacrificed, brake the Bread, and drank the Cup with his Disciples, <hi>p.</hi> 581, (instead of 518.) <hi>We do deny, and do say it is no Ordinance of God, neither was it ever commanded of him, or practised by the Saints, but is an Institution of the Whore of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> This <hi>F. B.</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>E. B.</hi> to say of the Bread and the Cup, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cited in the next antecedent Words, as here.) Oh sad! what a gross Perverter art thou <hi>F. B?</hi> This has been often thy fallacious manner of Citation to abuse us; as 'tis plain, that which <hi>E.

in <hi>E.</hi> B'<hi>s.</hi> p. 518, (before quoted,) and not breaking of Bread, and drinking of the Cup' as given by Christ unto his Disciples: <hi>E.</hi> B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knew this was some time practised by Believers' but not the other; and it had been more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious for <hi>F.</hi> B. to have convicted him of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror about <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> than to mis-represent him. Though I grant <hi>E.</hi> B. in <hi>p.</hi> 518, objects against <hi>their manner of breaking Bread, and drinking Wine among the Unconverted and Unregenerate, as not commanded of God, nor practised by his Saints.</hi> But does not call the breaking of Bread, and drinking Wine, <hi>a Popish Institution of</hi> Rome, as he does <hi>Sprinkling Infants, and their calling it the Baptism into the Faith.</hi> This point is answered in the <hi>Quakers Vindication,</hi> p. 2. col. 1. But <hi>F.</hi> B. is more expert in mis-representing, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and railing, than in rational Argument, or fair Disputation.</p>
            <p>As to our Exception against <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> and <hi>seeming</hi> thereby to allow of <hi>Dipping,</hi> p. 46. we except against the one as unscriptural, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the other as once Scriptural in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dispensation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Fifth and Sixth Charge against the Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they undervalue the Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ; and exalt their own Sufferings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Sufferings of Christ, above the Sufferings of the Apostles, above the Sufferings of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, or any Christians since the Days of Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106641:26"/>We deny these Charges, as expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Principle, and publick known Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, both highly valuing and exalting the Death and Sufferings of Christ above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: His charging the Quakers to <hi>exalt</hi> their Sufferings above the Sufferings of Christ, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as if they so <hi>lifted up, extolled, dignified</hi> or rendred their Sufferings <hi>more excellent</hi> than Christ's. This is a most gross Calumny cast upon the People called Quakers, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contrary to their Intention and Principle. Though F. B. takes advantage at some Words of <hi>E. B's,</hi> which he partially cites, adding the Words [<hi>called Quakers,</hi>] and as unfairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strues against the Quakers in general; as where he saith, <hi>Q.</hi> Mary's <hi>Days brought not forth a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering more cruel, F. B.</hi> leaves out [<hi>in many respects,</hi>] which many respects, he explains to be about tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Matters, as for not <hi>putting off the Hat,</hi> (<hi>thee</hi> or <hi>thou</hi> to a Person) and denying the circumstance of <hi>Swearing, and Hundreds suffering on Suspicion, when nothing could be charged against them; and that this was contrary to</hi> Magna Charta. Thus <hi>E. B.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the Arbitrary Proceedings of those in power, in 1657. Though I cannot warrant all his comparative Expressions, but grant that the Passage objected against <hi>E. B.</hi> in this place, was not so well worded as intended accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Explication: For by <hi>greater and more cruel Suffering,</hi> I cannot think <hi>E. B.</hi> so senseless, as to intend <hi>in all Respects;</hi> as that the People of God in our Age, have unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more cruel</hi> Sufferings than all the Primitive Sufferers, Apostles and Martyrs in the Ten Persecutions; no sure, but in <hi>some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi> wherein they did not suffer then, upon such small Pretences as many did in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, without any such pretext of Law, as the <hi>Jews</hi> pretended against Christ. However, tho' the Sufferings of the People of God among us, was far short of the Sufferings in the Apostles Days, and in the Ten Persecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet F. B. gives but a mean and partial Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; namely, of <hi>a few Imprisonments, and some small Distresses,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the Twenty Five Years he was amongst the Quakers, he might have remembred also, the <hi>cruel Whippings,</hi> and <hi>tedious Imprisonments, close Confinements</hi> many of God's People have met withal here in <hi>Old England,</hi> together with <hi>cruel Beatings, Stockings, Stonings,</hi> &amp;c. As also the sad Accounts from <hi>New England,</hi> of the cruel and barbarous <hi>Whippings, Cutting Ears, Hanging and putting to Death,</hi> divers of our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Friends there: I may not say, this was so cruel as the Sufferings in the Days of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and Ten Persecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But these being inflicted by Professors of Christianity in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New England;</hi> it seemed more <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> in them, than in the Heathens, who pretended to no such Religion and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106641:27"/>One remarkable Passage of <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi>'s, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to the Fifth and Sixth Charge against the Quakers, I must needs take some notice of. In his Sheet to the Parliament, he puts a Query, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether was greatest, the Sufferings of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or the Sufferings of Christ? To which</hi> (<hi>Bugg</hi> saith) G. W. <hi>gave no direct Answer, but glossed it over, as his usual way is; for if he had answered, that the Sufferings of the Quakers had been greatest, as their Doctors teach,</hi> (a gross Lie by the way,) <hi>the People would have been ready to Stone him for Blasphemy. Again, if he had said, the Sufferings of Christ had been the greatest, he had then given the Lye to</hi> E. B. <hi>So that he was in a great strait like the Pharisees of old their Predecessors.</hi> (Thus far <hi>Bugg,</hi>) p. 47, 48.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> I pray thee see, and I wish thy Ministers <hi>William Smi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hies,</hi> and <hi>Isaac Archer,</hi> may see what a notorious wilful Liar thou art, in this very point, in saying, <hi>G. W.</hi> gave no <hi>direct Answer to thy Question, but was in a great strait.</hi> To evince thy wilful Lie herein, do but review thy own Query, and <hi>G. W</hi>'s. direct Answer therein, in the <hi>Quak. Vindic.</hi> p. 2. <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Query 5. <hi>Whether was the Sufferings of Christ, or the Sufferings of the Quakers greatest?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>1. In the First place we answer, the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, in the nature of them, both inward and outward, in Agony of Soul, and Pains of Body, by that most cruel Death of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106641:27"/>
the Cross, following that of Scourging and Crowning with Thorns.</p>
               <p>2. It was most unjustly and wickedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by his Persecutors the <hi>Jews</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; yet worse'in the <hi>Jews,</hi> because they might have known better, and because they prosecuted him upon false Witness. And as Christ's Sufferings were most Cruel and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, both as to the Nature thereof, and the Dignity of him that suffered, so he was a most acceptable Sacrifice, and sweet smelling Savour to God, and his Suffering and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Universal Advantage and Benefit to Mankind, in that he died for all Men, and and gave himself a Ransom for all, that all might be capable of Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now pray observe, that <hi>G. W.</hi> gave a direct Answer to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Query, <hi>viz. Whether was the sufferings of Christ, or the sufferings of the Quakers greatest? G. W.</hi> &amp;c. answers directly, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Sufferings of Christ in the nature of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Christ's Sufferings most exalted and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because of the Dignity of him that suffered. And this was obvious to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Eyes in Print, in our said <hi>Vindication;</hi> and therefore then <hi>F. B.</hi> must needs be a notorious wilful Liar herein, in affirming <hi>G. W. gave no direct Answer to thy Query, but was in a great strait.</hi> And as to <hi>E. B</hi>'s. intention and Principle, he exalted Christ's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in their <hi>worth, dignity</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> above all other Men's, as appears by his own and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <q>As Thousands can witness, who have heard us both preach up, and contend for the free Grace of God to all Men; and thereby (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the Grace of God,) Christ tasted Death for every Man, and died for all Men, and gave himself a Ransom for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2.

And this is not all, but he thinks thereupon to debase me, by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding me with my former Estate, saying, <hi>G.

            <p>Though he somewhat mistakes as to Time and Age, yet <hi>that Poverty</hi> I am not at all asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of; it was for Christ's sake that I was made low and poor: I was no whit behind <hi>F.

And as for being <hi>fed at</hi> F. B's. Table, I think 'twas not very often, whether Three or Four Times I remember not; and I suppose it was not without some Invitations by him to his House: Didst not thou <hi>F.

Surely it was not then intended to upbraid me in Print, with <hi>seeding at thy Table.</hi> Thou wast then more a Man, and of more Civility, 'tis pity thy Conversion to the Priests and Levites should so much deprive thee both of <hi>Compassion, Natural Affection</hi> and <hi>Civility:</hi> However since 'tis thy pleasure thus to

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106641:31"/>
thy <hi>getting a Justice's Warrant, was to the intent</hi> to get me to own my Book, <hi>Judgment fixed, N.

            <p>4. <hi>A Gross Perverter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I deny as a gross Lie, and his Instance, (though unfairly cited,) Is no proof thereof: 'Tis evident that the Instances <hi>Bugg</hi> brought in his Sheet, to prove the <hi>Quakers Contempt of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reviling Christ's Magistrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> were out of <hi>E.

               <hi>F.

            <p>Pray observe, this seems a heavy Charge, as if <hi>F. B.</hi> had a Mind to hang us all, as well as to Pillory and Cage us. But here are several no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Falshoods contained in these his Words, in divers respects. As <hi>First, that we Summons the King's Subjects;</hi> this is general, and without Exception too. Query, Who issues out Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's for the King's Subjects? <hi>Secondly,</hi> And what Subjects are they? I know no such Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but in Free and Christian Agreement Our Yearly Meeting, (which has been of many Years standing, is innocently held for Religious Good and Christian Ends, in the Law of God and for Peace, good Order, Amity and Unit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the Churches of Christ; that we may as God's People and Christian Society, be helpful and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106641:32"/>
serviceable one to another in our Day. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> And this our Annual Meeting is of no such intent or design to be as a <hi>general Council or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to make Laws, Edicts or Canons for the Kings Subejcts throughout</hi> England <hi>to observe, in direct opposition to those of the King and Parliament,</hi> (as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> most malitiously suggests.) For <hi>First,</hi> We know no Laws, Edicts or Canons we have to make, either for the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or for our selves, but to be helpful in the truth, and to stir up one another to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, to that Law and Testimony that God has given and made known to us, who is our Lawgiver.</p>
            <p>But what is this <hi>Usurpation</hi> so highly charged against us? and what <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> do we make? To this he bids us see our Yearly Epistle, <hi>May</hi> 1675, where (he saith), <hi>viz. In opposition to the Law the King and Parliament made, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ls a <hi>Law made by us in opposition to King and Parliament,</hi> we know no such Law made by us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t an Antient, Apostolical and Christian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony and Exhortation, which our said Year-Meeting gave to our Friends; and which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106641:33"/>
had been our Care and Practice from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That an open Testimony for the Lord should be borne, and a publick Standard for Truth and Righteousness, upheld in the power and Spirit of God, by our open and known Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The said Meeting giving Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Judgment, that all Friends gathered in the Name of Jesus, keep up those publick Testimonies, and not to decline, forsake or remove their publick Assemblies.</q>
            <p>Whereby 'tis plain, that this Advice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for no other end, than for their keeping their Publick Assembles for the Worship of God, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and very agreeable to the Holy Apostles Exhortation, <hi>not for saking the Assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how proves F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> that this Advice was a Law made by our said Meeting, in opposition to the Law made by the King and Parliament? Has he not herein reflected upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and aspersed the King and Parliament? For where did they make a Law against publick Assemblies, gathered in the Name of Jesus Christ to worship God? How doth he prove the Laws made against <hi>Conventicles,</hi> or <hi>Seditious Meetings, under pretence of Religious Exercise,</hi> &amp;c. were made against such Assemblies as met in the Name and Power of Christ Jesus, really to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in Spirit and Truth? for such were our Assemblies advised to be kept.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106641:33"/>Another Instance <hi>Bugg</hi> has against us, <hi>That our Books be spread up and down the Nation,</hi> &amp;c. And what Usurpation or Justling with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is this? Why not our Books be spread as well as his? And must he have all the liberty to spread his dirty Defaming Books, and we not have liberty to divulge Answers to them, to remove his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lumnies? That's very unfair and unjust. But he objects <hi>being unlicensed;</hi> that's not true of all our Books.

            <p>Which thou <hi>F. B.</hi> had once a Testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; but wast unfaithful, and turned thy back thereof. But farther, our Christian Testimony against Tithes, was neither <hi>Law, Edict,</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106641:34"/>
of our own making; but what we received, and were perswaded of in Conscience, by the Light and Testimony of Jesus Christ from the begining.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That none should carry Guns in their Ships:</hi> This is perversly and mischievously worded by <hi>F.

            <p>Whereas the Caution in our said Epistle was Tender and Christian, relating only to some Ship-Masters, reputed Quakers, who contrary to their former Principle and Practise, (and to the injury of their own Souls and Consciences, by their declension, and placing their Security in that which is altogether Insecure,) <hi>carry Guns,</hi> &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

'Tis more like to be a <hi>weakening;</hi> for any such (by acting contrary to their Principle and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and letting in Unbelief,) to provoke God to deliver them up to their Enemy to be destroyed.</p>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106641:34"/>Let it be observed how tender and careful our said Yearly Meeting was in this very Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with respect both to our Christian Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the outward Government also, in the next following Passage which <hi>F.

            <q>Dear Friends, you very well know our Christian Principle and Profession in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both with respect to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> that because we are Subjects of <hi>Christ's</hi> Kingdom, which is not of this World, we cannot fight, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36, Yet being Subjects of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Kingdom, we pay our Taxes, Tribute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Example of Christ and his Holy Apostles relating to Christ's Kingdom and <hi>Caesars,</hi> wherein we are careful not to offend, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 27. and 22. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7.

Christ's Flesh was the Vail?

But also his <hi>being the Anointed, as well as the Anointing,</hi> p. 5.

            <p>'Tis strange that thou should shew so much Envy against that Innocent Man, as to charge him with Contempt of our Lord Jesus, who did more sincerely believe and confess him, both in Principle, Doctrine, Charity and Innocent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, (than thou hast done) whose sincere

Wilt thou stand to this Proposition yea or nay, according to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s said Charge and Allegation, in his Sheet? If thou wilt, then it will appear who is in the Spirit of <hi>Anti-christ, G.

            <p>And for <hi>F.

But how know'st thou that? When contrarywise like a Busie-Body in other Mens Matters, and malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary, he did interpose with his inveterate Lying Pamplet to the Parliament, against the People called Quakers, even at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim when our Friends were petitioning the House of Commons for ease to the said People in general in case of Oaths. Did not this tend
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106641:40"/>
to obstruct favour being shewn them? With what Face or Conscience then canst thou say thou believest he would not damage Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Quakers, when his Invective Pamphlet made no such distinction? For shame Man do not excuse such an act of apparent Malice and Intrusion, who also hast farther shewn how thou dost second <hi>Bugg</hi> in Malice and Partiality, where thou sayest Liberty of Conscience is but just and reasonable, for such as are truly conscientious, if they could be truly distinguished from <hi>G.
