         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beyond Barbarism, in any who have been
conversant in the least measure with any transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>State:</hi> A Knight he was of choice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals,
and noble Extraction, who may be said to have King'd it
abroad half his age in Embassies, by representing the person of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Prince in most of the Courts of Christendom, amongst the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and most sagacious sort of Nations; for he was thrice sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
to the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> from the most serene Prince
<hi>James</hi> the first King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> (by whom the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was conferred upon him.) Once to the States of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi>
Twice to <hi>Charls Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Once to
the <hi>United Princes</hi> of <hi>Upper Germany</hi> in the Convention at <hi>Heyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun.</hi>
Lastly, He was sent Extraordinary Ambassadour to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
<hi>Leopold,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> Imperial Cities, <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
and <hi>Ulm,</hi> and to the <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> himself, <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the second: And however it may be thought by some that after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great and noble employments, the Provost ship of <hi>Eaton</hi> was a place
not considerable enough for a personage of his merit; yet if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sedateness of his temper and spirit, he being of a speculative and
quiescent disposition, it seems to have been rather his own choice, then
any want of regard, in those times, to a man so highly deserving of the
Commonwealth; and consequently, it appears that those weighty affairs
he manag'd both at home and abroad with so much honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were rather the effects of his zeal to the service of his King and
Country, then of any aspiring or ambitious thoughts; seeing he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
<pb facs="tcp:93045:4"/>
the highest places of honour and profit, which he merited at the hands
of a great King, for the more contenting enjoyments of a solitary and
studious retirement. Had he been never known unto the world until
the publishing of his late works called <hi>Reliquiae Wottonianae,</hi> there is
in them contained that which may abundantly demonstrate how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he was accomplish'd both in the severer and politer Arts. Not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon the many <hi>Elogiums</hi> deservedly fixt upon his fame by the
most learned and judicious persons both Native and Forraign; I shall
only insert what the most vogu'd <hi>Poet</hi> of this age hath sung of his skill
in Tongues.

It were but needless therefore to premise any thing concerning these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
discourses, written by a person of such a known and celebrated
worth, but only this, that by the high quality of his negotiations in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Courts, he had the greatest advantage that could be to feel the
pulse of Government, and make inspections into those <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi>
those mysteries of <hi>State,</hi> which he communicates here to the world, in
many choice and judicious Observations, whereby the discerning Reader
may be will acqnainted with the state of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the interest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies,
and power of most <hi>Princes,</hi> together with the occasions
and motives of most of the Wars that hapned the last century, whereof
some came from slight quarrels; for he tells you that <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Duke</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> made a war for a <hi>Cart-load</hi> of <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,</hi>
in which he breath'd his last: With these <hi>Modern observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
he intermingles many ancient passages, both of <hi>Greeks</hi> and

STATE
OF
CHRISTENDOME.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had lived many years in voluntary exile and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and saw that the most happy and fortunate
success, which it pleased the Almighty to send unto my
gracious Soveraign against the malicious and hostile At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarch, both openly and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly,
practised against her sacred Person, and invincible
State and Kingdom, I began to despair of my long desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
return into my native Countrey, and to consider with
my self, with what price I might best redeem my sweet and inestimable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Sometimes I wished that her Majesty had, (as the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes have)
many confined and banished men abroad, upon whose heads there are great
Fines set, to invite others to kill them, in hope to receive those Fines in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
of their murther: But my wishes vanished as smoak in the wind,
and as long as I dwelt in those cogitations, me-thought I did nothing else but
build Castles in the Ayr; then I applied my wits to think upon some other
means of better hope, and more probability; and supposed that to murther
some notable Traytor, or professed enemy to my Prince and Countrey, might
be a ready way to purchase my desire: But the great difficulty to escape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
the continual terror that such an offence might breed unto my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the perpetual infamy that followeth the bloody Executioners of
trayterous Murderers, (for I held it trayterous to kill my friend and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance)
made both my heart and my hand to abhor any such action:
<hi>Martius Coriolanus</hi> seemed unto me a most happy man, who, when in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of a few mistaken injuries, he had wrought his Countrey great despight
and annoyance, suffered himself with much difficulty, to be intreated by his
Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, his Mother, and the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to return home, and to become
so great a Friend, as he had been a Foe unto his country. That day should
have been more joyful unto me then the day of my birth and nativity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I might have seen a Letter from any of my friends, with assurance of my
pardon to call me home. But I find my self so much inferiour to <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
in good fortune, as I come behind him in manly valour, and other laudible
qualities. Whilest I lived in this perplexity, I hapned (by chance) to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93045:13"/>
meet with an honest and kind English Gentleman, who was lately come out
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and meant to sojourn a few moneths in <hi>France,</hi> and then to return
into <hi>England;</hi> He knew both me and my friends very well: And although
his License forbad him to converse with any Fugitives, yet hearing (by
common and credible report) that I was not so malicious as the rest of my
Countrey-men, but lived only for my conscience abroad, he adventured
now and then to use my company, and with me, and in my hearing, to use
greater liberty of speech then with any other of our Nation. Whereupon I
presumed, that as I was trusted, so I might trust him again; and as he did
conceal nothing from me, so I might adventure to reveal to him the secret
projects of my inward cogitations: I therefore acquainted him with my ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire to return, and with the great difficulty which I found to procure
my return; and he perceiving that my words agreed with my wishes, and
that my tongue uttered nothing but what my heart thought, promised me
faithfully to effect my desire, if I would be content to grant his request: I
presuming that he would demand nothing but that which should be both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and lawful, gave him my faithful promise to satisfie his demand: He
accepted my offer, and uttered his mind in this manner.</p>
            <p>In my travel I have heard many things which I knew not when I came out
of <hi>England,</hi> and no more then I would, and yet much more then I can be
well able to answer when I come home; if you will be as willing, as I know
you are able, to frame me a good and sufficient answer to all that I have heard,
all the friends which I have in <hi>England</hi> shall fail me, but that I will purchase
your return home with credit and countenance: And because your promise
bindeth you to vouchsafe me this favour; I will as briefly as I can possible,
shew you to what points I shall need, and most desire your answer. I heard
Princes generally reprehend the <hi>Flomings,</hi> perhaps more boldly then justly,
accused of rebellion; the <hi>French</hi> men, I know not how truly, burthened
with the same crime; and our Sovereign in my poor opinion wrongfully bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for aiding both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Flemish</hi> Nations. I heard some men to
maintain this strange opinion, that the <hi>Turk</hi> had long before this day been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
subverted, or sorely weakned, had not her Majesty holpen those two
Nations, which hindred both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Kings from imploying
their united forces to the utter subversion of the <hi>Turk.</hi> I heard some men charge
us with vain-glory, as men that had learned of the vain-glorious Souldier in
<hi>Terence,</hi> to brag of our valour and exploits in <hi>France,</hi> where they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe that we ever obtained the tenth part of that which we boast to have
atcheived: And others who were better acquainted with our Histories, and
more affected with our conquests, do wonder and marvell greatly howwe
could lose in a very few years all that our Predecessors got with much effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of blood, and with great difficulty. I heard the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (our mortal
and professed Enemy) highly commended, for that his Predecessors could
of a mean Earl, make themselves mighty Monarchs, and because that he with
his wisdom doth maintain and keep all that they got: I heard his might mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
his Policy admired, his Government extolled, his Wisdom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
his Wealth feared, and all his Actions justified: I heard contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
our <hi>Portugal</hi> Voyage condemned, the Cause thereof disliked, the Success
dispraised, the Entertainment given unto <hi>Don Antonio</hi> disallowed, and her
Majesty accused to have given the <hi>Spaniard</hi> many and divers occasions of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment:
The death of the late Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> The intercepting of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
monies sent into the Low Countries, The proceeding against Catholicks,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93045:13"/>
the expulsion of the Popes authority out of <hi>England,</hi> the sending away of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour in some disgrace, and our League and Amity with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces, are the principal causes that displeased the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> I heard
it imputed unto her Majesty as a fault, that her Grace continued in league
with the late <hi>French</hi> King, who was charged to be a Heretick, a Waster of
his Revenues, a Lover of dishonest women, a Murderer of the Duke and
Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and a Prince neither able nor worthy to govern so great
and mighty a Kingdom as <hi>France.</hi> I heard the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempts and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
against <hi>England</hi> justified, because our Queen was excommunicated, her
people not able nor willing to help and succour her, her Subjects overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with unaccustomed Subsidies, our Forces not sufficient to encounter with
his strength, and our Realm easie to be subdued by Forraigners. I heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
some men condemn the <hi>Spaniard</hi> of great folly, for ruling the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by strangers; for not granting liberty of conscience unto his Subjects in
those Countries, for taking upon him to enforce them to alter and change
their Religion; for intending to reduce all Protestants to the ancient professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Papistry, for aiding the Leaguers in <hi>France,</hi> and for attempting to
make himself Monarch of the world. I heard some think it a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to subvert him, others suppose it to be a very easie matter to overthrow
him, and many desirous to know the means how to weaken him; I heard
the tumults of <hi>Aragon</hi> diversly construed; the murder of <hi>Escovedo</hi> sundry
wayes censured, and the proceedings against <hi>Antonio Perez</hi> justified by some,
and condemned by others. To be short, I heard many say more then I can
well and readily remember; and yet not so much as I can be content to
hear in praise of my Countrey, and in disgrace of <hi>Spain;</hi> in commendation of
our Princess, and in dispraise of the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> in allowance and approbation
of all her actions, and in reprehension of all, or most part of his Enterprises.
These things were in substance all that I heard; some to my comfort, and
others to my grief: And if in clearing all these things you will vouchsafe me
your paines, I will warrant your return within a very short while, after that
you shall have sent me your Treatise. Your credit with Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> your
acquaintance with <hi>Morgan,</hi> your Friendship with <hi>Thomas Throgmorton,</hi> your
conversation with <hi>Charles Pagett,</hi> and your long experience in forraign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
hath undoubtedly enabled you to give me a full satisfaction to all these
demands. If you run through them lightly, you shall rather point at them
then please me; If you dwell upon them long, you may fear to be thought
too tedious: And yet because you have leisure enough to handle them at large,
I shall take great delight to see and read them somewhat largely handled.</p>
            <p>Such was his speech, and this my short reply. In hope of performance
of your promise, I will undertake your task; not because I take my self able
to answer your expectation, but to shew you that I will hazard my poor
credit to recover my dear Countrey; and because I trust you will use my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for your instruction, and not to my discredit; You may be instructed
if you read them advisedly, and I discredited if you make them common.
To be short, with assurance of his secrecy, I undertook his task; if he shall
hold his promise, I shall think my labours well bestowed: if they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my return, I shall have employed my pains to my contentment. And
if my pains may pleasure and satisfie the Readers, their satisfaction shall dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my joyes, when I shall attain safe and free access unto the long desired
place of my Nativity.</p>
            <p>The singular affection which you bear unto me, and the great good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93045:14"/>
which unworthily you have conceived of me, have greatly deceived you,
in making especial choice of me, as of one better able then any other of your
wise and discreet friends, to deliver unto you a sound and sure Judgment of
the present Estate of Christendome. You see <hi>Flanders</hi> in trouble; <hi>France</hi>
in Arms; <hi>Scotland</hi> in division; and the whole remainder of the universal
Christian world, either (as Neutrals) idly looking and gazing on their mise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries,
or (as men interessed in the same cause) voluntarily ayding and abetting
them, or their enemies: This sight seemeth unto you very strange, because
that professing one Christ Crucified, fighting under one Master, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the general name of Christians, they give occasion unto the professed
enemy of Christianity, by taking advantage of their unnatural dissention, to
to enlarge his (already too large) Confines and Territories. In truth you
have some cause to marvel hereat; But if it may please you to remember,
That things in common are commonly neglected; that perils which be far
off, and not presently imminent, are little regarded; That dangers which
are at hand, and hang dayly over our heads, carry us away with their
due confideration from the vigilant care and providence which we ought to
have of common Enormities: And lastly, that this careless negligence or the
common Adversary, is no new thing, but a matter of great Antiquity, and
long continuance: You will leave to wonder thereat, and begin to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be ready at the Call and Command of the other Officers, and this is all that
we can do; and who so looketh for more at our hands, erreth as much in
your Opinion, as you are deceived in your Choice: But the Interest which
you have in me, and the hopes which I conceive of you, make me rather to
hazard my poor Credit, then to incur your heavy Displeasure: You may,
and I hope you will, conceal, or excuse my follies; but I would not, and
God forbid I should, deserve the least diminution that may be, of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
favours towards me.</p>
            <p>In hope therefore of your Secresie, I will boldly enter into this Tragical
Discourse; The chief Actors whereof are, The mighty Monarch of <hi>Spain;</hi>
The merciful Queen of <hi>England;</hi> The unfortunate <hi>Don Antonio</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi>
The valiant King of <hi>France;</hi> The Imperious Prelate of <hi>Rome;</hi> The sleeping
and secure States of <hi>Germany;</hi> The Politique and Grave Senate of <hi>Venice;</hi>
And the weak, but wise, Princes of <hi>Italy: Spain</hi> coveteth more then his own;
<hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>France</hi> would gladly recover their own: <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and indeavour only to conserve and maintain their own: <hi>Germany</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the peril that is far off: <hi>Venice</hi> temporizeth wisely; and the rest of <hi>Italy</hi>
sheweth an outward affection to him that is mightiest, but inwardly wisheth his
weakness, and the good and prosperous success of his Adversaries.</p>
            <p>This is in brief the open and hidden <hi>Idea</hi> of the present Estate of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherein the Princes are (as you see) many; their Designs (as you
have heard) too, <hi>viz.</hi> to conserve, and to increase their own; and the means
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93045:14"/>
to effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and accomplish their Desires (as you shall understand) many in
number, and divers in nature.</p>
            <p>Of the Princes, their Designs, and their Means, I will deliver unto you
my opinion in General, and in Particular. Generally: You see, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that by the Competencies, Pretensions, Titles, Quarrels and Debates
of all these Princes, the general Estate of Christendom is greatly weakned,
and the strength of the common Adversary daily increased; That all their
Realms and Dominions are either molested by continual Wars, within the
very Bowels, and poor inward parts of the same; or grieved with intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
charges, in sending out Men and Munition, with other things necessary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the said Wars; That their Subjects are greatly impoverished, by reason of
these Charges, and their hearts sorely oppressed with grief and anguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of these troubles: Lastly, That some of these Princes fain would, and
cannot, others can and will not, redress those Enormities. Now seeing all
this, you cry out with the time against the time; with the time you accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their just complaints with your sorrows, who lament the iniquity of the
time; and against the time, both you and they say, that it is more wicked,
dangerous, and troublesome then ever it was: You think it impossible to find
a Magistrate so just as <hi>Aristides;</hi> An Emperor so good as <hi>Trajan;</hi> A King so
fortunate as <hi>Augustus;</hi> A Prince so valiant as <hi>Alexander;</hi> A Captain so chaste
as <hi>Scipie;</hi> A Councellor so faithful as <hi>Hephestion;</hi> A General so expert as
<hi>Hannibal;</hi> A Conqueror so merciful as the <hi>Romans:</hi> You see no Princes in
this our corrupt Age,<note place="margin">Carion.</note> surnamed Gods, as was <hi>Demetrius</hi> amongst the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;
The delight and love of the people, as was <hi>Titus</hi> amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
The wonder of the world,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as was <hi>Otho</hi> the third, amongst the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
The Founder of their Cities, as was <hi>Caius Marius</hi> amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
The Father of the common people,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as was <hi>Cyrus</hi> amongst the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;<note place="margin">Herodorus.</note>
The Son of fortune, as was <hi>Charles</hi> the Great amongst the Bohemians;
The Buckler of the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">De Hailon.</note> as was <hi>Fabius Maximus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> Or the Sword
of the Country, as was <hi>Marcus Marcellus:</hi> You rather find that some Princes
may be called Tyrants,<note place="margin">Carion.</note> as was <hi>Dionysius;</hi> The Scourge of God, as was <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tila;</hi>
Epicures and God <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as was <hi>Antonius;</hi> Lords and cruel Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
as was <hi>Cambises;</hi> Covetous and Merchants,<note place="margin">Herodotus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as was <hi>Darius;</hi> Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and Effeminate, as was <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi> You see no Honours done unto
Princes of our time,<note place="margin">Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</note> as was done in times past; If they be in Adversity, their
Subjects put not on mourning weeds, as the Romans did when <hi>Manlius</hi> was
in trouble: If they be in Prison, the Clergy giveth not their Treasure, and
the Commonalty the fourth part of their goods,<note place="margin">Holinshed. Polid. Virg.</note> for their Liberty, as the
Clergy and Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> did for the Ransome of <hi>R.</hi> 1. If God
calleth them to his mercy, neither do the women bewail their deaths ten
Moneths together, as the <hi>Roman Dames</hi> did the death of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> nor the
men poll their Heads,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> their Horses and their Mules, or fill the Air with cries,
the Rivers with tears,<note place="margin">Herodot.</note> or the Fields with continual lamentations, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
did for <hi>Masistias:</hi> But contrary wise, some of them are wrongfully driven
from their Kingdoms, as in <hi>Don Antonio</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> others continually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
with Domestical Wars,<note place="margin">Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> as is <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> some untimely

others unjustly persecuted by their unmerciful enemies, as is the merciful

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93045:15"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> and a few of his Predecessors: You see Subjects licensed to rebel
against their Soveraigns, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> You see Fathers
bear Arms against their children, and Brethren war against the seed of their
Mothers Womb, as they do in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> You see Fields that
were wont to be fruitful, to lye now barren and unfertile: Cities that were
rich and populous, to be poor and desolate, Merchants that lived in wealth
and prosperity, to languish in need and penury: Gentlemen that neither
wanted ease or pleasure, to lack all manner of rest and contentment: And
lastly, Men, Women, and Children, that knew not what murther and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres
meant, cruelly murthered, and daily massacred: You see <hi>Germany</hi>
pestered with divers Religions; <hi>Poland</hi> infected with sundry Heresies; <hi>France</hi>
divided into many opinions; <hi>Flanders</hi> distressed by plurality of Religions;
and <hi>England</hi> troubled with <hi>Genevian</hi> Puritans, and obstinate <hi>Barrowists:</hi> You
see in all or some of these Regions, Monasteries subverted, Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
destroyed, Ecclesiastical living abused, and Benefices unworthily colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
You see Justice corruptly administred, Laws dissolutely executed, good
counsel negligently followed, and dissembling flattery more then diligently
embraced: You see new charges daily invented, unaccustomed Subsidies
yearly imposed, extraordinary grievances hourly practised, and unknown
Offices unadvisedly established: You see secret wars under the name of peace,
hidden enemies under the colour of amity, privy seditions under the pretence
of ancient confederacies: You see Nobility to degenerate in vertue from
their Ancestors; Sons to vary in opinion from their Fathers; Neighbours to
dissent in Religion with their next Inhabitants; and Judges not to agree in
matters of Justice, with their fellows in Office: You see the <hi>Puritan</hi> ready in
outward appearance to dye for his Religion; the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> for his; the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi>
for his; the <hi>Lutheran</hi> for his; the <hi>Barrowist</hi> for his; and other Sectaries
for their several Sects and Heresies. Briefly, you see Offices dearly sold,
which were wont to be freely given: Women impudently bold, which were
accustomed to be honestly minded: Men transformed into mis-guised Atires,
and children brought up and misled in unknown vices and impersections.
Now, seeing all this, you fear that variety of Religions may subvert the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
wherein it is suffered,<note place="margin">Dubraevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</note> as it did in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> That new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
may chance to cause a Rebellion in the Regions wherein they are levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as it did in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders:</hi> That Princes degenerating from their
Antecessors,<note place="margin">Dinothus de Bello Belgico.</note> may be driven from their Imperial Crowns, as they have been
in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> That Towns not inhabited, may cause penury amongst
the Nobility, want amongst the Merchants, and extream poverty amongst
the other Inhabitants, as they do in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> And lastly, That
all and every one of these Mischiefs and Miseries, may breed further incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
as they have done in other Countries, in which they have been
either in old time, or within our memory, practised. This sight therefore,
and this fear, ingendreth in your heart a just and worthy dislike of the present
time, and a great desire and delight in the Age of your fore-Fathers: You
condemned the one because it is (as you think) very troublesome and vitious;
and you commend the other, because it was (as you suppose) very peaceable
and vertuous: But if it may like you to confer the one with the other, you
shall find them both in like manner reprehensible, and with equal measure
laudable: For first you are to remember, that all Kingdoms and Common-wealths,
represent in outward shew and appearance, the figure of a humane
body, and have (as our bodies have) their times of health, and their times of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93045:15"/>
sickness; their seasons of prosperity, and their seasons of adversity; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they flourish with wealth and plenty, other times they languish in want
and penury: And as in all Ages, as well as in ours, mens bodies have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
altered, distempered, yea and destroyed with burning Agues, Pestilent
Fevers, contagious Plagues, and other mortal Diseases; so in other times,
as well as at this present, Common-wealths and Kingdoms, resembling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(as I have said) our natural bodies, have suffered distemperatures, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
changes, and subversions, by intolerable exactions, domestical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions,
forrain wars, and other such like inconveniencies, as trouble the
present Estate of Christendome.</p>
            <p>Cast your Eye upon all the same Regions which are now under the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
name Christendom, and see whether in the very Age, or immediately
after the Age of those vertuous and good Princes (of whose glorious Titles
Histories make mention) they felt not, in like manner as we do, the heavy
hand of Gods Indignation; Who (either to plague and punish the sins of the
Fathers in their Children; or to make us know and remember, that our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
although they are constituted and appointed in higher degree then we, yet
they are subject both to his Will and Pleasure, and to our imperfections and
vices, as well as we) sendeth us most commonly a wicked or foolish Son to
rule over us, after a good and wise Father: So he sent (as we may read in
holy Scripture) <hi>Roboam</hi> after <hi>Solomon, Manasses</hi> after <hi>Hezekias, Iehohaz</hi>
after <hi>Iosias, Iehoram</hi> after <hi>Iehosaphat, Ahaz</hi> after <hi>Iotham;</hi> So sent he (as
we read in prosane Histories) <hi>Nero</hi> after <hi>Augustus, Dionisian</hi> after <hi>Vespasian,</hi>
and <hi>Commodus</hi> after <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> All bad and wicked children to Rule
and Govern after their good and vertuous Fathers.</p>
            <p>So sent he (as we find in our English Chronicles) King <hi>Iohn, Edward</hi> the
Second, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second and Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; That their
Jurisdiction, Wickedness, Folly and Cruelty, might not only succeed, but
also illustrate the Wisdom, Goodness, Prudence, and Lenity of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors: for as white appeareth more clear and bright, being placed nigh
unto black; so vertue is more commendable when it is conferred with vice;
and the profits arising thereby are more esteemed, when the incommodities
which always accompany vice and wickedness, do immediately, or not long
after, succeed them.</p>
            <p>And surely, as God herein sheweth his Might and Omnipotency, so he
maketh us also see hereby his Divine Wisdom, and heavenly Providence;
For, since he hath distinguished Region from Region; some by Rivers,
others by Seas; some by Mountains, and others by Desarts: And in these Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he hath made the people of divers natures, and of sundry humors; some
inclined to Peace, others given to War; some to be ruled by gentleness, and
others not to be governed but by rigor and cruelty: For the conservation of
this distinction, and for the preservation of these people, he hath found it
good and expedient to set over them Princes of divers Qualities, and sundry
Natures; that agreeing with the Subjects in exterior dispositions, the inward
affection may not always be perverted by outward inequalities. And because
in his unspeakable Wisdom he knoweth that if he should give unto every
Kingdom a continual Race of conquering and vertuous Princes, neither
the Rivers nor the Seas, the Mountains nor the Desarts, should contain or
restrain their unbridled Ambition, from molesting and invading the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are nigh or far from them, whereby the distinction which he hath
set amongst them, might be utterly subverted; It hath seldom pleased him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93045:16"/>
to bless any one Kingdom with two Princes of like minds,<note place="margin">Plutarch. Justinus.</note> or of like vertues;
Hence it cometh, that as in <hi>Rome</hi> they had their <hi>Pompey,</hi> in <hi>Macedon</hi> their
<hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carion.</note> in <hi>Persia</hi> their <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> their <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and in <hi>France</hi>
their <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Haillan</note> which for their continual and happy Conquests were surnamed
the GREAT. So in the same Kingdomes, aswell as in others, they have
had their Princes, who for their Pusillanimity, Losses, and ill Fortune, might
worthily be baptized by the Surnames of <hi>Weaklings,</hi> and <hi>Unfortunate.</hi> Hence
it cometh, that the Empire of the whole world passed from the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to the
<hi>Medes,</hi> from the <hi>Medes</hi> to the <hi>Persians,</hi> from them to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> from
the <hi>Graecians</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The same Author. with Pol. Virg. and Hector Boetius.</note> from the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>French-men,</hi> and from
the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to the <hi>Germans.</hi> Hence it cometh, that <hi>Italy</hi> hath triumphed
over <hi>France, France</hi> over <hi>Italy; England</hi> over <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(although very seldom) over <hi>England.</hi> Hence it cometh (to be
short) that what the Fathers have got, the children have lost; what the
Conquerors added to their ancient Kingdoms, their Successors either cowardly
or negligently, voluntarily, or forcibly, suffered to be distracted and dissevered
from their Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And as the Empire passed from Nation to Nation, so their calamities, and
the happiness accompanying the Empire and the Emperours, also went from
people to people; for there was never Conquerour that commanded not the
conquered to be obedient unto his will and pleasure, nor Nation subdued,
which did not accomodate himself and his nature unto the disposition and
commandment of the Subduer. Then if the Conqueror was weak and
gentle, the conquered lived in ease and pleasure; if severe and cruel, they
wanted no manner of rigor or cruelty; if poor and needy, they supplyed his
wants and penury; if wanton and leacherous, they satisfied his lusts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
If covetous and an Extortioner, they were subject to Taxes and
Subsidies, if unjust and unrighteous, they suffer wrongs and injuries; brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if any way ill given, or ill disposed, they seldom gave themselves to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and goodness: Such therefore as was the Conqueror, such were the
conquered; and whatsoever it pleased him to prescribe, that they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to perform. His manner of attire was their fashion in apparel; his Will
served them for Lawes, his new Ordinances altered their old Consututions,
his meanest Subjects commanded the best of their Nobility, and his strange
and forraign Language, became their natural and Mother tongue. It they
had Lands, his Courtiers enjoyed them; if Daughters, his Favorites married
them; if Wives, his followers deflowred them; if riches his Souldiers shared
them; if Servants, his Slaves commanded them. Since then many Nations have
been subdued, and men of divers natures have subdued them: Since conquests
have been from the beginning of the world, and conquerors have always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the world: Since Force hath ever been an enemy unto Justice, and
Equity never bore sway where Arms swayed all things: Since Might overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Right, and Blood asketh Blood; What man liveth in this Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
endured not the torments that he suffereth? Saw not the miseries that
he seeleth? Tasted not the bitterness that he swalloweth? Felt not the wrongs
that he supporteth? Lost not the blood that he loseth? The Sun shineth now as
it hath done, the Stars keep the course they were wont to do, the Sea ebbeth
and floweth as it ever did, and the Rivers run the same way which they always
ran; I mean, (and you may understand how I mean) that all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from nature, duly keep and observe their Natures: I mean therefore
(and you may perceive how I mean) that as long as nature hath created, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93045:16"/>
shall create Princes of diverse dispositions, so long their Subjects have
been and shall be subject unto contrary fortunes; unto good, if they be
good and godly; and unto bad, if they be naught and wicked. In the
good they have enjoyed, and shall enjoy the benefit of Peace: In the
bad, they have felt, and shall feel the discommodities of War. In the
good, they had and shall have all things which they desire: In the bad,
they wanted, and shall want nothing that may discontent them: In the
good, their estate was and will be such as you commend: In the bad,
their condition was and shall be such as you condemn. For as Princes
retain the Prerogatives given and granted unto Princes, so Subjects
maintain still the conditions and qualities incident and proper unto Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Every Prince hath his qualities,<note place="margin">Mores gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. <hi>Munster.</hi>
               </note> and every sort of people hath his
conditions: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> varieth from the <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> from the
<hi>French,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> from the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> from the <hi>English</hi>-man,
and the <hi>English</hi>-man from the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And such as all and every one of these Nations have been, such they
will be as long as they do and shall inhabit the same Climate, and receive
breath from the same Air. And as these Nations naturally hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so by nature they desire not to be subject one unto another; and
therefore, if against their nature, one of them chance to have never so
little authority over the other, the one commandeth imperiously, and
the other obeyeth most unwillingly: and yet it so hapneth oftentimes,
that the Commander is commanded; and they that once obeyed, many
times command, So did <hi>Padua</hi> command <hi>Venice,</hi>

And when things happen as these do, contrary to nature, contrary
to mens expectations, contrary to mens desires, can there be Peace,
where there are so many occasions of War? Love, where there is such
cause of hatred? Upright dealing, where there are so many motives and
incitements unto wrong? Is it possible that proud men should agree with
the humble and meek? Plain dealers, with common Deceivers? Men
of peace, with men of war? Simple Subjects, with subtile Princes?
Especially since Kings of strange natures or Countries never ruled well
or long, people varying from them in nature or conditions. Whence
came it that the <hi>Danes</hi> were driven out of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French-men</hi> out
of <hi>Naples,</hi>

are they odious? truely because they are most commonly insolent. And
wherefore are they insolent? verily because they think it lawful for them
to do what they list. And what moveth them to be of that mind? The good
opinion conceived of themselves, and the bad conceit which they have
and hold of the Conquered. What think they of themselves? marry,
that they are valiant, happy, victorious and fortunate. And what is
their opinion of the Conquered? Undoubtedly they hold them for
Cowards, base minded, vile Slaves, and effeminate persons. And
what are the effects of these sundry opinions? Certainly that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93045:17"/>
heaping cruelty upon cruelty, and the Conquered seeking all
means possible to free and mancipate themselves from bondage and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
they by negligence commit many errors, and these by wary
circumspection and providence, take advantage of their follies: Whence
they lose their conquest, and these recover their Liberty.</p>
            <p>I take oftentimes great delight to read our English Chronicles, and
especially the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">Nicolle Giles An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales. de Aquitanie. Du Haillan Polid. Virg. Holinshed. Hect. Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> and of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I see therein the continual success which they both had against the
Frenchmen; It delighteth me greatly to consider what sway <hi>Edward</hi> the
black Prince bare through all Christendom; to see how Princes Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; to read how Kings sought unto him; to behold how he restored
Kings to their Kingdoms, and drave Usurpers from their Usurpations;
To remember how valiantly he fought at <hi>Poitiers</hi> and <hi>Cressy,</hi> two of the
most famous Battels that ever were fought in <hi>Europe;</hi> To Record how
he took the French King, and most part of the French Nobility Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
How he brought the King and them into <hi>England;</hi> how reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he carryed himself towards the Captive Prince; how Honourably he
was received by his Father and his Subjects; and how lovingly the two
Kings entertained one another, and in the end departed one from the
other: But my joy is turned into sorrow, and my delight into grief, when
I see that the Frenchmen naturally hating Englishmen; that the Prince
forcibly overcharging the Conquered with new Subsidies, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Tributes; that the Gascoins disloyalty forsaking their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto their natural Prince, and that the French King unkindly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hold of the occasions that were offered unto him; they with him,
and he with them, set upon the poor Prince when he was unprovided, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
his Country when he thought little of their coming, and drave
him into <hi>England,</hi> who had driven them out of <hi>France.</hi> The like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and his Successors, for the one was not so
fortunate in Conquering, as the other was unfortunate in his losses; but
hereof hereafter: And now more plainly to my purpose, let me confer
the miseries of this Age, with the calamities of former times. They that
inveigh against the present State, wonder at many things; which I will
begin in order, and let you see and understand, that in times past all
things were in as evil case, as they are at this present.</p>
            <p>They first wonder that the common Adversary of Christendom being
in Arms, and ready to invade part of <hi>Austria;</hi> the civil Wars in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Flanders</hi> cease not, but continue in as great fury, rage and extremity
as ever they did; That the Princes of Christendom labour not to appease
and finish the said Wars, but rather nourish and maintain them; That
the Popes Holiness (whose principal use and commendation hath been,
and is, to set Princes at unity, which be at variance) indeavoureth not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile,
but to animate them in their Quarrels who have taken unjust,
or not very just occasions to war one against another; And that by this
common negligence, the common enemy is not repulsed, but encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to increase his over-large Confines and Territories.</p>
            <p>To this I will Answer before I come unto other Points. This negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
(as I have said before) is no newthing, nor these troubles in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Flanders</hi> a strange President; nor the Causes moving or continuing
the same, are such as never hapned in any other Age: They therefore
who blame our time for this respect, should remember that the <hi>Turk</hi> is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93045:17"/>
grown unto his greatness by the dissention of Christian Princes only.
And that they may the better perceive herein I report a manifest truth,<note place="margin">That the <hi>Turk</hi> is grown great by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention of Christian Princes.</note>
I will prove as much as I have said, by many examples: It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto them that be conversant in Histories, That the <hi>Turks</hi> first
beginning was very base and obscure; That his power was weak and
feeble, and his Dominion small and of less moment, which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
by taking advantage of the discord and variance of Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
who, when they have been in Arms against him for and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the common Cause, have overthrown the common Cause by
sudden jars and debates which arose both untimely and unfortunately
amongst themselves. About the year 1106. <hi>Baldwin</hi> being Successor
unto his Brother <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalemme.</note> in the Kingdom
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Christians besieged <hi>Carra</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and having
with continual Seige and sundry Batteries, driven the same unto great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, they that were in the City determined to yeild themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mercy of the Christians, amongst whom suddenly there arose a
strife and contention whose the City should be, and so they deferred the
entring thereof, until that controversie was decided; in which interim
there came such great succor of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> that they overcame
the <hi>Christians,</hi> and cut all their throats: In like manner the <hi>Christians</hi>
laying Siege unto <hi>Damasco,</hi> and having equalled the Walls thereof with
the ground, through discord and dissention growing suddenly amongst
them, they departed without taking the same, and thought it better to
leave it unto the Infidels, then for one Christian to see it in the possession
of another. And not long after, the <hi>Turk,</hi> by the departure of <hi>Conrade</hi>
the Third, Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, who
returned to their homes by reason of civil Wars, begin in <hi>Germany</hi> by
<hi>Gulfin,</hi> a Rebel of the Empire, the Christians lost the whole Country of
<hi>Edissa,</hi> and whatsoever else they held in <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> Furthermore,
<hi>Baldwyne</hi> the seventh King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being dead, and leaving behind
him one only Infant, while <hi>Guydo Lusignian,</hi> and <hi>Raymond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,</hi>
Brethren in Law unto the King, contended who should succeed him,
<hi>Saladyne</hi> King of <hi>Damasco,</hi> hearing of their contentions, secretly sent
word unto the Earl <hi>Raymond,</hi> that if he would circumcise himself, he
would help and assist him with all his Forces against <hi>Guido,</hi> and make
him King of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> unto which his offer, although the Earl gave
not open ear at that time, yet by outward shews he declared his good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and delight therein, and became <hi>Saladines</hi> great friend and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
who seeing the Earls inclination, favour, and readiness, assembled
presently a great Army of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and set upon the City <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riades,</hi>
belonging unto the Earl <hi>Raymond</hi> (for so it was secretly agreed
betwixt them) thereby to make his Brother in Law, <hi>Guydo Lusignian</hi> to
come to succor him, and then either to kill him, or to take him by the
Earls treachery, as they indeed took him in a certain Battel wherein all
the Christians were slain; and <hi>Saladine</hi> took <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and all <hi>Palestina,</hi>
in the Moneth of <hi>October,</hi> in the year 1187. And <hi>Raymond</hi> in hope that
<hi>Saladine</hi> would perform his promise, circumcised himself; but he failed
of his purpose; For the <hi>Turk</hi> was so far from keeping of his word, that
be drave <hi>Raymond</hi> from all that he had in possession, whereupon he dyed
suddenly, as some say, and others write that he fell into such a desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he hanged himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93045:18"/>
So likewise by the discord of the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Acon,</hi> the
<hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> slew above 30000. Christians; And the <hi>Tartarians</hi>
came into <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> and destroyed both the one and the other
<hi>Armenia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> Surnamed <hi>Barbarossa,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> together with <hi>Richard</hi> the first, King of <hi>England,</hi> lamenting the
late loss of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> resolved to combine themselves, and with their
untied Forces to recover the same; And being come unto <hi>Suega,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained divers great and important Victories, by reason of discord
and dissention betwixt the two Kings; the <hi>French</hi> King not only return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>France,</hi> but also made War upon King <hi>Richard</hi> in his absence, for
the Dukedome of <hi>Normandy;</hi> which King <hi>Richard</hi> understanding (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was then in a readiness to win <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and did great hurt
daily unto the Infidels, insomuch that <hi>Saladine</hi> purposed to yeild <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
up into his hands) returned home into his Country, leaving the
most honourable Enterprise which he had begun; And the <hi>Turks</hi> (who
were sorely decayed and weakned in strenght) through the benefit of his
sudden departure, not only recovered that which they had once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to give over unto the Christians as already lost, but also drove
them from those places which before his departure they quietly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
            <p>It is likewise Recorded of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, that he being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth; and having no other means to purchase
his Absolution, determined to go unto <hi>Asia,</hi> and to recover <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
at his own proper Charges: Where the Almighty so favoured him, that
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> was delivered unto him by composition, and he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King thereof upon <hi>Easter</hi> day, in the year of our Lord 1229. and
because he was also King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Kings thereof at this day bear the
name of Kings of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> But whilst this Emperor was busied in the
Wars and Affairs of the Holy Land, the Pope maligning him for the
Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> procured him secret enemies in <hi>Italy,</hi> mighty Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and such Rebels in every place where there was any
thing appertaining unto him, that the good Emperor was constrained to
return, and to imploy his whole power and strength for the recovery
and conservation of his own; After whose departure, the Christians, by
the Popes Counsel, breaking the Truce which the Emperor had taken
with the <hi>Turk</hi> for their advantage, and dividing themselves into Factions,
by the imitation and example of <hi>Italy,</hi> (which was divided into <hi>Guelfians</hi>

part was assaulted by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> they did not only not help
one another, but of set purpose, the one part assisted the very <hi>Moors</hi> against
the other; by whom they were both destroyed in a very short time, and
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> yeilded up again unto the enemies.</p>
            <p>I might tell how <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by the discord of the Graecians; how
<hi>Anatolia,</hi> by the same cause, and the subtilty of <hi>Ottamon;</hi> how <hi>Caria,

and <hi>Thracia,</hi> were subdued and taken by the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might tell you how that the discord betwixt <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93045:18"/>
and of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Sextus</hi> the Pope,
<hi>Francis Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Floentines,</hi> enforced the poor
<hi>Venetians,</hi> who otherwise were not able to withstand their domestical
Enemies, to give the Turk <hi>Chalcedonia,</hi> a principal City of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Island of <hi>Stalemina,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and an
hundred thousand Duckets in ready money, and eight thousand of yearly
Tribute.</p>
            <p>I might tell you (as <hi>Lewis Fuscarin</hi> Embassadour of <hi>Venice,</hi> in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that he made unto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second, told him) That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
betwixt <hi>Christian</hi> Princes have been so many and so obstinate,
that the <hi>Turk</hi> by reason of them possesseth two Empires, which be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and <hi>Trapesonda:</hi> Four principal Kingdomes of <hi>Persia, Arabia,
Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Twenty great Provinces, and two hundred fair Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>I might tell you how <hi>Barbarossa</hi> burnt <hi>Niza</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and carried
above forty thousand Captives out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples, Pulia,</hi>
and <hi>Calabria,</hi> taking only advantage of the sedition which then raigned
in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might tell you that the Island of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was lost because the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were not able to succour the same, by reason of the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
the Insurrection of the commonalty of <hi>Spain.</hi> I might tell you that the
Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> was lost by the like dissention. And briefly, that
in late years the contentions betwixt the French Kings, and <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, and King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> have greatly hindred the progress,
happy success, and fortunate accomplishment of such enterprises as were
valiantly attempted, and might worthily have been executed against the
aspiring pride of the insatiable <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to tell you all this, and the circumstances thereof, were somewhat
too tedious: And I hasten unto other points; and I shall have occasion
to handle that which is untouched, and not sufficiently declared in this
point, in another place more aptly hereafter.</p>
            <p>The second point whereat they wonder,<note place="margin">An answer to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in times past they did the like</note> is, that Princes hating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
as the Enemies of their estates, the Impugners of their authority, the
Adversaries of their absolute power, and the Subverters of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
do in these dayes not only bear with Rebels, but also harbour
them; not receive them alone, but also aide and assist them. So say
they, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> maintaineth the Rebels of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
commonly called the States of the United Provinces: So say
they, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> supporteth, yea and helpeth with money, men,
and munition, the Rebels of <hi>France,</hi> commonly called <hi>Leaguers:</hi> So
say they, the Popes holiness animateth the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to rebell against their Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>Truly to nourish Rebels is an action in nature hateful, and in policy
dangerous; for to aid the wicked, is to participate with them in their
wickedness: and he that giveth countenance, comfort or succour unto
his Neighbours domestical Enemies, is to look for the like measure, if
his Subjects at any time, and upon any occasion, chance to rebel against
him. But because many things in outward appearance seem good, which
indeed are naught, and vitious; not only in this Age, but also in times
past, are and have been baptized by the names of vertues: It is now, and
it hath always been usual to deem all things honest that are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93045:19"/>
honourable that are expedient, and lawful that may be justified by
examples. Is there any thing that maintaineth States, and upholdeth
Kingdomes better then Justice? And yet lived there not a man, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
professed, and openly said, <hi>Si violandum est jus regnandi causa?</hi>
Is there any thing more odious or unbeseeming a Prince, then to say one
thing and do another? And yet lived there not a Prince that wrote for
his Posie, <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit Regnare?</hi> Is there any greater
sign of an insatiable mind, and of ambitious covetousness, then having
many Kingdomes to covet more Kingdomes? and yet lived there not a
King, who having conquered most part of the world, wept, because he
heard a Philosopher dispute of another world, which he had not as yet
subdued? Is there any thing more cruel or barbarous, then an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
being bound by duty, and commanded by the Almighty to conserve
and preserve his Subjects, to wish and intend the death of all his Subjects?
And yet lived there not an Emperor who wished that all the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> had but one head, that he might cut it off at one blow? And what
moved these Princes, Kings, and Emperors to violate Justice? to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
with all men? to aspire and desire more Kingdomes? and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
and imagine the death of their Subjects, but a colourable shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or of profit? The common Proverb saith, <hi>give a man an Inch,
and he will take an Ell;</hi> and who desireth to do be great, regardeth no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
careth for no kindred, nor esteemeth any Lawes.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> whose fame is notable through all the world, and
whose Actions are imitated by most of the world, seemed outwardly to
be just, and true dealers, never coveting more then their own, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
contented (in common opinion) with their own; And yet in
their inward thoughts they were never satisfied, till all that belonged to
others became their own. They first conquered <hi>Italy,</hi> then <hi>Spain,</hi> next
<hi>France,</hi> afterwards <hi>Germany,</hi> and after them <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi>
their desires and covetousness rested not there, but as men infected with
the Dropsie (the more they drink, the more they desire to drink) so
they, the more they had, the more they desired, and did spread the wings
of their ambitious Avarice over all <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> making themselves
of Lords of one Town, Monarchs of the universal world; In all which
their conquests they carried an outward shew of manifest Equity, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for all and every the wars which they undertook, not one but many
just causes, which they used to declare unto their friends and confederates,
and not to conceal them from their very enemies, unto whom they sent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
an Herald of Arms, who should demand restitution of such things as
they pretended to be unjustly taken from them, or reparation of their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
wrongs: But if a man should now with the eyes of indifferency look
upon the causes which moved them to undertake all, or most part of their
wars; he should find that they were but colorable shews; for what cause had
they to war with <hi>Carthage,</hi> but that they envied <hi>Carthages</hi> greatness? What
moved them to subdue <hi>England,</hi> but because <hi>England</hi> holpe <hi>France</hi> in their
wars against them? What pretence had they to conquer <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that
<hi>Scotland</hi> succoured England? Why hindred they the <hi>Switzers</hi> going into
<hi>France.</hi> with intention to conquer <hi>France,</hi> but that they thought
it a better morsel for themselves? What colour used they to overcome
the residue of the world, but sometimes a pretence to defend their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates?
sometimes a shew to maintain the liberties of their Neighbours?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93045:19"/>
sometimes a feigned and hypocritical zeal of Religion, when as indeed
they oppressed them whom they pretended to defend: brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
for whose liberty they would seem to fight: and were in all respects
as irreligious as they whose Religion they seemed to condemn: So to be
short, they cunningly enlarged their Confines, by seeming to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of Conquests; made themselves Monarchs, by pretending to suppress
Tyrants; and did wrong unto all men, by bearing an outward shew to
suffer no manner of injury to be done unto any man. This cunning in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
unto Forrain Dominions, begun in the Infancy of the Romans
prosperity, continued in the riper years thereof, and practised even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
their declining Age; was not only proper unto them, but passed (as
their Empire did) from them unto other Rulers (by what name or title
soever they were called) taking advantage of the time, omited no means
to attain unto their desires and purposes.</p>
            <p>Though therefore the name of Rebels in all Ages hath been odious,
their Cause was never unjust, and the voluntary Aid given unto them,
never was honourable unto him that aided them; yet the Chronicles not
only of our Nation, but also of other Regions, Realms, and Dominions,
are full of Examples of many Princes not inferior to the Princes of our
Age, be it in Might, in Power, in Authority, or in Goodness; who rather
regarding the propagation and increase of their Dominions, then the
conservation and maintenance of their Honours, did as our Princes do
now, not only receive their Neighbors Rebels into their protection, but
also use them as means and instruments to molest and persecute their
Neighbours, by whose decay and downfall they might rise, and aspire
unto higher Authority. Neither hath the League of Amity, the bond
of Kindred and Parentage; the duty of children to their Parents; the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of one Brother to another, moved Princes to withdraw their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand, succor and assistance from those who being tyed by all, or some
of those Bands, rebelled against their Sovereigns. <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being not only in League with <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, being King of
<hi>England,</hi> but also by Oath and Homage bound unto him, as his Vassal,
did not only favour and receive into his protection a young Man, named
<hi>Perkin,</hi> who was suborned by <hi>Margaret,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> to call
and carry himself for one of the Sons of her Brother King <hi>Edward;</hi> but
also married the said <hi>Perkin</hi> unto <hi>Katherine,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Alexander,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and his own neer Kins-woman; and with him, and for
him invaded <hi>England:</hi> Here you see the Vassal favour and succor the
Rebels of his Sovereign; and the neer Kins-woman conspire against her
Leige Lord and King. <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Poictou,</hi> because his Father
<hi>Henry</hi> the second denyed him that Honour (although by the death of the
young King <hi>Henry,</hi> he was become his eldest Son) to marry him with
the French Kings Sister <hi>Alice,,</hi> and to declare him immediately for his
immediate Successor, became the French Kings Man to serve him against
his Father. <hi>Robert,</hi> Son unto <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, having tasted the
sweetness in Commanding others, so far that he loathed to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by others, Rebelled against his Father, and was aided and succoured
in his Rebellion by the French King <hi>Henry,</hi> Son unto <hi>Henry</hi> surnamed
the <hi>Grosse,</hi> because his Father was Excommunicated by the Pope; and as
an Excommunicated person was not in his opinion to hold and sway the
Empire; was not only animated by the Pope to Rebel against his Father,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93045:20"/>
but also assisted by him, until he took his Father Prisoner.</p>
            <p>Here you see the Sons Rebelling against their own Fathers, protected
and succoured by them, which either were, or should have been Friends
and Confederates unto their Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Terapha Holinshed. Pol. Virg. Du Haillan</note> base Brother unto <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> knowing that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his evil and licentious life, was generally hated of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Rebelled against him, and with the help of the Kings of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Portugal,</hi> deprived him of his Life and Crown. Here you see the
Brother bearing Arms against his Brother; ayded by two Kings, who
should rather have favoured a Lawful King then an Usurper.</p>
            <p>The Marquess of <hi>Villona,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> both neer
Kinsmen unto <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isabel,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and of
<hi>Castile,</hi> Rebelled against them both, and received aid and succour in their

(against the corruption whereof you and others inveigh most bitterly)
Princes ayd the Rebels of other Kings, betwixt whom there is no manner
of Alliance; Or if there be any, the same is long since dissolved, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into hatred and enmity: For albeit the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Married the
Sister of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and of the late French King; by which
Marriages he was Allied unto both in League of Friendship and Affinity:
Yet you know, and shall hereafter see, that many occasions besides the
deaths of his Wives, have changed his love into hatred, and his good
will into malice: So that it is no marvel, since every injury asketh a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
every enemy seeketh all means possible to hurt and annoy his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary;
and every Prince can be content to take such advantage for
the enlargement of his Confines, and for the maintenance of his Estate, as
the time and opportunity doth or shall yeild him; If the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who
hath purposed in his heart to devour and swallow up the Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> useth the Rebellion of the <hi>Guyzards</hi> for his best means and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or if the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who findeth no better ways to keep
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> from invading and subduing her Realms and Dominions,
then to busie and to find him continually occupied in defending, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his own, doth succour his pretended Subjects of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
(for indeed they are not his Subjects) and vouchsafeth daily to
send them such supplies of Men and Money as seem most necessary for
their defence.</p>
            <p>The Third Point whereat they wonder, dependeth somewhat upon this
Point, which is, Why the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> being always reputed a fearful and
timerous Nation; And the Frenchmen having at all times most worthily
carried the names of the most Faithful and Loyal Subjects of <hi>Europe;</hi> the
one in hatred of the Spaniard, Rebelleth against the Spaniard; and the
other, at the Instigation of the Spanish King, beareth Arms in his behalf,
against their natural Leige Lord and Soveraign: But if it may please you,
and these Wonders,<note place="margin">That the Flemming had just cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> to enter into consideration of the Spaniards Nature,
and of the Flemmings Qualities; and to call to mind the Levity of the
one, and the Cruelty of the other; the Weakness of them, and the Pride
of these; and how ready they are to take, and these to give occasion of
Rebellion; you will leave to wonder at their revolt and distraction from
the bondage of the Spaniard. Read the Chronicles of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93045:20"/>
shall find that there was never any Nation more mutinous,<note place="margin">Anales Flandriae. Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> more easie to
be displeased, more prone and ready to Rebel, then the Flemmings.
You shall likewise find, that they are far more fit to be Governed by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
then by Rigor, and by Women then by men; You shall likewise
find, that they have seldom lived in long Peace and Obedience under any
of their natural Princes, if he did not Rule and Govern them with all
manner of humanity: And finding this, you must needs think that there
can be no long Agreement betwixt them and the Spaniard, whose nature
is to Command Imperiously, to Rule Proudly, and to Govern Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically,
as it appeareth in all places where he beareth Sway or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The House of <hi>Austria</hi> had their beginning in <hi>Hasburg</hi> in <hi>Switzerland;</hi>
whence (as you shall read in <hi>Smiller</hi>) they were driven by the Subjects
for their extream Tyranny: By Marriage they are grown from poor Earls
unto mighty Princes, and have spread themselves over divers Nations;<note place="margin">Smillerus de Repub Helvetior.</note>
over which how they have Tyrannized, the very Histories of those Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do report and witness: You shall read of their persecutions in the <hi>Indies;</hi>
Of their Exactions in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> Of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hard and cruel dealing in the County of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> Of their late Cruelty
in <hi>Portugal;</hi> and of their intolerable oppression in all places. You shall
read that ever since they began to be in Authority in the world, they have
troubled the Tranquility and Peace of most part of the world: You shall
read, that <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> have suffered more injuries, wrongs,
and indignities by them only, then by all other Princes and Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of Christendom. You shall read that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor,
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and this present King of <hi>Spain,</hi> disquieted and troubled
the peaceable Estates of all other Princes that lived, or live in their
time.</p>
            <p>Briefly, You shall read, that they have always had high minds,
unsatiable desires, ambitious projects, marvelous designs and purposes;
which if it had not pleased the Almighty to prevent and cross, by sundry
unexpected Accidents, they had long before this time made themselves
Monarchs of the universal world.</p>
            <p>This is so apparent and well known unto all men that know never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the knowledge which is gathered from Histories; That I shall not
need to stand upon the proof thereof, and to confirm the same by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>No marvel then, since the Low-Countries did all at the first, with one
mutual consent, Rebel; and the United Provinces do yet bear Arms
against the Spaniard,<note place="margin">Dinothus de bello Belgico. Responce, ala Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration de D. Jehan de Austrice Discourse summarie de Estates Generals. du Pags Bas.</note> defending themselves by power and might from
his wrongs and violence, who gave them many just occasions to Revolt
from his Obedience; Before they Revolted, he Ruled them by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
being bound to Govern them by their own Country-men; He brake
dayly their Priviledges and Customes, being sworn duly to keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them; He preferred meer Strangers, and men of base condition,
unto the best and highest Offices over them, having protested and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by Oath, to constitute no such Magistrates overthem, as were not
born in their own Country; He altered the State of the Clergy without
their consent, having promised not to innovate any thing therein without
their Counsel and permission; He caused to be done to death the best of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93045:21"/>
their Nobilty, without any such form of Judgment as their Laws and
Priviledges required; He charged them with new Imposts, and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Tributes, without their advice and consent, whose counsel and
consent he was to use therein: He called them to consult upon matters of
weight and importance, in such places as they might not appear. Lastly,
He placed such Governours over them, as sought and wrought the death
of the best Maintainers and Upholders of their Ancient Priviledges; as
filled the Country with odious and suspected People; as bandied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
themselves with Forrainers against their States; as sought and took
all occasions possible to sow Debate and Sedition betwixt their Nobles
and Princes; as charged their Nobility with false and untrue Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
as declared the better part of them to be Traytors and Rebels,
because they would not at their commandment make open Wars against

               </gap>ity into Tumults and Troubles: Can any Prince do
greater wrongs unto his Subjects then these are? Or can any Subjects suffer
greater injuries then these? Especially such a Prince as was no longer
Prince then he observed their ancient Priviledges; Especially such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as were no longer bound to their Prince then he kept their Liberties
inviolable; Such a Prince as lost his Authority over them so soon as he
brake the Conditions whereupon he was received: And such Subjects
who were freed from all manner of Obedience so soon as these Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were broken; Such a Prince as was requested by all the Princes of
Christendom not to Tyrannize over his Subjects, and would not hearken
to their perswasions and requests; And such Subjects as besought the
Princes of Christendom to be their Intercessors to their Prince, and could
not prevail with him: Briefly,<note place="margin">Dinothus D. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus:</note> Such a Prince as when he had long vexed
and wearied his Subjects with intolerable charges, and unsupportable
wrongs, might have had infinite wealth of his Subjects to receive them
into his good Grace and Favour, and would not accept their offer; And
such Subjects as offered to give their Prince three Millions of Gold, to
suffer them to live in liberty of conscience, and could not be heard. These
Subjects therefore had good occasion to forsake and renounce this Prince,
And the Wars which they undertook against him were in my simple opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
most lawful; Not that I approve Rebellion, or allow Subjects to
Rebel against their Soveraigns, when, or for what occasions they will;
but that I dis-allow and dislike the Prince that will Govern and Rule his
Subjects in all things as he lists; There is a mutual bond betwixt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and the Prince; there is a reciprocal League, there is on both sides
a certain duty, in the one to obey reverently, and in the other not to
command over rigorously: The reverence of the Subjects conserveth the
Majesty of a Prince; and the Lenity of a Prince maintaineth the life and
welfare of his Subjects; but when the Prince casteth off humanity, and
the Subjects forget their duty; when he mindeth nothing less then the
publique wealth, and they suffer things whereunto they have not been
accustomed; when he breaketh Laws, and they desire to live under their
ancient Laws; when he imposeth new Tributes, and they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sufficiently charged and grieved with their old; when he oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93045:21"/>
and suppresseth such of the Nobility as favour the common people,
their ancient Lawes, Priviledges, and Liberties, and they take the
wrongs that are done unto their Favourers, and Patrons, to be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves and their Posterity: Then changeth love into hatred, and
obedience into contempt; then hatred breedeth disdain, and disdain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth
disloyalty, after which follow secret conspiracies, unlawful
assemblies, undutiful consultations, open mutinies, treacherous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and manifest rebellions: The chief reasons whereof are, because
the common people are without reason, ready to follow evil counsel, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be displeased, prone to conceive dislike, not willing to remember
the common benefit which they received by a Prince, when they see their
private Estates impoverished by him or his Officers; forgetful of many
good turns, if they be but once wronged; more desirous to revenge an
injury, then to remember a benefit, quickly weary of a Prince, be he
never so good, if he be not pleased to satisfie all their unreasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
easily suspecting those who are placed in authority over them,
commonly affecting time that is past, better then the present; briefly,
all liking what the most like, all inclining where the greatest part favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
all furthering what the most attempt, and all soon miscarried, if

            <p>This natural disposition of the common people, is proved by common
experience, observed by wise Polititians, and confirmed by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
not of one Realm, but of many Nations; not of one age, but of
many seasons; not of barbarous people, but of civil Realms; not of
Kingdoms alone, but of other manner of Governments; briefly, not of
Subjects living only under Tyrants, but also under the best Princes that
ever were; for there is no Kingdom comparable unto <hi>France</hi> for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
or for greatness, for strength, or for continual race of good
and vertuous Kings, for absolute government of Rulers, or for dutiful
obedience of Subjects, for good laws, or for just and wise Magistrates; and
yet <hi>France</hi> that hath this commendation, and these benefits,<note place="margin">That <hi>France</hi> hath rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against their Kings before this time.</note> hath many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times besides this, and for other occasions besides the causes that now
moveth <hi>France</hi> to rebel, revolted from her liege Lords and Soveraigns; for
proof whereof, let us examine and consider the causes and motives of this
present Rebellion, begun in the late Kings time, and continued in this Kings
days. They that write thereof at large, and seem to understand the causes of
this revolt more particularly then others, affirm that this Rebellion began
upon these occasions. The Authors and chief Heads thereof saw Justice
corruptly administred,<note place="margin">Pedro Corn de la lyga q confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesa.</note> Offices appertaining unto Justice, dearly sold, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
and Ecclesiastical dignities and livings unworthily collated, new
Impositions dayly invented and levied, the Kings Treasures and Revenues
prodigally consumed, old Officers unjustly displaced, and men of base
quality unworthily advanced;<note place="margin">The causes of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, their proceeding &amp; policies.</note> they saw the late King carried away with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
governed by a woman, entred in League and Amity with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and fully resolved to follow his pleasure, and to leave the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
and government of the whole Kingdom unto their mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
They saw him careless in the maintainance of their Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to have any issue to succeed him,<note place="margin">David Chytraeus. Risember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</note> not willing to establish any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Crown after him, and obstinately minded not to enter into
League with them, that intended and purposed to uphold and maintain
their Catholick Religion. Lastly, they saw that as long as he lived, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93045:22"/>
King of <hi>Navar</hi> and his followers could hardly be suppressed; and that as
soon as he dyed, the said King was likely to be his Successor; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they considered the desperate estate of their Religion, the sure and
certain advancement of the Protestants, and of their cause and quarrel,
the utter subversion of all their intents and purposes; And lastly, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and lamentable end of the greatness of themselves, and of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
Wherefore to withstand all those mischiefs and inconveniencies,
and to prevent some of them, and to redress and reform others; they
called a general Assembly of the three Estates; implored the help of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes; levied as great Armies as they could possibly gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
propounded means of Reformation to the King; and when they
found him not willing to yeild to their advise and counsel, they combined
themselves against the Protestants, his pretended, and their open enemies;
seized upon greatest part of the Kings Treasure, took possession of his best
Holds and Towns of strength, removed such Officers as disliked them,
and in all Affairs that concerned the advancement of their Cause, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men fit for their humours, made for their purpose, brought up in their
Factions, practised in their Quarrels, affectioned in their Cause, and
wholly devoted to their wills and pleasures. And because they found
themselves unable to encounter with the late King and his Confederates,
unless they were also assisted by some forrain Princes, they sought all
ways and means possible to insinuate themselves into the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of strange and mighty Potentates, to recommend their Cause and
Quarrel unto their protection, and to joyn their Domestical power with
their forrain Enemies: They consider therefore that the Popes Holiness
by the heat and vehemency of the hatred which he beareth unto Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the greatness of his Ambition; and the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by the ancient envy and enmity which hath been, and
which is betwixt him and the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> might easily be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and induced to favour their party, and further their Attempts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> as chief Head and Patron of these Actions, sendeth
Messengers unto every one of these Princes,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> the head of the League; his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and policies.</note> beseeching them, as they
had heretofore secretly favoured him and his complices, so they would
now (that matters were grown to ripeness, and secret Conspiracies to open
resistance) vouchsafe him and his Confederates their help and assistance
to the utmost of their power: In which Suit he findeth happy success;
and with promise of assured and sufficient aid, is animated to proceed with
courage, and not to omit any manner of cunning and policy, to win un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself as many friends as he might possibly; He therefore consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that for the better accomplishment of his designs, it was needful and
expedient for him to continue at the Court, and there to draw unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as many partakers as by any means possibly he might obtain, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thither with all diligence; And knowing that he should undoubtedly
fail of his purpose, unless he might effectually compass three things of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
consequence; he laboureth to the utmost of his power to bring them
to pass: The first of the three was the late Kings especial Favour: The
second an Office of great Account and Dignity: The third, that the rest
of the Court should be at his Will and Commandment, either for love
towards him, or for fear of his Greatness and Authority. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing
and assurance of the Kings favour, he useth two principal means:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93045:22"/>The one, to let the King understand that he was now grown to so great
power and strength, that it was impossible for his Majesty to supplant or
suppress the same. The other, to perswade the King, not only by words
but also by good carriage of himself, that he would never abuse that his
power, but always use it to his Highness benefit, and his Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
keeping the King by this means always betwixt love and fear, and
increasing the number of his friends and followers, by gratifying some
with Offices, others with money, and still imploying his Purse, his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and his Countenance, for the strengthning of his Party; and that
in such manner as the King could not but perceive it; yet he dissembleth
so cunningly, protesteth so devoutly, and sheweth sometimes so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
effects of his good will, and dutiful obedience to the King, that
his Majesty distrusteth not his proceedings: And for the better continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the King in that opinion; he marketh what is done in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
willeth many things to be done that were acceptable and pleasing
to the Kings humours; and still writeth unto his Friends and Kinsmen,
that they should shew their obedience in small things, and in matters of no
great moment, that they might the better be trusted in matters of more
great weight and profit, to the furtherance of his and their designs. Now
for the obtaining of such an Office as might both countenance him, and
prefer his Friends, he very subtily insinuateth himself into the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
favour, unto whom the King had committed the Administration
and charge of the weightiest affairs of his Kingdom; he maketh the Kings
principal Secretary sure unto him; causeth him to procure his return to
the Court, when he was once commanded by the King to depart thence
in disgrace; bringeth it to pass by him, that the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> his
greatest enemy, should be banished the Court, and that after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the same Secretary should continually seek and procure his discredit,
and contrariwise further him in all his Attempts and Endeavours, lest
that the King recalling in time the Duke <hi>Despernon,</hi> might be induced by
him to displace and discountenance them both. And whilst he is in
this favour, he sueth to be High Constable of <hi>France,</hi> meaning in time
to use the same Office (as <hi>Charls Martel</hi> did) for a step and Ladder to climb
up to the Kingdom; which Office he saith was of such antiquity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as that as soon as there was a King in <hi>France,</hi> there was also a High
Constable; and that their Estate never flourished better, then when the
Crown was provided of such Officers as should and did execute their
Offices and Charges, in as ample manner as their Commissions gave them
power and Authority to do. Besides, seeing that the Queen Mother,
either at the first, or at the last, obtained whatsoever it pleased her, of the
King; and that whosoever he was (were he never so highly in the Kings
favour) that displeased her, in time lost the Kings good will, and good
opinion: He so carried himself towards her, that he seemed to affect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then her good liking, and yet not to be so desirous thereof, as
that he would wholly depend thereupon; knowing that the King although
he did always attribute much unto his Mother, and was contented that
she should be reverenced and respected next unto himself, yet he could not
well brook them that sought for her good will more then for his Favour;
and thus with cunning, continuing a firm League of love and amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Mother and the Son, he hoped in time to possess them both, in
such manner, as before they should be aware thereof, he would assume
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93045:23"/>
unto himself the power and authority of them both: And further, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that the Kings old Secretaries were not in all respects so pliant and
ready to follow and fulfil his designs as he wished, he laboured by all
means possible to prefer them unto Offices of higher dignity, and
to place others in their rooms, who would not fail to further his intents
and purposes, nor disdain to depend wholly upon his favour, and also to
make him privy to whatsoever business or affairs of Estate they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to dispatch by the King; whereby he came to perfect knowledg
of all that was purposed or determined by the Kings privy Councel;
And grew into such favour and credit, that even the principal Officers of
the Crown, either for fear or for love, or by other mens examples, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselves wholly unto his devotion: And he had such interest in
the Kings Court and Courtiers, that all or the most part of them, seemed
to be at his only disposition, and to affect him more then their King and
Soveraign. Having installed himself in this manner in the Court, and
distracted the hearts of the principal Officers thereof from their duty and
love to their King; he thinketh it not sufficient to be invested in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
unless he might also captivate the affections and good wills of the
common people; whom by promise to relieve their necessities, to ease
their charges, to supply their wants, and to redress all that was thought
or suggested to be amiss (the common means used in all times, and all
ages, by men of his mind, to seduce and mis-lead a multitude) he easily and
quickly perswadeth to favour his party; And finding the common sort
so ready, willing, and desirous to perform and accomplish his pleasure, as
that in respect of their obedience towards him, he seemeth to lack nothing
but the only name of King to be a King: Notwithstanding the great Honor
and Reverence that Courtiers shewed unto him; the love and affection
that the Commonalty bear to him; the Offices and Dignities which he
partly affected, and partly attained; the high Attempts and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he lodged in his heart and conceit; and the unaccustomed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which he cunningly had usurped; yet he was so far from being
puffed up with pride or disdain towards his inferiours (faults commonly
incident unto men advanced unto extraordinary favour and preferment)
that for the better continuance of his credit, and the peoples good will
towards him; he would debase, and so much deject himself, as that he
thought not scorn to go bare headed from one end of the Street unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even unto base Chrochelers and Porters; with which his demeanor
the Duke <hi>De Mayne</hi> his Brother was many times highly displeased, and
could not at any time frame himself to follow and imitate him therein;
which hath appeared more manifestly since his death: the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in regard of that want, not favouring him so highly as they did the late
Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi> Now where there is a Subject of such credit with the
King, of such authority in Court, of such power in every Province, of
such Alliance in the whole Realm, of such favour with forrain Princes,
of such liking of all sorts of Subjects, of such experience in Martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
of knowledge in matters of State; briefly, of such continuance in
the love, in the hearts, in the good liking of all men: Can it possibly be
hard or difficult for him to work his pleasure in any thing that he shall
imagine or indeavour? Or can it be that such a man should not be most
dangerous unto his Country and unto his Prince? Especially in <hi>France,</hi>
where there are many Provinces ruled by their particular Governours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93045:23"/>
many Citadels possessed by several Deputies, many Holds and Towns
or strength committed to the custody of certain Lievtenants, many
Bands of men at Arms, and of other Souldiers, under the charge of
choise Captains. And all or the most part of these Governours, Deputies,
Lievtenants and Captains, chosen or appointed out of his Parentage,
Kindred, Affinity, Alliance, Family or Followers.</p>
            <p>Look upon men in other States and Kingdoms,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwixt him and them,</note> under other Princes
and Kings, of like mind, and of such Ambition as possessed the Duke;
and consider what dangers they have brought both unto their Countries,
and unto their Sovereigns.</p>

                  </gap>us Sejanus</hi> ruled all things under <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor; whom he
had so cunningly blinded and besotted with love and affection towards
him; that although he was wary enough of all others,<note place="margin">C. Tacitus</note> and could keep
his least secrets from them, yet he could not beware of him, nor conceal
the greatest secrets he had from him. This <hi>Sejanus</hi> had many qualities
fit and proper for his aspiring mind and purpose: He could endure all kind
of labour; he durst adventure to do any thing whatsoever; he was very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;
he used to reprehend and backbite others boldly; he could flatter cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
behave himself, when occasion served, proudly; again, when he saw
cause, his carriage was very modest outwardly, albeit inwardly he boiled
with a desire of Rule and Government: For the better attaining whereof,
he used now and then liberality, but more often labour and industry;
points as dangerous (when they tend to the purchasing of a Kingdom) as
Ambition and Prodigal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty. This <hi>Sejan</hi> had such interest in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
such power in <hi>Rome,</hi> such sway and authority in all the Affairs of the
Empire; that after he had perswaded <hi>Tiberius,</hi> either for his health, or
for recreation, or to live free from the cares and troubles of Estate, to
retire himself unto a little Island; he presumed to call himself Emperor,
and <hi>Tiberius</hi> a poor Islander, or Prince of one Island. This <hi>Sejan</hi> had
two Obstacles to hinder his purpose,<note place="margin">C: Tacitus.</note> 
               <hi>Drusus</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> both Heirs unto
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> both of divers natures and conditions, and both so desirous to
be Emperors, that the one could have been content to supplant the other.
This <hi>Sejan</hi> to take away these impediments used these means, he poluted
<hi>Livia, Drusus</hi> his Wife with Adultery, won her to promise him Marriage,
promised to make her Partner and Fellow in the Empire, perswaded her
to consent to the death of her Husband: To put her out of all doubt and
jealousie; he banished his own Wife <hi>Apicata</hi> from his house and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and when his secret purposes were bewrayed, thinking it time to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
<hi>Drusus</hi> his death, and to work the same so cunningly that it might not
be known or perceived; he cast a kind of poison, which should so kill him,
that it might seem he dyed of some sudden disease: After this he assaulted
<hi>Nero</hi> in another way; he caused his friends and followers to animate him
to affect the Empire, to tell him that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were desirous to
make him Emperor, that the Souldiers were of the same mind, and that
<hi>Sejan</hi> although he Ruled all things, yet he neither durst nor would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him. <hi>Nero</hi> gave ear to these perswasions, and could not so dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his inward thoughts and cogitations, but that now and then he uttered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93045:24"/>
some words that bewrayed the secrets of his mind, which by such Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as were set to observe him, his words, and doings, were brought to
<hi>Sejans</hi> hearing, and by such Accusers as he suborned, carried to <hi>Tiberius</hi>
his ears, who vouchsafing <hi>Nero</hi> no indifferent hearing, afforded him no
good countenance, but suspected him the more, if he spake any thing in
his own defence, and condemned him if he held his peace: And <hi>Sejan</hi>
had so provided, that his watching his steps, his sights, and his secrets
were told by his wife unto her Mother <hi>Livia,</hi> and by <hi>Livia</hi> unto him,
who had likewise induced his Brother <hi>Drusus</hi> to seek this ruine and subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Nero,</hi> by telling him that when his Brother <hi>Nero</hi> was dead, he
was next heir unto the Empire; which perswasion easily prevailed with
<hi>Drusus,</hi> because he had an aspiring mind, and secretly hated his Brother
<hi>Nero;</hi> for that their <hi>Sister Agrippina</hi> loved him better then she did <hi>Drusus:</hi>
And yet <hi>Sejan</hi> did not so favour <hi>Drusus,</hi> but that he likewise purposed
his death and destruction, which he thought he might easily compass,
because he knew him to be stout, and over-bold, and easie to be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by his slights and subtilties.</p>
            <p>You have heard of the Treasons of <hi>Sejan,</hi> his policies, and his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
you may guess of his success, and read of his end. Now you shall
hear of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who was more subtile and cunning then he, and had
the wit to get more then he, but not the grace to keep it long. <hi>Caesar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he bare any Office in <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutatch.</note> was in his youth so prodigal, and such a
Spend-thrift,<note place="margin">Dion.</note> that he had indebted himself above 700000. Crowns; and
although the greatness of his debts might justly have made him fear to be
cast in Prison,<note place="margin">Piero Mexias.</note> and never to hope or look for such preferment, as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
attained, yet he neither feared his creditors, nor doubted of his
future advancement: For the better attaining whereunto, he accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
his nature to all mens humours, and vouchsafed to flatter, and
make much, not only of Free-men, but also of such Slaves and Bond-men
as he knew well able to do any thing with their Masters; He thought it
no disgrace or discredit to humble himself in the beginning, so that he
might live in assured hope to command all men in process of time.</p>
            <p>Besides other subtile devices which he used for the better accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his desires, he observed most diligently who were in greatest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the common people, who were best able to further or hinder
his purposes; who were easily to be won to favour him in his attempts
and intentions; and what means he might use and practise to be assured
of their Friendship.</p>
            <p>There lived in his time four men of especial account, <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
<hi>Crassus, Piso,</hi> and <hi>Curio: Pompey</hi> was so valiant and fortunate in Armes,
that he was worthily surnamed the GREAT. <hi>Crassus</hi> attained to such
wealth, that he was commonly called the RICH. <hi>Piso</hi> bare such sway
with the people, that no man was either feared or loved more then he.
And <hi>Curio</hi> was so wise, and so eloquent, that the people loved him
greatly, and he so desirous of their favour, and so careless and prodigal
of money, that to attain any thing for himself, or for his friend, he would
spare no manner of costs or charges. To win these men that were fit for
his purpose, and yet of divers humours, <hi>Caesar</hi> thought it convenient to
use divers means; he married his daughter to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he took to wife
<hi>Pyso</hi>'s Sister; he paid all <hi>Curio</hi>'s debts; and because there was a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and emulation betwixt <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> by reason whereof he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93045:24"/>
thought it very difficult to grow in favour with both of them; he being
absent from <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> when they were in the heat of their contention, came
thither of purpose, not to extinguish the same, but to use it as a means
to deceive them both; and seeing that each of them sought his friendship
against the other, he would not follow any of them, but carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as neutral and indifferent betwixt them, he procured all wayes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make them friends. And knowing that so long as he declared not
himself to be a faithful friend to one of them, both would do for him,
whatsoever he should demand of them; he held them both in suspence,
and made them so jealous of him, that for fear to lose him, both laboured
to content and please him; and so much, that first he made himself equal
to either of them; next he brought to pass, that the power and authority
which was in their hands only, was divided betwixt him and them: And
in the end he alone came to rule all; for he drave <hi>Pompey</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and made himself Lord and Master of both places, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Roman Treasure, and paid his Souldiers therewithal. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
the Histories reporteth; and I haste unto another of the like
mind, but of better fortune; for <hi>Caesar</hi> lived not long after he came to the
Empire: And many wise and learned men wonder why the Emperours
at this day carry still his name, since he was the only ruine and overthrow
of his Countrey, and of the ancient liberty thereof; whereas he, of
whom I intend to speak, not only enjoyed the Crown and Scepter many
years together, which he usurped cunningly, but also transferred the
same unto his posterity, in which it hath remained better then these five
hundred years, and <hi>Caesar</hi> his posterity enjoyed not his purchase the
twenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th part of that time. You have heard that the last Race of the Kings
of <hi>France</hi> descended from <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who being but Master of the Kings
Palace, governed all things under him, and so carried himself in that
his Government, that he wan the hearts and love of the common people,
and also got into such favour with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fifth of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince of
small worth, and of no great wit, that as some Historographers write, he
dying the year 987. without Heirs Males, not of his natural death, but
by poyson, gave his Kingdom unto <hi>Blanch</hi> his Wife, and willed her to
marry <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> which she did according to her Husbands Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so <hi>Capet</hi> became King, albeit the Kingdom appertained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y
right unto <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Brother unto King <hi>Lotharius,</hi> and
Uncle unto the said <hi>Lewis.</hi> For <hi>Charles</hi> being then in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been called and sent for by some of the Nobles of <hi>France</hi> to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
King thereof, came not with such speed as was convenient for him to
have used, but gave time and respite unto <hi>Capet</hi> to seize upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
pretending himself to have Title thereunto, by the late Kings will,
by reason that he was in some sort by his Mothers side of the race of
<hi>Charlemaign,</hi> by signifying unto the people, that <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
deserved not to be chosen King, because in all contentions, debates,
and differences betwixt the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and the Empire, the said
<hi>Charles</hi> favoured the Emperours more then the French King; and by
suggesting that he being present and alwayes ready to defend the Realm,
ought to be preferred before <hi>Charles</hi> that was absent, and not willing to
come to accept the Crown, when he was called thereunto; by inducing
<hi>Anselm</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laon</hi> to deliver the said Duke his Master with his two
Children into his hands very trayterously; by committing the Duke and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93045:25"/>
his Sons to prison in <hi>Orleance,</hi> where they dyed, and by degrading <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolph</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> under colour and pretence of Bastardy, for
fear he proving himself to be lawful and legitimate brother unto <hi>Charles,</hi>
might in time deprive him of the Kingdom; but the especial policy that
Capet used for the obtaining his purpose, was the imitation of <hi>Pipin</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> of whose practises you shall first hear; and then as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in
the lives of the Worthies of <hi>Greece and Rome,</hi> compared a Graecian and
a Roman together, that the vertues and excellencies of both may appear
the better by that his comparison: So I will compare the devices of the
late Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with the practices of <hi>Sejan, Caesar, Capet, and Pipin,</hi>
to the end you may see in what points he imitated them fully, and also
wherein he failed to follow their foot-steps.<note place="margin">Da Haillan</note> 
               <hi>Pipin</hi> being Master of the
Palace under <hi>Childerick</hi> the third King of <hi>France,</hi> (who for his unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was deprived of his Crown by the Pope <hi>Lachary</hi>) thought that the
greatness of his Office, and the weakness of his Prince and Master, might
well serve him for a Ladder to climb to the Kingdom, and knowing that
it would not suffice to advance his own credit and commendation, unless
he did also dispraise and discredit his King, he suborned men of purpose,
not only to spread abroad the kings indignities, to inveigh against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencies,
and to cry out against his evil Government; but also to set
forth his own praise, to commend his valour, and to extoll his exploits
and services, done as well for his Country, as for the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> to the
end that as soon as the people began to contemn and dislike their King,
they might also begin to love and affect him, of which affection and love
he hoped there might in time proceed such a good liking, that they would
vouchsafe to elect, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the French-men were well affected to the Pope, and would do any
thing at his Commandment; to win the Popes favour and assistance, he
not only promised; but went into <hi>Italy,</hi> of purpose to succour his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who at that time greatly troubled the universal
rest and quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> Besides fearing that the Oath which the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
make unto their King, and the Love and Loyalty which they bear
unto him, might hinder his designs and purposes, he sent an express
Messenger unto the Pope, to declare unto him the true sense and meaning
of their Oath, and to intreat his Holiness to make such an Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof as might serve his turn; the effect of which Interpretation was,<note place="margin">A strange Interpretation of the Oath of Allegiance.</note>
That since the promise which the French-men made unto their King was
conditional and reciprocal; and that their King was likewise sworn unto
them; they being his Subjects were not bound any longer to their Oath,
since he being their King had broken his, because he was neither religious
valiant, just, or in any respect answerable to those conditions which
were inserted and included in his promise to them. In hope of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of which conditions they had sworn unto him all manner of duty,
service, succour, faith, and obedience. This was <hi>Pipin</hi>'s policy to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant

            <p>Now let me compare the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his practices with these mens
devices, his wit with their wisdom, and his aspiring mind with their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
<hi>Sejan</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> were lowly and humble when they saw occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and what was the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he went bate-headed unto Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Crochelers? <hi>Caesar drave Pompey</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sejan, Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
out of <hi>Rome</hi> into an Island, and what did the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93045:25"/>
forced the late French King, not to leave, but to fly from <hi>Paris, Caesar</hi>
suppresseth <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus;</hi> and <hi>Sejan</hi> indeavoured to destroy <hi>Drusus</hi>
and <hi>Nero;</hi> and what did the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he caused the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>France</hi> to be massacred, and the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to be banished
the Court? <hi>Sejan</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> spared no money to win men to their service
and devotion: What did the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he spent all his own
Patrimony, and his Wives Inheritance, and the King of <hi>Spains</hi> yearly
Pension, and infinite Pistolets, to purchase himself Friends and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?
<hi>Casar</hi> and <hi>Sejan</hi> subverted their enemies by their own friends;
And what did the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he sowed sedition betwixt the King
and his brother? <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Sejan</hi> used the Marriage of <hi>Livia, Drusus</hi> his
Wife of his own Daughter, and of <hi>Pycos</hi> Sister for the furtherance of their
purpose: And what did the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he caused the Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
of <hi>Paris</hi> to be performed at the Marriage of the present King of <hi>France</hi>
with the late Kings Sister? <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Sejan</hi> could be proud when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was offered? And what was the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he equalled his
power and strength with the Kings? <hi>Caesar</hi> could brook no equal; And
what could the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he contended with the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Superiority and Precedency? <hi>Sejan</hi> set variance betwixt <hi>Drusus</hi>
and <hi>Nero,</hi> to the end the one should take occasion to destroy the other?
And what did the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he perswaded the French King
to send his only Brother into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he devised divers means to
endanger his life? <hi>Caesar</hi> assumed by cunning and pollicy, all the Power
and Authority unto himself, which was sometimes equally divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus?</hi> And what did the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when
he suffered no man to be in credit at the Court but himself? <hi>Sejan</hi> offered
the Empire unto <hi>Drusus,</hi> not for favour which he bore him, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and incourage him to seek the ruine of <hi>Nero:</hi> And what did the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he profered the Kingdom in the late Kings days,
unto the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> now King of <hi>France,</hi> but seek means to breed such
a distrust and jealousie betwixt the King and him, that the one might let no
occasion slip that might procure the destruction or overthrow of the other?
<hi>Caesar</hi> observed diligently the natures and dispositions of such men as were
in special credit with the common people, and to purchase their favour fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
their purposes, when they tended not to his own hinderance: And
what did the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when he fawned upon those whom the King
loved, and labored to prefer his Secretaries to higher places, to the end that
both they and their Successors might be always willing and ready to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him? <hi>Pipin</hi> shewed himself wise in using the Kings weakness, and his
own credit for a Ladder to climb to the Kingdom; And the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> came not much behind him in wisdom, when he weakned the late
Kings forces, and strengthned himself and his complices, with intention
to set the Crown of <hi>France</hi> upon his own Head. <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> pretended
right to the Crown, because he was in some sort alley'd to <hi>Lewes</hi> the fifth,
by his Mothers side: And the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> fortified his Right, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Alliance unto the Duke of <hi>Larrain,</hi> whom <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> deprived
of the Crown. <hi>Pipin</hi> hired men to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end himself and dispraise <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick:</hi>
And the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> wanted not his writers and his flatterers,
who in Books and common Table-talk, did daily set forth his praise, and
took hold of every small occasion, to enveigh bitterly against the King,
<hi>Pipin</hi> again used Religion and Zeal for a means to win the Popes favour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93045:26"/>
and to procure him to make a friendly Interpretation of the French Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Oath to their King: And the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with a shew of suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> drew divers Popes to join with him in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
and to draw other Princes with the same line into the same League,
and left not until the Pope had Excommunicated the late King. <hi>Hugh
Capit</hi> disabled <hi>Childerick</hi> as a man not sufficient to Rule, and therefore
caused him to be shut up in a Monastery; And the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was so
bold as to bring forrain power into <hi>France,</hi> and to tell the King that he
had procured their help to suppress the Protestants, because his Majesty
had neither men nor money enough wherewith to overthrow them; and
common fame greatly wrongeth him, if he intended not in time to have
shut the King up in some religious house, and to have put a Friers Weed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. Briefly, <hi>Pipin, Iulius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> attained their desires
by their cunning practises, and their subtile devises; And the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
by his slights and Stratagems had not failed of his purpose, if the King had
not by doing him suddenly to death prevented his intended Usurpation.</p>
            <p>By this that hath been said, you may plainly perceive that the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
rebelled against their Soveraigns long before this time; And that
they are in a manifest Error who commend their Loyalty so much, as in
their Writings to call them <hi>The most Loyal, Loving, and Dutiful Subjects
of</hi> Europe; For to omit other Rebellions of the children against their own
Fathers in <hi>France,</hi> whereof their Histories are full and plentiful: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed that both <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> were Usurpers; and that
as many as favoured and furthered them against the lawful Heirs of the
Crown, were notable and traitorous Rebels, and in no respect inferiour
to those who in these days combine themselves against the late French
King, and still continue their open Revolt, and unlawful disobedience
against his right Heir and lawful Successor: Neither can any man deny,
that all they that took part with <hi>Lewis,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Meek,</hi> against <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> were also most famous and disloyal Traytors; For
<hi>Lewes</hi> being younger Brother unto <hi>Pipin</hi> (who dyed before his Father
<hi>Charlemain,</hi> and left <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy</hi> his sole Heir) had no right
to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> so long as the said <hi>Bernard</hi> his eldest Brothers
Son lived, for that as well in the Succession of Crowns and Kingdoms,
as of private mens Lands and Inheritances; the eldest Brothers Son and
Heir is always to be preferred before his Uncle.</p>
            <p>And for as much as <hi>Lewis</hi> having taken his Nephew <hi>Bernard</hi> in the
field Prisoner,<note place="margin">Du Haillan</note> did not only detain him, and his chief Councellors in hard
Prison, but also in the end put him to an unlawful and unnatural death.
Those Subjects who followed and assisted him in those his unkind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
actions (because it is a most wicked deed to participate with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their wickedness) must needs be accounted as wicked as the present
Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> who consented unto the cruel Massacre of their late
King: Again, all those French Subjects who bore Arms against <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, in the behalf of <hi>Philip de Valoys</hi> were in as high degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
as these latter Rebels: And so likewise were those who stood
with <hi>Charls</hi> the seventh against <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth and sixth of <hi>England.</hi> For
the only reason and cause which they alledged to debar these English
Kings from the Succession, as lawful Heirs to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
was the Law Salique, (which as they then pretended) excluded not only
women, but also other Heirs males descending from the woman, from the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93045:26"/>
Inheritance of the Crown; Which Law was no sufficient bar, because it
was undoubtedly a local Law,<note place="margin">Du Haillan Holinshed.</note> made in <hi>Salem,</hi> a Town about the River
of <hi>Rhine in Germany;</hi> at what time the French Kings were both Kings of
<hi>France,</hi> and Emperours of <hi>Germany;</hi> and therefore as all other local
Laws are, was tyed to the Inheritance of that Town only, and could not
stretch her Forces to forrain Countries, or to the succession of Kingdoms,
no more then the Law of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> being peculiar, not to all, but to
some part of Kent, is of full strength and full force in other places of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Besides, it is confirmed that there was never any such Law in <hi>France</hi>
by the Testimony of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> who when as <hi>Philip,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the <hi>Long,</hi> was created King, never left to cry out against his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and to profess openly, That the Kingdom belonged of right unto
<hi>Ioan,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Hutine,</hi> sometimes King of <hi>France,</hi> before that
<hi>Philip</hi> stoppen his mouth with the gift of the Country of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in
Dower with his eldest Daughter. I could stand longer upon the proof
that there was never any <hi>Salick</hi> Law in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Haillan denieth the Law <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi>
               </note> were it not that <hi>Du Haillan</hi>
a French Chronicler, in the first Volumn of his History, easeth me of
that pain, and cleareth that point so plainly, that he being a Frenchman,
and refuting a Law, suggested not only to be a Law, but also one of the
chief Pillars and Maintainers of the ancient Dignity of the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> cannot be thought to write thereof either partially or untruly:
But although I let pass Ed. 3. his Title, as the less valuable, because it was
impugned and weakned by the only Allegation of that Law; yet I must
enlarge somewhat more <hi>Henry,</hi> the fifth his Right, because the same (in
my simple conceit and opinion) was far stronger then <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds;
For <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth considering that because his Predecessors did always
from the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, lay continual claim unto the Crown
of <hi>France;</hi> and that therefore the Kings, or rather Usurpers thereof had
do right nor just title thereunto, because they not having <hi>bonam fidem</hi> (a
point requisite in Prescription) by reason that they knew the right to be in
Kings of <hi>England</hi> rather then in themselves, could not lawfully prescribe
a right unto the said Crown, demanded the same by force of Arms of
<hi>Charls</hi> the sixth, and drave him to such extremities, that he being able
no longer to make resistance against his invincible Forces, was glad to
capitulate and agree upon conditions of Peace with him: The principal
Articles of which Peace were; That the said <hi>Charls</hi> the sixth should du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life, continue King; That he should dis-inherit his Son and Heir,
who was afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh; That the King of <hi>England</hi>
should take to Wife <hi>Isabel,</hi> Daughter unto the French King; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that Marriage he proclaimed Regent of that Kingdom during
<hi>Charles</hi> his Father in laws life, because he was sometimes Lunatique, and
Heir apparent to the Crown after his death; And lastly, that the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Peers of <hi>France,</hi> should not only consent thereunto, but also
take a solemn Oath (which was accordingly performed and executed) to
maintain every point of those Articles, and uphold and assist <hi>Henry</hi> the
fifth, and his lawful Heirs and Successors, against <hi>Charles,</hi> Son unto the
French King, the rather because his Father had for very good and just
occasions him moving thereunto, dis-inherited the said <hi>Charles,</hi> and by
the last Will and Testament, made when he was in perfect sence and
memory, ordained and constituted the said <hi>Henry,</hi> his sole and lawful
Heir of the Crown. But the Frenchmen have their Objections to all that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93045:27"/>
is said; the which I cannot lightly pass over, because I know you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to hear their Exceptions, and also what may be replied in Answer
to their Allegations; But I may not dwell long upon every particular
Point, because my leisure will not serve me, and it is not pertinent to my
first purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They say first,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens first Objection, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Hottoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de jure successionis</note> That their Kingdom goeth not by Dissent and Inheritance,
from the Father to the Son, but by succession, which is grounded not upon Law,
but upon a Custom; by vertue whereof, the next of the Blood Royal, be he of the
farthest degree that may be of Kindred, succeedeth not as a lawful Heir, but
as a Successor by Custom, not newly invented, but of long continuance, even
from the time of the first King <hi>Pharamond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which objection I mean briefly to Answer, before I will proceed to
any others. <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> who wrote an Universal History of all things
that hapned in his time, not only in <hi>Italy,</hi> but also in all other places of
<hi>Europe</hi> (although he was a very perfect and learned Lawyer) yet when
he had occasion to touch any Point of Law, he handled not the same
Lawyer-like, but passed it over lightly, setting down his opinion of the
Case, in as few words as he could possibly, because if he had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
he knew that he should not observe the Laws and Bounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Histographers are tyed and bound. In like manner although these
Questions are meerly civil, and ought to be handled by me as a Civilian;
yet because I purpose to write you an historical discourse, I wil touch them
lightly; for that I speak of them <hi>obiter,</hi> and by digression, and I hold it
sufficient to refute the Objections that may be made in this Cause; not
by Law, but by the Histories of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For albeit <hi>Iohn Bodine,</hi> a Frenchman, and notably well seen and read
in Histories, discoursing in his Book <hi>de Methodo Historie,</hi> at large, what
Rules are to be observed in judging a right of an Historographer, and what
credit may be given to an History, setteth it down in an opinion not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable,
That in matters touching <hi>France or England,</hi> you ought not to
credit a French or English History; but rather a stranger writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
with more indifferency and less partiality; yet, as in Causes which
cannot be well decided, or perfectly known but by Domestical witnesses,
their Testimony is to be preferred before all others; So in matters of
State, which cannot be so well known unto Forrainers, as unto men born
and bred within the same State; better credit ought to be given unto these,
then unto them: You shall therefore hear this first Objection refuted by
their own Writers; and especially by <hi>Du Haillan,</hi> who in my opinion is
the best Historographer that writeth of <hi>France;</hi> who refuteth this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by reckoning up a bed-roll of Kings who did not succeed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but were chosen one after another; <hi>Pharamond</hi> (saith he, in his third
Book) was the first chosen King of <hi>France;</hi> After whom <hi>Daniel,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Childerick,</hi> was chosen: <hi>Pipin</hi> likewise was chosen, and after him

being discontented with his Government, they deprived him of his

looslly, was likewise deposed and cast into Prison; and in his place

                  </gap>ul,</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was instituted and created King of <hi>France;</hi> and
there remaineth even at this day a certain form of Election which is made
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93045:27"/>
at the consecrating and crowning of the King at <hi>Beihins,</hi> where the Peer
of <hi>France,</hi> in the name of the Clergy, Nobility, and People, chuse the
King that is present: Here you see an Election begun in <hi>Pharamond,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in others, and observed at this day; and yet as many as have been
Kings since <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>'s time, have succeeded to their Kingdoms, and
claimed the same by Inheritance, rather then by custom; and you shall
see when we come to another of their Objections, that neither this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor this Custom in succession hath been alwayes duly kept and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second Objection against this agreement is,</hi> That although Contracts
do bind Princes as well as Subjects,<note place="margin">The second Objection, with the answer.</note> yet such Contracts as are made by men not
being sufficient and able to celebrate Contracts; as men distracted of their wits,
Lunatiques, and others not being in perfect sense and memory, do not bind
the Contrahents, but are held in Law as matters of no weight, force, or vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
and therefore <hi>Charles the Sixth</hi> who concluded his Peace with the above-mentioned
conditions, being both before and after the celebration of the same
notoriously reputed and known to be a Lunatique, this Contract did neither bind
him nor his Successors.</p>
            <p>To this it is easily answered, That Contracts made by men disabled by
Law to enter into any such compositions, are of force by two wayes; The
one if they with due and requisite solemnities be done by such as by Law
are deputed to have the Government of their goods and persons during
the time of their weakness and imbecillity: The other, if they themselves
having <hi>dilucida intervalla,</hi> being (as Lunatiques many times are) in
perfect sense and memory to celebrate any manner of Contract, the same
is of full force and strength; and therefore <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth being (as
their own Histories report) at the time when this Agreement was made,
in his right wits and memory: This contract wanted not the force and
vertue which Law requireth, especially since the chief Nobility of the
Realm were then not only present, but consenting thereunto, and sworn
to the performance thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Objection is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third Objection and answer.</note> That the Kings of <hi>France</hi> cannot alienate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,
Rights, Titles, and Interests of the Crown without the privity and
consent of the three Estates, which consent could not possibly be had at this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,<note place="margin">Guido Papnis quest. 23. 9. Hostiensis extr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him against the King his Father.</p>
            <p>To this I briefly answer, That in matters which go by plurality of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it is not alwayes necessary that all be present, but that the greater or
better part of them that will and do vouchsafe their presence thereat
yield their consents thereunto, especially when the others who are absent
have been cited and warned to be present,<note place="margin">Alexander Cent. 25. n. 20. vel 5.</note> and they either willingly or

or disallow the things which concerneth them, and they will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

proceeding in their absence, <hi>quia volenti non fit injuria.</hi> In this case
therefore those that were away, being either voluntarily absent, or tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
minded to their King (which appeared in that they followed his
Son against him, and animated and assisted him in his disobedience and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93045:28"/>
rebellion against his Father) could not in any respect prejudice the force
and validity of this contract; for if they were absent of purpose, then
there was no injury done unto them; and if they were Traytors (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
they are, who either bear Armes against their Prince, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his Enemies with their counsels) then they had lost the right of their
consent and voice; And so consequently the Contract which was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by the more and better part, or by all the Nobility, and of the three
Estates that were present, and true and Loyal Subjects unto their King,
notwithstanding the others voluntary malicious absence, was by Law war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
especially being confirmed and fortified by the Oath of the King,
and his Council and Nobility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth Objection against this Agreement is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fourth Objection and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> That when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
the King of <hi>England</hi> had almost Conquered all <hi>France,</hi> was there
with his power and strength about him, and shut up the French King as it were
in Prison, and utterly disabled him to make any resistance against his invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, and conquering Forces; And therefore whatsoever he did, being
done by fear and compulsion, was of no better force then a Contract extorted by
violence, or made in Prison by a private man, which when he is set at liberty,
he is not bound by Law to perform except he list.</p>
            <p>To this Point I likewise Answer briefly; That the Law that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for the remedy of such as by Imprisonment, or by violence and just
fear, and such as the Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, <hi>cadet in fortem virum,</hi> have yeilded to
any inconveniency, extendeth not (in my simple conceit) her force unto
the Contracts of Princes, which are celebrated and concluded after long
Wars betwixt them; For if Conquerors might not impose what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Peace they please upon the conquered, there would never be any
end of Wars; And as private men being in troubles may even in cases
which admit no giving or taking on any side (as for Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
livings betwixt Ecclesiastical persons) redeem their troubles by
giving or taking whatsoever shall be agreed upon, and with the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
they may; so in Wars, Princes who have lost the field, and so
weakned their Forces, that they are able to make no longer resistance,
may lawfully alienate the more part of the Revenues of their Crown, to
purchase their liberty, and their Subjects quiet; who (if their Princes
might not capitulate with his and their Adversary, in such manner as the
Conqueror shall demand) should be deprived of their lives, liberties and
Livings; of all which three, every King is sworn to have a special care
and regard, and to seek all means possible to preserve them all: And in
consideration hereof, it is usual amongst Princes rather to lye in durance
a long time, then to yeild to the unreasonable demands of their enemies,
whilst they are in the heat of their choller and indignation; because when
their wrath is somewhat asswaged, and either time or intercession of other
Princes (who commonly in such cases interpose their helping hands, and
be Mediators of Peace) mitigated and moderated their anger, they are
willing to yeild to reasonable conditions. For confirmation hereof, I
could alleadg many examples, but I will deal with a Frenchman at his
own weapon: <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> in his before mentioned History, discoursing
at large of the hard measure that was offered unto <hi>Francis</hi> the first, King
of <hi>France,</hi> after he was taken Prisoner at <hi>Pavia,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Army of
the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, saith, That there were never but two Kings
of <hi>France</hi> taken prisoners in the field, <hi>(to wit)</hi> King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the said <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93045:28"/>
King <hi>Iohn</hi> was so kindly used in <hi>England,</hi> (where he lay above 2 years
pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oner) that after he was delivered thence, he would needs go thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to see his good Host, for so he termed the King of <hi>England,</hi> whereas
<hi>Francis</hi> the first, albeit he greatly desired to be transported out of <hi>Italy</hi> into
<hi>Spain,</hi> being in great hope and confidence that the Emperor (who had seen
the change and variety of time, and also the inconstancy of fortune) would
have some Princely compassion upon him, found all things contrary to
his conceived hope and expectation; for he was committed to hard pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
kept with a continual and strong guard, not attended upon as a
Prince of his might and greatness ought to have been, hardly suffered to
speak with his Sister, who was sent out of <hi>France</hi> on purpose to comfort
him, and never brought unto the Emperours sight and presence, until
that through grief and melancholy he fell into so dangerous a sickness as
made the Phisitians almost despair of his recovery; the Emperour not
for love (as <hi>Guicciaraine</hi> affirmeth) but for fear to lose by his death all
that he hoped to get for his Ransome, went to visit and comfort him.
The reason of this hard usage was, to inforce him by long durance, and
want of liberty, to redeem his troubles upon hard conditions; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had oftentimes answered the Emperour, that he had rather dye
in Prison then yeild to his unreasonable demands, which could not be
well performed without the great prejudice, yea almost the utter subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Kingdom; and had accordingly written unto his Nobility and
Council in <hi>France,</hi> that they should make no more account of his life or
liberty, because the demands of his Ransome were too too unreasonable,
yet he was forced at length to subscribe and consent unto such hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Articles, as were agreed upon by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and his
Council; Which indeed were so hard, that although his Sons lay in <hi>Spain,</hi>
as Hostages for their performance; yet after he was delivered, he would
not see them accomplished, but fell a fresh to Wars with the Emperor;
and in the end, by the intercession of other Princes, made a more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
end. But King <hi>Iohn</hi> (as both the French Chronicles and ours do
report) was set at liberty with more equal conditions, and yet the same
were not performed; And the Frenchmen in all Treaties of peace with
us, have either gone so far beyond us with their wits, that they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
greatly deceived us, or have so fraudulently violated all, or the
more part of the Articles of their Agreement, that our victories being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
against them, never yeilded unto us any great commodity or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
The consideration whereof moved one of their Writers to say,<note place="margin">John Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</note> that
we never won any thing of them by the dint of Sword, but they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same again by the sharpness of their wits. And another Historian
of theirs mocketh us in his writings, and saith,<note place="margin">Philip de Comines,</note> That when we come to treat
with them of Peace, we sit down proudly, and with great words extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our exploits, valour, and good success against them; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our parts we do demand no less then the whole Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> but in the end of them, we fall from Mountains unto Molehills.</p>
            <p>Now sithence we by their own confession have been so courteous and
reasonable, that we have yeilded them far better favour, and better
conditions of peace then they hoped for, and they contrarywise have
dealt so craftily, and so deceitfully with us, both in the time of King
<hi>Iohn,</hi> and others, before the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, that we cannot
be blamed for dealing more hardly with them in the said contract, and
for using the surest way we could devise for our security and assurance of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93045:29"/>
that which was promised unto us. And certainly as the Treaties and
Conclusions of peace made with King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and King <hi>Francis,</hi> were in
the opinion of the best and learnedst Lawyers of <hi>Europe</hi> held lawful,
although they were not in all points performed; so the Contract made
betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, and his Son-in Law <hi>Henry</hi> fifth of <hi>England,</hi>
was undoubtedly agreeable to Law and Equity; for otherwise Princes
should be in worse condition then Subjects, who are bound to perform
every point of a reasonable contract or agreement which they make. But
it was hard to demand and take a whole Kingdom. True if conquests
were not lawful, we should have dealt so favourably with <hi>Charles</hi> the
Sixth, as our Predecessor did with King <hi>Iohn;</hi> it might be we would
have done so, if King <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Successors had not before oftentimes
deceived us. Princes do not usually take advantage of their enemies when
they have the upper hand over them, with all utmost extremities. But
if they do, what remedy is there? or who can gainsay the Conqueror?
Courtesie is commendable in all men, and especially in Princes, who are
to extend the same at all times, when it is demanded in good manner, and
by men worthy of mercy and compassion. And such was the lamentable
<hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, who had at once many miseries heaped upon
him by the heavy wrath of God, as namely, wars within his Realm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of his own Son against him, revolt of his Subjects, and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his wits; and so it was extream cruelty to adde affliction to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.
Indeed mercy is to be extended to persons worthy of commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and Lunatiques are by all men to be pitied: and in regard hereof,
the King of England, whereas he might have destroyed the whole Realm
of <hi>France,</hi> burned the Cities, wasted the Countries, led away the people
in captivity, taken their goods to his own use, bestowed the Nobilities
and Gentlemens Lands upon his own Subjects, altered the Lawes of the
Countrey, changed the Government thereof, deprived the most part of
them of their lives, and seated his own Subjects in their possessions; he
suffered them to live at liberty, to enjoy their ancient possessions, to
maintain and use their own priviledges, to dwell in their wonted habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to continue in all respects as free as they were before they were
conquered. And whereas he might have made the King prisoner, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
him with him into <hi>England,</hi> and to have placed another to govern
for him, especially he being not in case to rule and govern by himself: He
was so far from so doing, that he suffered him to enjoy the Kingdom
whilest he lived, and by taking his Daughter to wife, transferred not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the French, but also the English Crown unto the issue of her body, a
thing to be greatly desired of that Father, whose Son by reason of his
disobedience deserved not to succeed him; a thing practised by all men
that have had the like children, a thing far beyond the custom of French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselves, who in the like cases have not used the like clemency
and moderation.<note place="margin">Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What cruelty purposed they to have practised in <hi>England,</hi> at
what time <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dolphin of <hi>France</hi> was called into <hi>England</hi> by the
Barons who bare Armes against King <hi>Iohn?</hi> Intended they not to have
destroyed the most part of the Realm? Purposed they not to have killed
the very Barons themselves, who were their friends and confederates?
Had they not executed this their purpose,<note place="margin">Polid. Virg. Holinshed.</note> if a noble French-man who
was in <hi>England</hi> had not as well in hatred of their intended cruelty, as in
commiseration of the poor English Nobility, revealed upon his death-bed
their barbarous intentions? To be brief, what severity used King <hi>Lewis</hi>
surnamed for his lenity towards others, <hi>Lewis</hi> the M E E K, against
<hi>Bernard</hi> his own Nephew,<note place="margin">Du Haillan. Froissart.</note> and rightful heir to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
(as we have shewed in the second point which we handled) whom he not
only deprived of his right, but also held him a long time in Prison, and
condemned him to lose his eyes, which were accordingly pluckt out of
his head; and his cheif Counsellours endured the like punishment: Of
which both he and they complaining, not without just occasion, were so
far from finding such compassion and remedy as they deserved, as that a
new Edictment was framed both against him and them: Now with such
Adversaries, with men of such cruelty, with such as had oftentimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified
their faith, and broken their promises, what wise Prince would ever
have used greater lenity, more mercy, or better Justice then the King of
<hi>England</hi> shewed them? Especially considering the immortal hatred, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>The fifth Objection that they make against this Contract, is,<note place="margin">The fifth Objection, with the answer.</note> is, <hi>That the
Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>cannot be given unto any man by Will or Testament:</hi>

contrary to the custom of other Countries, and repugnant to the Law of
all Nations, they must shew how they came by such a Priviledge, and
why they should not follow the customes of other Kingdomes: For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will alledge an exemption from the due observance of the Law,
must make it appear at what time, for what occasion, and by whom he
or his Predecessors obtained the same, that the quality of the Giver, and
the consideration and cause of the Grant being duly examined and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
considered,<note place="margin">Terapha. Holinshed. Hect. Boet.</note> the strength and validity of his exemption may be
well and perfectly seen.<note place="margin">Hist. <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae.</hi>
               </note> I know that there are many degrees of Princes,
and that some Kings are in some manner subject unto others from whom
they receive Lawes, and by whom they and their Kingdomes are ruled
and directed. So hath <hi>Scotland</hi> been ruled by <hi>England,</hi> so hath <hi>Denmark</hi>
acknowledged the Empire, so hath <hi>Sicily</hi> obeyed <hi>Rome;</hi> so hath the Pope
challenged power and authority over the Empire. But all Histories agree
in this, that although of other Kingdomes some be subject to the Pope,
others unto the Emperour, yet the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is, and alwayes
hath been most absolute, neither depending upon the Emperour, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any respect subject unto the Pope. That the Emperour hath no
authority over <hi>France,</hi> was shewed when as <hi>Sigismond</hi> the Emperour
would have made the Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> a Duke in <hi>Lyons;</hi> for then the Kings
Officers withstood him therein, and forced him, to his great grief, and in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93045:30"/>
a great fury and anger to depart thence, and out of all the dominion of
<hi>France,</hi> before he could use in that point his Imperial power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And that the Pope hath no manner of Authority, Prerogative, or
Preheminence over <hi>France,</hi> it appeareth by the confession of all Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
who have written, and do write of the Popes Prerogatives: For
albeit they make the Empire, and almost all the Kingdoms of the world,
in some sort subject unto the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet they confess the King of
<hi>France</hi> to be so absolute, that he acknowledgeth no Superior but God,
and that there is no other Prince but he, unto whom some Pope or other
hath not either given or confirmed his Estate and Kingdom. It must
needs therefore follow, That there is no Superior out of <hi>France,</hi> who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath or could bestow his priviledge upon <hi>France:</hi> And it appeareth
by their own Histories;<note place="margin">Du Haillan</note> That there hath been nothing done within the
Realm whereby their Kings have been forbidden to dispose their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
by their last Wills and Testaments: For <hi>Dagobert,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
in the presence of the principal Lords and Prelates of his Realm, made his
last Will and Testament, and therein gave the Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia</hi> unto
his Son <hi>Sigisbert;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Piero Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ias vida de Carlo Magno.</note> and the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> unto his Son <hi>Cloius,</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Charlemain</hi> by Will and Testament, divided his Kingdom betwixt
his three Sons; He gave unto <hi>Charles</hi> the best and greatest part of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Germany;</hi> unto <hi>Pipin, Italy</hi> and <hi>Baivera;</hi> and unto <hi>Lewis</hi> that part
of <hi>France</hi> which confineth and bordereth upon <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Provence;</hi> And
caused this his Will to be ratified, confirmed and approved by the Pope;
and intituled his Sons with the names of Kings. It is also written by
French Historiographers, That <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> (who contended with <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third for the Crown of <hi>France</hi>) ordained by his last Will and
Testament,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 15. p. 214.</note> that <hi>Iohn</hi> his eldest Son should succeed him in the Crown;
and that his second Son <hi>Philip</hi> should enjoy for his part and portion, the
Dukedom of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Earldom of <hi>Valois.</hi> Now these three
Kings being of three Races of the French Kings, <hi>Dagobert</hi> of the <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingians,
Charlemain</hi> of the <hi>Charlemains,</hi> and <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> although
not directly, yet collaterally of the <hi>Capets,</hi> which are the three only Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that ever were in <hi>France;</hi> and they having disposed of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in manner as is a foresaid, it may well be presumed that others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them have or might have done the like, especially since there is no
Law to be shewed which forbiddeth Kings to bequeath their Kingdoms
by Will and Testament.</p>
            <p>The sixth and last Objection which is made against this Contract is,
<hi>That</hi> Charles <hi>the sixth could not lawfully dis-inherit his son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The sixth Objection with the Answer.</note> 
               <hi>who, by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

            </p>
            <p>In this Objection there are two things intended; The one, <hi>That the
Kings of</hi> France <hi>cannot deprive their Sons or next Heirs, for any occasion
whatsoever, of their Right, Title, and Interest to the Royal Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

The other, <hi>That the next of the blood Royal, according to the Custom

            <p>This Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection is (in my simple opinion) of greatest force, because I
read not in all the Histories of <hi>France,</hi> that ever any King thereof, but
<hi>Charls</hi> the sixth did dis-inherit his Son: True it is that <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh
was thus dis-inherited, being plagued by God for his disobedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93045:30"/>
his Father, with a Son as undutiful and disobedient in all respects,
as himself was, sent unto the Pope to advise him how he might dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
his eldest Son, who had divers times rebelled against him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the Kingdom upon his second son, in whom he never found any
manner of disobedience; but the difficulty is resolved by this reason fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
For if a Kingdom may be given by Will and Testament (as is
to be presumed) that it may also be taken away from one, and bestowed
upon another, when there is just cause given by him who layeth claim
thereunto; why he should be dis-inherited, especially when as there is
no such necessity of successive inheritance, as hath hitherto been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
And in case it be doubtful whether a Kingdom may be taken from
the right Heir, and be bequeathed unto another; the custom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in private mens Inheritance is to be considered: because most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
such as the Law is in part, such it is in the whole; and for that
generally the Nobility of every Realm (who regard the conservation of
their Honour and Dignity in their Families, no less then Princes do the
preservation of the Royal Authority in their Posterity) do follow and
imitate the manner, Law, and Order of their Kings, touching the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of their Kingdoms: And even as they usually dispose of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
so do the other of their Baronies, and inferior Estates, by what
Name or Title soever they be called: If therefore it can be shewed that
any of the chief Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> have at any time dis-inherited their
lawful Heirs, it may justly be presumed that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> may do
the like, when the like occasion is offered unto them: The Lords of <hi>Bearne</hi>
have time out of mind, been of such power and might in <hi>France,</hi> that the
Kings thereof have in all Ages made great account and reckoning of
them; And the present King of <hi>France</hi> is Lord thereof; and by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
the Spaniards (who will hardly vouchsafe him the name of a
King of <hi>France</hi> or of <hi>Navar,</hi> because they take him to be lawful King of
neither of these Kingdoms) is commonly called in their Writings, Lord
of <hi>Bearne.</hi> The Earls also of <hi>Foix,</hi> have beyond the memory of man,
been of such worth and estimation, that it is written of them, (when
they were also Lords of <hi>Bearne</hi>) they cared neither for the King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
nor for the Kings of <hi>Navarra,</hi> for they were able upon any urgent
occasion to keep more men at Arms at one time, then both those Kings
could make at two several Levies. Both these Lordships or Seigneuries,
are now under the Kingdom of <hi>Navar;</hi> and the principal members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the Lords and lawful Owners of each of them,<note place="margin">Nich. Gyles Froissart.</note> dis-inherited their
next and lawful Heirs, only for ingratitude and unkindness towards them;
for the French Histories report, that <hi>Gaston</hi> Lord of <hi>Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of <hi>Navar,</hi> went about to have poisoned him, gave his Earldom
from him, to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who presently bestowed the same up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earl of <hi>Candalles.</hi> Here you see two Heirs dis-inherited by their
Father, whose Act was generally reputed and held lawful. Now you
shall see the like cause in <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh; and why should it not be
thought lawful for his Father to inflict upon him the like punishment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The one of them denyed his Father in law such help as he demanded;
The other purposed to have poysoned his own Father: The unkindness
of both was not in all degrees equal, yet their punishments were in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
alike. The Father of the one incurred no loss by his Son in lawes
disobedience, and the Father of the other lived not a minute of an hour
the less, notwithstanding his sons wicked purpose. But <hi>Charles</hi> the 6ths
case was in many respects lamentable, and his Sons ingratitude for many
causes worthy of greater punishment then the loss of a Kingdom; for the
murdered the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> one of the chief Peers of <hi>France,</hi> and
when he was summoned by Proclamation to shew some cause before his
Father,<note place="margin">Du Haillan. lib. 21.</note> and the Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> why he had committed so horrible a
murder, did not only not appear at his Fathers Summons, but also defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his cruelty in killing the Duke, and his disobedience in not appearing
at his Fathers Commandment, by force of Armes: For which unnatural
Rebellion, not his Father alone, but the whole Council and Nobility of
<hi>France,</hi> gave judgement that he should be banished the Realm, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unworthy to succeed his Father, either in the whole Kingdom, or in
any part or parcel thereof; which done, and Judgment being both begun
and ended with all such solemnities as in the like cases are required, must
of necessity be held and reputed most just and equal, since both Law and
mans reason neither hath not can invent any better means to chast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se and
correct the unnatural disobedience of rebellious children towards their
Parents, then by depriving them of their Patrimony descending from
their Parents. And if Princes should be debarred of this manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
they should be in far worse condition then their poorest Subjects;
for Princes Children having more occasions to lead them to wickedness,
then their Subjects Children have, if they should not be restrained by
dis-inheritance, would undoubtedly go far beyond all others in lewdness
and unhappiness; because Princes and Noble-men, whether they give
themselves unto vertue or unto vice, most commonly excell the meaner
sort in both, as it may evidently appear unto such by reading the lives of
Princes and Peers of all Realms and Kingdoms, shall find such rare Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of vertues and vices in them, as far exceed mans reason, or will
hardly be credited or beleeved of any man. Was there ever any private
man comparable to <hi>Nero</hi> for cruelty, or to <hi>Vespasian</hi> for mercy? to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
for wisdom, or to <hi>Childerick</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for folly? to <hi>Trajan</hi> for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or to <hi>Cambyses</hi> for murder? to <hi>Tarquin</hi> for pride, or to <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> for meekness? to <hi>Caesar</hi> for liberality, or to <hi>Caligula</hi> for avarice?
to <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> for moderation and temperance, or to <hi>Commodus</hi> for
prodigality and dissoluteness? Briefly, to <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for lenity
and clemency, or to <hi>Dionisius</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> for rigor and severity? For
undoubtedly, as long as the provocations to vices, and the allurements
to vertues are more and greater in Princes then in private men, so long
will the one far exceed the other in vertues or in vices; Then since it is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93045:31"/>
behoveful for every Common-wealth to be ruled by good Princes; it
must also behove good Parents to be careful to leave good children to
succeed after them, and not to be so affected to the eldest of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
because he is the first of their strength, as to make him, and no other
but him, their sole Heir and Successor, although he alone be wicked and
ill given, and the rest wise, discreet, and vertuous; so he unworthy to
Govern, and they most fit to Rule; because he would overthrow, and
they uphold the whole Estate and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof, moved the good Emperour <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
who had a good and a bad Son, when he was visited with a Disease
that was mortal, greatly to lament his own death; not because he was
loth and unwilling to dye, knowing as he did, that death was the end of
all miseries, and the beginning of everlasting felicity;<note place="margin">Vita de Marc. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relio.</note> but for that he was
bound by the custome, generally, and time out of mind received and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by his Predecessors, contrary to his will and desire, to leave the
Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> (which had been ruled a long time by his many years and
great experience) to be Governed and Ruled by the indiscreet youth and
youthful indiscretion of his bad Son <hi>Commodus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof, caused <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> to
perswade his eldest Son <hi>Iames</hi> (who was more fit to live sequestred from
the company of men,<note place="margin">Tarapha Illescas lib. 6.</note> in a Monastry, then to sway a Monarchy) to leave
the world, and betake himself to a Monastical life, suffering his second
Brother <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> (upon whom God had bestowed sufficient gifts and
qualities capable of a Kingdom) to succeed his Father in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof induced <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to make his
second Son <hi>Henry</hi> his Heir and Successor in the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 6.</note> because he
knew that God had endowed him with a far better spirit and wit, more fit
to Command and Govern then his eldest Son <hi>Robert</hi> had, upon whom he
bestowed the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof moved not only <hi>Lewis</hi> surnamed the <hi>Gross,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 8.</note>
King of <hi>France,</hi> but also all the Peers and States of the same Realm, to
make <hi>Lewis</hi> his second Son King, because <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest Son was by
him and them, for want of judgment and understanding, judged unfit
and unworthy to bear or sway the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore he and
they held it sufficient to bestow upon him the Earldom of <hi>Dreux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the Consideration hereof moved <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to
intreat <hi>Sigisbert</hi> his eldest Son,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 2.</note> who not being able in his opinion to Rule
and Govern so great a Kingdom as <hi>France,</hi> and yet desirous to have the
name of a King, to be contented with the small Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia,</hi>
and to resign and give over his Right and Title to the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
unto his younger Brother <hi>Clouis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering therefore, That the Gifts which are required in a Prince
are many and very difficult to be attained: That very few have wit and
wisdom sufficient to govern a Kingdom: That of these few some use their
wits to attain to their purpose; and when they have gotten their desire,
leave both to be wise and vertuous, as I could declare by many Examples,
if it were not to digress from my purpose:) And lastly, that the vertues
of the Parents are obscured and blemished by the childrens vices; and
the Predecessors Conquests are oftentimes either lost or diminished by
the Successors folly and pusillanimity: It were a shame for the Father, a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93045:32"/>
detriment to the Common-wealth, a wrong to the Kingdom, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to the vertuous child, where there is a good Son to succeed a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Father, to bind the same Father to leave little or nothing to his good
children, and a whole Kingdom to him that is neither worthy nor well
able to rule the thousand part thereof; And if at any time it be lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
yea scant tolerable, to prefer wicked children before them that are
vertuous; and to lay a heavy charge and burthen upon their shoulders,
who are not able to take up (much less to bear) the same, not for a day,
but for the whole term of their natural life; truly it is much more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
yea, in no respect to be suffered, that such a Son should be set
over others, to rule and govern them, who could nor would never govern
himself well; to exact and require obedience of his Inferiors, who was
always disobedient in the highest degree of disobedience unto his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
to manage, husband, and increase the Treasure of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who hath prodigally wasted and consumed his own private Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
Lastly, to induce others by his example to live honestly, justly,
orderly, and virtuously (as Princes either do or should do) who never
esteemed honesty, cared for justice, respected order, or embraced ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Bodin</hi> in his Book <hi>de Republica,</hi> writeth that a disobedient child of
<hi>France</hi> being sued by his Mother for using himself unreverently towards
her, and especially for easing his body in a mess of Broth which she had
provided for her self; was condemned by a competent and wise judge,
to make her honourable amends; from which sentence the wicked Son
disdaining to ask his Mother pardon and forgiveness, appealed unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
where it was found <hi>bene appellatum,</hi> and <hi>male judicatum,</hi> not that the
Judges there thought that the Appellant had just cause to appeal, because
he was enjoined to submit himself unto his Mother; but for that they were
of opinion that the Judges from whom he had appealed, had not inflicted
such punishment upon him as he deserved; And therefore considering
his former disobedience, and also his unkind and unnatural perseverance
therein, indiscreetly shewed, in refusing to make so slender a submission,
they altered the former sentence, and gave judgment that he should be
presently hanged, which was accordingly executed.</p>
            <p>This sentence was highly commended by <hi>Bodin,</hi> and worthily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and praised by as many Frenchmen as did ever read the same in his
Book.</p>
            <p>And how can they dislike the Judgment given against <hi>Charles</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
not by any inferior Judge, but by a King; not by a Parliament
of <hi>Paris</hi> (the Judges whereof may so hate an offence, that for the very
and sole indignity thereof, they do likewise hate the offender) but by a
Father, who had rather conceal then reveal, and pardon then punish his
childrens offences; neither by a Father alone, but by the whole Peers
and Nobles of a well ruled Kingdom? not lightly and without advice,
but deliberately, and with great discretion and wisdom; Briefly, not in
hatred of the offender, but in regard of the whole Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which might perish under the hands and government of an unwise, unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and unnatural Prince, in whom there could be no hope of love towards
them or their Country, because he had given manifest signs of want of
love towards his Father, whom nature and other respects bound him to
love, honour, and reverence; for Princes as well as private men, and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93045:32"/>
children of the one, as well as the off-spring of the other, are equally and
undoubtedly bound to obey Gods Laws, and Commandments; And if
both in one manner presume to break the same, both without all doubt
and controversie are subject to one and the same measure of punishment.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, Laws are made by Princes, and not for Princes;
and to bind their inferiour subjects, and not themselves or their children;
who for their Fathers sake, for the priviledge of their birth, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of their place, and in regard of the authority and preheminence
whereunto they are born, may and ought to challenge and enjoy far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
immunity, yea, and somtimes more impunity then other Peers, or
private men: certainly reason permitteth, and humanity perswadeth to
favour a Prince much more then a subject. But it was both the Will and
the Law of a worthy Prince, That nothing commendeth the Majesty of
a Prince more, then to submit himself to the observance of his own Laws:
and there can be no better means to induce subjects to shew their obedience
unto their Princes Laws, then the example of their own Princes, not
vouchsafing to violate the least branch that is of their own Statutes and
Constitutions. Was not that King highly commended by his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
praised by his posterity, and worthily extolled even in our age not
meaning that the son who had by breach of the Law deserved to lose both
his eyes, should escape unpunished (which might be offensive unto his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects)
but intending to moderate and qualifie the rigour of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was his Heir (which for some considerations is tolerable in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
plucked out one of his own eyes, and another of his Sons, thereby
satisfying, if not the rigour, yet the equity of the Law; and thereby
moving his subjects to compassion in regard of himself, and to obedience
to the same Law in consideration of his justice.</p>
            <p>I have stood too long upon the confutation of this last objection, and
yet have touched but one part thereof; and therefore I will run over the
other part lightly, because in refelling the same, I shall need but to make
a brief repetition of that which hath been said already: for if you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that not <hi>Bernard</hi> the Nephew,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 2, 6, 8.</note> but <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Meek</hi> succeeded his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pipin,</hi> eldest son to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and father to <hi>Bernard;</hi> That <hi>Pipin,</hi>
and not the right Heir was king after <hi>Childerick;</hi> that <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and not
<hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> enjoyed the Crown immediately after <hi>Lotharius:</hi>
That <hi>Dagoberts</hi> second son, and not the eldest possessed the Royal Scepter
after him: That <hi>Henry</hi> the younger, and not the elder brother ruled after
king <hi>Robert</hi> their Father; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the second, and not <hi>Robert</hi> the
eldest child of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Gross,</hi> was called to the royal Scepter and
Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and also, if it may please you to call to remembrance
that <hi>Pharamond,</hi> with divers others before-mentioned, were chosen kings,
you shall easily see and perceive, that there hath been no such custome, or
at the least-wise the same not so inviolable as it is suggested, for the next of
the Blood to succeed always in his own right, and not as Heir to hid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor.
In like manner if you please to understand that <hi>Theodorick</hi> the
first king of <hi>France</hi> of that name,<note place="margin">Nic. Gyles.</note> because he was a man wholly given over
to pleasure, of small worth, of less value, and of no sufficiency capable
of so great a Kingdom as <hi>France</hi> was and is, was by the States of his
Realm deprived of his Royal Crown and Dignity, and put up in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
That <hi>Lewis</hi> surnamed <hi>Do nothing,</hi> because he had make <hi>France</hi>
Tributary unto <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Idem.</note> was also driven by the States to give over his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93045:33"/>
Kingdom, and to lead the residue of his life in a house of Religion; And
that the Peers of <hi>France</hi> not regarding the young years of <hi>Charls</hi> the son
of <hi>Lewis</hi> their King,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> deprived him of his right, and made <hi>Eude</hi> Earl of
<hi>Paris</hi> king of <hi>France;</hi> You may think it as lawful for <hi>Charls</hi> the 6. to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
his Son <hi>Charles</hi> of his Inheritance, for the horrible murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(as it hath been said) on the person of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
a Prince of the blood royall, a Peer of <hi>France,</hi> and a Counsellour unto
the King his Father; and for the great, manifest, and undutiful disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which he shewed unto his Father, as it was for the States of the
same Realm to deprive <hi>Theodorick</hi> for his Insufficiency, <hi>Lewis</hi> for his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimity,
and <hi>Charles</hi> for his youth. So you see the last Objection
refuted by their own Examples. And as you see the cause why it is said
that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> cannot dis-inherit their children; so I will let
you understand the reason why they have invented a new shift or device,
thereby to deprive those of their due who made claim to such debts as the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> owed them.</p>
            <p>There was a time (and so it is still) when a King of <hi>France</hi> dyed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indebted to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> which debt they challenging of his immediate
Successor and Heir, who dyed in their debt; It was answered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
true it was that Contracts do bind the Contrahents and their heirs,
as well private men a Princes, yet the Kings of <hi>France</hi> not succeeding as
Heirs, but as Successors by custom, are not within the meaning and sense
of that Law which speaketh of Contracts and their Contrahents, and
their Heirs only.<note place="margin">Smillerus de republica Helvetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> By which cavil the poor <hi>Switzers</hi> were deceived of their
due debt, as we English-men have been debarred of our Claims, Titles
and Rights, sometimes by the Law <hi>Salique,</hi> which was (as I have said)
no Law of <hi>France,</hi> and sometimes by such exceptions, devices, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties,
as I have lately specified.</p>
            <p>The fourth point whereat they wonder, is, why the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
having good right unto the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The reasons why <hi>England</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth not her right in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> and better success when
they demanded their Right by Fire and Sword, do not still prosecute their
demand, and did quickly lose whatsoever they or their Predecessors got
in many years.</p>
            <p>This point consisteth of two several points, the one why we forbear
to challenge our right? the other by what occasion we lost all that some
of our Kings had conquered, especially <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, who subdued
the greatest part of <hi>France;</hi> and although he dyed very young, yet he left
his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, being an Infant of few years, so mighty at home
so be-friended abroad, so accompanied with good Souldiers, so well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
with good Counsellours, so followed by cunning and expert cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,<note place="margin">Du Haillan Polid. Virg. Holinshed.</note>
and so directed by wise and discreet Generals, that when he was
but ten years of Age, he was crowned at <hi>Paris</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> by the
Dukes of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and in the presence of the chief Peers and
Nobility of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This first point is easily answered, because ever since the first time we
laid claim to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> those Princes of ours who were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men, and inclined to Wars, demanded their Right by open Wars;
as both ours and their Chronicles do testifie. But it pleased God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to send us (as he doth unto other Kingdomes) such Princes as
were rather given to pleasure, and unto peace, rather then unto Wars,
and Martial exploits; in whose time the Frenchmen were wise enough to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93045:33"/>
take advantage of their quiet and peaceable natures; and when our Kings
and Subjects, following (as Subjects commonly do) the humours and
qualities of their Princes, gave themselves unto pleasures and pastimes,
the French followed the Wars; and either by open Invasions, or by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
devices, recoverd part of their losses. Besides it hath sometimes
fortuned, that when we had valiant Princes, and such as hath both good
will and sufficient power to recover their Right, our Realm hath either
been divided within it self, and by domestical dissention hindred to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Forraign Wars: Or that our Kings coming by their kingdoms by
force of Armes, have had more mind and occasion to stable and assure
the same unto themselves and their Heirs, then to make Wars abroad.
Again during the contentions betwixt the houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and of <hi>York,</hi>
sometimes the one part, and sometimes the other sought favour and
friendship, and alliance of the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> and they who prevailed
in their attempts and purposes, by their aid, furtherance and sufferance;
thought it an especial point of wit and policy to seek and continue their
Amity; yea, and sometimes to buy the same with very hard conditions;
lest that having them for their Enemies, they should either invade their
Realms, or assist their Competitors, who most commonly fled unto them
for help; relief, and succour. For as many of our Kings as have been
driven out of their Royal Seats and Dignities by their domestical Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
have been either entertained, or restored to their Crowns by the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or the Princes of
<hi>Henault;</hi> as were <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the second, the sixth and the
seventh. Besides some of the kings of <hi>France,</hi> as namely, <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <note place="margin">Da Haillan Phil. de Comines. Holinshed Polid. Virg. Hect. Boet.</note> the
twelfth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first, doubting that our Kings would annoy them
at home whilest they were busied in Forraign Wars, corrupted our Kings
Council with bribes, and with yearly rewards and pensions made them so
bound and beholding unto them, that they did not only bewray their
Masters secrets, but also diverted their purposes; and if at any time they
were purposed to molest <hi>France,</hi> or to joyn with the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi>
they changed the Kings minds, and perswaded them not only, not to
hinder, but also to help and further the French Kings in all their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
and against all their Enemies. And they were not only content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id Cardinal
<hi>Wolsey,</hi> who bare such sway with <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, changed his determination so
often, made him friend and enemy to whom he would, and favoured the
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and sometimes the French king his common
Adversary, in such manner, that it was commonly said, that Cardinal
<hi>Wolsey</hi> ruled the French King, the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Emperour,
but also they purchased our Kings favour and furtherance with yearly
Fees and Pensions. For it is written that <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh to retain and
entertain the King of <hi>England</hi> for his friend,<note place="margin">Phil. de Comines.</note> payed him yearly in <hi>London</hi>
50000 Crowns, and bestowed yearly 16000 other Crowns upon his
chief Counsellors, the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> and the
Master of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> and when our King had any occasion to send any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
unto him, he received them so honourably, entertained them
so friendly, rewarded them so liberally, and dispatched them with so
fair words, although their Embassage was never so unpleasant and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
unto him, that they departed alwayes very well contented. And
albeit that some of them knew that whatsoever he did, was to win time to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93045:34"/>
work his will and purposes, yet because they got much by their dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they dissembled their knowledge, and never acquainted our King with
his secret intentions.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Lewis,</hi> besides this manner of entertaining of our Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
used (when there was any great matter in debate and contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and him) to receive all Ambassages that were sent unto him, and
never to answer any of them but alwaies promised to send other Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
after them, who should bring his answers, and give our king such
assurance of all things whereof he had occasion to doubt, that he should
have no longer cause to be discontented; and when it came to the sending
of such Ambassadors, because he would be still assured to gain time, he
sent such personages as never had been in <hi>England</hi> before; to the end, that
if his former Ambassadors had promised any thing that was not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or begun any Treaty that was not finished, the latter should not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make any answer thereunto, but enforced to desire some time and
respite to acquaint their Master therewith, and to crave and have his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
therein.</p>
            <p>Further, you may remember that it hath been already said, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
to the end that Kingdoms should remain still under their natural
Princes, or being transferred from one Nation to another, should at length
return unto kings of their own Nation, who indeed are more fit to govern
them, of his infinite goodness toward man doth usually send a peaceable
Successor after a Warlike Prince, in whose time the conquered recover
either all or part of their losses, which by his heavenly will and pleasure
hath hapned in <hi>England</hi> as well as in other places: For we have had such

               </note> We won in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the first
the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and sold it presently. We enjoyed by reason of
the marriage with the daughter and heir of <hi>VVilliam</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and
wife unto <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. that Dukedome better then 300 years, and at the
last lost the same by negligence. We possessed the Dukedome of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
350 years, and lost it in the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the 7. We subdued
<hi>Scotland</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hect. Boet.</note> in <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. time, and lost it not long after. We conquered <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
better then four hundred years since, and yet retain it. VVe ruled in
<hi>Flanders</hi> for a while, and were driven out of <hi>Flanders</hi> after a small while.
Briefly, it is written by some, that <hi>Brennus</hi> who first took and conquered
<hi>Rome,</hi> was an Englishman, and that he continued his conquest but a very
short time.</p>
            <p>And as we have had good fortune against others, so others have not
wanted good success against us: for the <hi>Romans</hi> conquered us, the <hi>Saxons</hi>
subdued us, the <hi>Danes</hi> ruled us, and lastly the <hi>Normans</hi> had the upper hand
of us; of whom our Kings are lineally descended, and in whose race they
have continued better then 500 years.</p>
            <p>Again it is usual betwixt Princes, when they are wearied with long, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
chargeable and dangerous wars, to desire peace, and to yeild to
the same upon reasonable conditions; and in consideration of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
endured in wars, of their charges sustained thereby, and of their
subjects impoverished by the means thereof, to take long times of Truce,
and surcease from wars, within which time it is not lawful to do any act of
hostility. And this occasion hath also restrained some of our Princes for
attempting any thing against <hi>France,</hi> although they had great desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93045:34"/>
their right in <hi>France:</hi> Moreover it hath now and then hapned, that
when we have been determined to prosecute our right, we either have been
diverted by the entreaty of other Princes, who have been mediators for
peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and us; Or hindred by the departure of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ederates
from our part, as promised to aid and assist us in our enterprises.
Or drawn from them to defend our selves at home, by reason of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
invasions which have been made by the <hi>Scots</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
and perswasion of the French, which hath been the usual policy of
the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> to turn the wars from themselves upon us; alwaies
retaining the <hi>Scots</hi> for their friends and confederates, for no other purpose,
but either to help them when we came into <hi>France</hi> or to make war with
us when we intended to have carried our Forces thither.</p>
            <p>Again, either by the weakness or by the corruption of our Council,
we have (as hath been said) been so over-reached by the Frenchmen in all
such agreements as we have made with them, that when we have won the
whole, we have been contented with part, and when as we might have had
mountains, we have vouchsafed to accept mole-hills; yea, we have bound
our selves to relinquish our Right, to renounce our Titles, and give over all
our Interests.</p>
            <p>So at what time Prince <hi>Edward</hi> married <hi>Isabella</hi> daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the <hi>Fair,</hi> we resigned the Dutchy of <hi>Guyenna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Edward</hi> sir-named <hi>Long-hands,</hi> acquitted the French King of all the
right he had to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and to
the Earldoms of <hi>Anjou, Mayne, Tourrain,</hi> and <hi>Poictou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Edward</hi> 3. having taken King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France</hi> prisoner at <hi>Poictiou,</hi> and
retained him four years prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> took certain Towns and
Countries in <hi>France</hi> for his ransome, and surrendred the residue of <hi>France</hi>
into his hands, to be held by him and his heirs for ever, and with express
condition never to lay any claim thereunto thereafter.</p>
            <p>These agreements have been another cause why we have repressed our
desires, and not prosecuted our rights.</p>
            <p>Lastly, when we conquered <hi>France,</hi> and had continual wars therewith,
the Realm was not then as it hath been of late years united, void of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
free from civil wars, in the hands, and under the government of one
King, and not divided, dis-membred, and possessed with divers petty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who either for alliance with us, or for some quarrel betwixt them and
the French Kings, were alwaies ready to aid and assist us. So we had help
somtimes of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> of the Duke of
<hi>Britain,</hi> of the Earls of <hi>Foix,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of <hi>Arminack,</hi>
and somtimes of the kings of <hi>Navar,</hi> and of the Emperors of <hi>Germany;</hi>
which helps of late years failing us, and the reasons already mentioned,
have occasioned our weak, slender, and slack pursuit of the Title and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
which we pretend unto the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the second Point of this fourth Point, wherein I should spend
so much time, and overweary you with too long &amp; impertinent discourse,<note place="margin">The Causes and means how we lost all <hi>France.</hi>
               </note>
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I should relate unto you the time and manner, how and when we lost
<hi>Normandy, Aquitania,</hi> and every other member of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore
it shall suffice to shew you, how and when we had conquered almost all
<hi>France</hi> in a few years, we lost again all in a very short time.</p>
            <p>Both ours and the French Histories agree in this Point, That either in,
or immediately after the happy and prosperous Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93045:35"/>
we flourished, and possessed most in <hi>France;</hi> and lost all, or most part
of all, in the time of his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth.</p>
            <p>The ways how this came to pass were many, I have reduced them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
four and twenty; the least of every of which was, and hath been enough
to lose whole Estates and Kingdom, not gotten by Conquests, which are
easily recovered, but descending by Inheritance, which are hardly lost.</p>
            <p>The first Cause of our loss of whatsoever King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth had
gotten in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Holinshed. Polid. Virg. Du Haillan Ph. de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</note> was the death of King <hi>Charls</hi> the sixth; for when he
was dead, many of the French Nobility (which before either for fear of
the English puissance, or for the love which they bore unto King <hi>Charls,</hi>
favoured and furthered our part) revolted from us unto the <hi>Dolphin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius.</note> his
dis-inherited Son; and it is usual in Factions, the head of one side being
dead or suppressed, the residue be so weakned or feared, that either all
or the most part either fly unto their Adversaries, or else make their peace
with them, with as reasonable conditions as they can possibly; as was
seen by the death of <hi>Pompey.</hi> whose Adherents fled unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> or sought
his favour, after their principal Ring-leader and Guide was slain.</p>
            <p>The second Cause was the sparkles of sedition and strife which began
betwixt us and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> our principal Aider and Abettor,
who was highly discontented with us, because that <hi>Humphry,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Glocester,</hi> either blinded with ambition, or doting with the love of the
Lady <hi>Iaquet,</hi> sole Heir unto the County of <hi>Holland,</hi> had married her, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that her Husband <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and Brother to
the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> was then living.</p>
            <p>The third Cause was, the liberty of <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ransomed with courtesie, and having sworn Loyalty unto the young
King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, was no sooner in his own Country, then he forgot
his Oath, and allyed himself with the French King.</p>
            <p>The fourth was, the Revolt and departure of the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> and
his Brother, from us unto the French King.</p>
            <p>The fifth Cause was, the dissention betwixt the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who governed the young King; for appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
whereof the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Regent of <hi>France,</hi> was called home.</p>
            <p>The sixth, the liberty of the Duke of <hi>Alancon,</hi> who being Ransomed
in the Regents absence, did greatly strengthen the <hi>Dolphins</hi> power.</p>
            <p>The seventh, the death of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and of the worthiest
and most fortunate Captain that ever <hi>England</hi> bred at <hi>Orleans;</hi> After
whose decease the English good and prosperous fortune presently began
to decline.</p>
            <p>The eighth, was the refusal of the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> to suffer <hi>Orleans</hi> to
yeild to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> Of which refusal there proceeded two
great inconveniencies:</p>
            <p>The one, That they of <hi>Orleans</hi> offering to yeild themselves unto the
said Duke, because they held it less dishonourable to yeild unto a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
then unto an English Prince, although it were to the behalf and use
of the King of <hi>England;</hi> and seeing their offer refused, grew (as many
both before and since have done upon the like occasion) so wilful, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and desperate, that we could never get their Town, but suffered
great losses in laying and continuing our Siege thereat a very long time,
and indured such shame by departing thence without taking the same, that
even until this day (as I saw of late years my self) they yearly celebrate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93045:35"/>
this day as Festival, to our great dishonour, whereon they compelled us
to withdraw thence our overwearied and bootless Forces.</p>
            <p>The other, That the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> thinking by this refusal that
we envyed his Honour too much, who had rather lose a Town of such
strength and importance as <hi>Orleans</hi> was, then to suffer it to yeild unto
him; although it were (as I have said) to our own use and advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
by little and little to remove his affection, and unfeigned friendship
and furtherance from us.</p>
            <p>The ninth, The often conveying of Forces out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and in succour of the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
who as mortal enemies, warred one upon the other, for the cause above
mentioned; and also into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> for the
Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> who intended to make a Conquest of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth, The <hi>Dolphins</hi> policy who refused divers times to put try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of his cause to the hazard of a Battel.</p>
            <p>The eleventh, The mistrust and jealousie which the Regent had of the
Parisians; for fear of whose wavering and unconstant minds (a fault
whereto they have always been greatly subject) the said Regent left di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times very good and advantagious occasions to fight with the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi>
and return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth, The variance and strife betwixt the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi>
then Regent, and the Cardinal of <hi>Winchester,</hi> proceeding of this cause espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
for that the Cardinal presumed to command the Regent to leave
off that name during the Kings being in <hi>France;</hi> affirming, the chief Ruler
being present, the Authority of the substitute to cease, and to be derogate.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth, The death of the Dutchess of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Sister unto the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with whom dyed the true friendship between the two
Dukes.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth, The foolish pride of the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Paris</hi> of purpose to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Omers,</hi> a Town belonging to the Duke of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> and appointed and chosen a convenient place for them to meet,
and end all contentions betwixt them both, thought that the Duke of
<hi>Burgundy</hi> should have come to his Lodging to have visited him first, as
Son, Brother, and Uncle unto Kings; And the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> being
Lord of that place, would not vouchsafe him that Honour, but offered to
meet him half way; which the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> refusing, they departed
the Town discontented, and without seeing one another, and never after
saw and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and won, partly by the outcries of his own people (overwearied with wars)
and partly by the general councel held at <hi>Arras</hi> for the according and
agreeing of the two Kings, joineth with the French King.</p>
            <p>The sixteenth, The death of the Duke of <hi>Bedfore,</hi> who being a man
throughly acquainted with the humors and wars of <hi>France,</hi> by reason of
his long continuance in the one, and conversation with the other, died
the fourteenth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. his Reigne, and presently after many
French Noblemen, and worthy Souldiers who followed the said Duke,
with-drew themselves from the English Faction.</p>
            <p>The seventeenth, The Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Successors so long stay in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
occasioned by the malice of the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> that before his
coming into <hi>France, Paris,</hi> and many other good Towns of <hi>France</hi> had
yeilded unto the <hi>Dolphin.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93045:36"/>
The eighteenth, The sending over but of hundreds, yea, of scores,
where before thousands were sent, to keep Holds not comparable to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and other such like places.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth, An unprofitable marriage concluded betwixt our King,
and <hi>Margaret</hi> daughter unto <hi>Rainer</hi> king of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the
means of the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> corrupted (as it was thought) by money: for
the King had nothing with her, but delivered for her the Dutchy of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne,</hi>
the City of <hi>Mouns,</hi> and the County of <hi>Mayne;</hi> which Countries
were the very stayes of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twentieth, The Earl of <hi>Arminack</hi> (with whose Kinswoman the
King should have married) by reason of the aforesaid marriage, became the
Kings enemy, and the chief cause of the loss of the Dukedom of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one and twentieth, The Queen disdaining that the King her husband
should be ruled by the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> never left till she had brought him
to his untimely death.</p>
            <p>The two and twentieth, The Dukes death, which divers French No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
hearing of, revolted from our King; whose Realm was (as he
knew) divided within it self, because <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> allyed by his
wife unto the chief Peers of the Realm, began to contemn the King, who
was ruled by his wife, and to lay claim privily unto the Crown, whereby
mens minds were not attentive unto Forreign affairs, but wholly given to
prevent and keep off proffered wrongs at home.</p>
            <p>The three and twentieth, The King himself, who being more given to
a purchase of an heavenly, then of an Earthly Kingdom, regarded not the
matter, but suffered the Queen to be governed by ill counsel.</p>
            <p>The four and twentieth, The sudden, and as it were in a manner, the
miraculous coming of the Virgin of <hi>Orleans</hi> unto the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who wrought
him very strangely to leave those follies whereunto he was vainly given,
and to betake himself with more courage and diligence unto the violent
pursuit and following of his cause. And because as of a few sparkles som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ariseth a great fire, so of very light occasions, now and then come
wondrous effects; I will briefly declare unto you the history of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and also the means how she being a base and mean Maiden, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be sent from heaven, to work such wonders as I may say in some
manner with the <hi>Dolphin:</hi> This Maiden was a poor Shepherds daughter,
and alwaies brought up to attend and keep her Fathers Sheep, until a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of some accompt and worth, dwelling not far off, thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
by reason of a bold spirit which was seen and observed to be in
her, somwhat exceeding the common courage of women, to use her as
an instrument to bring the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who lay at <hi>Borghes,</hi> besotted with the
love of a very fair Damsel, and careless of his own estate, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Realm, from that wretchless security, unto a better trade of
of life, and a more earnest desire of the recovery of his losses: First he
made the Maiden privie to divers secret qualities of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> which he
being an ancient and continual Courtier, had observed from him in
his Infancy: Then by shewing her every day his Picture, as truly and
lively drawn as might possibly be done, he acquainted her so well with the
form and shape of his face, that she might easily know him, although he
were never so much disguised amongst a number of other Courtiers: And
thirdly, he learned her many other things far beyond the reach and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93045:36"/>
of a poor simple Maiden, and taught her both to foretel, and to do
such things as made her to be taken for a very wise woman in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
This done, he resorteth to the Court, acquainteth divers Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with his purpose and intention; and how that he, considering that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other policies and devices had failed, to make the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to be more
careful of the present lamentable estate of <hi>France,</hi> had with much labour,
travel, and study, invented a very ready way to stir him up to diligence
and care of his Realm and Country, and to enforce or perswade him to
forsake those pleasures which had not only seduced and mis-led him, but
also the most and better part of his Nobility, by whose negligence <hi>France</hi>
was already fallen into bondage, servitude, and thraldome. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
saith he, must be brought to pass, not by humane policy, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
the <hi>Dolphin</hi> (as I have found a means how to do it) that God hath
sent a Virgin as it were from heaven, to be his Guide and Leader against his
enemies, whom (as long as he should follow) he should undoubtedly be
accompanied with good and fortunate success. Having won divers friends
of his to allow of his device, and to consent to the putting of the same in
execution, he and they spread a rumour in the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s Court, of many
strange things which they said had been already done by this Virgin, which
report came in time to the <hi>Dolphin</hi>'s ears; who being (as Princes, and others
commonly are) very desirous to know the truth of this report, sent for
this Gentleman (because it was told him that he dwelt very nigh unto her)
and asked him what wonders she had wrought: He verified the common
report, and added further, That she must needs have some secret vertues
more then other men or women could commonly have, for that she had
told him divers secrets of his own, which he never told unto any man:
Which seeming somwhat strange unto the <hi>Dolphin;</hi> he (to make up the
matter) assured him, that if she were called from her Fathers poor cottage
to the Court, he would not think any thing untrue that was reported of
her; for I dare undertake (said he) that she shall tell you your own secrets,
and know you, and reverence you as King, although she never saw you
in her life, and albeit you disguise your self in the habit of the meanest
Courtier within your Court: And further, I have heard say, that she can
and will direct you a course, how you shall (within a very short time) drive
the Englishmen your enemies out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> somwhat astonished with the strangeness of this tale, and
very desirous to see the Maiden, caused her presently to be sent for, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
himself in a mean apparel, and willed one of his chief Noblemen
to be honoured, apparelled, and accompanied as King, upon whom, he
amongst the rest attended in proper person. The Maiden being brought
to Court in a strange attire made for the nonce, and apparelleld like a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and instructed in some points of Chivalry by the Gentleman before
she came thither, and especially in the fashions of the Court, and other
circumstances of the same, so demeaned her self, that it may be said of her,
<hi>Non minuit, sed auget praesentia famam;</hi> She findeth out the <hi>Dolphin</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the midst of the thickest th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ong, yeildeth him reverence due and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
shewed unto a King: Who ravished with the strangeness thereof (for
that it was certainly known that she was never in the Court, nor had at any
time seen him) talketh with her, findeth her wise in her answers, and able
to tell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st part of his secrets; and to be short, she being seconded
by the Gentleman, and others (whom he, and the pity they had of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93045:37"/>
poor estate of the Country, had made willing and ready to joyn with her
in such petitions and motions as she had made unto the <hi>Dolphin</hi>) setled such
an opinion of wisdom and holiness in him, that he presently took her for
a guide sent from heaven, to direct him in all his doings; and by her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
left his Love, and followed this maiden to the wars; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always accompanied with good Captains, and counselled by them
what directions she should give to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to the end she might win
credit with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the first sped very well in many things which she at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
and especially in raising our siege at <hi>Orleans,</hi> where I have seen
her picture in brass, mounted upon a very large brazen horse, and there is
yearly (as I have said before) a solemn Feast, and procession kept, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of her, that she drave the Englishmen from thence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> being thus animated by her, and encouraged by the good
success which followed her for a while, proceeded so manfully, that he
never left, until he had recovered all the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> So he by
her sped not ill, but she for him had no good end; for being in the end ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

witchcraft, was found guilty, and there burnt for a witch. A strange

               </gap>s. But if you consider how
many things <hi>Scipo</hi> perswaded a few Roman Souldiers to do, which were
almost impossible to be done by a few, only by telling them that he had
often and secret conference with a Goddess, who counselled him to put
those things in execution, and promised him good success in those enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises;
you may easily think that his policy might work the effect which it
wrought.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the God of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that he grew to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and reputation of a God,<note place="margin">Marco Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogo sans occino nel suo gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> by as mean a device as this; for he carryed a
shew of holiness, was better learned then their Teachers were, had the
gift of Eloquence, secretly had insinuated himself into the favour of the
people, and to perswade them that he had secret conference with God,
and that whatsoever he Preached unto them, was put into his mouth by
the Holy Ghost; he had used a tame Dove to come and stand upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Head unto his Ear, as though it did whisper something into his Ear;
Whereby he won such credit, that not only his Laws were thought to
proceed from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, but he ever sithence hath
been honoured for a God.</p>
            <p>It is written again of <hi>Kemitius</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that when he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
endeavoured by divers ways to induce his Nobility to think well
of his intended Wars against the <hi>Picts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hect. Boet.</note> and could not by any manner of
perswasions prevail with them, he invented a policy never used or heard
of before; he called his Council and Nobility together to consult of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of weight, and held them in consultation until night, then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a great and costly Supper, which of set purpose he caused to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
until the night was very far spent, insomuch that they being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with meat and drink, fell all asleep; then he commanded that
into every one of their Chambers there should go a man apparelled in a
long Gown, made of fish skins, with the scales still remaining upon them,
who carryed in one hand a staff of rotten wood, because that it (as the
scales of the fish do) in the dark, maketh a kinde of glittering able to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those who never saw the like; and in the other hand a great Oxes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93045:37"/>
horn, out of which the man speaking, should give a sound and voice far
differing from the voice of a man: These men so apparel'd, entring into the
Counsellors chambers, spake in a great and grave voice, and said, <hi>That they
were Messengers sent thither from Heaven, to tell the Scottish
Nobility, that
they ought to hearken to the advice and Counsel that</hi> Kemitius <hi>their King gave
them, and to aid and assist him to recover his Kingdom out of the hands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Picts:</hi> When they had thus said, every one of them (as he
was taught) hid his staff under his Gown, and gathering the fishes scales
together in such manner, that it seemed unto the beholders, that as the
glittering, so they suddenly vanished away. In the morning the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
met together, and every one of them telleth the King what he had seen
and heard that night; he wondred thereat, as though he had not known
thereof, telleth them he had the like vision, but thought not good to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them therewith, lest that they glorying too much in the special
favour which God shewed unto them, should by revealing the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was time, unto over many, greatly offend his heavenly Majesty;
but that he meant to shew unto them what he had heard and seen, when
the Wars were happily undertaken and ended. The Nobility confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the opinion of the Miracle by the Kings report, yeilded presently
unto his Counsel, and with all possible speed made great preparation for
the Wars against the <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now from these by-tales again to my purpose, which I might dilate
and beautify with examples, confirming every one of these 24. Causes to
be sufficient to lose a Kingdom; but your own reason and experience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to assure you thereof; and therefore I will proceed no further in this
Point; Saving that I have thought good to clear one thing, which perhaps
may seem doubtful unto you; for I think it wil seem strange unto you why
I call him by the name of <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whom the French Chronicles call <hi>Charls</hi>
the seventh; you know that our Kings eldest Son, during the life of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ever sithence that <hi>Wales,</hi> was first conquered by <hi>England,</hi> was called
the Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> And so the eldest Sons of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> have
bin called <hi>Dolphins</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> since that <hi>Imbert</hi> and <hi>Humbert</hi> dyed without
Heir, and gave <hi>Dolphiny</hi> unto <hi>Philip deValois,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hottoman. Joh. Tille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> with condition
that the eldest Son of the Kings should be called <hi>Dolphins;</hi> which name
was given unto <hi>Charls</hi> the seventh during his Fathers life,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 15.</note> when he was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and retained, after that he grew to disobedience and rebellion; yea
continued by our Writers and Chroniclers, after his decease: for me
thought it not convenient to call him King of <hi>France,</hi> because our King
was then entituled by that name; but we vouchsafed him still the name
of <hi>Dolphin,</hi> even as the Spaniards having deprived the present and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> of his Kingdom, calling him still by the name of <hi>Don
Antonio,</hi> as he was called before the Kingdom fell unto him by descent;
and the Leaguers call the now King of <hi>France,</hi> not by the name of King
of <hi>France,</hi> but King of <hi>Navarra;</hi> yea the Spaniards (as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
considering that their King enjoyeth a great part of that Kingdom,
<note place="margin">Pedro Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neio de la lyga y Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
and layeth claim to the whole, vouchsafeth him not the honour to call
him king of <hi>Navarra,</hi> but in all their Writings they call him either the
Prince of <hi>Bearn,</hi> or more plainly, the <hi>Bernois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first point whereat they wonder is, why the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (whose
Predecessors not much more then 320 years agoe, were but very poor
Earls of <hi>Hapsburg</hi> in <hi>Swizzeland,</hi> until that in the year 1273. <hi>Rodulph</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93045:38"/>
Earl of <hi>Hapsburg</hi> was chosen Emperour) is grown to be a King of more
might,<note place="margin">How the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Predecessors grew from mean Earls to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kings.</note> greater wealth, and larger Dominions, the either the Emperour,
or any other Christian Prince possesseth at this present; and how he, and
some of his Predecessors have kept and conserved the same, whereas the
Emperour hath lost most part of his possessions, and we (as it hath been
said) and many others besides us, have in a very few years departed, or
rather been driven from all that we or they got and conquered in many
years.</p>
            <p>In this point there are these parts to be considered, The increase of
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and how it came; The continuance thereof, and
whence it proceeded; The fall and decay of the Emperour, and what
was the cause thereof; Lastly ours and others losses, and how they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> increase is rare, but not marvelous; because few
Princes have been blessed with the like fortune; not marvelous, because
the causes thereof are ordinary, and not in any respect strange or wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
for that very many mean men have enjoyed the like success; for of
the Kingdomes, Dominions, and Seigniories which he now possesseth,
he came by some justly, as those which came unto him by succession and
inheritance; others valiantly, as those which his Ancestors conquered by
force of Armes; some fortunately, as those which his Predecessors got
by marriages; others most wrongfully, as those which he or they usurped
unjustly.</p>
            <p>So private men which grow unto excessive wealth, get some thereof
with cunning, as that which they attain by deceit and policy, other-some
happily, as that which cometh unto them by marriage, some painfully,
as that which they purchase by great Industry, other some wrongfully,
as that which they extort from their Neighbours by violence, injury,
wrong, or oppression. It is and hath been alwayes usual amongst Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to give their Kingdomes and chief Dominions unto their eldest Sons,
and the Appendancies unto their younger children; and those Princes who
have commonly come by Election unto higher dignity then ever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
have likewife always accustomed for the increase of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the advancement of their house and family, to bestow whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
falleth void in the time of their Government belonging unto the same,
upon their children; even as Bishops, Deans, and other Prelates of the
Church, in these dayes, grant all the Leases, Coppy-holds, Farms and
Tenements which belonging unto their Bishoppricks, Deaneries, and
Prebendaries, fall void in their time, upon their children, or their neerest
kinsmen. But betwixt Princes and Prelates there is this difference, That
Princes give with this condition, that for default of Heirs Males of their
bodies unto whom they give, their gifts should return from whence they
came; and Prelates for the most part give for term of life, or for certain
years; and yet those Prelates who besides their prelacy challenge to be
absolute Princes (of which number I read of none so absolute or liberal
in that respect as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) grant many times, not Seigniories, but Kingdomes and Principalities with the like conditions, yea and impose
a yearly fee and pension to be paid unto them and their Heirs, unto whom
they give out of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence they and their posterity
receive the same gifts:<note place="margin">Historia Pontifical. de D. Illescas Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</note> So there was a time when <hi>Benedict,</hi> the twelfth
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave unto <hi>Suchin</hi> the Viscount and Government of <hi>Millan,</hi> and of all the towns, and of all castles belonging to the jurisdiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93045:38"/>
So there was a time when the same Pope bestowed upon divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the like gifts, as upon <hi>Martin of Scala,</hi> the cities of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
upon <hi>William Gonzega, Mantua</hi> and <hi>Rezzo,</hi> upon <hi>Albertin Corazza,

of <hi>Furly</hi> and of <hi>Cesena</hi> unto <hi>Iohn Manfred Faenza,</hi> and unto <hi>Lewis Adolisti</hi>
the city of <hi>Imola:</hi> So there was a time when as Pope <hi>Urban</hi> gave
unto <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Argiers</hi> and of <hi>Provence,</hi> the kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
the Dukedomes of <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nich. Giles.</note> to hold them unto the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
who promised to pay him yearly seventy thousand Crowns for
the same Kingdom and Dukedomes. So briefly, there was a time when
as <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth giving his only Daughter in marriage unto the
Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> confirmed unto him and his Heirs the same Dukedom,
and reduced the yearly pension thereof from fourty thousand Crowns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a thousand Ducates,<note place="margin">Guicciard.</note> not in imitation, but in the self same manner as
those Popes and those Emperours used: the forementioned Emperour
<hi>Rodolph,</hi> sometimes Earl of <hi>Hapsburg,</hi> having attained the possession of the
Empire; contrary to all mens expectations, and perhaps far beyond his
own deserts, meaning to increase his own ability, and to benefit his heirs and
posterity for ever there by, bestowed the kingdom of <hi>Austria,</hi> which in his
own time for want of Heirs Males reverted unto the Empire, upon his son
<hi>Albert,</hi> to hold it for ever of the Empire; and from this <hi>Albert</hi> came all
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi>

               </gap>th, who was Emperour and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the present king of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There began his house: Now shall you see how it came to further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.
His States, some are within his native Country, and some
without the same: They within, are the Kingdoms of <hi>Castile,</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
and of <hi>Lyons,</hi> &amp;c. twelve in number; somtimes belonging unto so many
several Princes, and in process of time united and appropriated unto one.
So was <hi>France</hi> in ancient time divided into three Kingdoms;<note place="margin">Du Hailan. Nic Gyles. Froissart. Munsterus. Functius.</note> as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Mets,</hi> with the Country adjacent; of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sson,</hi> with the Territory
thereunto adjoyning; and of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Provinces thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And the Kings of these several Kingdoms bore the names of the
place where they kept their Courts: So was <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hibault</hi> king of <hi>Mets, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert</hi>
king of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Clotarius</hi> of <hi>Soissons:</hi> So in the year 514. was
added unto these three Kingdoms a fourth, namely <hi>Orleans;</hi> and every one
of those Kings was commonly called King of <hi>France;</hi> and for the better
knowledge of them, and difference between them, it was added, The
King of <hi>France</hi> holding his Mansion house or Royal Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> at
<hi>Orleans,</hi> at <hi>Soissons,</hi> or at <hi>Mets.</hi> And the Soveraignty of <hi>Basemain</hi> of these
four Kingdoms was due only unto the King of <hi>Paris,</hi> as unto the chief and
principal King, until in the year 618. all these kingdoms were united and
incorporated into one. So was <hi>England</hi> divided into many kingdoms, as
into the kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> &amp;c. So the three sons of
<hi>Brutus,</hi> as <hi>Camber, Locrinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polid. Virg. Holinshed.</note> and <hi>Albanactus</hi> divided the whole kingdom
betwixt them after their fathers death. And this division continued in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93045:39"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in the <hi>Empire,</hi> until their mortal wars, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marriages, voluntary agreement, or forceable violence, greedy ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or fatal destiny reduced them unto one Monarchy. The Union of the
twelve Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> fell out in <hi>Ferdinando</hi> his time, who being king
of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Terapha Guicciard.</note> matched with <hi>Isabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> as heir unto her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Henry,</hi> and in her right, held himself, and after his decease transferred
unto his Daughter <hi>Ioan,</hi> begotten upon her body, all the Kingdoms of
<hi>Spain;</hi> which Daughter married with <hi>Philip</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> who
begate upon her body <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, who was Emperour, and unto him
succeeded <hi>Philip</hi> which now reigneth. And thus he came by the States
within his own Country.</p>
            <p>The States without the limits of <hi>Spain,</hi> some of them are Kingdoms,
as of <hi>Naples,</hi> of <hi>Navarra,</hi> of both <hi>Sicilies,</hi> and of <hi>Portugal,</hi> together
with the many Kingdoms of both the <hi>East</hi> and the <hi>West Indies;</hi> some Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Dukedoms, as of <hi>Milan, Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and briefly of the seventeen United Provinces: How he came by all these,
it will be more tedious then wondrous to declare.</p>
            <p>The Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> have been the butchery of most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Europe;</hi> For the Popes challenging to be Soveraign Lords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">That the Kingdom of Naples hath been fatal to many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and by vertue of that Title, to have full power and authority to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

Germans, other times upon Swetians, somtimes upon Spaniards, other
times upon Hungarians, and once upon the Englishmen. So that all these

proved by these examples following.</p>
            <p>In the year 1381. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> crowned in <hi>Avignion,</hi>

<hi>Sicily,</hi> and of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the which <hi>Ioan</hi> for default of heirs, adopted
for her son and heir, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and made him king of <hi>Naples
Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cambria,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Provence.</hi> This
gift and adoption was ratified by the Pope, and furthered by the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for these respects. <hi>Clement</hi> the pope having a Corrival named <hi>Urban,</hi>
who was favoured by the king of <hi>Castile,</hi> and of <hi>Hungary,</hi> thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and necessary for him to procure the help and assistance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the
Frenchmen for the better maintenance of his cause (as divers of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
had done before him) and therefore with his gift and donation so
wrought and won unto him the said <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was then Regent of <hi>France,</hi>
that although the Kings above-mentioned had sent their Ambassadors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the French king to entreat his favour and furtherance for Pope <hi>Urban,</hi>
they could not prevail with him, because the said <hi>Lewis,</hi> who governed
the king, and all the Realm, was wholly for <hi>Clement;</hi> insomuch that
through his favour <hi>Clement</hi>'s Cardinals had all the best Benefices, and
Ecclesiastical promotions of France, without any respect being had to
their lives, to their learning, to their qualities, or to their Religion. The
Frenchmen aided the said <hi>Lewis</hi> in this quarrel, and in his Wars for the
obtaining of these Kingdoms, most willingly; because they were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to send him far from home, who wearied them at home daylie with
new Taxes, and unaccustomed grievances.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93045:39"/>
Pope <hi>Urbane,</hi> on the contrary side to gratifie his friends, and to be

so good success, as that he took the said <hi>Ioan</hi> Prisoner, and caused her
to be put to death: Here you see Frenchmen and Hungarians at mortal
Wars for this Kingdom. And before these later Contentions, you shall

far distant from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By that which hath been said you may easily perceive that the Popes
have used these Kingdoms, and their pretensive right unto them, for the
only means and instruments to furnish themselves with friends in time of
need and necessity: And when they began to be weary upon any occasion,
of the present King of <hi>Naples,</hi> they incontinently set upon another; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
their enemy, and called such a Prince as best pleased them, or the
time or the opportunity made fittest to hearken to their perswasions, and
to persecute their Adversaries, into <hi>Italy;</hi> and there continued and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
him for a time, until they likewise grew weary of him, or he could
no longer stand them in stead.</p>
            <p>This is verified by many Armies that have been especially brought out
of <hi>France,</hi> and by sundry Kings and Princes of that Country, who spent
their time, travel, and treasure, in those Wars: But there is not one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
that confirmeth the same more apparently then that which our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
report of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This King by reason he had Reigned many years, saw sundry alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in divers Kingdoms;<note place="margin">Math. Paris</note> and (as Princes who continue long are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sought unto) he was honoured of all the Kings and Potentates that
lived in his time; and many of them were glad of his am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
for as he was mighty, so was he very wise, and therefore able to
help them with his strength, and counsel them with his wisdom; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so strong, nor so wise, but that his power was abated, and his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93045:40"/>
abused by the Popes subtle policies. There was a time when <hi>Conra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
king of <hi>Sicily,</hi> began to be somewhat grievous and offensive to the
Pope, who to be revenged of his supposed wrongs, had suborned divers
Princes against him; and when all had either failed him, or faintly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in their quarrel against <hi>Conrade,</hi> he fled for his last refuge unto the
said <hi>Henry</hi> the third; and to induce him to shew his readiness and good
will to drive <hi>Conrade</hi> out of his Royal Seat and Dominion, he used divers
sinister means, and many subtle devices.</p>
            <p>First he defamed the said <hi>Conrade,</hi> accused him of Heresie, layed mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his charge, burthened him with the death and poysoning of his
own Brother, thereby making him odious to the world. Then not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it sufficient to disgrace and discredit him (for that the Princes neither
then, nor in those days did easily undertake Wars one against another in
hatred of the vices which possessed them, but in hope of the Kingdoms
which they enjoyed) he, to encourage our King the more, gave him the
Kingdoms of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and entituled his Son by the name of king
of both those Countries; And understanding that he wanted sufficient
men to imploy in that service,<note place="margin">Math. Paris</note> he dispensed him to take those Souldiers
which had enrolled themselves for the Wars of the Holy Land, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
that his Adversary for grief was dead, and forsaken by his friends;
With these devices, and his Embassadors subtleties, he induced our King
to bind himself, upon pain of loss of his Kingdom, to spend and send
140<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Marks to those Wars; and this promise was so readily performed,
and men by our King so willingly transferred for that service, that the
whole Realm in very short time felt great want, both of men, and of
money.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> have been both troublesome and
chargeable to as many Nations as I before named; And yet you see not
how they came directly unto the house of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor with what Right and
Title king <hi>Philip</hi> possesseth them at this day.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that herein as well as in other Points, you may be
fully satisfied, I will let you understand the late claims and challenges
layed and made to those Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charls</hi> the eighth,<note place="margin">Paul Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. lib. 2. Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</note> king of <hi>France,</hi> challenged the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
because <hi>Renatus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> his very near Kinsman, dying without
children, and being made Heir of the same kingdom by the last Will and
Testament of <hi>Ioan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Illescas vida de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio.</note> Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> had made and declared in his last
Will and Testament, <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh for his Heir unto the same king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which <hi>Lewis</hi> was Father unto the said <hi>Charls;</hi> who followed the
Claim with such speed and expedition, that he got the kingdom by force
of Arms, in so short a time,<note place="margin">Phil. de Comines.</note> that a notable Historiographer writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
saith, That an Embassadour would almost have spent as much time in
going thither from <hi>France,</hi> as the said <hi>Charls</hi> did imploy in conquering
thereof.</p>
            <p>The Frenchmen enjoyed not their Conquest many years; for <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 5.</note>
king of <hi>Spain</hi> began to lay claim unto the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that although <hi>Alphonsus</hi> king of <hi>Aragon</hi> had bestowed the same king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
upon <hi>Ferdinando</hi> his base Son; yet both <hi>Iohn</hi> his Brother, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
in the kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and also <hi>Ferdinando</hi> himself being Son
unto the said <hi>Iohn</hi> had just cause of claim and title ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unto; because
that <hi>Alphonso</hi> having gotten the same both with the Forces and with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93045:40"/>
the treasure of the Realm of <hi>Aragon,</hi> it should of right belong unto that
Crown.</p>
            <p>This claim of <hi>Ferdinandos</hi> was furthered by Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> the second, who
either being wearied of the insolency of the Frenchmen, or desirous to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the steps of his inconstant Predecessors, or rather willing to revenge
the wrong offered unto his Predecessor by <hi>Charls</hi> the eighth,<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 1.</note> what time he
imprisoned him in the Castle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and enforced him to give him
for his ransome or deliverance the Castles of <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> of <hi>Forracina,</hi>
and of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> to hold them until he had made full conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and also constrained him to invest himself in the said Kingdom, besought
<hi>Ferdinan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o</hi>
king of <hi>Aragon,</hi> to undertake the defence of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Illescas vida de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio 2.</note> and of
the States and Dominions thereof, against all those who persecuted the
same, and especially against <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. of <hi>France;</hi> and to make him
the more willing and ready to accomplish this his desire, he sent him the
Investure and Gift of the same kingdom, with a very small and reasonable
yearly Tribute for the same. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> thinking his Title the better by
the Popes Grant, and his possibility to prevail the greater, because of his
assured help and furtherance, prosecuted his claim by open Wars upon the
Frenchmen; wherein he had so good success, that he drew the French
King to make a friendly division of the kingdom between them. This
composition (as all agreements betwixt Princes most commonly are) was
kept inviolable, until <hi>Gonsalvo,</hi> General for the <hi>Aragonian</hi> king in those
parts (who was afterwards for his Excellency called the Great Captain, as
<hi>Pompey</hi>
was amongst the Romans) took these occasions following to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
and drive the Frenchmen out of all that they possessed within the
Realm of <hi>Naples.</hi> First he alledged that the division was not equally
made, because the <hi>Dogana</hi> of <hi>Puglia</hi> (which indeed was the best and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Revenue of that Crown) was wholly allotted unto the Frenchmen, and
neither any part thereof, nor any th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng else that might countervail the
same in worth, value, and goodness, was assigned unto the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there fell such a disease amongst the Frenchmen, by reason
of the abundance of fruit which they eat daylie,<note place="margin">Guicciard. D. Illescas vida de Clemente 7.</note> and because the waters
which they drank (as it was thought) were poisoned by the Spaniards, that
most part, as well of the private souldiers, as of the chief Captains, died
thereof and many for fear thereof departed from the French kings Camp.</p>
            <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that poor and small remainder that was lest, presuming that
this composition should be held inviolable, grew so negligent and careless,
that they suffered the Spaniards to do all that they would, and never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted
them, until it was too late.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Gonsalvo</hi> being required to desist from Wars because there was
a peace concluded betwixt the Spanish and French kings, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the French General had long before surceased all acts of hostility; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That he could not leave off his wars, because he knew not what
authority Don <hi>Philip</hi> (who was the Mediator of that Peace, and should
have had the French Kings daughter for wife to his son <hi>Charls</hi>) had from
the King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> to conclude the said Peace: And the said
King and Queen hearing of the good success which their General had daily
against the Frenchmen, permitted him to proceed as he began, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
all that was agreed, or yeil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed unto by the said <hi>Don Philippo,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had no power or authority from them to make any such agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But Don <hi>Philippo</hi> seeing his credit thereby called in question, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93045:41"/>
to all the world that he had done nothing more in the concluding the
said peace,<note place="margin">How the Spanish King came by <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </note> then the King and Queen had given him full commission to
do; and further before he departed out of <hi>Spain,</hi> he saw them both swear
upon the holy Evangelists, and upon the Image of Christ crucified, that
they would confirm, ratifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and observe, whatsoever should be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him.<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 5. 6. &amp; 9. Sleidon lib. 16.</note> Thus <hi>Naples</hi> was gotten deceitfully, although <hi>Francis</hi> the

fifth, did voluntarily renounce all his Right, Title, and Interest unto the
same kingdom for the ransom and deliverance of his two Sons, who
were Prisoners a long time in <hi>Spain,</hi> as pledges for their Father.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> I hasten to the kingdom of <hi>Navarra,</hi> gotten
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Predecessors, and held as unlawfully by him, as the two
other kingdomes;<note place="margin">How the Spanish King came by the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra.</hi>
               </note> for when as <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> so often before mentioned,
had occasion to pass with an Army through the kingdom of <hi>Navarra</hi> to
succour the Pope, he demanded safe passage of the King thereof; who
being so commanded by <hi>Lewis</hi> the French king his Soveraign, denied him
passage: <hi>Ferdinando</hi> certifying the Pope of his denial, the Pope excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
the King,<note place="margin">Guicciard.</note> and depriveth him as a Schismatique of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> hereupon having his Army in a readiness, invadeth
the kingdom, taketh the King unprovided, and before he could have any
help from the French king, depriveth him of his Royal Seat and Dignity;
and his Heirs have held the same ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ithence by no better Title then this.
Of which give me leave in a few words to tell you my simple opinion, and
then I will come to the kingdom of <hi>Portugal.</hi> As it is most certain that
the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> and of <hi>Scotland</hi> hold their kingdomes the one of the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other of the Queen of <hi>England</hi> as of their Soveraigns;
so it is undoubtedly true, that the Kings of <hi>Navarra</hi> owe homage, faith,
fealty, and obedience unto the king of <hi>France,</hi> as unto their Lord and
Soveraign, for their kingdom; in regard whereof they are bound to many
conditions of services unto him as their Soveraign, and especially to aid
and assist him in his just quarrels, wars and contentions against any other
Prince whatsoever, and never to leave him, upon pain of forfeiture of
their States and Dominions holden of him; which is so true, that many
Doctors of Law writing upon this case, make this question, whether a
Vassal (such as the king of <hi>Navarra</hi> was in respect of the French king)
leaving his Lord and Soveraign sorely hurt in the field, and forsaking him
in that case, doth forfeit his Estate or no? And they all generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that it his wounds be not mortal, and such as they leave no small
hope of life, then the Vassal for forsaking him loseth his Estate, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great. But I will not stand upon the proof of this point, nor upon
the justifying of the king of <hi>Navarra</hi> his denial made unto the <hi>Aragonian</hi>
king by Commandment of his said Lord and Soveraign; for I shall have
occasion to enlarge hereof in another place, whereunto when I come, you
shall see it sufficiently and plainly proved, that the king of <hi>Navarra</hi> could
not without manifest loss and forfeiture of his kingdom unto the French
king, deny or resist his Commandment.</p>
            <p>This then being most manifest, it must needs follow, that the king of
<hi>Aragon</hi> did most wrongfully invade and take from him his kingdom;
and so consequently the king of <hi>Spain</hi> withholdeth the same from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
king of <hi>Navarra,</hi> with no better right or reason then he that detaineth
a private mans lands, who never having any just title thereunto, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93045:41"/>
his Tenure by no other reason but by a few years wrongful possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which giveth no just title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially if the same hath been continually
claimed and demanded by the lawful owners thereof, as without all doubt
the kingdom of <hi>Navar</hi> hath been; for the present king and his Predecessors
did oftentimes require restitution thereof of them which did wrongfully
detain it; And had not the civil wars of <hi>France</hi> hindred the present king
from demanding the same by force of Arms, he had long before this time
warred upon the now king of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the recovery thereof. <hi>Now to the
Kingdom of</hi> Portugal. This kingdom as <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Navarra</hi> are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> so it is a member of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Spain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Terapha de Regibus Hisp.</note> for <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the sixth, king of <hi>Spain,</hi> had a base Daughter

very great service against the Moors: But his Son <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the first, was
the first that was named King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the first that got the City
of <hi>Lisbone</hi> from the said Moors; and having overcome in one Battel five
of their Kings, he left five Shields for Arms unto his Posterity. This
kingdom hath had many alterations, and sundry Wars, moved by such
as layed claim thereunto; but none considering the small continuance
thereof, more lamentable then the late Wars betwixt the now king of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and him whom the Spaniards call <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and no lawful
king of <hi>Portugal;</hi> for besides that the chief of the Nobility of that Realm
were either cruelly murthered in the said War, or unkindly held in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
thraledom or servitude by the Spaniard, their natural and professed
enemy; the rightful King was most wrongfully driven from his lawful
Inheritance, to live as you know, in a strange Country with the Princely,
and yet slender releif that her Majesty of her Royal liberality and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
vouchsafeth him and his poor Train.<note place="margin">Sleidens Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</note> The Spaniard for the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

the first, king of <hi>France</hi> for the Empire; brought an Army of men unto
the place where the Electors were assembled to make choice of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
pretending the cause of bringing his Army thither, to be his just
and Princely desire to free the Electors from all manner of fear, which
they might justly have of some violence to be offered them by the French
king, if they made not choice of him; Whereas in very deed his Forces
tended to no other purpose then to chuse him: But the king of <hi>Spains</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was not in all respects so cleanly, as you shall hear by the sequel: But
you must first understand how many Competetors there were for this one
Crown, and what right every one of them had thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emanuel</hi> king of <hi>Portugal</hi> married first <hi>Isabel,</hi>

by whom he had nine children; <hi>Iohn</hi> who had issue <hi>Iohn</hi> the

him, <hi>Lodowick,</hi> who was lately secretly married, and had issue this

who married a daughter of the Earl of <hi>Marialva,</hi> by whom he
had two Sons, who dyed before their Father. The fourth was <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
who was made Cardinal, and departed the world not having any child.
The fifth was <hi>Henry,</hi> who was likewise a Cardinal, and king after Don
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93045:42"/>
               <hi>Sebastian,</hi> and died also without issue. The sixth was <hi>Edward,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Theodosia</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Burgantia,</hi> by whom he had three children, that
is to say, <hi>Mary,</hi> who married <hi>Alexander,</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma, Katharine,</hi> who
took to husband the Duke of <hi>Burgantia,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> who died unmarried.
The seventh was <hi>Anthony,</hi> who died in his infancy. The eighth childe
was <hi>Isabel,</hi> who was married to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, and had issue by
him the present king of <hi>Spain.</hi> The last was <hi>Beatrice,</hi> wife to the Duke
of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were the issue, now follow the Competitors; they were five.
Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> lawful son, (as he proved) unto <hi>Lodowick</hi> the second heir
male of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> as Tutor unto his son, begotten
upon the eldest daughter of <hi>Edward,</hi> the sixth heir male. The Duke of
<hi>Bergantia,</hi> begotten on the body of <hi>Katharine,</hi> the second daughter of the
said <hi>Edward.</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> begotten of the body of <hi>Isabel,</hi> eldest daughter
unto <hi>Emanuel.</hi> And the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the lawful heir of the youngest
daughter of the said <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of all these competitors, to deliver you first my opinion, I take
it (alwaies <hi>salvo meliori judicio</hi>) that none of them all could lawfully claim
the Crown of <hi>Portugal:</hi> For as many as hold the marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth king of <hi>England,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> unlawful, because she
was married unto his eldest brother <hi>Arthur,</hi> must needs hold the marriage
of <hi>Emanuel</hi> king of <hi>Portugal</hi> far more unlawful, because both king <hi>Henry</hi>
and he married unlawfully: For if two brethren cannot successively mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one woman, truly two sisters cannot be married unto one man: And
the reason which some use to justifie king <hi>Henry</hi> his marriage, cannot serve
for the justification of king <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s matrimony; for all that was said in
the defence of the Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> was, that her husband never knew her
carnally; which cannot be truly said for king <hi>Emanuel,</hi> because he had a
son by his first wife: wherefore if all these nine children being begotten in
unlawful wedlock cannot possibly be reputed legitimate, and therefore are
not lawful heirs to their reputed fathers, much less can any of they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from any of these nine children be esteemed lawful heirs to the
Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But grant them to be lawful, and then to each of
their Titles in order. Don <hi>Antonio</hi> hath sufficiently justified his Title in
his Apologie, by many reasons, which I reduce to these three principally.</p>
            <p>First he proveth his Fathers marriage, though it were with his far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
to be lawful, notwithstanding the disparagement, in regard of which
it was concealed. Then he fortifieth his Title by the custome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who by ancient priviledge challenge a right, in case of
controversie for the Crown, to make choice of such an one of the compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
as they shall have a special liking and love unto. Lastly, he either
sheweth, or might shew, that Bastards have succeeded in the Kingdom of
<hi>Portugal;</hi> and that therefore although Bastardy had been fully proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, yet being chosen by the common consent of the people, it was
no sufficient bar, or lawful exception, to say that he was a Bastard, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being made by such an one as came from a Bastard himself, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his own Kingdom by right derived from a Bastard, as doth the present
king of <hi>Spain:</hi> For the Chronicles of <hi>Spain</hi> report, that <hi>Henry</hi> bastard
brother unto <hi>Peter</hi> king of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Froissart vol. pr. c. 252.</note> taking advantage of the evil opinion
which was conceived of his brother, (by reason of his loose and dissolute
life) by the help of the French King, notwithstanding that <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93045:42"/>
third aided the said <hi>Peter,</hi> and once restored him to his Crown, drave him
the second time from the same;<note place="margin">Du Haillan. lib. 6. Froissart vol. 3. c. 25.</note> and having slain him in the Field, usurped
his Royal dignity, and transferred it unto his heirs, of which king <hi>Philip</hi>
is lineally descended: For there was a time when as <hi>Iohn</hi> Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi>
and son to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> challenged the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> because
he had married <hi>Beatrice</hi> the only daughter and heir of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> late king
of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but the people would not accept him for their king, because
they naturally hated the Castilians, and therefore they chose a bastard for
their king, named <hi>Denis,</hi> saying; That it was as lawful for them to chuse
the said bastard for their king, as it was for the Castilians to admit <hi>Henry</hi>
the bastard for their king, who had (as is above said) deprived most unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and unnaturally the lawful king of his life and Scepter. Now from
Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> unto the rest in general, who because they all claim by right
of their mothers,<note place="margin">D. Anton. his Apol.</note> are all excluded by an inviolable law of <hi>Portugal,</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the aforesaid <hi>Iohn</hi> Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi> in the behalf of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
bastard <hi>Denis,</hi> whereby it is provided, That no woman shall
enjoy the Crown of <hi>Portugal:</hi> For whereas there is a Law that no woman
shall succeed; the same Law (as it appeareth by the Law <hi>Salique</hi> alledged
against us in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third) excludeth also the males
descending from the woman. And so these four Competitors claim is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
void, and of none effect. And in case where women may succeed,
the Females descending from an heir male, are to be preferred before such
as come only and directly from the female: And so the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Bergantia</hi> descending from the daughters of Prince <hi>Edw.</hi>
and they in law succeeding their Father, as the same person and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
heirs, are not only to be preferred before the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who came of the daughters of the before-named
<hi>Emanuel,</hi> but also before their Aunts, the said King <hi>Philips,</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi>'s mothers, because in matter of Succession, the elder brothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are always preferred before the Uncles or Aunts. Those Titles, and
the means how the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> prevailed before the rest of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors,
are largely set down in Don <hi>Antonio</hi>'s Apologie, unto which I
refer you, Although there be (at the least) twenty points therein of no
small moment, which (in my opinion) are not sufficiently cleared, nor
substantially handled, yet therein you shall easily perceive how king <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
in getting the same kingdom,<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish King's right to the Indies.</note> imitated (as I said before) his father. I
must likewise refer you to the history of <hi>Hernan Logeres,</hi> touching the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and conquest of the <hi>Indies;</hi> for it were too long for me to tell you
what small forces went thither out of <hi>Spain</hi> first; and how the Leaders of
those slender Armies taking advantage of the divisions which they found
betwixt the kings of those Countries, did easily overthrow some with the
help of the other. There you shall see how a number of naked men fly
like sheep before a few armed souldiers; there you shall read, that even
amongst those barbarous people and princes, there wanted neither deceit
nor policy; there you shall find, that the Spaniards being far from their
Country, and not many, amongst an infinite number of mortal enemies,
strived and contended amongst themselves for superiority, which argueth
an unsatiable desire of rule and government, and their natural proneness
to mutiny; although they challenge an especial praise above all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for their obedience to their Superiours: there you shall see the fruits
of division, the effects of tyrannie, the force of terror and fear, and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93045:43"/>
vertue of good and expert souldiers fighting against rude and ignorant
multitudes: there you shall observe, in some of these unchristian Princes,
more loyalty, friendship, constancy, and perseverance in their honest and
lawful enterprises, then hath lately been found in many Christian Princes:
there (briefly) you shall find enough to satisfie you, how the Spaniards
came to the possession of the <hi>Indies;</hi> if withal it may please you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth being a Spaniard, and chosen Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator
betwixt the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> at what time they were at
variance for and touching the division of the <hi>Indies;</hi> the said Pope shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself too too partial unto the Spaniard, and gave him much more
then the Portugal thought that in reason and conscience should have been
allotted unto him.</p>
            <p>Now from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the aforementioned Kingdoms, unto the
Earldoms and Dukedoms; And first to the Dutchy of <hi>Millan;</hi> a State
which hath suffered many alterations, of which I may not speak without
digressing too much from my purpose; and because I hasten unto many
other points, whereof I intend by Gods grace to discourse at large, I may
not be over-long in this point.</p>
            <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> was anciently a member of the Empire,<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Kings title to the Dukedom of <hi>Millan.</hi>
               </note> and
none was held lawful Lord or Duke thereof, which had not received his
investure and approbation from the Emperour. It would be both long
and tedious to relate unto you the many competencies for this Dukedom,
the sundry Pretendants thereunto, and the mighty Partakers of these
competitors; whereof leaving ancient quarrels aside, and not troubling
you with the Titles of the Viscounts, with the pretentions of the <hi>Sforzas,</hi>
nor with the claims of the Predecessors of <hi>Francis</hi> the first king of <hi>France,</hi>
and of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour;<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 14.</note> I will only tell you that the former
challenged the same Dukedom in right of the Lady <hi>Valentine,</hi> wife unto
the Duke of <hi>Orleance;</hi> and the later pretend right thereunto, because the
contract of Marriage betwixt <hi>Valentine</hi> and the said Duke was not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Authority of the Emperour, because the Emperour had never
granted unto the before-named Duke the Investure of the said Dukedom:
These reasons indeed are sufficient in Law to deprive a Vassal of his Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory,
if by voluntary negligence, or wilful obstinacy, he refuse to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
or to demand the Investure of his hold and Tenure of the Lord and
Sovereign. But there are many occasions which may excuse this demand,
upon which I shall not need to stand, because they are not pertinent to
this purpose, which is only to shew you whether the Spanish King came
rightly or unrightly unto the Dukedom of <hi>Millan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which difficulty may be cleared in this manner: Let the Spaniard
shew that his Fathers Allegation was lawful, then shall it follow that his
War for the same, with the French King, was also most lawful; And so
consequently his getting the same by force of Arms likewise lawful: Let
him shew that it was gotten with the Forces and Expences of the Empire;
then it shall follow that it belonged unto the Empire: Let him shew that
his Father, having purchased his Dukedom in right of the Empire, and at
the costs, and with the help of the Souldiers and Captains thereof, had full
Authority to alienate the same, and to bestow it upon him his lawful Son,
and that he so did; then shall it follow that he is true owner thereof: But I
fear me it will be very hard and difficult for him to shew all these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and therefore I dare not deliver it for any sound opinion, that he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93045:43"/>
hath right thereunto, unless he shall plead the Renunciation, and Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
made thereof by the said <hi>Francis,</hi>

(who was unfortunately slain by the <hi>Switzers</hi>) was Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
of <hi>Holland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and Lord of all the united Provinces; by
reason whereof, and of those laudible qualities which he possessed, he
thought himself inferiour to no Prince living in his time, and never had
been overthrown as he was, had he not dwelt too much in his opinion,
had he not presumed too much of his own strength, had he not thought
too basely of his enemies, and had he not made so sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght account as he did
of the French Kings subtle and secret practises against him; which indeed
were so politique,<note place="margin">De Com.</note> so wise, and so secret, that a French Historiographer
writeth, That the French King still sitting in his Chair at home, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the Duke to follow his own
humours, and suborning and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him daily new Adversaries, did him far more much harm, then they
who did openly and directly bear Arms against him.</p>
            <p>This Duke being slain (as is above-said) in an unfortunate time for the
house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and for a very small occasion (for the Wars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was slain were but for a Cart loaden with sheep-skins) left issue but
one Daughter, whom <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour married, and had by
her issue <hi>Philip</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> who begat <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour,
and <hi>Charls</hi> (as it hath often been said) this present King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides
<hi>Francis</hi> the first (who before that time was (as all his predecessors before
him had been) Soveragin of all those Estates and Countries) did as well
at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> whilst he was Prisoner there for his own Ransome;
as at <hi>Cambray,</hi> after he was set at liberty; for the deliverance of his two
Children, renounce all his Rights and Interests to the Soveraignty of all
these Countries. Thus came the Spaniard by all that he hath.</p>
            <p>Now shall you see how he hath hitherto conserved all this his own pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,<note place="margin">How the Spanish King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all those States which he now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth.</note>
notwithstanding the reasonable pretences which many either do
or may make to divers of his Dominions.</p>
            <p>First, as amongst private men, whosoever attaineth unto great wealth,
is reverenced amongst his neighbours, honoured by his friends, feared
by his adversaries, and so sought unto by all men, that many indeavour
to please him, few or none dare to contend with him; even so amongst
Princes, he that exceedeth the rest in might, in wealth, in reputation, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
such credit with the rest, beareth such sway wheresoever he cometh,
winneth such favour in all that he attempteth, and striketh such terrour in
the hearts of them who have occasion to quarrel with him, that they had
rather sit down losers, then rise up in Arms against him; they suspect
his secret attempts, stand in awe of his exceeding power, doubt the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
projects of his ambitious mind, and are presently terrified when they
enter into consideration of his strength, of his treasure, of his friends and
confederates; provoke him think they, and you heap burning coles upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93045:44"/>
your own heads; anger him, and you awake a shrewd sleeping Dog;
offend him, and you displease his friends; contend with him, and you
strive against the stream; and therefore they hold it for extream folly to
incur his displeasure, and for singular wisdom to continue in his favour.
When the Romans were in the highest degree of their prosperity; What
Prince was so mighty that feared not their power? What Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
so rich that stood not in fear and awe of their huge Armies? What
commanded they that was not obeyed? Or whither went they, where
they were not received? Was there any Nation so far from them which
heard not of their might and magnificence?<note place="margin">Titus Liv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Corn. Tac. Polibius.</note> Was there any Region (were
it never so remote) that heard not of their strength and puissance; that
trembled not at the very name and mention thereof? Came not Kings
voluntarily to <hi>Rome</hi> from the furthest confines of the world to seek their
friendship? Sent not the Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Monarchs of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and
all the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> their Embassadours, to crave their Favour and
Alliance? What Prince presumed so much of his own force, that if he
were wise, held himself not greatly honoured if he were so happy as to be
one of the number of their Alliance? and if he were unwise, or over-hardy
and bold, that found not himself deceived, yea utterly overthrown, if
at any time he presumed to contend with them? Lived not <hi>Carthage</hi> in
wealth and honour until she took stomach and heart at grass against <hi>Rome?</hi>
Mighty <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> wise <hi>Mithridates,</hi> deceitful <hi>Hannibal,</hi> puissant <hi>Massinissa,</hi>
with a number of others of like renown, ruled they not in peace, and
Raigned in security, until they began to conjure and combine themselves
against the Romans? And then failed not their power? perished not their
Authority? decayed not their Reputation? and went not all they had
to wrack and ruin? It is therefore undoubtedly true, that this prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
opinion of the Spanish Kings Might and Power, hath been one espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
means to preserve and keep his many Dominions; for although his
might is in many degrees inferiour to the Romans Power; yet as they,
because they possessed most part of the world, were redoubted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced
of all Nations in the world; so he possessing more then any
Prince of Christendom, must needs be had in honour and reverence
through the greatest part of Christendom.</p>
            <p>Besides, as they, in all places of Conquest had their power and forces
to hold them in continual awe and obedience; As in <hi>Germany</hi> eight Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,<note place="margin">Appianus. Alexand.</note> every Legion consisting of 6100. Souldiers, and 726. Horse-men;
In <hi>Spain</hi> three Legions; In <hi>Affrica</hi> two; In <hi>Seruia</hi> and <hi>Bulgaria</hi> two
more; and in <hi>Salaminia</hi> other two; and about <hi>Rome</hi> in the Cities of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
twelve sundry Bands, whereof every one of nine of them, consisted of
1105. Foot-men, and 66. on Horseback; So that they had always in

Foot-men, and unto 19734. Horse-men at the least, besides the help and
succour of their friends and Confederates; And these Forces they kept
as well in the time of peace as war, for the more safety and security of their
Estates and Dominions: In the like manner the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
men always in pay in the Dutchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
in the Country of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in the Low-Countries, in the Realm
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in other places of his Dominions, for the better secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y
of the same; and those Men lye in continual Garrison, as well when he
hath Peace as when he is at Wars. Moreover, as the Romans destroyed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93045:44"/>
the Cities of <hi>Alba,</hi> of <hi>Numantia,</hi> and of <hi>Carthage,</hi> because as long as
they stood, they were always rebelling against them; So the Catholique
King hath either forceably subverted, or voluntarily impoverished many
Cities within his several Dominions, only to disable them to make head
against him: And this pollicy of impoverishing Rebellious Cities, and
their richest Inhabitants, is too too general and usual in <hi>Italy;</hi> where it is
held a point of wisdom, and a strengthening, or rather a sure way to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and continue their Estate, to hold down and depress their most noble
and wealthy Subjects, for fear that le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> as the <hi>Romans</hi> never entred into League or Amity with any
Prince or Nation who did not wholly submit himself, and it self unto
their discretion; So the <hi>Spaniard</hi> never receiveth any King or Potentate
for his Ally and Confederate, unless he can and will be content to be
wholly at his devotion. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book of the lives of the noble
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. in the life of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi>
               </note> writeth that <hi>Eumenes</hi> understanding that divers Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapes
sought all occasions and means to kill him, to stop and prevent
their malice against him, feigned that he had great need of a great sum of
money, which he borrowed of them which hated him most, to the end
that they might give over the seeking of his death, whereby they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
to lose all their money: In like sort, both the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
his Father before him, doubting that <hi>Genoa,</hi> a very rich, mighty, and
populous city in <hi>Italy,</hi> might be either induced by the perswasion of other
Princes in <hi>Italy</hi> (who desire nothing more then to see a King of <hi>Naples</hi>
and a Duke of <hi>Millan</hi> born within <hi>Italy</hi> it self as there was wont to be)
or by the counsel of such Citizens as were wont to favour the French facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to fall from him to the French, and especially for the great Traffique
which they have at <hi>Lyons, Paris,</hi> and other places of <hi>France</hi> (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
respect hath moved the <hi>Florentines</hi> to be far more friendly and better
affected unto the French King then unto him) did and doth borrow as
much money as he could or can possibly get into his hands, of the best
and richest Gentlemen and Merchants of that city; to the end that fear of
losing their money may always retain them in love and friendship towards
him.</p>
            <p>It is written by the said Author,<note place="margin">Plut. in the life of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus.</note> that <hi>Theseus,</hi> to people and augment
the city of <hi>Athens,</hi> invited as many as would to come and dwell there,
promising and assuring them to enjoy the self-same Liberties, Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and Immunities, which the very Citizens themselves had. In like
manner the Spaniard to enrich his city of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other cities of the
Low Countries, by the Access and Traffique of our Nation with them,
and to draw us thither for that purpose more willingly, freed us from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Imposts,<note place="margin">Idem in the life of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus.</note> which his own natural Subjects usually paid. Again the
same Author reporteth, that <hi>Romulus</hi> after he had builded <hi>Rome,</hi> and
subdued the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and taken their City, he commanded them to throw
down their own houses, and to go to dwell with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they
should have the same Liberties and Priviledges, which his own Citizens
had. And there was nothing that more increased <hi>Rome,</hi> then this joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and incorporating with her own Inhabitants those which she conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
In imitation hereof, the Spaniard when he had subdued the <hi>Indies,</hi>
transported as many <hi>Spaniards</hi> as he could possibly thither, giving them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93045:45"/>
great priviledges after they had inhabited there certain years: And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mens opinions, there is nothing that doth more retain that barbarous
people in obedience unto him, then the fear of those natural Spaniards,
nor any thing that more inricheth his natural Subjects; we go thither ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
poor, and return thence infinitely rich: And in my simple conceit, the
sending of those Colonies (as I may call them) into the <hi>Indies,</hi> is the
best and surest means that the Spaniard doth and can use for the peaceable
maintenance of those Estates: For albeit they tyrannize there far beyond
the nature of humane creatures, as well in respect of them that inflict, as
of those which endure afflictions and torments in those countries, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as our Chronicles do testifie) that (as <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour
did after he had conquered our Nation) he hath deprived the Inhabitants
of all sorts of Weapons,<note place="margin">Holinshed. Polid. Virg.</note> whereby they are made unable to undertake any
hostile attempt, he liveth and ruleth in peace amongst them, and his few
number of <hi>Spaniards</hi> are held invincible, or such as may easily withstand
and prevent their secret conspiracies.</p>
            <p>Besides, those whom he placeth as Governours, or men of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongst them, do cunningly get into their hands the chief wealth
of the Country, whereby the inhabitants are greatly impoverished, and
they enabled when they return, to do better service unto their Prince and
Country. In consideration whereof, many desire their places as soon as
(or before) they become void; and some take the wealth purchased there,
for a sufficient recompence of their many and several services done at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times, and in other places. But it may be said, that the Spaniards
cruelty might long before this time have given occasion to the <hi>Indians</hi> to
rebel: True, if they had weapons and arms wherewith to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and offend their enemies: why necessity enforceth the old wife to
trot, and putteth divers inventions into the heads of malicious and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men, to find out fit Instruments for the accomplishment and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their desires. Certainly, and past all doubt, put a few expert
souldiers, and well defended Castles bid a number of uncunning and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
armed men. Multitudes most commonly prevail against a few,
and sudden rebellions are dangerous and terrible: No man can deny this
to be a manifest truth; but multitudes without an head seldom do any thing
worthy their labour, or answerable to their desires, hazards, and perils:
and where there is no order, no guide, no governour, there seldome or
never followeth good success. The Romans after they had conquered
<hi>Capua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </note> willingly yeilded that the Town should be still inhabited, haunted,
and frequented by all sorts of people, as it was before accustomed, but
they would not in any wise permit or agree that there should be any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
any form of Government, any Guide, any kinde of Magistrates,
any common Council, as there was wont to be; because where these things
are wanting, there it is impossible for any innovation, conspiracy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to have good and fortunate success.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard therefore ruling in the <hi>Indies</hi> by his own Nation, they
being stronger then the natural inhabitants; and the people of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
either for ignorance not being able, or for want of authority, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sufficient power to govern as they would, it is easie for him to rule as
he list, and very difficult for them to change, alter, or subvert the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Government, although it be hateful, prejudicial, odious, and
hurtful unto them. But albeit that this kind of administration and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93045:45"/>
may for a small time work the like effect which a far milder sort of
rule and commandment most commonly worketh; yet common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the ready disposition of the <hi>Indians</hi> to revolt from the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
when as Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> was lately amongst them, declare, that
they would willingly, if they could securely, be content to shake off the
yoke of the Spanish Government. In like manner, although <hi>Naples</hi> and
<hi>Milan</hi> live obediently under his regiment, and factions are not in this age
as rife there as in ancient times they were wont to be; yet the people of
both places being far more willing to be governed by their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
then by meer strangers, the exactions in both States exceeding by very
much the old and ancient tributes, imposts, and contributions, by what
name soever it shall please you to call them; and the Spaniards sparing
them no more then they do the poor and simple Indians: It is to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that if there were a <hi>Brutus</hi> amongst them, who would vouchsafe to
undertake the restoring of his Country and Countrymen unto their former
and ancient liberty, he should not fail or quail in his enterprise, for want of
a competent and sufficient number of friends and followers: For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
hatred conceived against the Spaniards, the general dislike of their
Tyranical Government, the common desire of the inhabitants uttered in
Table-talk, in secret conferences, in open assemblies, in private houses,
and in all places where they may boldly speak without danger, argue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
that they lack ability, and not good will to rebel. But he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
such Governours in both places, as are not only true and faithful unto
him, but also so discreet and wise, that they both foresee and prevent all
occasions of rebellion. These Governours have their eyes alwaies open
and watching, not only over the Subjects committed to their charge, in
holding them low, and in continual fear of severe punishment for every
small offence, but also over the Princes which confine with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in keeping them from all opportunities of invading their States.
These Governours are assisted by grave and wise Counsel, by whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they are directed in matters of great weight. These Governours are
accompanied by many under-officers, who are employed in gathering such
intolerable taxes as are layed upon the common people; upon which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
the fault is layed, if any offence be taken against the extremity of the
taxes; and somtimes the Governour upon complaint made unto him (if
no excuse can pacifie the complainants) mitigateth the rigour of the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
or sendeth them unto his and their king for relief and remedy; who
if he shall see no other way to content them, or to continue and contain them
within the bounds of their wonted obedience, yeildeth somwhat to their
petition; and so laying the blame either upon the necessity of the time, or
the extremity of his expences, or the severity of their officers, dischargeth
himself of the fault which was imputed unto him, and sendeth the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
away in some measure well pleased and satisfied. But I shall have
occasion to handle this point more largely in another place, when I shall
speak of such exactions as were levied in particular estates in this our age.
And therefore reserving the residue of that which I have to say for that
place, I will proceed in declaring unto you other means which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
useth for preservation of his Estates in peace, in quietness, and in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
obedience.</p>
            <p>It is written that his Father <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, fearing that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Duke
of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and the only remainder of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> late King of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:93045:46"/>
might in time find some friends to help him or his issue (if he should so
marry that he might have any) to the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
married him unto <hi>Germana,</hi> widow unto the said <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> but barren,
and past children; reaping of this marriage two benefits, and both of great
weight and consequence: For whereas the said Duke, by refusing the
Crown when it was offered him by the people,<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 15.</note> and by perswading them
to accept and receive the same <hi>Charls</hi> for their King, had made the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
somwhat beholden unto him, he did not only seem in some measure
to recompence that good turn, by honouring him with the marriage of a
Queen, but also he assured that Kingdom unto himself and his heirs, by
bestowing a barren wife upon him who was rightful heir thereunto, and by
that marriage was utterly disabled to have any lawful Issue.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard not by mariage, but by employment of the late Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> in such wars as were somwhat pleasing and answerable to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
kept him alwaies so busied, that he could never attend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which of right belonged unto his Son, rather then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> And as the Emperour rather deprived the above-named
<hi>Ferdinando,</hi> by giving him a barren wife, of all possibility to have
any lawful issue, and so consequently of all earnest desire to recover that
Kingdom, which should end in himself for want of a childe to whom it
might descend; So the Spanish King deprived the said Dukes son of all
hope to recover his right in <hi>Portugal,</hi> by procuring and counselling him to
match in such a Family, as never can be able to yeild him any competent
aid for the recovery of his said right.</p>
            <p>Again it is written of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, and also of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth,
Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polid. Virg. Hect. Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t. Holinshed.</note> that they both fearing lest that <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi>
who lived in exile with the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> by whom he was only sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and succoured, might in process of time find some Friends at home,
or purchase the favour of some Forraign Prince abroad, to help him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whereunto he always laid claim, did seek
all means possible to have the said Earl delivered unto them by the Duke,
but they could never prevail, and therefore never lived secure or assured
of their Estate: And <hi>Richard</hi> the third, according as he doubted, was
deprived of his Royal Dignity by the said Earl: In like manner the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
hath sought all ways possible to have <hi>Don Antonio</hi> delivered unto
him, and hath made him divers great and fair offers of great livings and
dignities if he would return into his Country, and acknowledging him
for King, live under his obedience, but he could never prevail; and God
knoweth to what end it hath pleased the Almighty to preserve and reserve
the said Don <hi>Antonio</hi> from many great, and almost inevitable dangers and
hazards of his life: He is not now so low, so poor, so bare, so destitute
of all friends, so void of all hope, but that <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> was in
all degrees and measure of need and poverty equal unto him. It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
rule in policy, that no Usurper hath any firm hold or strong assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Estate, as long as any pretending right thereunto liveth; but
the Spaniard hath sufficiently foreseen and provided for any manner of
harm or detriment that may arise unto him, or unto any of his, by <hi>Don
Antonio,</hi> or by his children: For as the loss of the Battel at <hi>Canna,</hi> defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Victories, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might have had against the Romans, and
his abode at <hi>Capua</hi> (where his Souldiers learned to be eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>minate, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to be right Souldiers) took away all hope to subdue the Romans
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93045:46"/>
so the overthrow received by <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Antonio,</hi> within his own Kingdom,
when he was possessed thereof, made it very difficult for him to re-gain
or recover the same; And the late repulse taken at <hi>Lisbona,</hi> when he was
before the Town with the small and weak Forces of <hi>England,</hi> hath put
him out of all hope to attain his purpose: And yet it is held for a sure and
most sound opinion by many martial men, that not with much great
strength then he had then from hence, it would be an easie enterprise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that Kingdom; which opinion I list not to controll (for that men of
my profession may not conveniently contend with Souldiers, especially in
matters concerning martial affairs) And yet I fear me, that if any second
enterprise should be attempted against <hi>Portugal,</hi> with an English Army
of greater strength, of better provision, of sounder bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and of more
convenient furniture then the last was; the Commanders of such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
should be subject to no less inconveniencies then the other was; and
so long as those incommodities are found in an Army, so long the like
success (as hapned unto the first) will follow the latter.</p>
            <p>You seldom hear or have read of any Army that went far from home,
that hath not been subject unto many casualties, unto many accidents, and
unto unexpected success and fortune; They are to day Conquerors, and
to morrow conquered; this day strong, to morrow weak; sometimes
in health and prosperity, upon a very sudden in sickness and penury: Their
Triumphs are Messengers of evil fortune; their Victories forerunners of
overthrows; their abundance, tokens of Penury; and their conceived
hope, an infallible Prognostication of future calamity. Was there ever
a wiser Captain then <hi>Hanniball?</hi> Was there ever any Army compounded
of so many and diverse Nations? Was there any Souldiers that were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
governed? or any Governor that was more carefull of his Company?
more politique to win and purchase unto himself the favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of such people with whom he had any manner of commerce or socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or of whom he stood in any kind of need? And yet what success had
his Providence, his Prudence, his Policy? Decayed not his strength dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
his Souldiers, became they not effeminate? his fortune, did it not
forsake him? his faithful friends, did they not leave him? the Towns he got,
did they not revolt from him? And briefly, lost he not in a very short space,
all that he got in many years? And yet since <hi>Hannibal</hi> his time, there was
never any Captain, General, Colonel, or Leader of any Army (call him by
what name or Title you list) that in my simple conceit might compare with
<hi>Hannibal;</hi> either for the governing of his Souldiers, or for temporizing
with his Adversaries, for preventing mischeifs, or for inventing new Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems;
for putting in execution, with good success and marvelous fortune,
of all his attempts and enterprises; or briefly for furnishing his Camp
with all things necessary, or keeping his Souldiers in awe and obedience;
But <hi>Hannibal</hi> contended with the mightiest Adversary of the world: <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
had secret enemies at home, who were content to suffer him and his
to live in want and penury abroad; <hi>Hannibal</hi> pretermitted many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of good fortune, which being taken in time, might have made him a
most happy Conqueror: <hi>Hannibal</hi> suffered his Souldiers to dote in love,
when it was no time to dally in Lechery; Briefly, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnibal</hi> would not
win when he might have won; And therefore it was reason that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
should lose when he would not have lost.</p>
            <p>In later times <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s follies have made wise men; <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s evil
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93045:47"/>
fortune, hath taught others to beware of the like Fortune; <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
losses have given his posterity occasion to take heed by his examples, lest
following his steps, they chance to fall into his miseries. Now Princes
measure their strength by their adversaries power; they rate their charges
by the distance of places into which they are to convey their Armies; they
furnish their company according to the time for which they purpose to use
the same; they cast their accompts before they enter into wars; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the casualties which are accustomed to follow wars; they note the
dispositions and affections of their neighbours; they mark and observe the
provision of their enemies; they provide for longer time then they intend
to spend in wars; they have their carriage to attend upon their Armies,
their victuallers to follow them, their confederates to supply their wants,
their Messengers to bring them word of their necessities, and their Officers
both at home and abroad to make provision as soon as any thing is found
to be defective or wanting in their Armies: So if they go far from home,
they seem always to be at home; if they want, their wants are presently
supplied; if they chance to decrease, their number is immediately increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and although they may happen to languish, yet they are never suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to perish: True it is, that other mens harmes have made men both in
these dayes, and in former times, to be wise and wary: And the Prince
is reputed to want the discretion and wisdom requisite in a Prince. who
undertaketh wars without due consideration of all the circumstances above
mentioned; and yet neither <hi>Hannibals</hi> ill fortune, nor his example, nor
common experience, nor fear of inevitable accidents can make men so
wary as it behoveth them to be, but in later times they have been and will
be subject unto the self same Inconveniences which men in former times
endured. Have Armies in times past, going far from home, perished in
their journies by reason of the intemperature of the air, the heat of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the intemperance of the Souldiers, who seed too much of noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
and hurtful fruits, or drank too much of hot Wines in hot seasons,
and in hot countries; as did the Army which <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> led from
<hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Parthia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Appianus. Alexand.</note> whereof better then 20000 Foot-men, and 4000 Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
perished by such casualties before he came to his Journies end? And
do not, or have not some miscarried by the same means in our dayes,
or within our memories? Have many Christian Armies led out of
Christendom into <hi>Turky,</hi> not lost the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Army that ever the <hi>Romans</hi> sent by Sea against the <hi>Carthiginians</hi> perish in
the Sea;<note place="margin">Tit. Livius.</note> and almost so dismayed the Souldiers, that they were utterly
discouraged to commit any more men or ships to the unmerciful Tempests
of the raging Seas? And did not the like befal unto the Navy that <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth sent in his time unto <hi>Algire,</hi> whose lamentable overthrow is piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

and can it seem strange or marvelous,<note place="margin">Vida de Paulo 3. de D. Illescas.</note> that <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth's Army,
brought out of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Marselles,</hi> and passing by the most barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
countries of <hi>France,</hi> felt the like calamities? Plagues, Pestilence,
Famine, Tediousness of the way, Want of water, Tempests by Sea, and
sudden Sickness have always, and will continually lessen the number,
weaken the Forces, and not spare the mighty multitudes that have been or
shall be sent far from home by any Prince whatsoever. There is no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
can prevent it, no wisdom that can foresee it, no fore-sight that can
withstand it; they be Scourges which it pleaseth the Almighty to send,
and therefore it behoveth him that hath urgent occasion to send an Army
into forraign countries, to think well thereon, to consider all casualties,
and to provide for them long before they happen, lest that want of fore-sight
cause his utter discredit and destruction. The only means is, to
send such a number as is neither too great to be conveniently maintained,
nor too little to effect and accomplish his purpose; especially if things be
so ordered, that as soon as occasion shall be ministred, fresh supplies may
be conveyed over in due time, and by competent and sufficient numbers.
For if the supplies be defective in number, or not transported in seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time, they are sent (as experience teacheth) but as Sheep to the
shambles. But from these matters (which are touched but by the way
of digression) back again to the Spanish King, and to the narration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reasons, why possessing many Kingdomes, he enjoyeth them all
peaceably, or with so little distrurbance as he doth. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
whereof, you are to consider the State and condition of such
Princes who have any Lands or Territories confining or bordering upon
his Dominions; and in them you are to mark and observe what power
they have to annoy him if they would, or what will if they could. The
Princes with whom by reason of such Neighbourhood he hath any way to
deal, are these.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turk,</hi> the princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
King, and the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> Of which some could be content to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
him by all means possible, but they want ability answerable to their
good will; others have might enough to prejudice him divers ways, but
he carrieth so watchful an eye over them, is so jealous of their greatness,
so well acquainted with their counsels, determinations and purposes, that
all their intents, indeavours, and enterprises against him, are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
so soon prevented by his careful providence, as they are intended
through their malice and indignation. But it is not sufficient to declare
thus much in general terms; you shall see his particular proceeding with
every one of these Princes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> he knoweth to be a Prince greatly to be feared of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as well in regard of his great power,<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Kings opinion &amp; proceeding with the Turk.</note> as in respect of his subtile poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
His power is terrible, because he armeth speedily, and that in such
multitudes, as both the number and the expedition terri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieth all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
For when he armeth, he most commonly bruiteth it abroad, that
he meaneth to carry his Forces to one place, when indeed he conveyeth
them to another; yea, and somtimes he sendeth Ambassadors to will
them to be assured and out of all doubt, that he will not in any wise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93045:48"/>
or trouble them, whom his full intent, purpose, and resolution is to
invade upon a sudden. Considering therefore his strength, his religion,
his natural hatred against Christians, together with the continual emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
quarrels, and contentions that are betwixt Christian Princes, he
holdeth it most convenient and necessary to have alwaies a vigilant eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
such an adversary. For of Christian Princes, he considereth who
they be whom he most envieth, whose States he most longeth for, after
whose Dominions he most thirsteth, and unto which he hath best access,
and easiest possibility to attain them. The House of <hi>Austria</hi> are his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
kinsmen, and on one side the next adjoyning neighbours unto the
Turkish Territorirs: With them for kinred sake he entertaineth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amit
amity, and is loth to offer them any occasion of discontentment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knoweth that of late years they have not only possessed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but also been greatly favoured in <hi>Germany;</hi> with whose invincible
power and puissance, they are both able and ready, when occasion shall
be offered, to offend and defend the Turk: For it is their Dominion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which the Turk hath an especial eye, and an unsatiable desire, and by
them and their means, Christian Princes most annoy him; because by
the Country of <hi>Hungary</hi> the way lieth open unto these Regions, which he
lately subdued; and a Christian Prince leading an Army through that
Country against the Turk, may undoubtedly have good success against
his Forces, if he shall observe these conditions following.</p>
            <p>First, if in conducting his Army he shall avoid and decline the wide
plains, and come not neer unto the River <hi>Danubius;</hi> of the commodity
whereof, the Turk by reason of his great courage, standeth alwaies in
need.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If he shall not come nigh unto such places where the Turk
may have convenient use of his Horsemen, and innumerable Footmen;
with the excessive multitudes of which, he will easily oppress and suppress
a Christian Army, if they should chance to encounter in those Plains.</p>
            <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Christian Prince shall arm this year, and proceeding
slowly on his journey, not meet with the Turk, but fortifie and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
such places as he shall get and conquer; and the next year, when as the
Turk neither is wont, nor can arm with the like number and quantity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
manfully; For the Prince in thus doing, shall compel him to stand
continually upon his Guard, and alwaies to entertain great and gross Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which he should not be able to endure long; or else enforce him to
use such Forces as might be more easily conquered, and so consequently
drive him to change the accustomed course and custome of his Wars,
which would be as much as half a victory gotten against him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Christian shall endeavour to draw him into some
Streight, and there with some war-like stratagem enforce him to a Battel,
and with a Troop of well ordered Footmen encounter his Janizaries,
which he usually reserveth for some extremity, and with valour, and some
unknown and unusual exploit, drive them to the worst, or put them out
of their array and order; there is no doubt but with the strangeness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he might obtain a notable victory against him; whose horsemen are
most easily overthrown, because they are for the most part unarmed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If he shall mark and observe when there is mutiny, sedition, or
secret dissention, disturbance, or discontentment betwixt the Turk and
his Subjects, and by all cunning and policy entertain the same, maintain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93045:48"/>
the procurers and heads thereof, and in the very heat of their tumult be
ready to invade them. For indeed, the especial means to weaken the Turk,
is to assault him when he is otherwise busied in wars with the <hi>Sophi,</hi> or with
any other enemies, or when his successors are at contention for the crown,
or his people divided amongst themselves, or he did lately receive some
notable overthrow: for he tyrannizing his subjects in such manner as he
doth, the least overthrow that can be must needs endanger his State great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he feareth that his own people will be ready to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
aid, and succour unto any, by whom they may have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hope to wind their necks out of the yoke of that intolerable servitude
which they now suffer.</p>
            <p>This is so true, that it is credibly affirmed by the best Warriours of our
age; That if the Christians had procceded with their invincible Navie,
when Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> gave the Turk the famous overthrow (for
which all Christendom greatly rejoyced) they might haply have gotten
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and have recovered most part of the Turkish Dominion.
Next unto the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> which although it
be far inferiour unto many Christian Princes in power and strength by
land, yet it yeildeth unto very few or none of them in force by Sea.</p>
            <p>With this State the Spaniard knoweth also that it is very good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for him to entertain peace and amity: For albeit they have many
Countries confining and bordering upon the Turk (for the which they
pay him yearly Tribute) and that their Merchants have continual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Trade and traffique unto Turky, and likewise the Turks with
them (which bringeth in inestimable wealth and benefit unto the State)
and that in consideration hereof the Turk will not easily offend them, nor
they willingly displease him; yet the Venetians knowing him to be a Turk,
that is, a common enemy of Christendom, the devourer of other mens
estates, the disturber of the common peace, and a most notable breaker
of all League, Truce and Amity; as often as he stirreth they stand in
continual awe of him, and notwithstanding all leagues, contracts, and
confederacies with him, are content to joyn with the Spaniard at any time
against him, and to use the utmost of their power to annoy and molest
him; as it was seen by the great aid which they gave unto the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
King, when as Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> gave the Turk the above-mentioned
overthrow. Thus being assured of the Venetians friendship, entertaining
perfect and perpetual amity with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and having the
rest of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> for his friends, he hath little occasion to fear the
Turk: And yet for his better security, he seeketh to live in league and amity
with him; and likewise keepeth continual friendship with the Turks greatest
enemies, hoping to turn them upon him, if at any time he should chance
to attempt any act of hostility against any of his States and Dominions.</p>
            <p>The French King is the second considerable friend or enemy the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
hath,<note place="margin">The Spanish Kings opinion &amp; proceeding with the French King.</note> of whose friendship or enmity he is to make no small account;
For albeit the one hath many more Kingdoms, many more People, and
much more Treasure then the other; yet because <hi>France</hi> is of it self, and
within it self, a very great Kingdom, well inhabited, full of many great
Cities, replenished with all things necessary, and sufficiently furnished
with whatsoever is needful, either for Peace or for War: The King
thereof is (in my opinion) nothing inferior unto the Spaniard, and much
more able to pleasure or annoy him, then any other Prince of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

ever had, were in comparison of his own Wars, with women rather then
with men; And that all the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would not have
sufficed to end and finish one only War with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with
whom the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the first Wars against them, fought twenty four
years together. And that the <hi>Romans</hi> had overthrown above 1000.
sundry Armies, the least of all the which was far greater then the
Armies of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> or of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; All which
may seem to be true, because <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> and
<hi>Greekish</hi> Worthies, reporteth, That <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> took in his time, one
thousand Cities by assault; overcame more then 300. sundry Nations; took
above a Million of men prisoners, and slew better then another Million of
men in divers Battels; for if one General of the <hi>Romans</hi> wrought so many
worthy Exploits, subdued so many Regions, and slew so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
how infinite, now incredible were the Armies and the Victories
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93045:49"/>
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> (who had many Captains (As both the <hi>Scipios, Fabius

                  </gap>lius Caesar?</hi> Notwithstanding all this that is said, I must needs say
that (as <hi>Iohn Bodin</hi> a French Authour saith, in his Book <hi>de Republica</hi>) the
<hi>Romans</hi> having made tryal of four several Estates;<note place="margin">Bodin.</note> As of a <hi>Royal,</hi> a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,</hi>
an <hi>Aristocratical,</hi> and a <hi>Popular</hi> State, never thrived better, nor
ever flourished more, then they did under their <hi>Popular</hi> State: And to
what end say I thus? Forsooth to this purpose: To shew you that when
the <hi>Romans</hi> were most mighty, when their Authority was greatest, when
they commanded all <hi>Italy,</hi> they might justly stand in fear of such an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>Italy,</hi> as the King of <hi>France</hi> may be thereunto; And so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the present King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose power is by very many degrees
inferiour and not equal to the <hi>Romans,</hi> hath very great and just occasion
to doubt and fear the French King; for it is written that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who
was the greatest enemy that ever the <hi>Romans</hi> had,<note place="margin">Tit. Livius. lib. 33.</note> who in my simple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
was the most wise, politique, and valiant Captain that ever lived,
who knew the strength of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and how they might well and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
be annoyed by any Prince that would undertake Wars against
them, better then any General of former Age, or of our time doth, or can
know, being driven after the ruin and destruction of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to fly for
succour, and for his last refuge unto King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> delivered unto him,
for his sound and setled opinion; that <hi>Italy</hi> was a Country that was able
to yeild unto any forrain Enemy, both Souldiers and Victuals against it
self; and yet whosoever would attempt any enterprise, either secretly or
openly, against <hi>Italy;</hi> must take the advantage of some Conspiracy, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
or Commotion, to be moved within the very bowels and entralls
of <hi>Italy;</hi> for that if the <hi>Romans</hi> might wholly enjoy and imploy the only
forces and strength thereof; there was never any King, or any Nation
that might justly and truly compare with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Then if <hi>Italy</hi> be
such a Country (as undoubtedly it appeareth to be by <hi>Hannibals</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
If it be able to yeild releif to Forrainers; if the next way to win it
be to have a partie and partakers in it, who can be thought wise that shall
be of opinion the Spaniard is of so great power and Authority in <hi>Italy,</hi>
that he should not need to fear the French Kings might or puissance?
Shall he not be feared, because some men perhaps think him not able to
set forth an Army sufficient to encounter with the Spanish Forces?<note place="margin">Tit. Livius. lib. 9.</note> Why,
it is written that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (who conquered mightier Princes
then the present King of <hi>Spain</hi> is) never had in amy Army above 30000.
Foot-men, and 4000. Horse-men. It is writen that the very <hi>Romans</hi>
(whose power was such as you have heard it to be) never used greater
Forces against any forrain enemy then an Army of 40. or 50<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. at the most.
Lastly, it is Recorded that the Spanish Kings Father held an opinion, for
many reasons him thereunto moving; that an Army of the same number
and quality which <hi>Alexander</hi> used, was (without all doubt and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie)
sufficient for any Prince whatsoever against any enemy, was he
never so mighty: Again, shall he not be feared because his Treasure is
not equal unto the Spaniards Golden Mines? Why, it is true that money
and Gold are the very sinews of War; it is an infallible Maxime;
we hold it for a most ancient and over-ruled Rule; but if riches had been
the best and only means to subdue Nations, never had the poor <hi>Romans</hi>
at their first beginning, nor the needy <hi>Swizzers</hi> in their Wars against the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93045:50"/>
rich Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> nor the beggarly <hi>Normans,</hi> in the Infantry of
their Chivalry, obtained such Victories and Conquests as they did: But
grant that the Spaniard needeth not fear any Enemy in <hi>Italy,</hi> unless he be
as mighty as the <hi>Romans,</hi> both in money and in men; If the French King
shall be found to be such an enemy, will the Spaniards favourers confess
that he is worthy to be feared? If they should not, you would hold them
to be senceless.</p>
            <p>And if in this Point concerning the annoying of the Spaniard in <hi>Italy,</hi>
I prove him not in some manner equal to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I can be content
that my slender Reputation shall suffer any manner of indignity. <hi>Titus
Livius,</hi> and many other Authors of the like Authority and Credit, make
true and large mention of the harms, of the indignities, and of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which the <hi>Romans</hi> sustained by <hi>Hannibal;</hi> They report how he passed
the <hi>Alpes</hi> with great difficulty, brought in forces into <hi>Italy</hi> with great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ruled his Souldiers with great dexterity, provided things necessary
for them, with singular wisdom and providence; won divers Princes of
<hi>Italy</hi> to join with him and them, with great Wit and Policy; Lastly,
proceeded on his journey with so great courage and magnanimity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in his enterprises with so good success and fortune, terrified and
daunted the invincible hearts and stomachs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with so many
unexpected and notable Victories; that they had no other way to be rid of
him but to send <hi>Scipio</hi> to War in <hi>Affrica,</hi> and by besieging <hi>Carthage</hi> to call
him home to the releif of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Now for the better proof of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
give me leave I pray you, to compare the Spaniard and the <hi>Romans,</hi>
the French King and <hi>Hannibal</hi> together; a Molehil indeed with a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
an Eagle in truth with a fly, but such a Molehil, and such a fly,
as will declare the greatness of the Mountain; as will illustrate the might
and vertues of the Eagle. The <hi>Romans</hi> commanded all <hi>Italy;</hi> The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
ruleth most part of <hi>Italy;</hi> they had no man in <hi>Hannibals</hi> time, that
durst oppose himself openly against him; he hath few or none in our Age
that dareth shew himself an open enemy against him; they were generally
feared; he is undoubtedly redoubted; they were assisted by their friends
against <hi>Hannibal;</hi> he would likewise find friends against the French King;
Briefly, they stood upon their guard, and he is not without his Garrisons.
But an <hi>Hannibal</hi> annoyed them when they were almost in the highest peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of their pride and prosperity; And why may not a French King work
him annoyance when he standeth most assuredly upon his defence? Shall
he not be able to hurt him because the <hi>Alpes</hi> divide <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and
maketh the passage hard and difficult? But <hi>Hannibal</hi> passed them when
they were not so passable as they are now; And how many times have the
Frenchmen passed them since <hi>Hannibals</hi> time? Shall he not find means
to work him dispight and hindrance because he is not so well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in Wars, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was? But may he not find many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
who in these days have little less experience then <hi>Hannibal</hi> had?
Shall he not be sufficient to war against him in <hi>Italy,</hi> because the Country
is far better fortified then in <hi>Hannibals</hi> time? but late experience hath
taught us, that those Fortifications, Holds, and Citadels, could not stay
the course of <hi>Charls</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> who passed through all
<hi>Italy</hi> as a Conquerour, until he came to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which he
also subdued? Briefly, shall he not prevail against him in <hi>Italy,</hi> because the
Spaniard is in League with most of the Princes hereof? But Histories af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93045:50"/>
us many examples, that the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes have oftentimes broken
their League with the Emperour and other his Predecessors, whose great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they either feared or enveighed as they do the overgrowing power of
the Spaniard at this present.) And why may not these examples move them
to do the like, when as the like occasion of fear or of envy is offered unto
them? <hi>Hannibal</hi> counselled (as you have heard) <hi>Antiochus</hi> to war upon the
Romans in <hi>Italy,</hi> when they were far stronger then the Spaniards is and no
man had better experience of the Romans or of <hi>Italy</hi> then <hi>Hannibal</hi> had;
The reasons therefore enforcing <hi>Hannibal</hi> to give that Counsel to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
may (as they have many times) serve to move the French King to
follow his counsel; the rather because experience proved it to be true;
and <hi>Antiochus</hi> failed of his purpose, because he hearkned to <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
perswasion.</p>
            <p>But this difficulty will be better cleared, if I shall let you understand
the opinion of one of the best Warriors of our Age, as well touching the
wealth,<note place="margin">Monsieur de la Nove en le, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques.</note> as the strength of the French King: <hi>Monsieur de la Nove</hi> (who
dyed but a few years past, and when he lived was generally reputed and
esteemed the best Captain of our time) in his Book of Military discourses,
delivereth that the French King, <hi>Henry</hi> the second, levyed yearly by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means of his Subjects, fifteen Millions of Francks, part whereof
were engaged and pawned for his debts; and yet (saith he) our King le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth
no less at this day. Here you see the French Kings Revenues were
in some measure comparable unto the Romans: For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned History,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> writing of the life of <hi>Pompey</hi> (who was surnamed
the <hi>Great</hi>) reporteth, That the yearly and ordinary Revenues of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Common-wealth, before the Conquest obtained by <hi>Pompey,</hi> came
but to five Millions of Crowns, which is fifteen Millions of Francks; the
just Revenue of the French King, until that <hi>Pompey</hi> increased the same,
and brought it to eight Millions, and 500<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Crowns, and brought unto
the Treasure-house, ten Millions of Jewels and ready coin: So if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that (as it hath been shewed) the Romans never flourished more,
then they did when they were governed by Consuls, and not by Kings or
by Emperours; yea you shall see that the French King coming not much
behind them in yearly Revenues, may be thought in some respect equal
unto them.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Mounsieur de la Nove,</hi> in his twentieth <hi>Military Discourse,</hi> talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the might and puissance of the French King, deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may very conveniently set forth an Army of 60. Companies of men at

               <note place="margin">Du Haillan</note> in his 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of the History of <hi>France,</hi> setteth down,

               </gap>. Ships, all
loaden with men and munition, which I have thought good to let you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93045:51"/>
understand, to the end you may see, that if the <hi>Alps</hi> should be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable
by the Spaniard for the Frenchmen (which was the Emperour
<hi>Charls</hi> the fifth's purpose and intention to do, if in his life time he could
possibly have brought it to pass) yet the French King is not unable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished
of ships to convey and carry (as his Predecessors have done) a
sufficient Army by Sea into <hi>Italy. Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
recordeth, that the Frenchmen came with an Army of three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fighting men, to raise <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> Siege before <hi>Alexia;</hi> a huge
number, and such a number as the Romans never used the like against any
Forrain Enemy; as the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> testifieth in the life of <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
where he affirmeth, that the greatest power which the Romans ever
had against any enemy whatsoever, was but eighty eight thousand souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<note place="margin">Andreas Friccius de Repub.</note> and <hi>Andreas Ficcius</hi> in his book <hi>de Repub.</hi> reporteth, that they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never passed the number of forty or fifty thousand; a less num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
then which, <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, the present King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s father, held
to be sufficient (as I have said before) to encounter with any Christian
Prince; and I have thought good to repeat, because hearing what you
have heard of the French power, you may think the French King well
able to annoy any King of Christendom: For although I should grant
that his power is weakned, and he not able to arm such multitudes as his
Predecessors have done (for which I see no reason, if he were freed of his
Civil wars) yet it must needs be granted, that he could easily make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of that number, and therewith greatly prejudice the Spaniard in <hi>Italy,</hi>
especially since a Captain of valour and experience will adventure to set
upon innumerable multitudes, nothing fearing their number, with a few
well trained and experienced souldiers; as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did upon
<hi>Darius</hi> his innumerable hoste, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> did upon the Romans; who
(as <hi>Polibius</hi> testifieth in his second book, with scant twenty thousand, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to fight with the Romans in <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polib. l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> amounting unto seven hundred
thousand footmen, and seventy thousand horsemen.</p>
            <p>Thus, as in Revenues, so in multitudes of Souldiers, at the leastwise
in such multitudes as they commonly used, you see the French King is in
some measure comparable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but especially in no respect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
unto <hi>Hannibal</hi> for men or money; and therefore without all doubt
and controversie, as likely and able to war with the Spanish King within
the very bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> as he was to contend with the <hi>Romans</hi> when they
were strongest, as all Princes are most commonly within their own
Realms and Dominions, especially if they have (as the Romans had) the
same wholly and entirely to themselves. But although this point touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of <hi>France</hi> his possibility and means to molest and trouble the
Spanish King in <hi>Italy,</hi> be well and sufficiently cleared by that which is said,
yet I cannot so leave it; for I hold it convenient to let you know the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Father concerning the same matter. He therefore considering
the variable affections of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the hidden and secret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
which they inwardly bear unto all strangers and forreigners, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretensions which the French King hath unto <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with sundry prosperous attempts and journeys which of late years
they have made into <hi>Italy,</hi> counselled the present King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his son,
at the time he resigned all his Kingdoms unto him (a very rare and
commendable act) to carry a watchful and wary eye over the French
King; he willeth him to be jealous of his greatness, and to seek all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93045:51"/>
means possible to weaken him; he adviseth how to war against <hi>France,</hi>
and how by his own examples, and by the remembrance of his own
mishaps and evil success, he might fight against the French King with far
better advantage then he did at <hi>Marselles;</hi> he exhorteth him to shut up the
French King's passage, as much as in him shall lie, by the way of <hi>Turin;</hi>
he admonisheth him to take heed lest that at any time the Frenchmen give
him some overthrow in <hi>Italy;</hi> he assureth him, that if at any time they
should haply obtain any victory there against him, his best and most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
friends in <hi>Italy</hi> would not run the same and the like danger and fortune
with him, but presently joyn and associate themselves with his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
briefly, he warneth him above all other things, to look and foresee,
that there be no league of amity and alliance concluded betwixt the
French King and the Venetians, or any other Prince of <hi>Italy;</hi> he addeth
to those counsels, divers other wise and considerable advertisements; as,
to inform himself throughly of the contentions and strifes that are or may
be betwixt the principal Houses and Officers of <hi>France;</hi> he counselleth
him, if there be any, to nourish them; if none, to procure and set some
forward; he considering that the Country of <hi>Piedmont</hi> is easie to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by the French, and of great profit and commodity unto them, either
by Wars, or by marriage, to keep them from the possession of all, or of
any part thereof; assuring him, that it will not be so beneficial for him
to take from the French King a third part of his whole Realm towards
<hi>Flanders,</hi> as it will be to shut him out of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> because barring him
by that means of an easie access into <hi>Italy,</hi> he shall live in good assurance
of his Estates there, which are the chiefest parts of his strength, and the
most especial pillars of his greatness. This counsel hath been as wisely
followed and executed by the Son, as it was warily given by the Father:
for it is better then thirty years ago since he by his instruments (I mean the
Princes of the House of <hi>Guise</hi>) hath maintained and nourished civil dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>France,</hi> whereby the Kings thereof in all this time have never been
able to make wars upon him in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is likewise many years agone
since he favoured the late Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (who by the French King was
driven out of his Estate) with men and money for the present recovery of
the same: and not many years since, for the better assurance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyans
friendship, he hath given his second daughter (a match fit for a
better man then he) in marriage unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and hath holp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him as much as he could possibly, in all his wars against the late French
King, by whom (if God had spared him longer life) he had long before
this time, been driven out of his Country. I shall not need to tell you
in what terms he standeth with the present King of <hi>France;</hi> you, and all
the world know, that he only maintaineth his Rebels, not for any love
towards them, but for his own private gain and security. And therefore
from the French King I will now come unto other Princes of whom the
Spaniard maketh any reckoning or account.</p>
            <p>And first unto the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Kings opinion &amp; proceeding with the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> of whom I shall not need to say
much, for I shall have occasion to speak of the Emperour in another place;
and the other Princes either depend on him, or if they be absolute of
themselves, set their whole care upon preserving their own Estates, and
care not to augment and increase the same. Hence it cometh, that they
live in continual peace, although they differ in Religion, and that one of
them encroacheth not upon another, albeit they have their Estates and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93045:52"/>
Territories very neer adjoyning together. Hence it cometh, that they
live securely, and are not ready to enter into Wars for light occasions, or
to succour their Allies and Confederates with such celerity, willingness,
and expedition as is required, and thought meet and convenient. Hence
again it cometh, that they opposed not themselves against the greatness of
the Spaniard, and are not so forward, as they in reason and policy should
be, to yeild aid both of men and money unto those whom he molesteth.
Briefly, hence it cometh, that there are so many free Towns and Cities
in <hi>Germany,</hi> which had framed unto themselves such Governours, and
such Rulers as it hath best pleased them; and that these Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
being of great wealth, are not made subject unto the next adjoyning
Princes; for if that the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had been so desirous and ready
to increase their Estates, as the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Dukes and other
Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> have been, who by main force, and the advantage and
benefit of times, have usurped the possession of divers Cities, whereunto
they had no manner of Right, <hi>Germany</hi> should have fewer free cities, and
far mightier Princes then it hath. The Spaniard therefore knowing that
these Princes are peaceable men, and not easily let to enter into wars, and
yet, because their country is populous, both able and willing to spare
many of their Subjects to be imployed in forraign Wars, entertaineth as
many of them as he can possible, for his friends, and hath lately sought to
draw the <hi>Switzers</hi> (who are part of <hi>Germany</hi>) from the service of the
French King; wherein he laboureth so earnestly by his Embassadours,
that what by promising to pay the French Kings debts, what by assuring
them to increase their monthly pay, he had undoubtedly won them, had
not the ancient friends of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the eldest captains
and Senators stuck hardly unto the late French King, who was compelled
for fear of losing their aid and assistance, to borrow as much money as he
could possibly, to pay them some part of his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bts, and to assure unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
those Captains and Senatours, without which help, his ancient friends
forsaking him, had entred into league and service with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.
Thus much, or rather this little briefly of the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
Ferrara, Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> all which have
some Town or other, neer unto the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> or Dukedom of
<hi>Mlian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He maketh special account of the Pope,<note place="margin">The Spanish Kings opinion &amp; proceeding with the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> not because he is the mightiest
(for the <hi>Venetians</hi> are undoubtedly of far greater strength and power then
he) but because where he inclineth, there the rest most commonly bend
their favour, and lend their furtherance; unto him therefore he carrieth
great respect, feeeth his chief Counsellors, respecteth his colledg of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
giveth rewards and yearly pensions unto many of them; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those Courtiers who are in special favour with him, promiseth and
protesteth that he will be always ready to defend and protect them, and
their just causes and quar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>els against all princes whatsoever. He careth
not by what means he procureth his friends to make a Pope, whether it
be lawful or unlawful, whether he be worthy or unworthy of so high a
place and dignity, so that he be well assured of his Friendship. And if it
so fall out, that those cardinals who are not well affected unto him, by
plurality of their voices, make such a Pope as is rather his enemy then
friend, he presently seeketh all means possible to purchase his favour, he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93045:52"/>
corrupteth his best favourites, bribeth his neerest servants, winneth by
yearly fees and pensions his chief cardinals, and so by direct and indirect
courses procureth his assured Friendship. Or if he be past hope to obtain
the same, that Pope shall be assured not to live long in his pontifical feat
and Majesty; For, either he, or some one of his friends or followers for
him, will find some way or other to dispatch him, as it hath been very
lately seen and verified: So that either love, procured and continued by
his benevolence and liberality towards the Popes Cardinals, or fear, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the consideration and remembrance of the dangers which
later Popes have both incurred and endured, because they did not either
like him, or were not well liked by him, containeth and continueth the
See of <hi>Rome</hi> in peace and amity with him.</p>
            <p>Next unto the Pope are the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with whom the Spaniard know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he may very easily entertain Love and Friendship,<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Kings opinion &amp; proceeding with the Venetians, &amp; the rest of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Italy.</note> because they
do, or have always put great trust and confidence in the change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of times; attributing so much thereunto, that it is greatly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their long sufferance will be the cause of their utter ruine and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for temporizing as they do, they will become in time a prey unto
some warlike Nation, and namely, unto the Turk, with whom, by reason
of their continual Traffique with him, they stand in such terms, that they
lye always open unto him; and it is to be doubted, that he taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and benefit of time, will one day when they least suspect him,
deprive them of <hi>Corsu, Candia, Zant,</hi> and other places, as he did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
spoil them of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> notwithstanding because the
<hi>Venetians</hi> are somewhat jealous of his greatness, and fear to see any man to
be of over-great credit and authority within the bowels and heart of <hi>Italy;</hi>
the Spaniard hath a watchful and suspitious eye over them, knowing that
as nothing can sever or seperate them from the Turk, unless they see him
not only ready to decline, but also in some manner thrown down; so
they have always, and will still be most ready to withstand the aspiring
ambition of any Forreigner that should seek to make himself great and
mighty in <hi>Italy.</hi> Moreover he knoweth that the <hi>Venetians</hi> know not their
own power, nor can tell how to use the same; which they shewed to be
most true not many years since, when they took not such occasions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
their Dominions as were offered unto them. Again he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that they having lived a long time in peace, are grown so out of use
of wars, that they have in a manner forgotten all military discipline; and
therefore if they should at any time give him occasion to fall at variance
with them, he might undoubtedly with assaulting them upon a sudden,
drive them to some great inconvenience, especially if he should enter with
his forces into the heart and very center of their Dominion, and there
compel them to put strong Garrisons within all their Forts and Towns of
strength, whereby they should not be able to keep the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in so
many holds (as they have) it cannot be but that in some of them there
would quickly be found want, either of victuals, or of munition, or else
some means to corrupt the Garrison or the Captain, or the Inhabitants,
or such as are factious; of which quality and humour there are many, in
very many of their cities. Further he knoweth that if he were but once
Master of the field, all that is not strong within the Seigniory (which in
all States is a great deal more then the strong) would presently yeild unto
his discretion; or else he should constrain them to come to the field, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93045:53"/>
there leave the Forts and Towns without sufficient defence, or else not to
be able to continue their Garrisons long; and coming once to the field,
they will easily be drawn of necessity unto a Battel, wherein they can hope
for no great good success; or at the least they must suffer some great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
by reason of the want of experience, as well in their Souldiers
as in their Captains: But the greatest care or fear the Spaniard hath of the
<hi>Venetians</hi> is, lest that the remembrance of their good usage and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
towards the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and of their mild and gentle Government
wheresoever they chance to have the upper hand, should make the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans</hi>
willing and ready to further their Attempts, if at any time they
should set upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> This care maketh him entertain
friendship with them, and also putteth him in mind (if he see the least
likelyhood that may be of Wars with them) to seek all the means possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either by prevention or sudden Invasion to divert them from warring
against <hi>Naples.</hi> Thus liveth he either in peace with them, or warreth
against them with great advantage.</p>
            <p>Now from them to the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the which are of such
strength that he needeth not greatly to fear them; only of them he hath this
care and this regard; That he suffereth none of them to augment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Estate, no not him that dependeth most upon him; carrying
always this mind, That it behoveth him as well to contain his best friends
within a moderate and convenient greatness, as to weaken and depress his
enemies: For he assureth himself, that those that love him best in <hi>Italy,</hi>
who flatter him now most, who follow him with all favour and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
would quickly forsake him, if his Power once began to decline:
For the <hi>Italian</hi> lendeth his hand to his enemy to help him up; that is but
up to the chin in Water; and putteth his foot upon his head to drown him
that is, fallen in above the chin: And because he knoweth their weakness
to be such, as that they cannot possibly annoy him, unless they chance to
enter into League and Confederacy against him; he entertaineth their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
maintaineth his credit and reputation amongst them, provideth
wise and discreet Officers to govern his Subjects there, useth his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as gently as he can; and lastly, foreseeth that they shall not combine
themselves against him; This is all that I shall need to say of the Princes
of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whom I must come to the Queen of <hi>Engl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen of England is the mightiest enemy that the Spanish King hath.</note> who (the times

for he that is mightiest of them, is mighty either by Sea only, or by Land
only; her Majesty is strong both by Sea and Land, they there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore not
able to trouble him without the help one of another; and her Highness of
her self sufficient to cross his enterprises, to withstand his indeavours, to
prevent his purposes, and to invade his Kingdom. In so much that he
may well reckon it for one of the chiefest blessings that God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him; that it pleased his divine Majesty to make her a woman, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93045:53"/>
not a man, a lover of Peace, and not a friend of War, a Princess desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to maintain her own, and not to Conquer other Princes Kingdoms;
for if ever she had affected higher Dominion, if ever she had desired to
enlarge her Territories, or coveted to enrich her self with his, or other
Princes losses; What occasions have been offered unto her? What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
hath time it self given her? What suit have some of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
made unto her? not to receive them only into her protection; but
also with her aid, help, and assistance, to subjugate other Dominions?
<hi>Scotland</hi> may commend her Justice and Liberality: <hi>France</hi> hath great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to extol her Lenity and Temperance: <hi>Flanders</hi> is bound to pray
for her prosperity: And the Spaniard himself shall be unthankful, if he
praise not her Equity. Time hath greatly favoured her by sending divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
amongst her Neighbours; The Almighty hath strengthned her, by
impairing the strength of her adversaries; both have set her many degrees
above all the Princes of Christendom, by giving her peace, when they
have had wars; her abundance, when they haue suffered many wants;
her loving and dutiful Subjects, when their people have been unkind and
rebellious; briefly, her all the blessings that mans heart can wish, and
them most part of the crosses that humane imbecillity can endure. I may
not dwell upon her praises, because they are far beyond my capacity; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
set forth her blessings, because they are innumerable. The one require
an higher stile, a more eloquent Tongue, a better Wit, and a greater under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
then the most High hath bestowed upon me: The other are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
but not computable; and whosoever shall undertake to express
them, shall faint before he be half entered into them; And yet I may not
thus leave them, lest passing them over in silence, I should seem cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in other States, and ignorant of our own. Neither may I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to write all that I know: Princes actions are open in outward shew,
but inwardly obscure; subject to the view of many men, but exceeding
the wisdom and capacity of most men; soon espied, but never throughly
seen; seeming quickly to be known, but hardly well understood; in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
easie, but in effect very difficult; in some mens opinions repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
but in others judgments praise worthy: To be short, they may
be talked of, but not controlled; admired but not censured; lightly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after, but not narrowly sif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed and examined; It sufficeth to hear
them, it becometh not any man to seek and search the Reasons of them:
Nature enforceth us to desire the one; and wisdom warneth us not to be
curious of the other.</p>
            <p>But I have taken upon me to make a full Discourse of this time; and
therefore may not omit the principal Actions of the only Princess of our
time, nor obscure her Puissance by leaving it untouched, whose power is
invincible, because it was never touched: The Maiden whose honesty was
never attempted, deserveth the name of a true Virgin: And the Prince
whom no man dareth to molest, may well be termed invincible: The
Fort that never parteth, is seldom taken: And the King whose Power
never decreaseth, can hardly be subdued.</p>
            <p>It is written that the Frenchmen seeing the innumerable Armies that
have been sent out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>France;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Da Hailan</note> and considering that they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
our men dayly, and in great numbers, and yet we received daily
new supplies from home, as though our men never dyed; compare us
unto wild Geese, which in the coldest Winters come unto the watry
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93045:54"/>
grounds every year by great flocks, and albeit most part of them be
killed before the Winter be fully ended, yet they return the next year in
as great quantities as they did the year before; And so, although they were
wearied with killing and slaying our Country-men; yet as soon as one
Army was defeated, there came a new supply, which took sharp, revenge
of the others deaths, and never suffered them to live in peace, ease, or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness,
until they redeemed their vexations and troubles with such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as contented our Princes.</p>
            <p>I might here take just occasion to trouble you with a long recital of the
Forces and Armies which divers of our Kings have led and carryed, either
under their own, or under their Lievtenants conduct into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> into <hi>Turky</hi> or the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land;</hi> but our Histories and other Chronicles are full of them, and you
carry them so well in mind, that I hold it very superfluous to refresh
your memory. I leave the prowess of <hi>Edward</hi> the third undeclared;
the fortunate Conquests of <hi>Richard</hi> the first untouched; the happy Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth unrepeated; and the strange and marvelous fortunes
of many other of our Kings, not mentioned: I list not to boast of the
black Princes valour, of the Duke of <hi>Glocesters</hi> boldness, of the Bishop
of <hi>Winchesters</hi> pride, who being but Subjects under our Kings, carried
out of our Realm divers Armies comparable to the Forces of Kings. Old
Histories are reputed for Fables; Things beyond memory are not thought
worthy of memory; And what our Fathers did, redoundeth not, in
some mens opinions, to our praise or commendation, according to the
Poets saying.</p>

            <p>But later Years have held many Testimonies of our strength, manifold
Arguments of our valour, infallible proofs of our power; The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
is in the opinion of all men, the terrour of Princes, the controller of
Kings, the Monarch of the world, and the most and highest Soveraign of
all Soveraigns; It is he that maketh <hi>Italy</hi> to tremble; that holdeth <hi>Spain</hi>
in great awe; that terrifieth the proud and invincible <hi>Germans;</hi> that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteth
the valiant and variable Frenchmen; that tyranizeth over the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
Flemmings; that mastereth the ancient and warlike <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
that captivateth the free and manly <hi>Switzers;</hi> that miscarrieth the
populous and poor <hi>Scots;</hi> that bridleth the simple and untamed <hi>Indians;</hi>
that ruleth the unruly and obstinate people of <hi>Portugal;</hi> that overlooketh
with an eye of ambition, with a heart of covetousness, with a desire of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority,
with an unsatiable appetite of Soveraign Authority, the whole
face, and the large precincts of Christendom. It is he that useth his wit,
imployeth his strength, bendeth his power, armeth his people, directeth
his Council, and dedicateth all that he possesseth to the lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inlarging of his Territories. It is he that taketh of his Father to be
Ambitious, that hath learned of his Ancestors to be troublesome, that
thinketh it a work beseeming a Prince, and becoming a King, to vex and
molest all Kings. It is he that dreameth by night, studieth by day, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
at all times how to let no time pass without a line (as it was anciently
said) without a Stratagem, a late invented policy, an unknown practise,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93045:54"/>
and a rare and marvelous enterprise. It is he that increaseth in ambition
as well as in years, in covetousness as well as in pride, in rigour as well as
in morosity; Briefly, it is he, and I would to God that it were not he,
that troubleth the peaceable estate of Christendom, that only vexeth the
Realm of <hi>France,</hi> that disquieteth <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>setteth</hi> friends at jarrs,
allies at variance, and confederates at dissention; insomuch that it may
well be said of him,
<q>Phi-<hi>malus &amp;</hi> lippus, <hi>totus malus ergo</hi> Philippus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a woman hath presumed to encounter with this man; if a
Queen of one Island hath undertaken to bridle a Prince of so many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
if her sole Forces have tamed his invincible power, her only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
prevented his subtile practises; her good will, withstood his ill-will,
his mischievous practises, and his ambitious desires; if she alone hath
hindred him to be Lord of <hi>France,</hi> Ruler of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Commander of
all the rest of the world; shall he not err that compareth <hi>Hercules</hi> with
her? Or can any man deem him wise, that taketh her in any respect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> mighty <hi>Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great? For
two of these, with the invincible power of the invincible Romans, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
some part of the rude and unwarlike people of the world; and
the third and fourth are famous, not in true Histories, but in old Fables,
for doing such exploits as are more pleasant then credible, more praised
then possible, and much more admired then allowed for true, and not
miraculous: But if any man shall deny her to be wise, her peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
giveth him the lie; if her might and power shall be called in
question, her actions in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> testifie the fulness of her
strength; if her justice be not worthily commended, her motherly care
over the present King of <hi>Scotland</hi> while he was an infant, her pitiful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
extended to as many as have had need of her help, and her upright and
just proceedings in as many matters forraign and domestical as have been
referred to her discretion, shall convince him of falshood, or of malice, that
shall derogate ought from her innumerable multitudes of her everlasting
praises. I wonder when I hear the Romans boast of their <hi>Pompey,</hi> the
Grecians brag of their <hi>Constantine,</hi> the French report wonders of their
<hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and the Syrians set forth the praises of their <hi>Antiochus</hi> (whom
every one of these Nations baptized with the sirname of Great) because
their actions were somwhat extraordinary, exceeding the common suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of other Princes, and the usual fortune of many and divers Kings;
for if a woman hath gone far beyond them all, and that without the aid
of any Allies, without the help of Forrain powers, and without the
strength of such as should have employed their whole strength to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of her endeavours; are not their praises eclipsed, their honours
blemished, and their renown obscured? They lived in an age of ignorance,
in a time of simplicity, in a season of cowardly pusillanimity; she ruleth
in a world full of Machiavelists, pestered with deceitful <hi>Hanibals,</hi> plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of warlike Captains, and rather over-burthened, then not throughly
furnished with sufficient Counsellors: and yet neither the policy of the
wisest, nor the deceit of the craftiest; not the labour of most warlike, nor
the wisdom of the best and most sufficient Counsellors, hath ever drawn
her into any small inconvenience, but hitherto either wisely or happily,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93045:55"/>
providently or fortunately, warily or worthily she hath not only prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but escaped, foreseen but overgone, forecast but overcome the most
secret, the most subtile, the most divelish, and the most unnatural and
inevitable practises, devises, attempts, treasons, and trecheries of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.
For many men and women, learned and unlearned, spiritual
and temporal, noble and ignoble, courtiers and counsellors have sought
her death, and committed treasons against her: Witness the late Queen of
Scots, Mrs <hi>Arding,</hi> and her daughter, witness Dr <hi>Storey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Parrey,</hi> and
Dr <hi>Saunders:</hi> Witness <hi>Campion, Sherwin,</hi> and their complices: Witness
the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Westmerland,</hi> and <hi>Arundel:</hi> Witness <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington,
Throgmorton, Tilney,</hi> and their confederates: Witness the late
Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Perrott,</hi> both Privie Counsellors of great account,
wealth, credit, and honour, both greatly loved, trusted, and honoured
by her Majesty, both bound unto her Highness for many favours, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and advancements, both (briefly) counselled, animated, encouraged,
and directed in their treasons by the wise Counsellors of the mightiest
Prince, and the greatest enemy that her Grace had in the world: Their
treason was plotted abroad, and intended at home; invented in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
should have been executed in <hi>England;</hi> there it received a beginning, here
an approbation: here were executioners, and there counsellors; here
practisers, and there patrons; here the traytors were blinded with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there the abettors were transported with envie; here reigned pride,
and there revenge; briefly, here the treasons ended, but their malice
continueth, and sendeth forth daylie new Conspirators, new devises, and
new practises: Since therefore her Majesties death hath been so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
the subversion of her State so many times purposed, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of both so desperately undertaken, her Highness for her self,
and we for her Highness, are greatly bound to pray to the Almighty,
who hath so many ways, so many times, and so miraculously preserved
her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was so fortunate,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> that being in great danger of drowning
and presuming that it was not his Creators pleasure that he should perish
in the Sea; when the Pilot durst not adventure to carry him for fear of
the apparent and great danger which threatned his present death, he boldly
said to the Master of the ship, <hi>Go thy ways, thou carriest</hi> Caesar, <hi>and</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars
<hi>Fortune;</hi> and yet notwithstanding it was his fortune to be killed with
Bodkins, and that by his dearest friends, yea in the Senate House, where

as free from danger as a Prince invironed with a strong Guard.</p>

was one of the Wonders of the world, and for his rare faithful friends
and Counsellors, went far beyond all the Princes that lived either before
or after him; neither by his vertue nor valour, nor by his fortune and
good hap, nor by his friends and Counsellors, could escape the fatal poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that ended his days, before he attained unto those years which be the
forerunners of Age: So as in others, so in this Point her Majesty far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
<hi>Caesar, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> the three greatest Princes that ever
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93045:55"/>
lived: For their death was so soon performed as purposed; Her life hath
been often sought (but God be thanked therefore) not shortned; they
escaped not the malicious Treasons of one or two; she hath been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the wicked treacheries of very many; they could not prevent
the Conspiracies of their friends; she hath withstood the open and secret
attempts of their enemies; Briefly, they dyed before they became old,
she hath attained unto sixty years of her Age; and the rare fortune which
she hath hitherto had to escape so many and marvelous dangers, putteth
me, and all her loving Subjects, in good hope, that it will please the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to add many more years of bliss and haappiness to her days: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I think only that she shall live beyond the ordinary and usual years
and age of other Princes; but I am fully perswaded, that her Grace is
preserved and reserved to great fortune to some marvelous purpose; her
qualities exceeding other Princes conditions; her fortune being more
then ordinary, and her dangers escaped, not prudently, but providently,
not by humane policy, but by divine prevention; give me good occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to presume, that he that disposeth of Kings, and all Kings Actions,
lengthneth her days, and hath dedicated her years to some notable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
For what he hath intended, man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent: what he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<note place="margin">Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent what God intendeth.</note> humane wit cannot change or alter, his resolutions are in Heaven,
ours on earth; his eternal, ours changeable; his immutable, ours subject
to alteration; We purpose, he disposeth; we intend, he changeth; we
desire, he ruleth, yea so ruleth, that he directeth our thoughts, leadeth
our counsels, inclineth our dispositions to his will and pleasure; he knows
our necessities before we ask, our infirmities when we conceal them, our
desires, albeit we keep them most close and secret; He giveth us what is
expedient for us, granteth us more then we dare desire, provideth better
for us then we can deserve; and to be short, is so resolute to do us good,
that all our wits, capacities, and policies are not able to prevent the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of his determinations, so the same tend to our benefit: For although
his mercy exceeding our merits, and his clemency yeilding to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
do sometimes divert the evil that we have deserved, and mitigate
the punishments which are due to our many offences; yet if our humility
be not dissembled, or his pleasure fully bent to work us any good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
so good is he, that our good cannot be attended, nor his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
changed: An Example or two will prove this to be manifest; and
therefore I will afford you these Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Astiages</hi> dreamed that his Daughter <hi>Mandana</hi> made so much water at
one time as filled his whole City,<note place="margin">Herodotus lib. 1.</note> and was likely to drown his whole
Country; with which dream being greatly terrified, he propoundeth the
same to be expounded by his best Interpreters of Dreams; They report,
that of the said Daughter should come such an Issue, as should drive him
from his Kingly Seat: He taketh counsel what to do to prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Almighty. It is resolved, that the best means is to marry
his Daughter to a mean man. The counsel is followed, and she married
not to a <hi>Median,</hi> worthy of such a Wife and Princess as she was; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a mean <hi>Persian,</hi> by name called <hi>Cambises,</hi> born of indifferent good
Parentage, but not likely to carry such a mind as to deprive his Father
in Law of his Kingdom. The same year that his Daughter was married,
he dreamed again. That out of her Privities sprang such a Vine, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
all <hi>Asia.</hi> This Dream he likewise communicated with the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93045:56"/>
They delivered, That out of the Womb of <hi>Mandana</hi> should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
such a Child as should be Lord of all <hi>Asia;</hi> and so desirous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that he should hardly and very unwillingly attend his Grand-Fathers
death: According to the Prophesie, the Child is born, his Nativity cast,
and the disposition of his body, and other outward signs foretel, that the
Prognostication made before his birth, was likely to prove true. The
Grand-father minding to prevent a future mischief, giveth him unto one
of his faithful Counsellors, commanding him to put him to death: The
Counsellor moved with pitty, commendeth the child to the custody of
his Shepherd, yet charging him to murther the Infant; The Shepherds
Wife having a child of her own dead the very self same day, not finding
in her heart to consent to the death of so pretty and Princely a Child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeched
her Husband to expose her own dead Child instead of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for
so <hi>Astiages</hi> his Grand-father was called: The Shepherd followed his
Wives counsel, and yeilded his consent that she should bring up <hi>Cyrus</hi> as
her own: He groweth to years, and within a few years is chosen King by
other children of all sorts, poor and rich, Noble and ignoble; and being
elected King, commanded as a King, and inflicteth punishments upon his
far betters, for disobeying his Authority. They disdaining to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
much less to be punished (as they were) by their far inferiour,
complain to their Parents, and they to <hi>Astiages,</hi> of the injury offered by
poor <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The Shepherd is injoyned to bring forth <hi>Cyrus;</hi> he maketh
appearance at the day appointed; carryeth himself not Shepherd like, but
Princelike, before the King: And being demanded by the King how he
durst presume to command his betters to be chastised; answered boldly
and with a spirit far exceeding his years, and not becoming his supposed
Estate, That since it had pleased the rest of the youth to chuse him for
their King, and to subject themselves in general unto him, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for any particular, were he never so good, to disobey him; And in case
any one did so far forget himself as to contemn his Authority, that then it
was as lawful for him, as for King <hi>Astiages,</hi> to punish his or their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
At which Answer the King being astonied, looking upon the
audacity of the Child, considering his wisdom, calling to mind the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and conferring his Daughters childs Age, and his years
together, suspected him to be <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Sent presently for <hi>Harpagus</hi> (for
so was the Counsellors name unto whom he had given him to be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
compelleth him to tell the truth; The Shepherd is likewise sent for,
who declareth the means and manner how <hi>Cyrus</hi> was saved: The King
highly offended with <hi>Harpagus,</hi> and fully resolved to depress <hi>Cyrus,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
his anger with the one, and taketh present order for the base edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the other. <hi>Cyrus</hi> is sent from <hi>Media</hi> into <hi>Persia:</hi> and <hi>Astiages</hi>
not long after, carrying a watchful and revengeful mind; and knowing
that <hi>Harpagus</hi> had but one child, and being once rebuked of <hi>Harpagus,</hi>
(more boldly then wisely) of drunkenness, sendeth for the Infant and the
Father, unto whom he saith, <hi>Thou toldest me (of late) I was drunken; Now
to shew thee whether I be, or no, I have here an Arrow in my hand, which if I do
shoot so rightly, that I do hit thy Son at the heart, thou mayest well think I am
not drunk; and if I miss his heart, then will I not be offended at thee for so say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of me:</hi> He shooteth the Arrow, and striketh the child at the heart:
And not content with this severe revenge, commandeth the Father to sup
with him, and compelleth him at Supper to feed on the best and cheifest
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93045:56"/>
parts of his only and dearest Son, baked in a Pie. <hi>Harpagus</hi> endureth
the wrong for a while, and maketh <hi>Astiages</hi> to continue his cruelty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
to his Marriage with his own Sister, bringeth him by secret means,
and his own leud demeanor, into the hatred of his Subjects; And when
he saw that it was time to begin to work his revenge; fearing that if he
should send a Letter to <hi>Cyrus</hi> (whom he meant to use for the Instrument
of his revenge) by ordinary means, the same might be intercepted, and
so both he and <hi>Cyrus</hi> endangered; taketh an Hare, openeth his Belly,
within it encloseth a Letter, and giveth the Hare to a trusty Messenger to
carry unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> willing him to take off the Hares skin; And to the end the
matter might be less suspected, he apparelleth the man like a Hunter, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
him Nets in his hand, and other instruments belonging unto Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The Letters contained, <hi>That</hi> Cyrus <hi>should dispose the</hi> Persians <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the wrongs that</hi> Astiages <hi>had done unto him and to</hi> Cyrus: <hi>The trust
that</hi> Astiages <hi>reposed in</hi> Harpagus, <hi>and that being assured to be made cheif
Lievtenant of the</hi> Median <hi>Forces which should be sent against</hi> Cyrus, <hi>he would
presently revolt unto</hi> Cyrus, <hi>who by that means might easily overthrow his
Grand-father:</hi> The Plot was thus layed; <hi>Cyrus</hi> rebelled, <hi>Astiages</hi> put
<hi>Harpagus</hi> in trust with all his strength; he flyeth unto <hi>Cyrus; Astiages</hi> is
delivered into the hands of his enemies, and the Empire of the <hi>Medians</hi> is
by this means translated unto the <hi>Persians.</hi>

               <hi>Amulius</hi> to rule alone, killed <hi>Numiter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Just. lib. 43. Tit. Livius.</note> and made his Daughter <hi>Rhea</hi>
one of the Virgins Vestals, that no man-child might proceed from her to
revenge the wrong done unto her Father, or recover the Kingdom due
unto her Father, <hi>Rhea</hi> living thus sequestred from the company of men,
is gotten with child, it is not known whether by mortal man, or by the
God <hi>Mars.</hi> She bringing forth two Twins, they are called <hi>Romulus</hi> and
<hi>Rhemus,</hi> who being brought up (as some say) by a Wolf, or (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
by a common Strumpet called <hi>Lupa,</hi> as they grew in years, so
they increased in vertues, valour, and credit, and in time wrought the
revenge of their Grand-fathers death, and drave <hi>Amulius</hi> from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambyses,</hi> Son to the afore-named <hi>Cyrus</hi> dreamed that a Messenger
brought him word that his Brother <hi>Smerdis</hi> sitting in his royal seat,<note place="margin">Herodotus lib. 3.</note> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Heavens with his head; by occasion of which dream, fearing that
he might be deprived of his Kingdom by his Brother, more speedily then
wisely, he commanded <hi>Smerdis</hi> to be done to death: He is no sooner
dead, but one <hi>Smerdis</hi> rebelled against <hi>Cambyses;</hi> with whom <hi>Cambyses</hi>
riding to encounter, as he gat upon his horse, his Sword fell out of his
sheath, and ran him through the Thigh, of which wound he dyed.</p>

               <hi>Gargoris Rex Curetum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Just. lib. 44.</note> begat a Son upon his own Daughter, and being
ashamed of so foul a fact, purposed to cause the child to be murthered.
First he willed him to be cast to wild beasts: The wild beasts contrary to
their kind, nourish him. Then he throweth him amongst hungry Dogs,
and such as he had caused many dayes to be kept of purpose from meat:
The Dogs likewise spare him. Next he exposeth him unto certain Hogs,
unto which there was no manner of Sustenance given in a long time: The
Hogs likewise do him no kind of harm. Then he willeth him to be thrown
into the Ocean Sea, whence he is cast upon the shore, and presently an
Hart giveth him suck. Lastly having lived a long time amongst a number
of Harts, until he could run as fast as they, he was taken in Nets by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93045:57"/>
Huntsmen, who presented him unto the King; by whom being
known, as well by the proportion of his body, as by certain marks given
him as soon as he was born, he is acknowledged and accepted for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
and in regard of so wondrous preservation from so many and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
perils and dangers, is also declared only heir of his Kingdom, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Atis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These examples although they may seem to be untrue, and incredible,
yet because they are strange and wonderful, and reported by such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
whose writings deserve no small credit, they may right well serve to
put us in mind, that whatsoever the eternal God hath decreed, it lies not in
our power to prevent or alter his determination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Astyages</hi> could command his daughter to marry with a mean man, he
had power to will the fruit of her womb to be destroyed, he might entreat
or enforce <hi>Harpagus</hi> to procure the Infants death; But after that he (mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with compassion) spared the childe, and committed the same unto
the custody and discretion of the Shepherd: <hi>Astyages</hi> authority, and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagus</hi>
commission expired, the Shepherd pitied the poor Infant, and it
pleased the Almighty (who had resolutely determined his greatness and
welfare) to suffer him to live, to the utter ruine and overthrow of the
Grandfather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amulius,</hi> as a wicked Usurper, intended to deprive <hi>Rhea</hi> of her right,
according to his purpose slew her father, and dedicated her to such a life,
as there was smal hope that from her should succeed any off-spring to spoil
and deprive him of his Royal Scepter: But God had fully resolved that
out of <hi>Rheas</hi> womb should proceed the scourge of her fathers iniquity,
and the founder of the Romans Majesty, and accordingly of her came
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus,</hi> who founded that worthy and famous City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambyses,</hi> dismayed with a dream, and fearing that his Brother would
shorten his days, and usurp his Crown, took the ordinary means that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
use to take in such occasions; but he had no sooner killed one <hi>Smerdis,</hi>
but another arose and rose against him, who did put him besides his royal
Diadem.</p>
            <p>Briefly, <hi>Gargoris</hi> thought by adjudging the Son which he begate upon
his own daughter, somtimes to one, and somtimes to another kind of
death, to have hidden his own shame, and to have debarred the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
from his right: But he that righteth all wrongs, and undertaketh the
defence of the innocent, would not have it to be so, would not suffer wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
to prevail, nor permit the guiltless blood to be destroyed.</p>
            <p>I may therefore infer by these examples, and by the rare fortune which
our gracious Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hath hitherto enjoyed, that it lieth not in the
ambitious Spaniard, nor in the proud Prelate of <hi>Rome,</hi> her mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
her sworn and professed adversaries, to shorten her days, but one
day, or one minute: Their wishes are on earth, but cannot ascend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
they may purpose, but not dispose, they have often desired, but
could never prevail; they have suborned many, but never found, nor
shall find any that shall be able to accomplish their desire; the Axe may
be layed to the root of the Tree, but it shall not have power to fell it; the
Lyon perhaps may go about to seek his prey, but he shall never find it;
the divel (as a divel) may provoke and procure his instruments to be ready
to further his attempts, but Gods Angels attending on her person, having
a care of her health, and a special charge of her safety, will not permit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93045:57"/>
divellish ministers to have the least power that may be over her.</p>
            <p>The Rule and Government of Women is rare; and <hi>omnia rara sunt
chara:</hi> Their Sex is weak, and the Almighty hath promised to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of the infirm and weak; Their capacity is not answerable to mans
policy; and the Lord hath said, that his elect shall not be confounded
with humane wisdom; he hath said, and we may swear, That heaven
and earth shall sooner perish, then his word shall fail. Why then do the
Princes rage? Why then do the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> fret and fume
against the Lords Anointed? Against his chsen Vessel? Against his dear
Virgin? Why the cause is the Lords, and he will try it, he will end and
determine it. Is it because she upholdeth and defendeth the Spaniards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and oppressed Subjects? Why, therefore she was ordained, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord preserveth her. Is it because she liveth in peace, and they in
wars? Why, the Almighty hath blessed the Peace-makers, and hath vowed
to be the Protector and Patron of as many as love peace. Is it because her
subjects rebel not against her, as theirs do? Why that is an express and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
sign of their evil, and her good Government. Is it because she
withstandeth their attempts and purposes? Why she medleth not with
their doings, but with such as tend to her hinderance; and those it is both
lawful and honourable for her to cross and prevent. Briefly, Is it because
the wisest Princes and Subjects of the world favour her more then them?
Why, that is because their actions are not in any respect equal or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto hers; for they pretend one thing, and intend another; her
thoughts and pretensions do alwaies agree together: They would seem
to love Peace, and yet dwell continually in wars; she seeketh peace and
embraceth it: They combine themselves, and employ their strength and
Forces against Christian Religion, she useth her power to no mans detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or destruction: Briefly, they do or would usurp more then belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto them, and she requireth no more then is her own. That such is her
mind, desire, and purpose is most apparent to all the world, because
when she might have had the Soveraignty and universal Government of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> she accepted it not; when she might have excluded the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
out of the possession of his rich and wealthy <hi>Indies,</hi> she deprived him
not of them; And when as her Forces are sufficient to disturb his whole
Realms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> she employeth them not to his disturbance:
But <hi>In magnis voluisse sat est:</hi> She hath assaulted the <hi>Indies;</hi> attempted
the conquest of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and assayed what her Forces could do in <hi>Spain:</hi>
It cannot be denyed but that her Majesty hath done as much,<note place="margin">The justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Queens attempts against <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </note> and perhaps
more, then is said; but not before she was provoked thereunto, neither
with a mind so much to prejudice the Spaniard, as to provide for her own
safety; For when Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> with such Forces as he and his friends
with a very slender help from her Highness, had provided, happily spoiled
part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and returned thence with no smal prey, if he had gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward somwhat sooner then he did, better furnished then he was, &amp; with
a larger commission then he had, al which lay in her Majesty to have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, undoubtedly either the season of the year, or the number of his ships
or the largenes of his Authority, would both have encouraged and also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him to have done those her Highness enemies much more and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
despight then he did. But as wise men going about a great piece of
work, and finding when they have begun the same, that their ability will
not serve to accomplish it, sit down and study what ways to take, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93045:58"/>
how to put those ways in execution, for the full perfection of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise:
So her Highness having so mighty an enemy as the Spaniard,
whose Attempts and purposes it was necessary (for her own security) to
cross and prevent. And finding that her Treasure was not comparable
to his wealth, especially seeing he attempted divers ways to annoy her,
and purposed to weary her with length of time, and variety of expences,
resolved with her self, that it could not be amiss to permit her loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to adventure some part of their wealth, and a small portion of her
own Treasure, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hope to bring from the <hi>Indies</hi> much more then they
carried thither: The which her Resolution being put in practise, found
the same event which was expected, and the sequel thereof sufficiently
declared; that a greater Navy well furnished with sufficient men, and good
store of Victuals and Munition, might then, and may yet, put her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in quiet possession of the richest and best part of the <hi>Indies:</hi> But it
sufficeth her Highness to try the Forces of those Countries; to acquaint
her Sea men and Souldiers with the way thither; to give them a taste of
the <hi>Indian</hi> wealth; and to make her power known as well unto the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of those remote Countries, as of other nearer Regions of the world,
who thought too basely of her strength, and carried too good a conceipt of
her Adversaries might and puissance; And finally, to fetch from her mortal
enemies own Dominions some Treasure wherewith to withstand the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
and extremity of his malice.<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 10.</note> In which Action her Majesty fully and
wisely imitated the example of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who fearing that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pope
<hi>Iulius</hi> the second would war upon them for consenting unto that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
which divers Cardinals, with the consent and furtherance of the French
King and other Princes, had summoned against him; and thinking it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to defray the charges of Wars, moved in defence of <hi>Church-men,</hi>
with Church goods; seized upon so much of the Clergies goods as they
thought would suffice for the maintenance of those Wars: Even so her
Highness hearing that the Spaniard had a long time prepared to invade
her Realm, and being well assured, that as soon as he could be well able
he would send the same preparation towards <hi>England;</hi> held it expedient
and necessary to seek all means possible whereby she might happily be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to maintain either all, or part of the Expences of those Wars with
his Treasure; And having learned of men of great experience what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would suffice to effect her desire and purpose, thought it superfluous
and needless to send thither greater strength then they (not unadvisedly)
required; And albeit neither her Majesty nor the Lords of her privy
Council were ignorant that the <hi>Indians</hi> were far stronger then when they
were first conquered; And therefore that such a Navy as was first sent
thither could not work the like effect there; yet both her Grace and they
thought it not meet to employ any more of her own, or of her Merchants
Ships in that service, lest that the Spanish Fleet (which was expected in
<hi>England</hi> many years before it came) coming upon her Realm in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and his Consorts, should not have found the
same sufficiently provided to make such resistance as was needful: For as
it sheweth courage in a Prince to give the first on-set upon his enemies
within his own Dominions;<note place="margin">Machiavel in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon Tit. Livius.</note> so it argueth want of discretion and wisdom
to assault his adversaries with such force and power, as if the enemy in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
thereof invade his Realm, there should not be found at home, an
Army sufficient to withstand his Invasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93045:58"/>
Now as touching her Majesties Attempt made against <hi>Portugal</hi> and
<hi>Spain;</hi> The manner thereof is not unknown unto the world, the cause
is notorious, and the success is not hidden nor secret: For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Anthony
Wingfields,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Doylies</hi> Books; the one in English, the other in

truly, so fully, and so plainly, as I shall not need to say any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
especially having already touched his Right at large, for whose cause,
and at whose instance the Voyage was undertaken: But because the said
Books make but a plain and true Narration of the Journey, and of the

think it will not be denyed, but that what help soever was, or shall be

or to take away his goods from him. The same proceedeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with us in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> and provideth that if a man be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
and others stand by, and help him not, they are held for parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the violence that is offered unto him; and if a man be robbed upon
the high-way, and Hue and Cry be not made presently after the Theeves,
the Town, Village, or Hamlet, which presently pursueth not the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
shall answer whatsoever is taken from the party that is robbed.</p>
            <p>The reasons of this Law are many. First it is expedient for the Common-wealth
to conserve the lives and goods of the Subjects thereof; then
there should neither be <hi>Meum</hi> nor <hi>Tuum,</hi> if this Law did not take place.
Next, the first and especial cause of assembling Societies together, and of
making and fortifying Villages, Towns, and Cities, was a desire and
care which men had to live together in safety, as well of their Goods, as
of their persons. Lastly, nature detesteth unlawful violence, desireth
the conservation of her Creatures, tendreth their welfare, and hateth the
Procurers of her harm and detriment, and therefore provided Princes
that should minister Justice unto all men indifferently, defend the innocent
valiantly, maintain their Subjects in peace continually, and duly inflict
condigne punishment upon the breakers and perturbers of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.
Now because Justice loseth her name and majesty unless a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Equity be observed in the administration and exercise thereof,
as private mens security is regarded and tendred in Justice, so the Law
must likewise have the indempnity, safety and commodity of Superiors,
Magistrates, and Princes in recommendation, otherwise they should be
in far worse case then their own Subjects are: For, the wrongs that are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93045:59"/>
done unto them, are righted by their Magistrates; and therefore it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with good reason, that some provision be made, and some care had
for the reformation of such injuries as are offered to the Kings and Princes.
If a Subject be thrust out of possession of his proper Inheritance, the Law
provideth that he shall be presently restored thereunto. And if a king
be wrongfully driven out of his kingdom, shall not he be allowed to seek
a restitution thereof? He shall, but how? Forsooth at his hands who
hath deprived him; but what if the Usurper will not yeild to his petition?
he is then to implore the help of other Princes, and they on his behalf are
to pray and admonish the Usurper to make restitution of all that he detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
wrongfully; whereunto i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he shall not hearken after due admonition
given unto him, they may (<hi>junctis viribus</hi>) invade his Realm, and by
main force inforce him to restore whatsoever he with-holdeth unjustly. For
this charge lay upon the Emperours, as long as they were of sufficient
force and authority to command and controll the Kings of this world:
But now that the Imperial Majesty is somewhat abated, and Kings have
freed and emancipated themselves from the Emperours power and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
it remaineth as part of the charge of Kings, to see that no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be
offered unto their Colleagues, and especially unto their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.
Therefore it is usual amongst Princes to enter into Alliance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with express conditions to take the Enemies each one of the other
for their own Enemies, and not only to defend their own Estates against
all men whatsoever, but also to offend him, whatsoever he be that shall
attempt any thing to their prejudice; and there is nothing more common
then to see Princes oppressed to fly for aid unto the Oppressors Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and to receive help and succour from them.</p>
            <p>They therefore are highly commended which receive and harbour a
distressed Prince,<note place="margin">That it is lawful for a prince to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince flying unto them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note> and they contrarywise worthy of perpetual shame and
infamy, which either refuse to receive such an one, or after his receipt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him any manner of wrong or violence; because as to adde affliction
unto the afflicted is a point of great Inhumanity; so to comfort the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortless
is a work of singular Justice and Lenity. The commendation due
to this kind of courtesie hath wrought so strange effects in the hearts of
many Princes, that some have received their professed Enemies, others
have fallen out with their dearest friends, rather then they would restore a
poor Prince being fled unto them for succour, when he was demanded at
their hands; some have refused great rewards which have been offered
them for the restitution of such as lived in exile and banishment within their
Territories, others have entertained them with large yearly Pensions, and
presently aided them for the recovery of their Kingdomes; some have
given them whole Cities to dwell in, others have been so forward in relei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such as implored their help, that they have lost their own Kingdoms
for defending them.</p>
            <p>It is written in the Histories of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh having

of <hi>France</hi>(who was his eldest son) banished him out of his Realm,<note place="margin">Du Haillan lib. 24.</note> and
commanded that none of his Subjects or Friends should receive him: The
Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (who was then Vassal unto the French King, and
mortal Enemy unto the Dolphin) did not only receive him, but also
gave him leave to chuse what Castle, Hold, or City of his soever he
would to dwell in: and sent presently Embassadours to his Father to make
his excuse for receiving him.</p>

Our Chronicles and other Histories are full of a number of the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
confirming the equity, and commending the clemency and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
of such Princes as have yeilded competent relief to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
to their enemies, to their Allies, and to meer strangers, being
enforced to crave their aid and assistance. But hoping that these will suffice
to satisfie and resolve you, I will forbear to enlarge this discourse
with the supersluous and needless recital of others.</p>
            <p>It is commonly said that troubles come in post, and depart by leisure;
And who so seeketh unquietness shall easily find it, and therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the displeasure that is done to the adversary of him that is received
into another Kings Realm and protection, the danger which the Receiver
may incure, and the manifest wrongs which are sometimes done unto the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93045:60"/>
Receiver by the received, together with their most unkind and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Ingratitude; this kinde of charitie, is sometimes termed crueltie; this
pity, peril, this favour extream folly, and this compassion a passion not
agreeable to reason and Princely policy. Some Princes therefore weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the perils that may follow the receiving of such Guests, or the aiding
of Princes who were expelled or banished from their own Dominions,
would neither receive them, nor succour them, unless they were well
rewarded for their labour; to the end that such a reward might recompence
the costs and charges which do necessarily depend upon the harbour and
relief which is given unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexis,</hi> sometimes Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> being deprived of his Empire,
could not obtain any manner of aid from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Marquess of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> until he had faithfully promised to
pay the <hi>Venetians</hi> debts,<note place="margin">Biondo lib. 16.</note> to recompence with so much ready money the
harms which the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had sustained by the Emperour <hi>Emanuel,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Macrinus,</hi> having slain the Emperour <hi>Bassianus,</hi> enjoyed the Empire;
and his Son <hi>Antoninus Heliogabalus</hi> lived a long time in exile, until his
Mother <hi>Messa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Piero Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xias vide Macrino.</note> by great gifts and extraordinary liberality, won the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and his best Captains and Colonels, to acknowledg
him for the true and indubitate Heir of the Empire; and in regard
thereof, and of the duty of the young child (whom for his Fathers sake
they quickly affected) to deprive <hi>Macrinus</hi> of his usurped Diadem, and
Imperial Authority.</p>
            <p>Other Princes perhaps terrified with the perils that accompany and attend
upon the harbouring of such distressed Princes, when they have once
received them, either restore them to their enemies, or detain them as
lawful Prisoners, or cause them to be secretly murthered.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Alarick,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So briefly did <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth King of <hi>England,</hi>

King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> prisoner many years, who flying from the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
persecution of his Uncle, who had deposed his Father, and usurped
the Crown, was driven by tempest into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Examples varying much from the former; And these Princes
observing a quite contrary course unto that which the before-named
Kings observed, maketh this question very doubtful; Whether it be
lawful and commendable in Princes to receive and harbour another Prince
who flyeth unto him for succour: But if humanity deserveth always more
commendations then cruelty; if it be true that the Poet saith.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:93045:60"/>
Turpius ejicitur, quam non admittitur Hospes.</q>
            <p>If Princes were first ordained and instituted to yeild relief to as many
as were distressed; If God most commonly blessed them who yeilded
such relief, and contrariwise punished those who exercised no kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
towards them. Briefly, if wiser Princes have received them then
have rejected them, this doubt is easily dissolved, and this difficulty quickly
removed.</p>
            <p>Now that humanity which is incident unto men, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cruelty, which is proper unto bruit beasts, is a thing so apparent to
common sense, that I hold him for senseless that doubteth thereof; and
what is he who blameth him not for incivility, who having received his
friend into his house, and being very well able to relieve him, excludeth
him without any occasion of discontentment offered by him: Or who is
so ignorant, that knoweth not there is nothing more answerable unto the
principal cause and motive of the first institution of Kings, then it is to
succour as many as have need of their help: And our Chronicles do testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that God plagued the posterity of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, for his extremity
used unto the poor distressed Prince of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the French Histories
do declare, that God never prospered <hi>Lewis</hi> sirnamed <hi>Oultremer,</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> because he had dealt discourteously and unkindly with the Infant
<hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. Walsing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi>
               </note> whom he had received into his safe custody
and protection: And to be short, the wisdom of those Princes who have
harboured their Neighbours and Allies,<note place="margin">Du Haillan.</note> are commended beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
by the Writers who mention them; whereas their folly is reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their cruelty blamed, who rejected those of whom I lately made
mention, and all histories shall sooner perish, then their infamy be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
But to reconcile the contrarieties of the precedent examples, and
to clear the difficulty of this question, I think it not amiss to descend from
the general argument to a particular supposition; for so the controversie
will soon be determined: Suppose therefore (for example sake) that the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> being in fast League of friendship together,
there ariseth a variance betwixt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarra;</hi> from
this variance they fall to wars, of these wars follow the overthrow of the
Navarrois; after that overthrow he flyeth unto the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:
May the Spanish King in this case receive and harbour him? To this
demand it is not possible to make a good and an absolute answer, unless
the cause of the Wars betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarra,</hi> and the kind of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> be well and sufficiently known; for, the
nature and quality of the one and the other, may make the receipt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the <hi>Navarrois</hi> lawful or unlawful: If the French King had
just occasion to war against the <hi>Navarrois,</hi> because he was wronged by
him, or by some of his; and the League betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> bound
the Kings of both places not to receive one anothers enemies, but that the
one should hold him for his foe, which was, or is adversary to the other.
Then doubtless except the King of <hi>France</hi> of his part had first committed
some Act contrary and repugnant unto the conditions of the Alliance,
whereby the same was broken and violated, the Spaniard could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
receive the <hi>Navarrois:</hi> But contrarywise, if the aforenamed Wars
were unjust, and the League not so streight as Alliance, which are both
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93045:61"/>
offensive and defensive are, then might the Spaniard without breach of
his duty harbour the <hi>Navarrois,</hi> especially if the French King had before
the receipt violated the conditions of the League; for as Bonds and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
betwixt private men tye not the Obligee to other things then are
mentioned in the conditions; so Leagues betwixt Princes, do not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
them to do any thing that is not expresly or by implication forbidden
by the Articles of those Leagues.</p>
            <p>Besides (as the world is now adayes) Leagues are of no longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
then there is some profit or commodity arising or proceeding from
them,<note place="margin">That leagues are no longer inviolable then until there is some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage given to break them.</note> and as soon as the breach of them may be certainly and assuredly
profitable and advantagious unto the breaker, they are not so religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed as they have been in times past, but some colour or other is
presently pretended to justifie their unlawful violation. You have heard
what a strait League was concluded betwixt the French King and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi>
King of <hi>Spain</hi> touching the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and also what
occasion was taken to break the same, as soon as <hi>Gonsalvo</hi> (surnamed the
great Captain) had the French General at an advantage. But I think I
have not as yet acquainted you with the colour and pretence which was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to excuse the breach thereof; the which, because it now cometh fitly
to the purpose, I purpose to declare unto you.</p>

<hi>Naples,</hi> being equally divided (as you have heard) betwixt the two
Crowns, alledged for their excuse, that amongst other Articles of their
League and Agreement this clause was inserted: That they should not be
bound to any thing that might be prejudicial unto the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
that therefore the Pope having required them, as Sovereign Lord of that
Kingdom, to succour the distressed Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> they could do
no less, but yeilded unto his request, and with this Cautele, contrary to
their former promise made unto the French King, the said King and
Queen entred into confederacy and league against <hi>France,</hi> with the Pope,
with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and with the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferara</hi>
would not openly enter into this League, but cunningly, and with an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
devise and subtilty, he suffered his Son to serve the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi>
as his Lieutenant General with 150 men at Armes. A few more Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

of this question, and therefore I will afford you some such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

was fastened unto this condition, that as soon as the one or the other
dyed, the Subjects of neither of them should be tyed any longer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
adding further, that it stood not with policy to admit a Stranger to
bear rule and government over them. The examples are infinite that
might be alledged to this purpose, but these few may suffice to shew the
proneness and ready good will of Princes to falsifie their Faith, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
the breach thereof with some reasonable shew and pretence, when
they found it not commodious or convenient for them to hold every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and Article of their Agreements: Now having seen by this that
hath been said already, that Leagues are lightly broken, it resteth for the
better strengthening of my purpose, that I declare unto you by such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
as shall presently come unto my memory, what occasions one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
hath taken to be offended with another, and how upon such occasions
offered, of great friends they have become mortal enemies. For hereby you
shall see (that since Princes are most commonly led and ruled by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
insomuch that they hold all things to be well done, which (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apparently unjust or dishonest) are done by example) that our Queen
notwithstanding the ancient continuance of the League that hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> of which the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> pretendeth himself to be lawful Heir,<note place="margin">Princes for lawful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions may, &amp; have bin offended with their confederates and leave them.</note> may most lawfully
fall from the same, and by many and infinite Presidents justifie the receipt
of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the aid given unto him. I find many causes
in such Histories as I have read, which have moved princes who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
together in a very straight League of Amity and Friendship, to fall
at variance, and either to war one upon another, or to associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
each one with the Foes and Adversaries of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> although the Romans were in League with the people
which were anciently called <hi>Lingones,</hi> yet he held them, yea and used
them as Enemies, because they aided the <hi>Helvetians</hi> (which are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Swizzers</hi>) with corn and other provision. Other Princes have taken
occasion of offence against their Allies and Confederates, because they
have fallen to Agreement with their common Enemies and Adversaries
without their consent of privity.</p>
            <p>So was Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the fourth highly displeased with <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King
of <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Illeseas vida de Sexto 4.</note> because he not making him privy thereunto, had agreed all
matters of variance and controversie betwixt himself, and <hi>Laurence de
medicis,</hi> and the City of <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So did <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth of <hi>France</hi> justly complain of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the
second,<note place="margin">Idem vida de Julio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> because at what time <hi>France</hi> stood in most need of him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the differences betwixt the Church and their common Enemies;
and for this injury offered unto him, published bills and books of greivous
complaints against him, saying that he was worthy to be deprived of his
Popedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93045:62"/>
               <hi>Illescas</hi> in the life of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth,<note place="margin">Idem vida de Leon. 10</note> reporteth, That the <hi>Venetians</hi>
being in League with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> against the <hi>French</hi> King, departed
from their Alliance with the Spaniard, and allied themselves with the
French King, for no other occasion but because <hi>Prospero Colona,</hi> one of
the Captains of the Spanish Army, did not presently give unto them <hi>Bres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
which he had taken from the French King, and should (as it seemed)
have been restored unto the <hi>Venetians</hi> as soon as it was taken. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it falleth out that many occasions meet at one time to move a Prince
to relinquish and leave the side and party of his confederate:<note place="margin">Idem ibid. Paulus Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius. l. 26.</note> Many causes
enforced Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth to leave the French King, and to join with
<hi>Charls</hi> the fifth. First his unsatiable desire to recover <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi>
The pity he took of <hi>Italy,</hi> to see what misery it endured under the French.
Thirdly, The good will he had to gratifie the Emperor for the great love
which he shewed at the Diet holden at <hi>Wormes,</hi> unto the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Fourthly, his indignation and displeasure conceived against <hi>Monsieur
Lotreth,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> because he did not only molest and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the poor <hi>Millanois,</hi> with a thousand vexations and grievances, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
gave all the Benefices, Bishopricks, and other Ecclesiastical Livings,
within the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> without the Popes leave and licence; And
further, because he had had given commandment that no man should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon any Citation sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor should go thither to follow
any Suit or Process begun or moved there. And lastly the remembrance
of those injuries which were done by the King of <hi>France</hi> unto his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and especially unto <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Laurence de Medicis,</hi> his Father and
his Brother.</p>
            <p>Here you see the Pope (whom the rest of <hi>Italy</hi> most commonly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
partly moved with a just hatred against the Frenchmen; and partly
fearing their overgrowing power in <hi>Italy;</hi> to prevent the hateful increase
of their greatness, leaveth them, and joyneth himself unto their enemies.
Now you shal see another Pope,<note place="margin">Idem vida de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 7.</note> named <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh, and with him
also the <hi>Venetians,</hi> finding that <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth (with whom <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth
allied himself against the French King) yeildeth not, accordingly as he
was bound, the investiture of the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> unto <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi>
who promised to give him for the same six hundred thousand Ducates,
and to marry with whomsoever it should please him; and also to hold
the Dukedom at his devotion; And further, conjecturing by the on-set
which he gave upon <hi>France,</hi> and by the great Power and Authority which
he had even then in <hi>Italy,</hi> that he went about to make himself Lord of
the most part of the world; And seeing that <hi>Francis</hi> the first, King of
<hi>France,</hi> had lately won <hi>Milan</hi> from the said Emperour, they entred into
League with the French King against <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, as secretly as they
might possible: You have heard before how <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, taking the
kindness shewed unto him by the Emperour, at the Diet of <hi>Worms</hi> very
kindly, was moved thereby to leave the French party, and to become
one of the Emperours Faction.</p>
            <p>Now you shall hear how Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Idem de Paulo. 3.</note> having the Cardinal
<hi>Farnesius</hi> for his Embassadour with the said Emperour, and finding that
his Majesty had proclaimed a Diet to be held at <hi>Wormes,</hi> touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
of certain matters and controversies of Religion, took it in so evil a
part: that the Emperour would intermeddle with the hearing of spiritual
causes, the cognizance whereof belonged unto the Pope; that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93045:62"/>
the said Cardinal to depart from the Emperors Court without taking
leave of his Majesty, and to leave the Cardinal <hi>Marcello Corvino</hi> in his
place; which was an indignity never offered unto any Prince, unto whom
either the Embassadour or his Majesty bear any love or affection. This
evil conceit of the said <hi>Paulus Tertius</hi> towards the same Emperour was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by three special Causes.</p>
            <p>The first because the Emperour to strengthen himself against the above
named French King, had lately entred into League and Alliance with
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> who was then fallen from that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which the See of <hi>Rome</hi> looked for at his hands.</p>
            <p>The second because <hi>Caesar</hi> had so quickly forgotten the wrong done
unto his Aunt, lately divorced from the same King.</p>
            <p>The third because the Emperor would neither sell unto him the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Milan,</hi> nor make his Son <hi>Pier Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might proceed in the recital of many other Examples like unto these,
but from these you may sufficiently gather, that the wisest, both Popes,
Emperors, and Kings, that ever lived of late years, have made it a matter of
small or no conscience to break their Leagues for very small occasions,
especially if they found that any King or Emperour, by reason of their
League, presuming to finde no resistance able to withstand his intent
and purpose, went about to incroach upon other Princes, and to make
himself Lord of the world: You may also perceive by the mutability and
inconstancy of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of their falling from <hi>France</hi> to
<hi>Spain,</hi> and again from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> how greatly they fear the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the one or the other in <hi>Italy,</hi> how ready they have been to
supplant him that waxeth great amongst them; and how careless, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and secure they are now, since they notwithstanding (not as their
predecessors always did before them) the aspiring Ambition of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.
Moreover these Examples may teach you what opinion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth; what jealousie and suspition other Princes had
of him, and what an high and aspiring mind he carryed; The which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left as an Inheritance to his Son, with a number of precepts forged
in so dangerous and ambitious a conceipt; no marvel though he do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
imitate his Father. But great marvel it is why the Princes of our
Age do not foresee and fear in him the same minde, the same desire, the
same ambition, and the same purposes which were in his Father. But
the more careless other Princes are herein, the more commendations our
Gracious Soveraign deserveth, who for better then these thirty five years
hath (as I have said often, and cannot say too often) mightily crossed his
endeavours without the help of any other that ever would vouchsafe to
joyn with her Majestie in so honorable an Action. Neither may it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to her Highness as a fault, that she hath forgotten the ancient league
which was betwixt the house of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and her Predecessors, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he amongst private men, is highly commended, who forsaketh his
dearest friends in their unjust causes, and when they go about to oppress
and overthrow their Neighbours, so her gracious Majestie is worthy of
everlasting praise and fame, because it hath pleased her Highness to prefer
the justice and equitie of good causes, before the iniquity of any League or
confederacie, Besides, since that the League (that was betwixt <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Burgundy</hi>) was (as it may be gathered by the Chronicles of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93045:63"/>
rather with the people subject unto the Princes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> then
with the Princes themselves, her Majestie continuing in Amitie with the
States and People of the United Provinces, and being ready to do the
like (if the like occasion were offered) with the other of the seventeen
Provinces, doth not any thing in the prejudice of the Antiquitie of that
League, but as her Predecessors have done before her, (as namely <hi>Edward</hi>
the third,<note place="margin">Holinshed. Pol: Virg. Du Haillan.</note> and <hi>Richard</hi> the second) her Majestie hath thought it meet and
convenient to stand with the poor and afflicted people against the unkind
and unnaturall crueltie and oppression of their Soveraign. The which
action being most commendable, and such as might be approved by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Examples; they do her Highness great wrong, who, not considering
the indignities, wrongs, and injuries done unto her by the late house of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and not remembring the first occasion of displeasure between the
Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to have risen from <hi>Spain,</hi> blame her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
as the first breaker of that ancient League. These men, besides
many other things which are already refuted, or remain to be fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
hereafter in their several and fit places, more maliciously then
wisely object unto her Majesty, that about the year 1569. her Ships inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
59 chests full of Ryals of <hi>Spain,</hi> amounting unto the sum and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of eight hundred thousand Ducats,<note place="margin">Dinothus de bello Belgico.</note> which were sent unto the Duke of
<hi>Alva</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> to pay his souldiers withal, the which wrong gave (as
they affirm) the first or greatest occasion of breach of amity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> For by the intercepting of this money
the Souldiers were disappointed of their pay, and the Kings credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was greatly impaired and weakened in the Low Countries. But
those men neither consider that <hi>Spain</hi> had long before this time offered
great wrong unto <hi>England,</hi> nor remember that when the Spaniard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
unto her Majesty hereof, that it was wisely and sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
That her Majesty understanding that the said money was sent
to pay certain debts of the Spanish Kings, which he owed unto divers
Merchants of <hi>Genova,</hi> who being well able to spare the same, and her
Highness having urgent occasion to use so much, thought she might be so
bold (as the Spaniard had been) to borrow the said money for a small
time, paying them (as he did) some yearly consideration for it: Which
Answer might well have contented the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> since the said Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
at no time had any cause why they should not credit her Highness
as well as him: Nor did they weigh the violent and extraordinary dealing
of the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> who as soon as he heard the news of the intercepting
of the said money, commanded all our English Merchants that were then
in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or elsewhere in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be detained as priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
seized upon their goods and Merchandizes, and willed that the English
house should be kept by a Guard of High-Dutchmen, and presently wrote
unto the King his Master to detain all our Merchants in <hi>Spain;</hi> and further,
knowing that there were divers English Ships in <hi>Zeland,</hi> laden with Cloth
and other Merchandize of great worth and value, he caused them likewise
to be stayed, and neither they, nor our Merchants in <hi>Brabant, Flanders,
Zeland</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> were dismissed before the king of <hi>Spain</hi> was fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
which might easily be done; the very Cloth it self which was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of <hi>England</hi> into those Countries, being almost worth the sum
that was pretended (God knoweth how truly) to be taken away from the
Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niard: For although we should grant that this money was wrongfully
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93045:63"/>
taken and detained by her Majesty; yet the order which the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
took for the recovery thereof, was not to be justified: He ought first
to have acquainted his Master with the taking thereof; Then an Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
should have been sent from him into <hi>England</hi> to demand restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof: And lastly, if her Grace had denied the restoring of the
same, or not sufficiently satisfied the taking of it, the course which was
taken had not been amiss: But here the Cart went before the Horse, and
judgment was given before the Cause was heard. Now because our
Merchants lived quietly in the Low Countries, as well before as after the
taking of this money, because they enjoyed their Priviledges as largely as
ever they did; because we had daily Traffique with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Kings
Embassadours remained then and many years after in <hi>England;</hi> (All
which are Arguments and probable Conjectures, that there was peace
betwixt us and <hi>Spain</hi>) the intercepting of this money will still seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
unless it be shewed that the Spaniard hath given her Majesty some
just occasion of discontentment before the time of taking thereof. Truly
it cannot be denied that our Merchants had Traffique (as it is said) in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and elsewhere under the Spanish Dominions; but not for any
love to our Prince or Nation, but in regard of the great benefit that they
brought unto the King and to his Countries, which could not well stand
or at the least wise (as late experience hath shewed) flourished as they did
without them: Witness the misery of <hi>Antwerp</hi> at this present; the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Burges,</hi> and the calamity of many other Towns, both in <hi>Brabant,</hi>
and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which as long as they were haunted and frequented by
Englishmen, yeilded to few Towns and Cities of Christendom for wealth
and prosperity. Witness again <hi>Middleboroug, Vlushing, Amsterdam</hi> and
other Towns in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> which before the departure of our
Englishmen from those Towns which are now under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and before their Traffique in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> had not the tenth part of
the wealth or resort of Merchants thither, which they have at this present;
in so much that many Towns in these two Provinces are of late years
made larger, yea twice as big as they were wont to be. Witness lastly,
the great wealth, power and strength which the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
are grown unto since they have cast off the yoke of Spanish Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Government, entred into strait League with our most gratious
Queens Majesty, and hath had Traffique with her loving Subjects; for
which the small aid which they have had from us (small indeed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of their great charges) and with the yearly Revenues which they
gather by the resort of Merchants thither; it is seen of late that they are
become so mighty, as that for provision of Wars, for strength by Sea,
for Munition, for all kind of furniture for Wars, both by Sea and Land,
and especially by Sea, they may almost compare with the mightiest
Prince in the world. Have they not of late years boarded the Spaniard?
did they not when he sent his Invincible Army into <hi>England,</hi> stand us in
great stead? Have they not won many Towns which were lost and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
in the time of the late Earl of <hi>Leicesters</hi> being there, when they had
far greater help and countenance by us then they have had of late? Briefly,
have they not, and do they not carry themselves so of late years, that it
may not only grieve the Spaniard, but also all the Princes of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that he hath given them so just and good occasion to know and to
use their own strength. For, if the chiefest Towns of <hi>France,</hi> which are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93045:64"/>
grown to such an humor and liking of encantonizing themselves, as it hath
been thought meet to publish many reasons in print to shew the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
and difficulties which they should incurre and find in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
if I say, these Towns should enter into consideration of the wealth
and prosperity of the said States and their Subjects, and after due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their happiness, follow their examples; and so in time cast off
the yoke, servitude, and obedience, which time out of mind they have
owed, and most dutifully shewed unto their Kings; would it not be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill president, a dangerous imitation, and a most pernicious example?
Should not other Princes have just cause to suspect and fear the like
change and alteration in their kingdomes? And were it not greatly to be
doubted and feared, that other Subjects would be as ready, as forward,
as desirous as they of liberty, of alteration, and of a new kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Nay, was there not a time, when almost at one time all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Europe,</hi> not seeing so much as they may now see, jumped so well
in one desire to free themselves from their subjection unto Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as that all Kings and Princes were enforced to joyn together in
strength and in good will to suppress them? The danger therefore of this
inconvenience only, being well and wisely considered, all the Princes of
<hi>Europe</hi> have great occasion to be offended with the Spaniard, who by his
unjust severity hath in some manner endangered all their States and royal
Principalities. But hereof more conveniently hereafter in another place.</p>
            <p>Now again to my purpose. The Subjects of the United Provinces
travell dayly into <hi>Spain,</hi> they carry thither and fetch thence many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
they only abstain from carrying and bringing of things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and profitable for the maintenance of Wars. May any man, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the premises, and seeing how they and the Spaniards fight dayly one
against another at home, and within their own Countries, say truly that
there is no War betwixt them? No verily, it is not the entercourse of
Merchants, nor the residence of Leaguers and Embassadours that alwayes
proveth peace betwixt Princes: The one is permitted and entertained for
commodities sake, and for the benefit of the Subjects on both parts, yea,
for the better maintenance of the Wars: And the other is used and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for his great advantage, whose Embassadour can carry himself most
wisely and most cunningly. for Embassadours are (as <hi>Phil. de Comines</hi>
said very well) but honourable Espies, and therefore it is usual to let
them remain and reside in Princes Courts, not only after the rupture and
breach of peace, but also sometimes when they are at mortal Wars, that
they may be Mediators of peace. Send therefore saith <hi>de Comines,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
unto thine Enemies, even when thou art at most deadly feud
with them: For, though thy charges in sending be great, and thy Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
be wary and circumspect in foreseeing they shall do nothing to their
prejudice; yet if those whom thou sendest be wise, they cannot chuse but
learn somthing that may be very beneficial unto them, and countervail
their expences, The reading of Histories hath taught me, that Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
are sent from one Prince to another even in the hottest times of their
Wars, sometimes to demand a convenient place of parley.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Caesar</hi> sent unto his enemy <hi>Ariovistus</hi> to require him to appoint some<note place="margin">Czsars Commen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
convenient place where they might meet and confer of matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the profit of himself,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> and of <hi>Ariovistus;</hi> sometimes to require and
offer conditions of peace. So <hi>Divito</hi> was sent Embassadour unto <hi>Caesar</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93045:64"/>
to desire peace at his hands: sometimes to spie and sound the affections of
Subjects. So <hi>Hannibal</hi> when he was coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> sent certain Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
unto the French King, being then subject unto the Romans,
to enquire of their affections, and to see how they might be disposed and
perswaded o suffer him to pass the <hi>Alpes</hi> quietly, and to behold where he
might pass them with least danger. But I shall have occasion to handle
this matter more largely hereafter. And therefore from it again to my
purpose.</p>
            <p>The taking of the fore-mentioned money is the matter that is most urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">That the intercepting of the Spaniards money sent many years ago into Flanders gave him no just cause of quarrel against <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> and therefore must be more sufficiently answered. This is the sore
that gauleth, the wound that grieveth, the corro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive that groweth. To
this therefore I will adde another Plaister. It shall not suffice that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
intercepted was taken and esteemed not to be the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> but
to belong unto certain Merchants of <hi>Genoa;</hi> that Allegation shall not go
for sufficient and lawful payment; but it shall be added, yea and proved
(for an Embassadour was sent by her Majesty into <hi>Spain</hi> of purpose) that
her Highness complained unto the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of the great wrong that
was done by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> unto her Majesty and unto her Subjects
upon an unjust occasion of displeasure taken against her Grace and them
for that money; which if the King (although it was certain it appertained
unto those Merchants) would needs have it, it was offered unto him by
the said Embassadour, that it should be restored, so that her Highness
Subjects might enjoy their ancient Liberties and Priviledges within the
Spanish Dominions, and also a restitution might be made by the Duke of
<hi>Alva</hi> for all that was wrongfully detained from them: And the same
Embassadour added further, that it was never her Majesties mind to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Catholick king, nor to provoke him to wrath and anger, whose
Friendship the knew might be a great help and honour unto her. What
might her Majesty have said more lovingly? or what better satisfaction
could the king of <hi>Spain</hi> demand? Was he displeased because her Majesty
gave no better audience unto the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> his Secretary, who was
sent to admonish her Majesty not to meddle with any matter belonging to
his Master? Why, his cross and rash dealing deserved no favour at her
hands, and made his Masters Subjects fare far worse then otherwise they
should have done in <hi>England.</hi> For her Highness hearing that the Duke
had made stay of her Merchants, and of their Goods, to be even with him,
commanded that all the Merchants strangers that then lived in <hi>England,</hi>
and were Subjects to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> should likewise be arrested, and
their Goods attached; and strait Commandment was given unto our
Merchants, that they should forbear to traffique into any place subject unto
the Spanish Dominion, until the Kings pleasure was fully known what
should become of our Merchants. Here you see that the unordinary and
unkind proceeding of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> was occasion of greater unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
then should have proceeded of so small a matter: For, if he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
to arrest our Merchants, and to attach their Goods, until his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
pleasure had been known, his Kings Embassadours had had better
audience, and his Subjects had been free from inconveniences and harms,
as they suffered by his default. For after he had rashly and unadvisedly
layed hands upon our Merchants and their Merchandizes, her Grace
could do no less then she did, especially since the Lawes of her Realm
have provided, that her Subjects being restrained, in the like manner shall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93045:65"/>
have recourse unto her Highness, as unto her chief Justice, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that the Subjects of a forraign Prince who hath offered wrong or
violence unto them and their Goods, be presently attached in <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
our Merchants and their Goods be released and set at liberty by that
Prince: So the blame in this case must lye upon the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who
when this occasion of rupture and variance was growing betwixt our
Queen and his King, should have wisely dissembled the same, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have extinguished the flames of the displeasure and discontentment that
was likely to burn betwixt them.</p>
            <p>For a Servant and Counsellor may offend as well in being too forward,
as in being too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low in his Masters business, as I shall have occasion to
shew more at large hereafter; the which when I shall handle, will give
light unto this matter, and fully and throughly cleer the same. Now to
the proof that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did before the intercepting of this money,
give her Majesty just occasion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eize upon the same, and to detain it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it had been much more then it was, for her own use and benefit.
It is since the taking of this money some four and twenty years agoe, and
therefore if it may be proved that long before that time the Spaniard hath
dealt more like an enemy then a friend with her Majesty; I think it will
follow that she might justly have done him, even then, and before then,
far greater despight then ever she did.</p>
            <p>When the late French King suffered the Duke of <hi>Alencon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dinothus de bello Belgico.</note> his Brother
to take upon him the Title of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the defence of
those Countries, he sent an Embassadour into <hi>Spain</hi> to excuse his Brothers
going thither, and to signifie unto the Spanish King that all that was there
done was done without his Counsel and Privity; The Spanish King was
highly displeased with this Message, and answered the Embassadour, that
he had rather have the French King a profess'd enemy, then a dissembling
friend; And not satisfied with the indignity of this disdainful Answer, he
sent presently after him another Embassadour into <hi>France,</hi> to tell the King
thereof; That the Spaniards were not so foolish and so unwise, as not to
see and perceive, that whatsoever the Duke of <hi>Alencon</hi> did, was done by
permission, counsel, consent, and furtherance of the King his Brother.
Out of this Answer, and this Embassage, I gather thus much: That it is
better for a Prince to have an open enemy, then a deceitful friend: And
to prove the Spaniard to have been always such a friend unto the State of
<hi>England,</hi> I use these Demon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trations.</p>
            <p>First, It is not unknown (as I have said before) all the Treasons and
Conspiracies which have been attempted, intended and practised against
her Majesty, ever since her first coming to the Crown, have had their
beginning or their comfort, their counsel or their furtherance, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
or their invention from <hi>Spain;</hi> Witness (to omit others of lesser
moment, and yet of most dangerous consequence) the Treasons of the
late Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> since whose death it is better then twenty years, and
more then forty since he first began to be a Traytor. Is it not more then
twenty one years ago that <hi>Robert Rudolphy, a Florentine</hi> Merchant (who
had lived many years in <hi>England</hi>) departed out of <hi>England,</hi> for fear that
the Duke being committed to prison, should reveal the practises and
means which he had used by the solicitation of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of
the Pope, to draw the Duke unto those Treasons which he afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and had executed, had he not been happily discovered? did not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93045:65"/>
the same <hi>Redolphy</hi> go from hence to <hi>Rome?</hi> and there communicated with
the Pope how the Duke was apprehended, and thereby their Plot and
device broken and prevented? Was he not sent from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi>
there to make the same relation, and to consult with the Spanish
king what means might be used for the liberty of the said Duke, and if
that might not be happily wrought and effected, for some other kind of
of annoyance to be done to <hi>England?</hi> Was it not publiquly noised, and
certainly beleeved, that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> should have joined with the
said Duke, and have done us more wo then I may boldly speak of, and my
heart can even without extream grief to relate or remember? Witness
again the most unnatural practises of the late Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> unnatural,
because she was a Queen as her Majesty was, because she was her neer kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and her Vassal beholding unto her Highness for her life, and
for the life of her own only child, which unto good and loving Parents is
always more dear then their own life. Lived not this unthankful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious,
and unfortunate Queen, more then twenty years prisoner in
<hi>England?</hi> and which of all those years lived her Majesty free from some
Treason or other? But hereof in another place.</p>
            <p>Now let it suffice that it is apparent to all the world that she had secret
Messengers, secret help and counsel from <hi>Spain,</hi> as well before as after
her Imprisonment, to animate, encourage, and set her forward in all her
mischievous endeavours and purposes against our gracious Sovereign,
and her Realms. Is not then the Spaniard a deceitful friend unto <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
Is he not then, by his own confession, more to be feared, and more
to be disliked then an open enemy? Or are not we so wise as the Spaniard,
to see and perceive such deceitful proceedings? and seeing them shall it not
not be lawful for us to think of him as he thought of the king of <hi>France?</hi>
and to deal so with <hi>Spain,</hi> as he dealt and dealeth with <hi>France?</hi> such
justice as a Magistrate useth unto others, such must he expect himself,
saith the Emperour <hi>Iustinian: He that seeketh dayly to increase his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
purchaseth to himself envy and batred;</hi> So Said <hi>Sabellicus, The Prince that
desireth Cities that are far off, cannot but covet those which are near at hand;</hi>
So said <hi>Leo Aretinus;</hi> and it is hard and difficult to beware of such friends
which secretly play the part of enemies; So said <hi>Dionifius Hallicarnesus.</hi>
If therefore the king of <hi>Spain</hi> hath nourished civil dissention in <hi>France;</hi>
if he hath been so ready to maintain the Rebels thereof against their King,
that rather then the Realm should be without troubles, he hath relieved
and succoured the very Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> and the heads of their
Faction against their Sovereign, and other their professed enemies: And
if he hath done all this to the end the French king might not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon him in <hi>Italy, Flanders,</hi> or any other of his Dominions: Why
may not our Queen, who as a woman is fearful, and timerous, and, as
a Prince ought to be, careful and provident for the safety of her Realm,
and of her Subjects, relieve the States of the United Provinces, being
her ancient friends and Allies, to the end that he Spaniard being busied
in those parts,<note place="margin">Dinothus de bello Belgico</note> may have no time, leisure, or commodity, to work any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of open or secret prejudice unto her Realm, and her Subjects? <hi>Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
a true Historiographer of the civil Wars <hi>in Flanders,</hi> reporteth, That
when the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Embassador said unto the late French King, that
it was neither seemly, nor convenient for his Majesty to receive the States
who were Rebels unto his Master; The French king Answered him,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93045:66"/>
that he neither received nor harboured them as Rebels unto his Master
but as men wrongfully oppressed; and that Christian Princes have always
used to grant and give help and succour unto the oppressed: And further
that the States had assured him, that they had oftentimes sent many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
unto their King, therein submiting themselves unto his mercy,
and humbly beseeching his Majesty to remit their offences, and to receive
them into his favour; yea, and when they might have any commodity,
they delivered themselves such supplication unto the Kings own hands, but
could never have any reasonable Answer from him. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was lawful for them to appeal from him that denyed them justice;
and to seek aid against him, where they might hope to find the same. If
then the king of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince of contrary Religion unto the States; a
Prince of as neer Alliance, and of later Affinity, unto the Spanish king,
then our Queen is; a Prince that in his own Realm could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Protestants, because he thought it very dangerous to suffer two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
in one Kingdom, held it the part of a Christian Prince to succour
the oppressed, and to be their Protector, unto whom justice was openly
denyed: Why should it be a fault imputed unto our Queen, that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
her oppressed neighbours, since she doth it not in malice towards
the Spaniards, but in mercy towards the afflicted; not so much to offend
him, as to defend them, not to enlarge her Dominions, but to preserve
her Realms and Subjects; for how can she think that the Spaniard desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not her Kingdoms, who sheweth many and manifest signs that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
the Rule and Empire of all the world? Why should she not envy
and hate him who seeketh to encrease his power, to the end he may be the
better able to annoy her? And how can she be too wary, too circumspect,
too wathful over such a friend (if he will needs be taken as a friend) who
watcheth and snatcheth, every little and great, secret, and coulourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
to play her the part of a deadly and a mortal enemy? Shall she take
him for a friend, that seeketh to murther her person, to estrange her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to destroy her Realms? The first, confirmed by the Treasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned: The second proved by the pernitious and detestable
Book published by Dr <hi>Allen,</hi> wherein he exhorteth, teacheth, and licens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her Subjects to rebel against her, and had for his labour a Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
procured by the Spaniard: The last lately verified, and manifested
by the hostile attempt and violence of his invincible Navy, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in seven years space, compounded of all Nations, and reported
to have conquered before it came to the place where it meant to conquer;
and yet by our Might, and the Almighties assistance, happily and speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquered.</p>
            <p>It is truly written, or wisely fained, That <hi>Hercules</hi> (a man exceeding
common mens stature; a man blessed with more then ordinary good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
a man of rare vertues, and of admirable force and strength) went
up and down the world walking with a mighty Club in his hand, and
wandring from place to place, only to subdue and chastise Tyrants; and
this true History, or wise Fiction, tendeth to no other purpose, is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for no other cause, but to signifie that oppression is hateful, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
hated; that affliction craveth compassion, and afflicted persons
are worthy of mercy; and that to subvert the one is laudable, and to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the other is lawful: Then if (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saith) other men
direct their counsels to things that they think may and will be profitable
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93045:66"/>
unto them; but Princes are and must be of another condition, because all
their actions must tend to the affectation and purchasing of Fame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown;
The Prince that succoureth the oppressed, and seeketh to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
the oppressor, worketh a deed of Charity, an action of Piety, a
work of commendation; and in working thereof, bendeth his counsels,
and directeth his actions unto the attaining of true honour and everlasting
fame: Then (if as <hi>Polibus</hi> saith) he that hath not compassion of other mens
harms, must not hope that any man shall have pity of his miseries; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
because there is <hi>quaedam rerum vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssitudo,</hi> and fortune was never at
all times favourable, although they be in the highest degree of felicity,
must not presume too much on their own good fortune, nor condemn those
that are in miseries, lest that if they chance to fall, no man will vouchsafe
to help them up again: Then if (as <hi>Thucidides</hi> saith) he is not only a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that enforceth his Subjects to live in bondage and servitude, but he
also that may withstand another mans violence, and do not withstand the
same: Princes which see their neighbours violently oppressed, and as idle
lookers on yeild them no manner of reliefe and succour when they may
conveniently help them, and in danger to be esteemed and reputed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
Then if (as <hi>Zenophon</hi> saith) it be not lawful to break faith with
him that falcifieth his word and promise; Princes that withhold not their
helping hands from the oppressed, because they have been and are in
League with the Oppressor, who hath violated his faith unto them, and
unto others, are not to be condemned of wrong and iniquity; Then if
(as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith) patience and long suffering of an injury maketh the
wrong-doer most commonly ashamed of his actions; the Prince that
cannot be intreated to leave off his wrong doing may well be ashamed
thereof; Then if (as <hi>Bartholomeus Facius</hi> saith) women-kind, the
weaker and more fearful it is, the readier it is to beleive any credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
her Majesty is not to be blamed for crediting the just complaints of
the oppressed States, unto which the late King of <hi>France</hi> did (as you
have heard) give open ear, and would (as it is credibly reported) have
vouchsafed sufficient relief, had he not been letted by domestical dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and wars, nourished and maintained of purpose by the Spaniard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he should not be able to yeild them relief and succor.</p>
            <p>Then though it belong unto private men to conserve and retain their
own, and unto Princes to contend and strive for other mens Goods (as
ambitious minds do affirm and desire) yet must they remember, that
the desire of Rule passeth all other affections; yet must they not forget
that some things resembling vertues are scant commendable, but rather
hateful and odious; as too too great and obstinate severity, and a mind
nothing flexible or relenting, at the sight, at the remembrance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans misery: Then though Princes be of power to begin Wars,
and to oppress their Subjects, yet ought they to consider that it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
expedient to do all that a man may or can do, that a wise man must
first try all other means, then use the tryal of Armes; that as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
to be valiant against the enemy, so it is praise-worthy to use
clemency and gentleness towards them that are meek and penitent, that
they which offend by force, and not of purpose, by constraint and not of
free-will, and use Armes for their liberty, and not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> malice, deserve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and not hard dealing, favour and not cruelty, life, and liberty, and not
death and servitude; Then to be short, if every one of these reasons shall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93045:67"/>
not be available unto the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the oppressed <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi>
yet let all avail her and them; so shall she and they be justified,
and the Spainiard condemned; so shall their and her actions be approved,
and his doings be reprehended; so shall no man have just occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
their and her prosperity, and all Princes good cause to fear and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his over-growing authority; so briefly shall it appear, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
unkind dealing deserveth no kindness of her Majesty, and that
although she hath hitherto spared him, yet she hath no occasion to favour
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im. And now I will make it appear, that not withstanding his many
Kingdomes and great power, it lay in her power long sithence to have
overthrown him. For if it had pleased her Highness to have sent great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
strength in <hi>Flanders</hi> then she did, and of late years to have aided the
United Provinces with huger Armies then she ever sent thither, those
Countries which are now partly in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s possession, and partly freed from
his bondage, had all before this time rejected him for their Lord, and
not any of them ever returned to his Subjection. But the fear which she
had of him and his power at home, the supplies which she sent into <hi>France,</hi>
and the upholding of her friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the repressing
of her Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> never gave her leave to bend her whole forces
against him in the Low Countries. True, and that is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
reasons why he hath by all means possible laboured to sow discord,
and to maintain factions in all and every one of the Countries, thereby
disabling them to send out any forces sufficient to annoy him, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her from using the uttermost of her power, to his prejudice; and yet,
to conclude this point, considering the weakness of these his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
by reason of their domestical divisions, and her Graces whole
strength, because her Realm is not divided, it cannot be denied that she
hath far better ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to abate his pride; and truly he that shall well look into his
State, such as it is, shall find that it is far different from that which it is
supposed to be: For, although he be Lord and King of many Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

<hi>Flanders,</hi> and to <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that he can hardly, upon an occasion of
great and most urgent extremity, bring ten thousand Spaniards together:
And although the benefit of the Camaradoes doth greatly help them,
their long and late experience maketh them most expert and cunning;
their military discipline containeth them in a very good order, and their
extraordinary rewards and stipends maketh them both serviceable and
very adventerous; yet neither can so small a number perform any matter
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great worth, neither was it ever seen, since the first Wars of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Countries
until this day, that being inferiour but by a few, nay being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
unto our men in number, they departed with the honour of the field,
neither can it be truly said, that our men being no choice men, but such
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93045:67"/>
as our Country can spare, and hath least need of, having had no long
time of experience, nor fighting for the Liberty of their own Country,
or the right of their Prince (which two things adde and put courage even
in men scant having any great stomack at all) did ever refuse to meet the
best trained and long experienced Spaniards in the field, and meeting
them in equal places, and in like number, they most commonly have
driven them to the worst, or made their party good enough with them;
and although the Spaniards for these few years (few I term them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they exceed not the memory of man) have had the name of great
Souldiers, yet if we consider with what people they have encountred, and
by what policies they have prevailed, they have not received the tenth
part of that honour and renown which they seem to challenge of just and
due desert; for the people with whom they have contended in all this
time, have been the unexperienced <hi>Flemmings,</hi> the careless <hi>Germans,</hi>
the unwarlike <hi>Italians,</hi> and the fierce and quickly fainting <hi>French-men.</hi>
The first sort by long practise are grown equal, and nothing inferior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; the second of late have holpe them to most of their victories;
the third by their own Writers are termed <hi>Infamia militiae;</hi> and the
fourth was in <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> time, and are still, in the beginning of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
more then men, in the end thereof less then women; neither may I
so much derogate from the <hi>Italians,</hi> or from the Frenchmen, but that I
must of necessity grant, that many of the Captains who have done the
Spanish King greatest service, have been <hi>Italians;</hi> and the unprofitable
Journies which <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth made divers times into <hi>France,</hi> with
full intention and assured hope to conquer the same; and also the late
dishonours received by the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and other his Lieutenants sent
into the same Realm, with a purpose and resolution to do much more
then was effected, do argue that the French-men yeild not greatly unto
them in valour or in discipline. Then if he cannot make an Army of
many natural Spaniards, and they when they are strongest, be it in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or experience, are easily to be matched, and many times over-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by men of less experience, practise and exercise then they, why shall
his natural strength be feared, which cannot be great, unless he will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnish
his Garisons, which were to overthrow himself, and to lose his
best and richest Countries? Or why should a Prince fear his mercenary
Souldiers, or hirelings? who fight no longer then they have money, and
when they are ready to go to the Battel, either abandon their Master for
want of pay, or fly to the enemy in hope of reward; or when they are in
the conflict, behave themselves cowardly, faintly, and so indifferently,
that if they might be assured of their lives, they would hardly strike one
stroke. This is briefly his power.</p>
            <p>Now to his Wealth.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied that his Revenues far exceed the Revenues of any
Christian Prince whatsoever.<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard is not so wealthy as he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be.</note> It must likewise be granted, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

supposed that his credit with Merchants is able at any time to supply his
wants, if he should chance to stand in need: But his States being most of
them gotten (as you have heard) by conquest; or distracted (as you see)
by division; they must needs (as all such States do) put him to so great
charges, as the comings in will hardly serve to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93045:68"/>
by the Sea, part is intercepted by us, and all that is brought home,
doth not suffice to maintain his Wars. His credit is not in any measure
answerable to the conceit and opinion that is had of it.</p>
            <p>For first, It hath been published in French Discourses, Printed many
years since; that he oweth more money to the Merchants of <hi>Genoa</hi> alone,
then ever he shall be able to pay; And I can shew, whensoever it shall
please you to require the fight thereof, a Letter written better then sixteen
years ago unto him by his Secretary <hi>Escovedo,</hi> and intercepted by the
States, wherein he signifieth unto him, That his credit would not serve,
(the which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> affirmeth by another Letter unto his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Majesty) to take up any more money upon the <hi>Bourse at Antwerp,</hi>
because the Merchants would first be paid that which then was owing
them, before they would lend any more; And <hi>Don Iohn de Austria,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in his Letter, That had not <hi>Escovedo</hi> his credit (by reason that the
Merchants held him for a man of great wealth, and of great care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his credit) been of greater worth upon the <hi>Bourse,</hi> then the Kings,
their necessities had not been supplyed; and therefore in the end of his
Letter, he beseecheth his Majesty to have an especial care of the payment
of those small sums which were then taken up, lest that <hi>Escovedo</hi> his credit
failing. for want of due payment, they might fail of their purpose when
they should have the like occasion to borrow at another time.</p>
            <p>Besides, his Father, by reason of the great Charges which his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Wars put him unto, when he dyed, left him greatly in debt; and
he himself ever since his Fathers death, hath been at exceeding great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
either by building Castles and Citadels, or by making houses of
pleasure, and Monastries, or by maintaining continual Wars, or by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many Garrisons, or by buying and building Ships to withstand our
Navy, or by paying part of his Fathers debts, or by entertaining our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives,
or by upholding the Rebels of <hi>France:</hi> Now as private men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left in debt by their Parents, and living always at great charges, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
not possibly be rich and wealthy: So Princes being not only charged with
their Fathers debts, but also overcharged with ordinary and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Expenses, cannot have great store of wealth in their Treasure-houses;
And <hi>Alphonsus</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> (as <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> reporteth in his life)
held opinion,<note place="margin">Paul Jovius</note> that the Prince was not worthy the name of a Prince, and
was always likely to be contemned and wronged, who had not in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
great store of ready money laid up against he should have need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>But, to the end that all which I have said touching this last Point, may
carry the more likelyhood of truth and probability, I take it not to be
amiss to let you understand the proportion of some Princes expences, in
their Wars; in their Buildings, and in other occasions, by which you
may conjecture what the Spanish King hath expended of late years volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
and necessarily, beyond his usual and ordinary charges.</p>
            <p>The Bishop and Town of <hi>Colen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comines</note> in their Wars against <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> spent every Month an hundred thousand Crowns; as <hi>Philip
de Comines</hi> avoucheth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> in their Wars against the King of <hi>France,</hi> undertaken
by the Commandment of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, spent eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Ducates, in the taking of the Dukedom of <hi>Urbin;</hi> In their Wars
against <hi>Caesar,</hi> six hundred thousand; and in other occasions depending
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93045:68"/>
upon the Wars against <hi>France,</hi> after the said Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his death, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Ducates;<note place="margin">Guicciard.</note> And the same Pope spent in the said Wars against
the Duke of <hi>Urbin,</hi> eight hundred thousand Ducates; as <hi>Guiccidine</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.<note place="margin">Paul Jovius</note>
               <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh spent in the Wars against <hi>Tuscany,</hi> for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Family, ten hundred thousands Crowns; as <hi>Paul Iovius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.
<hi>Paulus tertius</hi> consumed in fifteen years, in needless Wars, above
twenty Millions of gold;<note place="margin">Illescas.</note> as <hi>Illescas</hi> in his life affirmeth. The Duke of
<hi>Alva</hi> for the building of the Castle of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> exacted of the Citizens
thereof,<note place="margin">Dinothus</note> four hundred thousand Florins; as <hi>Dinothus</hi> testifieth. <hi>Cosmus de
Medicis,</hi> being first a private man, and then Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> spent in
private and publique buildings, better then forty Millions of Crowns,
and ten Millions in Gifts and Rewards;<note place="margin">Paul Jovius</note> as <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> averreth.
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, King of <hi>England,</hi> spent in an idle Journey into <hi>France,</hi>
nine hundred thousand pounds;<note place="margin">Tho. Wals.</note> as <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Walsingham</hi> reporteth. The
Frenchmen in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, King of <hi>England,</hi> spent a
thousand Marks every day from Easter until Michlemas,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> in maintaining
but thirty seven Gallies, and eight other Ships; as the same Authour
affirmeth. <hi>Henry</hi> the third spent in a Journey which his Brother <hi>Richard</hi>
made into <hi>Germany,</hi> when he was chosen Emperour, above seven hundred
thousand pounds;<note place="margin">Math. Paris</note> as <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> saith in his Chronicles. But to come
more neer to our purpose: The King of <hi>Spain</hi> offered unto <hi>Don Iohn</hi>
Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> three hundred thousand Crowns every Moneth, to
maintain his Wars in the Low Countties,<note place="margin">Dinothus.</note> as <hi>Dinothus</hi> setteth down in his
History. The same King above sixteen years ago, had spent better then
fifty Millions of Crowns in his Wars of <hi>Flanders;</hi> as <hi>Marco Antonio
Arrayo</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. Ant. Arrayo.</note> testifieth. And the States of the said Countries gave unto the
Duke of <hi>Alencon,</hi> yearly, four and twenty Tuns of Gold to maintain their
Wars both by Land and Sea, against the King of <hi>Spain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">David Chyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aeus.</note> as <hi>David Chaytraeus</hi>
reporteth. Now, if mean States in small and short Wars; if petty Princes
in private and publique buildings; if the French king in the maintenance of
a few Ships, but for a few Moneths; if our Kings in idle Journeys; if
the duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in building one Castle; if the State of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in their Wars; and if the king of <hi>Spain</hi> himself so many years ago,
spent so much as is before mentioned; What have his Citadels, his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
his Monasteries, his Journeys, his provisions by Sea, his Ships,
and his Wars, not in one place, but in many, not against one Prince, but
against divers, not for short time, but of long continuance cost him? And
as these wonderful Expences are Arguments that he had much; so they
be witnesses that he now wanteth: And as his long and continual Wars in
<hi>Flanders</hi> do shew that he is malicious, prone to revenge, and desireous to
recover his own; so they prove that his might, his puissance, and his power,
is not so great as it is taken to be. For, he that withal his strength cannot
master one poor Nation; that in many years cannot recover his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony;
shall any man take him to be able to bring to pass all that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth?
Shall we deem him sufficient to subdue others Countries?
common sence and reason teacheth us, that he which is not able to do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things, is far unable to bring to pass matters of great weight. <hi>Titus
Livius</hi> divideth men into three sorts; Some are so wise that they counsel
themselves and others; Others be not wise enough to advise themselves,
and yet to conceive and follow such advice as is given them: And the
third sort can neither take nor give good counsel: So some Princes are
able to help themselves and others; Others can defend themselves, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93045:69"/>
not assist their friends; And there is a third kind that can neither defend
their own States nor others. I know not in which of these three sorts to
place the king of <hi>Spain:</hi> The last sort too base for him; the second not
high enough; and the first in truth scant fit for him; for he that cannot
help himself, how may we judg him sufficient to succour others? and
yet we see that there are no Wars where he hath not somewhat to do,
where he sendeth not some helps, either of men or money, or of both;
which argueth that he loveth to be always doing, although he do nothing
worthy his labour, always troublesome, although his troubles avail him
little or nothing; always desirous to embrace many things, although he
holdeth not safe any thing. But of Princes I had rather deliver unto you
other mens judgments then mine own opinion.</p>
            <p>You have heard what the Spanish Kingdoms are, and by that which
hath been said you may easily conjecture that his principal force and
strength cometh from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> Countries as far different in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and qualities, as they are distant in place and scituation: Of the force
of these two Countries you shall therefore hear what a learned Writer,
and what I (who am not worthy to write) hath set down for his resolute
opinion. I have told you long since, that <hi>Guicciardine</hi> termeth the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Italy, Infamia della militia;</hi> And now to the same purpose (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it falleth out very fit for my purpose) I may not forbear to tell you,
that the same Authour in his ninth Book of the same History, useth of the
Infantry of <hi>Italy,</hi> these words following; <hi>All Princes that can be served
with</hi> High Dutchmen, Spaniards <hi>or</hi> Swizzers, <hi>refuse the service of</hi> Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>Footmen, because they are neither acquainted with the Customs and Orders
of other Nations, nor accustomed to continue long in the field.</hi> The same
Writer considering that some kingdoms naturally are better able to defend
themselves then offend their enemies; delivereth for his opinion, that the
Spanish King is far better able to defend his Kingdom from any Invasion
to be made by the King of <hi>France,</hi> then to offend or annoy the said King;
By which two judgments I may boldly conjecture, and prove my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
by <hi>Nicholaus Machiavelli,</hi> (who hath written a whole Chapter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Argument) that not only the Spanish King, but also any other
Prince whatsoever, being driven (when he hath occasion to offend or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
an enemy) to use forrain power, and mercenary Souldiers, is not
to be esteemed a strong and mighty Prince: and that such is the state and
condition of the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> is manifestly proved by the places before
alledged out of <hi>Guicciardine.</hi> For, if his <hi>Italians</hi> (the principal forces
of an Army always consisting of Footmen) be not fit for that service;
and his Spaniards are better able to maintain his Realm at home, then to
molest his enemies abroad; who can justly esteem him strong, whose chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
strength dependeth wholy upon these two Nations? And now to leave
the <hi>Italians,</hi> as men in this respect not worthy to be had in any great reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,
and to proceed more largely in the discovery and declaration of
the Spanish valour.</p>
            <p>True it is that (as I have said before) continual use and daily experience
in Martial affairs, have made them of late years very famous: It is also
most certain and manifest,<note place="margin">Munsteri Cosmog.</note> that they are very patient, and able to endure
labour, hunger and thirst; light of body, sparing in their diet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
satisfied and maintained with a little; wary and politique, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cunning in using and inventing new Stratagems; briefly, so desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of Wars, that unless they have a forrain enemy, they will easily fall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93045:69"/>
to variance and civil discord at home: But if you call to remembrance
how they come to that fame, which now they have attained; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that they are (as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> testifieth) of an unquiet and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
disposition, and always affecting change and alteration; if you call
to mind that (as <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> reporteth) they have minds evermore
thirsting for Rule and Government; whereunto if they once attain, they
bend their whole force and thoughts unto the purchasing of further and
higher Authority; Lastly, if you weigh and remember, that (as <hi>Piero
Mexias,</hi> a Spanish Historiographer saith) they cannot endure to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a stranger; you must needs think that the before mentioned
vertues may be either obscured or hindred by these later vices: For let
them meet with a Nation not so timerous as those with whom they had to
deal of late; let them follow their natural disposition, and so fall at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
amongst themselves; let them still cover and affect Authority, and
so when they should jointly help one another against their enemies, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disdain to be ruled by their own leaders, as they have done of late years:
Lastly, let them contemn a stranger, as they did the late Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi>
or not agree with strangers, as they did in <hi>Flanders;</hi> what fruit may be
expected of their service? or what profit can proceed of their valour?
It is imputed unto the <hi>Germans</hi> for a great fault, that when they are ready
to join with their enemies in battel, they oftentimes refuse to strike a stroke
before they have their due and monethly pays; and for this one fault
Princes make no great account of them; and yet the Spaniards, who are
subject to this fault as well as they, are commended for their loyalty and
obedience; in so much that some men write, that they were never discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for want of their pay: But if you read either the Indian History, or the
Writers of their late Wars in <hi>Flanders,</hi> you shall find that they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
revolted for lack of their pay; yea they have banded against
their Captains, and their best Souldiers have resisted the commandment
of their Generals. This I could prove by many Examples, but one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Example shall suffice for those many. At what time it was agreed
betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States of the Low Countries, that
all Spaniards shall depart thence; It was thought convenient and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
by <hi>Don Iohn de Austria,</hi> who was the General for the King in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
to appoint some principal and chief Captains to have the leading
and conducting of them into <hi>Italy;</hi> Whereupon <hi>Don Iohn</hi> gave express
commandment unto the Kings Secretary <hi>Escovedo,</hi> to assemble the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of War in the Town of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and there to consult and deliberate
what man was meetest for that purpose. This Councel assembled, made
special choise of <hi>Don Alonso de Vargas,</hi> who willingly accepted the charge;
but <hi>Iulian Romero,</hi> a man of great worth, and no small experience, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to be commanded by <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> alledging for the only reason
of his disobedience, that it would be a great dishonour for him to go into
<hi>Italy</hi> under such a Leader; because that he being Master of the Camp,
<hi>Don Alonso</hi> had been his Souldier; and <hi>De Vergas</hi> as boldly protested,
that since he had been thought worthy by the Counsel to govern, he
would not be governed nor guided by <hi>Iulian Romero.</hi> The Councel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Don Iohn</hi> with this contention; he fearing to discontent either
<hi>Romero</hi> or <hi>Vergas,</hi> and doubting that if they should be discontented, some
great inconvenience might follow thereon; commanded the Councel to
chuse a third man, which was the County of <hi>Mansfield;</hi> Whereat <hi>Don
Alonso</hi> so stormed, that he complained of <hi>Don Iohn de Austria, a Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
displagad,</hi> with Banners displayed, as the same <hi>Don Iohn</hi> termeth it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93045:70"/>
in his Letters to the king of <hi>Spain;</hi> yea it seemed that he was so displeased
therewith, and so resolute to signifie his grief and discontentment unto
the King, that <hi>Don Iohn de Austria</hi> in his Letter unto the King is fain to
intreat his Majesty that if <hi>Don Alons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> moved with the same passion which
possessed him when he chid hand-smooth with him, should so much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himself as to write, <hi>Alganalibertag,</hi> some unbeseeming speech unto
his Majesty, <hi>Como la ha hecho a mi,</hi> as he hath done (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith he) unto me, it
might please his Majesty not only to dissemble, but also to comfort, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and promise him some high reward, assuring his Majesty, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
recompence his Grace should bestow upon him, he would take the
same as bestowed upon himself; yea further, beseeching his Majesty to
let <hi>Don Alonso</hi> understand what he had written in his behalf, and that his
commendations hath not a little availed him; to the end (saith he) <hi>Salga
de la opinion que ya concedido,</hi> he may conceive no more so evil an opinion
of me as he hath done. Was not this, think you, a point of great disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in a base Souldier, as <hi>Don Alonso</hi> had been? Was it not a bold
part of a Souldier to rail at his General unto his face? Was it not a fault
severely punishable, to refuse to march under a Leader chosen by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of an whole Councel at War? Was not that General in an evil case,
who was constrained to flatter so mean a Souldier? Or can that king be
thought to have obedient and loyal Souldiers, who must of necessity be
inforced, not only not to punish, but also to pardon, and not to tolerate
alone, but also to recompence a rebellious and insolent Captain, for fear
of some inconvenience that might follow of his discontentment or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
But this was not all, And <hi>Don Alonso</hi> alone shewed not himself
discontented; <hi>Sancho de Avila,</hi> the Colonel <hi>Mudragon,</hi> the Captain
<hi>Monteselega,</hi> the Colonel <hi>Verdugo,</hi> the Castellan <hi>Francisco, Hermandes
de Avila,</hi> and many other of the most especial Captains of that time,
were likewise so displeased, and uttered their discontentments in such
manner, as that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was compelled (as he testifieth in the same
Letter) to pacifie them, not only by granting them their whole pays out of
Wars which they had in Wars, but also by promising them that they
should have the like charges and Offices in the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> as they
had in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Now whereas the wisest, best, and most serviceable
Captains shew manifest signs of undutiful carriage, and intolerable
arrogancy; may the meaner Souldiers be justly blamed if they fall into
the like offence? Or can that Nation be worthily commended for loyal
and obedient Souldiers, whose chief Officers do so highly forget and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their duty? especially in a matter of such weight and importance as
the departure of the Spaniards out of <hi>Flanders</hi> was at that time unto the
King; but this kind of disobedience is not usual; and whereas there be
good Masters, there most commonly be likewise good servants; So the
Spanish King being better furnished with notable Captains then any other
Prince in Christendom, he must likewise have sufficient and good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
And because it hath been said, that not the number and multitude
but the goodness and valour of Souldiers maketh their Kings victorious,
it must needs follow as a necessary consequent, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
whose Captains pass the Captains of all other Princes, both in number
and experience, cannot be without good Souldiers, and therefore is strong
enough to encounter with any Adversary whatsoever: To this Argument
it is easily answered; that although the valour of Souldiers is better to be
regarded then the number, yet that Prince who hath valiant Souldiers,
not being able to bring into the field a proportionable and equal number
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93045:70"/>
unto his enemies, especially such enemies as rather excel then yeild unto
his Subjects in valour and Chivalry may undoubtedly be held and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Prince of no great strength and pui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sance. If then you remember
(as you cannot forget) that the Christian Adversaries with whom the
king of <hi>Spain</hi> hath any great contention; are, the king of <hi>France,</hi> and
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> (the Subjects of either of which Princes are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour unto the Spaniards in number or in valour) you cannot
chuse but perceive and see, that the King is not of might and power suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to contend at once with both these Princes. This was well known
unto his Father, who (as it hath been said before) so carried himself in
all his life time, that when he had <hi>England</hi> for his enemy, <hi>France</hi> was his
friend; and when he fell at variance with <hi>France,</hi> he presently procured
the friendship and alliance of <hi>England;</hi> Besides there is nothing more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
then to make conjectures of things to come by things that are past, and
to measure the present forces of Princes by their own or their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
strength and power at other times; for although a Kingdom be at
sometimes more populous then at others; yet because man in reason hath
a better regard of that which is commonly and dayly seen, then of that
which happeneth very seldom; he cannot greatly be deceived that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth
a new raigning Princes might and power, by his own and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
former puissance: But before I enter into the due consideration
hereof, it shall not be amiss to let you understand whence it cometh to
pass that the Spaniards are lately become so famous as they are: you know
that in this our corrupt Age, as men are friended, so they are favoured,
that they who are highest in Authority, are most commonly as high in
praise, as they are in preheminence; that all men covet to win favour
with the Mighty; that no man can so securely, as perhaps boldly, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the least jot that may be, from their credit and reputation, who in
common opinion are held praise worthy. Common same is by Law a
certain kind of proof; and our common Proverb saith; <hi>That it may be an
untruth which two or three report; but that can hardly be untrue which all or
most men affirm to be certain and manifest;</hi> yea such is the force of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
same, that whensoever it proceedeth first from grave and honest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
it carrieth great credit, and he shall hardly be credited that shall
venture to gainsay or control the same. Since therefore divers Authors
of great Antiquity, of marvellous gravity, of singular learning, and rare
wisdom, have attributed in their speeches, in their conferences, in their
writings, more praises, and far greater commendations unto <hi>Spain,</hi> then
unto any other Country; many for fear to be reputed unwise, if they should
not subscribe to their opinion; some to follow the new received custome
of open and intolerable flattery; and others for affection (which easily
deceiveth very wise men) have of late years either thought it a duty, or a
degree and step to preferment, to concur in opinion, both openly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
with as many as have dedicated their Studies, and devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their uttermost endeavours, to the setting forth, maintenance,
and augmentation of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the Spanish Kings honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Thence it cometh to pass, that divers learned men in their Writing,
striving to yeild more praises to <hi>Spain</hi> then it deserveth; make mention
of such commodities to be as yet in <hi>Spain,</hi> which many years before our
great Grand-fathers time were never seen nor found therein. So doth
<hi>Iohannes Vasoeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vasoeus.</note> in his Preface of his History of <hi>Spain</hi> say, that there
was sometimes so great abundance of gold and silver Mines in one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Spain</hi> called anciently <hi>Boetica,</hi> as that divers forain Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93045:71"/>
drawn thither with an unsatiable desire and covetousness thereof, did
not only lade their Ships with Gold and Silver, but also made Anchors
for their Ships of silver. The same Authour addeth further, That when
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> came first into <hi>Spain,</hi> they found in many houses great
Barrels and Hogsheads made of pure silver; and in some Stables the
Mangers for their Horses of silver: In so much that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
being enriched only with the wealth of <hi>Spain,</hi> were made able therewith
alone to subdue the <hi>Sicilians, Libians,</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> for they found their
silver in such great quantity, that one man called <hi>Bebelo,</hi> gave daily unto
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> there thousand Crowns: The same Authour proceeding in one
and the same manner of commendation, affirmeth our of <hi>Iustin,</hi> That
<hi>Spain</hi> may compare for fertility of soil, with <hi>France, Affrica</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> for
that these Countries never help <hi>Spain,</hi> but <hi>Spain</hi> oftentimes holpe them
with Corn, and all other kind of Victuals. The same Authour Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
still in one manner, calleth <hi>Spain</hi> the most warlike Nation of the
world; the Teacher of <hi>Hannibal</hi> to war, the Nurse of Souldiers, and
the Province which knew not her self, nor her strength, before she was
overcome; and that she troubled the <hi>Romans</hi> more then any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole world. The same Authour always continuing one course,
preferreth <hi>Spain</hi> for Antiquity of true Religion, and for faithful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to her Soveraign Kings and Governours, before all other Nations,
attributing the first foundation of their faith and profession of Christ, unto
<hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, and <hi>Iames</hi> the son of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and extolling their
loyalty, because they have not only been always true unto their own Kings,
but also to forraign Princes and Leaders; As <hi>Hannibal, Pompey, Iuba</hi>
King of <hi>Numidia, Sertorius,</hi> a notable Roman Rebel, reposed greater
trust and confidence in Spaniards then in their own Nations: Lastly, the
same Authour striving to exceed all others in flattery, equalleth <hi>Spain</hi>
for learned men and women, with the most learned Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi>
And <hi>Sebastianus Foxius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Institutione Historiae,</hi> with a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
brag, speaking by way of a Dialogue, more arrogantly then wisely
of himself; giveth such praises unto himself for eloquence, as <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Tullies Verse (O fortunatam natam me Consule Romam,</hi> argueth that he was
somewhat proud and arrogant. Now to avoid the just reprehension of
hatred or malice, I will forbear to confute their Assertions at large; and
briefly, impugn them, not by mine own, but by other mens Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
who shall not be inferiour but equal to <hi>Vasoeus</hi> for learning and side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
<hi>Munster</hi> therefore shall tell you, that <hi>Spain</hi> now yeildeth no golden
or silver Mines, but that all the Mines it hath are of Lead and Tin; which
may perhaps in time turn into Gold and Silver, if we may beleeve <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus
Lullius,</hi> and other Alchimists of his opinion, which if it should
chance at any time as many Historiographers as write of <hi>England,</hi> would
tell you that <hi>England</hi> should not then go behind <hi>Spain</hi> for gold and silver.
The same Authour shall likewise tell you, how likely it is that <hi>Spain</hi> should
excel <hi>Affrica, France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in fertility of soil, since (as he saith) <hi>Spain</hi>
lieth barren, waste and desolate in many places; and late experience
sheweth, that <hi>Denmark, Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> have many times supplied
<hi>Spains</hi> wants of Corn and other Victuals: How warlike a Nation <hi>Spain</hi>
hath been, let not only <hi>Terapha,</hi> a Spanish Chronocler, and better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for <hi>Spain</hi> then <hi>Vasoeus</hi> a Flemming; but also reason and daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
testifie, both which telling us (as you shall hereafter hear) that <hi>Spain</hi>
hath been conquered by more sundry Nations then any other Nation in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93045:71"/>
the world do by necessary inference conclude, that <hi>Spain</hi> yeildeth unto
all those Nations in Prowess and Chivalty; And all Historians of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
times, and of this present Age, will undoubtedly controll as many as
shall presume to affirm, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> troubled not <hi>Rome</hi> much
more then <hi>Spain</hi> did, before they could be conquered, for where was Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
in greater danger then in <hi>England?</hi> Where was there a Prince that
durst challenge him to a single Combat but in <hi>England?</hi> And what hold
had he of his Conquest after he had conquered <hi>England?</hi> No better then
<hi>Vasoeus</hi> might have of a wet Eel by the tail.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the confutation of the rest; <hi>Terapha</hi> in some manner
agreeth with <hi>Vasoeus</hi> touching the Antiquity of Religion; for he saith, that
during the Raign of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle travelled
over all <hi>Spain,</hi> and not long after <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Narbona:</hi> but how many
won <hi>Iames</hi> to profess the Gospel, by travelling over all <hi>Spain?</hi> Forsooth
but poor nine Disciples, as <hi>Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Travel, or for <hi>Vasoeus</hi> to boast and brag of, much less for him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et
<hi>Spain</hi> in this respect before all other Nations; for I know not why
for Antiquity of Religion, <hi>England</hi> should yeild unto <hi>Spain;</hi> because the
same <hi>Iosephus</hi> which buried the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> not alone, as <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Iames</hi> came into <hi>Spain,</hi> but with great company arrived into <hi>England,</hi> and
not he alone, but divers of his society, converted not poor nine, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
many, and not to profess Christ Jesus, but to be baptized: And if
a Spaniard may carry equal credit with a Flemming (which a Spaniard
will rather die then not do) our little English Island professed Christ long
before <hi>Spain.</hi> For Dr. <hi>Illescas</hi> in his Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our Countrimen in that Christian Religion and Profession which
they had received and entertained almost five hundred years before their
coming. Neither may it be justified that <hi>Spain</hi> (as <hi>Vasoeus</hi> saith) after it
had once entertained the Doctrine of Christ, never fell from the same;
for <hi>Illescas,</hi> in the life of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> the second, affirmeth, that in the
585. year of Christs Incarnation, <hi>Recaredus,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and of
<hi>Spain,</hi> was the first King that expelled the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and expresly commanded all his Subjects to receive and profess
Christian Religion: Whereby it appeareth that <hi>Spain</hi> lived from the time
of St. <hi>Iames</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being there, until <hi>Recaredus</hi> his Raign, which
is better then four hundred years, in manifest and manifold Heresies; a
crime which cannot be proved to have been in <hi>England,</hi> or in many other
Nations, after they had once submitted themselves to the Doctrine of
Christ and his Disciples. Lastly, if <hi>Spain</hi> will still continue to brag and
say, that their King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was entituled by <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, by
the name of the Catholique King,<note place="margin">Guicciard. lib. 10. 5. 18.</note> they may leave to boast thereof, when
they shall hear that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth our King, not much after the same
time, was surnamed by <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, Pope of <hi>Rome, Defender of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
faith;</hi> and that the <hi>Switzers</hi> for their service done unto the same

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93045:72"/>
the Ecclesiastical Liberty;</hi> a Title in no respect inferiour unto that of <hi>Spain:</hi>
And lastly, that <hi>Clouis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> above nine hundred years before
their <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the fifth was honoured with the Title of <hi>The most
Christian King:</hi> A Title as for Antiquity, so for worthiness better then
the other, because the French Kings, for the worthiness and multitude of
their deserts towards the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> are called <hi>Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>geniti
Ecclesiae,</hi> the
eldest Sons of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Now from their faith towards God,
to their fidelity towards their Princes, a matter sufficiently handled, and
therefore needless, and not requiring any other confutation, then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that may be taken of <hi>Vasoeus</hi> his own words; for if they have been
faithful unto forrainers and strange Princes, and have submited their necks
unto many several Nations, it argueth inconstancy, fellow-mate to levity,
which is either a Mother or a guid unto disloyalty; because light heads are
quickly displeased, and discontented minds give easie entertainment unto
rebellious and treasonable cogitations. To conclude then this Point with
their learning, let me oppose a Spaniard unto a Flemming; a man better
acquainted with the vertues and vices of his own Country then a stranger,
a man who giveth his Testimony of <hi>Vasoeus,</hi> and of the cause of his writing
of the Spanish History: <hi>Iohn Vasoeus</hi> a Elemming, seeing the negligence of
the Spaniards, and how careless they were to commit to perpetual memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the worthy exploits and actions of their own Nation, began of late years
to set forth a small Chronicle: Why then the Spaniards are negligent,
they are careless of their own commendation; so thought <hi>Vasoeus,</hi> or else
he had not written their History; so saith <hi>Sebastianus Foxius,</hi> the man
whom I bring to confute <hi>Vasoeus;</hi> the man who by attributing (as you have
heard) more unto himself then any modest man (unless it were a bragging
Spaniard) would do, giveth me occasion to think that he will not derogate
or detract any thing from the praises due unto his own Country: This
man therefore in his before mentioned Book speaketh thus of the learning
of <hi>Spain: Our Country men</hi> (saith he) <hi>both in old time and in this Age having
continually lived in forrain or domestical Wars, never gave their minds greatly
unto study; for the rewards of learning in our Country are very few, and they
proper unto a few paltry Pettyfoggers; and our wits being high and lofty, could
never brook the pains that learning requireth, but either we disdaining all kind
of study, give our selves presently to the purchase of Honours and Riches, or else
following our studies for a small while, quickly give them over, as though we had
attained to the full and absolute perfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion of learning, so that very few or none
are found amongst us, who may compare for learning with the Italians, or have
shewed the ripeness and sharp maturity of their wits in any kind of any kind of
study.</hi> You have heard two contrary opinions touching the Spaniards
learning; I leave it to your discretion to follow and beleeve which of them
you please; and withal to consider by the way what manner of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Discipline and Government we should have, if the Spanish ignorant
and unlearned Clergy might, as they have a long time both desired and
endeavoured, prescribe Laws and Orders unto all the Churches of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.
The favourable Assertions in the behalf of <hi>Spain</hi> being thus
briefly refelled, it remaineth now to make a conjectural estimate of the
Spanish present Forces, by an Historical Declaration of the power
thereof in times past; and because it were over tedious to trouble you
with the recital of such forces as <hi>Spain</hi> hath imployed many hundred
years ago, in her own defence, or in disturbance of her forrain ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
abroad, I will restrain my self unto such a time as is within
the memory of man, and especially unto the Raigne of <hi>Charls</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93045:72"/>
the fifth; For (as I take it) <hi>Spain</hi> was never, for this many hundred years,
so strong, as when the said <hi>Charles</hi> was both King thereof and Emperor.
And albeit <hi>Piero Mexias,</hi> in the life of <hi>Gratianus</hi> the Emperor attributeth
so much unto Spaniards, as that he more boldly then truly affirmeth; that
the Emperor flourished more under Spaniards, then under any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatsoever; and alledgeth for proof of his Assertion, the flourishing
Estate thereof, under the before named <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Yet I think
that the Empire being added unto <hi>Spain,</hi> rather beautified <hi>Spain,</hi> then
that <hi>Spain</hi> being conjoyned with the Empire, did any thing at all il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
the majesty of the Empire; because as little Stars give no light or
beauty unto the Moon, but receive both from the Moon; so a lesser
dignity being joyned to a greater, addeth no reputation thereunto, but is
greatly honoured and beautified by the conjunction thereof, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth
it much (in my simple opinion) unto the honour of <hi>Spain,</hi> or
of the Empire, that <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was Emperor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain</hi> is not greatly honoured thereby, because <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was a
Flemming, and no Spaniard; and <hi>Spain</hi> came unto him (as I have said)
by marriage with the heire of the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Castile;</hi> and
the Empire was rather disgraced then honoured by the said <hi>Charles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he being born in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> was not onely a vassal, and natural-born
subject unto the King of France, but also unto the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all
the Dominions, Lands and Seigniories which he had in possession, saving
those which he held of <hi>France</hi> and the Empire. But <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,
such an Emperor as he was (and undoubtedly he was a very mighty, wise
and politick Prince) never brought into the Field against any of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
whatsoever, so great forces, and so mighty an Army, as might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
be called invincible (by which name the proud and bragging Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
baptized their late Army against <hi>England</hi>) This Emperor being (as
you may conjecture and perceive by that which hath been already said)
both Ambitious and Warlick, had in his life time many wars with divers
Princes, but none more notable, famous, and worthy of perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his wars in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> For the wars which
he had against the Turk are not properly to be termed his, because his
Forces alone were not imployed therein, but the aid and help of the best
and most part of Christendom. His Forces in <hi>Germany</hi> were not above
9000 Horsemen, and 50000 Footmen, as <hi>Lewis Guicciardine</hi> testifieth in
his Commentaries: And although he used in these wars all his wit and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
to increase his own power, and to weaken and diminish the strength
of the Protestants; performing the one by drawing into League with
himself, and unto his aid, the Pope, and other Princes of his own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And effecting the other (as <hi>Sleidan</hi> writeth) by great cunning, and
policy used in distracting many Princes concurring in opinion touching
matters of Religion with the Protestants, from their side and Faction; yet
the Protestants Army, consisting of 10000 Horsemen, and 90000 Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
was far greater then his in number, and had undoubtedly gotten
the day against him when they joyned battel together, had not divers of
their Confederates left and abandoned them before the battel was fought;
Or had not the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> committed a gross error in joyning battel
with him. His Armies brought into <hi>France</hi> were many, but none greater
then at <hi>Laundresy</hi> and <hi>Marcelles:</hi> In the first he was aided by our King;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93045:73"/>
And in the second, by most of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
Insomuch that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had been first overthrown
by him in <hi>Italy,</hi> was constrained to implore the help of the Turk against
him: For when he came to <hi>Marselles</hi> he had (as Dr. <hi>Illescas</hi> reporteth
in the life of <hi>Paulus tertius</hi>) in his Army about 25000 Almains, 8000
Spaniards, and ten or twelve thousand Italians; the Almains ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hered
within the Dominion of the Empire, the Spaniards within his own Realm
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Italians not onely in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the
Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> but also in the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in other parts of
<hi>Italy,</hi> At <hi>Laundresey,</hi> reckoning therein the Forces which he had out of
<hi>England,</hi> his whole Army came not to above 50000 (as the said <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardine</hi>
affirmeth.) These were the greatest Strengths that ever he gathered
together; and these are not so great, but that our Queen, without the
help of any other Allie or Confederate, hath oftentimes brought far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Forces into the Field, as both our Histories, and the French and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Chronicles do witness. And Mr. <hi>de la Noüe,</hi> his opinion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
sheweth, that the French King of himself is very well able to raise
a far greater Army, then any of these were, against any of his Enemies. I
shall not therefore need (as I might conveniently do in this place) confer
the Forces of <hi>England</hi> or of <hi>France</hi> with the strength of this Emperor,
who had never gotten the happy victory, which he obtained against <hi>Franci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the first, King of <hi>France,</hi> had not the Italian Captains, whom the French
King put in trust, deceived him by taking pay for many more Souldiers
then they had in their bands; (a fault too much used in our Modern Wars)
had not the Switzers, when there was most need of them, departed to
their own homes; had not the French King given himself too carelesly
to pleasures, which caused his Forces to decrease and diminish daily; or
had not the said King very unadvisedly attempted in the cold Winter to
besiege <hi>Pavia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide de Marq. de Pescara</note> For the Marquess of <hi>Pescara,</hi> understanding that the King
of <hi>France,</hi> being counselled thereunto by Captain <hi>Bonnevet,</hi> was gone
to besiege <hi>Pavia,</hi> said unto his Souldiers; We that were no better then
men already conquered, are now become Conquerors; for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
being therein ill advised, leaveth us in <hi>Lody,</hi> and goeth to fight
with the Almains at <hi>Pavia;</hi> where the French-men will not onely lose
that Fury, with which many times they work wonders, but also will spend
their chiefest Forces in a long and tedious siege of a Town, not easie to be
taken, and in fighting with a very valiant and most obstinate Nation;
and in the mean while we shall receive fresh supplies out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and
without all doubt, if the War continue long, as it is likely to do, we
cannot but hope for a most happy and victorious end thereof.</p>
            <p>Now if this Emperor, in these Wars, (the worst of which was far
more just, then the best which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath lately undertaken)
could with the help and furtherance of all his Allies and Confederates
make no greater Forces, then are before mentioned; nor with his Forces
should ever have had so good success as he had, if his Adversaries had been
so wise and wary as they might have been: Why shall his son King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
be thought able to bring more men into the Field, then were in those
Armies, or worthy of so good fortune as his Father had, since his strength
is in no respect comparable unto his, and his Actions and his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
have not the like colour and shew of Wisdom, or of Justice,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93045:73"/>
as the Emperor had? That the Father excelled the Son in strength, all men
will confess, saving those wich carry a partial and prejudicate opinion of the
present greatness of <hi>Spain:</hi> for albeit the son hath lately added the kingdom
of <hi>Portugal</hi> unto those Realms and Dominions which his Father possessed
and left unto him; although the Empire hath continued for these many
years, and is likely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he hath greatly impaired his strength, and made it far inferiour unto
his Fathers, or unto that same which he himself was like to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or at the first beginning of his Civil Wars. For to omit that he
can now hardly make such strength as the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> or <hi>Don Iohn de

at one time 6000 horse, and 30000 foot, and the other as many foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and 4000 horsemen more; The decrease and diminution of his
strength doth manifestly appear in this, that the Low-Countries are now
reduced unto that poverty, and to such a penury of men, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly fetch any reasonable great number thence to imploy them
in forreign services, but he is fain to bring in Strangers to defend his
Towns against the united Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacobus Meyerus</hi> in the sixth book of his Chronicles of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
reporteth that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Flanders</hi> in the year 1181 having Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the French King, had 200000 Men in his Army: and <hi>Adrianus
Barbadus,</hi> in the Chronicles of the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> recordeth, that the
Bishop of <hi>Utritch</hi> is able, upon any urgent occasion, to arm 40000 Men.
The first of these reports sheweth what the force of <hi>Flanders</hi> hath been;
and the second giveth me occasion to conjectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and think, that the
strength of the United Provinces cannot but be great, since a Bishop of
one Town could readily and conveniently Arm so many Men. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that the chiefest cause of displeasure and contention betwixt <hi>Philip,</hi>
sirnamed The Fair, king of <hi>France,</hi> and Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, was,
because the said <hi>Philip</hi> would not, at the request and intreaty of the Pope,
restore <hi>Guido</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> unto his Liberty, that he might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and assist the Christians in their Wars in the Holy Land, where the
said <hi>Guido</hi>'s Predecessors had done better service then any other Prince of
<hi>Christendom;</hi> and the Pope held an opinion, that <hi>Guido</hi>'s presence
would avail the Christians much more then the society of all the other
Princes. What a loss then hath the king of <hi>Spain</hi> by the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
poverty, as well of money as of men, since the same Countries
were of late years more populous, far richer, and better inhabited then

their disobedience against him. For, considering the extremity of his

to passe with an Army through anothers Country, to take Pledges
and Hostages that he shall passe without any kinde of Annoyance: And
if caution be thought necessary when a multitude goeth but through a
Forreign Dominion, how can a Prince be too watchfull, provident, and
circumspect over an infinite number of Forreigners residing within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his Kingdom, where although they be not armed, yet they may
arm themselves at any time? although they be dispersed, yet they may
congregate and unite themselves together at their pleasure: although they
want Guides and Governours to direct them in any malicious enterprise;
yet if any Army of their own Nation should attempt any manner of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility

            <p>There was a time when certain wicked Rebels cruelly murthered

Sea-Rovers, and spared not to pill and poll any Nation whatsoever, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

take heed of strangers, and especially of such as have been Traytors unto
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93045:74"/>
their own Princes; and whosoever considereth well every circumstance
thereof, and of many others like unto it, may boldly presume to say, that
the Prince, whose Country is replenished with strangers, and especially with
such as have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to live in great doubt of his own security, and of his subjects safety.
But I speake not this against such strangers as are fled into <hi>England,</hi> or
any other Country for their conscience sake, to avoid the tyranny of
the Spaniards. I know that God ordained Cities of refuge, whereunto
it was lawful for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have a watchful Eye, as well to Cherish t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they be wronged by the natural subjects of his Country where they live,
against the course of Law, as to foresee, that neither all, nor part
of them be induced by the natural or professed Enemies of the State
in which they are harboured, to attempt any open Hostility, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Treason against him that vouchsafeth to harbor them. You have
heard what may be said against the present strength of the Spanish King;
Now it remaineth, that you hear what can be objected against his wisdom

and not to examine their actions, nor look into the mysteries of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

may boldy presume to commit to your secret view what others have

other could never endure to be ruled by proud and arrogant Officers,
but have alwayes been far better governed by the Courtesie and
Clemency of Women, then by the severity and rigour of Men.</p>
            <p>And truly, although <hi>Nimrod</hi> began his reign with cruelty and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
as the Scriptures testifie; and it hath been, and it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
disputable, Whether it be better that the Ministers of Kings
and Princes should be severe and cruel, or gentle and courteous;
yet the wiser sort are of opinion, that Humanity and Gentlenesse
is both more commendable and necessary; especially where the
People that is to be governed is milde by Nature, gentle in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and no way inclined to conceive well of cruelty. And
certainly whosoever shall busie himself in reading many Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
shall undoubtedly finde in them, that more Kingdoms, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Seigniories have been overthrown and ruinated by
the cruelty of under-Officers, then by the severity of the higher
Powers: For in Histories men shall see, that even those people
who lived many yeers in peace, without knowing what belonged
to the besieging of a Town, to the maintaining of a Camp, or to
the entertaining of any Domesticall sedition, have been enforced
by the barbarous and Cruel Tyranny of wicked Officers, to prefer
Wars before Peace, and the effusion of blood, before the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their lives.</p>
            <p>The Province of <hi>Graecia,</hi> after that it had sought and gained
many Battels, subdued sundry Nations, and triumphed over infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Enemies, was at the last overthrown and destroyed by the
wickednesse and cruelty of their Governors. The iniquity and
cruelty of <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> shewed unto <hi>Virginius</hi> his Daughter,
changed the state of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the onely cause that their
form and manner of Civil Government was altered. The Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the same Flemmings, which of late years have born Arms
against King Philip of <hi>Spain,</hi> not being able to brook and endure
the Indignities and Injuries of those Officers which king <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> (sirnamed The Fair) set over them, took out of Prison a
poor Weaver, and made him their Head, rebelled against their king,
and killed all the Frenchmen that were in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The People of
<hi>sicilie,</hi> moved thereunto by the barbarous cruelty of such French
Governors as Tyrannized over them, slew in one night all the
Frenchmen that were in that kingdom, and opened the bellies of
as many women of their own Nation as were with childe by
Frenchmen, onely to destroy the fruit of their womb.</p>
            <p>How many times have the People of <hi>England,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>France,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Spain</hi> rebelled for the
same occasion? Yea, in the time of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,
whose Predecessors were driven out of all that ever they had in
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> for the great Tyranny which was used by him
whom they placed for their Lieutenant. And in truth, less grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and offensive are the Injuries which Princes themselves do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Subjects, then those which proceed from the enmity and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their Officers; and certainly much more dangerous to a Princes
State are the Extortions, Cruelties and Exactions of inferiour Magistrates,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93045:75"/>
then of those unto whom as well the Magistrates as the Subjects are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable.
This is first proved by the force and efficacie of Reason
it self, because every particular man can better endure to be wronged by
the Master then by the Servant; for that the Indignitie and base Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wrong-doers many times increaseth the grief and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is conceived upon occasion of an Injury sustained. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>condly
the Common People hating alwaies much more the evill and tyrannical
Government of an Inferior Magistrate, then of the Superior Powers,
think it far better to have a bad Prince, who wil be Governed and directed
by good Counsellors, then to live under wicked Officers authorised to
Rule and Govern them by a good and vertuous Prince. For, say th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y,
a wicked Prince liveth at ease in his Kingly Palace, giveth himself unto
pleasure, followeth his delights, and rejoyceth in the Company of his

that he doth; But the wicked Magistrate studie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h continually, how to

The consideration whereof maketh me think not onely ours,
but all other Estates and Kingdomes most happy, which are governed by
such Princes as are borne in the same Kingdoms which they Govern;
And those contrariwise most unfortunate, and subject unto infinite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
which are ruled by Forain Princes: The consideration whereof
made many kingdoms not to accept and acknowledge for their Kings
the lawful Children of their deceased Soveraignes, because they were
born in Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rain Countries. The which consideration (as it seemeth)
had sometimes place in <hi>England,</hi> because am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en of our Kings which
are born in other Countries capable of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Lastly
the consideration whereof moveth many grave and wise Polititians to
be of opinion, that the Princes are not overwise and discreet which labour
all the daies of their lives to Conquer and subdue Forain Kingdoms; For
after that they have attained the desired Fruits of their desired Labour and
Travaile, what have they gotten worthy of their pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and charges?
They have added somewhat to their former Reputation, They have
increased their yearly Revenues of their Crown, They have (as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
good Husbands) augmented the Talent which God bestowed
upon them; And what is all this, but a thing that glistereth and is no
Gold? a shew of Reputation, that is no true Glory? and a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great profit than can have no long continuance? For if this happie
and glorious Conqueror shall leave his natural Country, and govern in
person his new Conquered Kingdome, what sorrowes, what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
what troubles, dangers and vexations will follow thereof?
His natural Subjects will complain that they are forsaken, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
will not long like of his Government; The former will find Fault
with his Deputies, and the later will desire his room, rather then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
The one will not think him worthy to enjoy his own, and the other
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93045:76"/>
will esteem all that he getteth theirs, because they presume that it is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the goods and wealth of the Country which they call theirs;
So he becometh a stranger unto his own, and being daily amongst his
own, his own will not know him; And that which is most greivous,
if his own chance to rebell, as many have done in their Soveraignes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

the Affections of his kinde and tender Subjects, by an indiscreet tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Fifthly, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>England</hi> having had
the like motion made unto them by their natural and most loving
Subjects, could never be moved to condiscend to their humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that it was not seemly for his Majesty to be directed by

since he both held and knew himself to be very well able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force

his rebellious and heretical Subjects to submit themselves unto the
profession of that Religion which his Subjects in <hi>Spain</hi> and in other his
dominions do profess.</p>
            <p>These are in briefe all the reasons that ever I could heare alledged by
any man for the justification of his refusal; and to the end that his error
may not be coloured or maintained by the shew and shadow of these
simple reasons, I will briefly confute every one of them in order. True
it is that there is no streighter tie, no surer stay, no stronger hold to
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>joyn and knit the hearts of Subjects together, then is the conformitie
and unitie of religion; and that the readiest way to sever and separate their
Affections is to set them at strife and variance for Religion; In regard
whereof diverse wise men and grave counsellors have advised their Kings
to take heed that no kinde of heresie creep into their kingdoms, to resist
the first beginni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g of any heresie whatsoever, and to foresee that no new
opinion enter into the hearts of their Subjects; and if any by chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to finde never so small entrance, to labor by all meanes possible to
remove the same. For variety of opinions easily ingendred, findeth
meanes to increase without great difficulti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and having once penetrated,
into the interior cogitations of mens hearts, so ravisheth their
senses, blindeth their eyes, and obscur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th their judgements, that
they can neither see, nor discerne the truth from falshood, nor the
light from darkness, but so cleave and hold fast on their opinions, that
they will almost as soon and as willingly depart from their lives as from
their heresies. But if by reason of not opposing and withstanding the
beginning and increase of opinions, the number of Subjects professing
a Religion contrary to their Kings, be once grown to be equall or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ude of those which agree with him in opinion, there
are but two waies to reforme and order this disorder. The one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(as <hi>Dagabert</hi> King of France did) that all they that profess not the
same religion which their King doth, shall by a certain time appointed,
depart out of his Realme; and that those who remaine within the limits
of his kingdome, beyond the day prefixed, shall be held as Enemies unto
the State, and therefore be reputed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> worthie of present death. The
other, to permit them to continue in their Country, and to enjoy liberty
of conscience: The which way because it draweth nighest unto huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
seemeth unto mee best to bee followed: For since mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
ought to be free and at libertie, since no man may rightfully be
deprived of the benefit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by their Sufferance cannot be well punished without great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
unto their honor and reputation, and briefly since the life may be
more beneficial then the death of such Subjects unto their Kings, it
should undoubtedly be great Tyranny to deprive them either of their
lives or of their Country. But we are commanded in the Scriptures to

               </gap>ject him that is an Heretick after one or two admonitions: Wee are told,
that he that will not be obedient unto the Church, must be unto us as

no man deceive us, and that we keep not company with such men; how
then shall the religious converse with the Reprobate? How shall the
Papist live with the Protestant? And how can a Prince maintain both in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93045:77"/>
one Kingdome, in one City, in one Town, in one house? This is
all that can be alleaged against us out of the word of God, and by
these words the Protestants are not commanded to shun the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
nor the Papists to avoid the Protestan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

general taught to beware of vain Philosophers, of men delighting in
many speeches, of such as with vanity of words excuse sins, and mock at
at the Menaces and judgements of God; we are forbidden to give any
credit to their Philosophie, and humane reasons, to put any confidence
in their Traditions in their Fables, to be moved any thing at all with
their Miracles, to participate with them in their Doctrine and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and to admit them to conference or communication with us; this
commandement stretcheth not unto men varying somwhat from us in
Religion; these words forbid not the true worshippers of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

all respects as they do; For if this were a general commandement, then
all men not being well instructed or perswaded in Religion, should not be
admitted into the company of Christians. The Church of God from
the beginning hath withstood and infringed this commandement; yea
our Saviour Iesus Christ should seem to have given contrary comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements

this Commandement contrary unto the former? Or could they as they

Feet, whose life must be our guide, whose Actions must be our imitation,

of people, never having respect of men, nor careing of what profession they

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wes of peace were
made unto the <hi>Flemings;</hi> not because they that offered those conditions
of peace meant to performe them, but to make the world believe that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93045:78"/>
they were desirous of Peace; whereas indeed their tender of peace was
but to save themselves from the hazard of a Battel; when they saw there
was no way but to take it either with some great disadvantage, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it with great dishonour: Such offers of peace were those that have
been lately made unto the United Provinces; and such were they that
were tendered many years ago, by which the Spaniards received alwaies
some benefit; sometimes he got a Town, a Hold, or a Castle; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he distracted some of the Nobility from the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and at other times he avoided some eminent danger which could not
otherwise be escaped. This will appear most true and manifest unto as
many as shall read divers Apologies set out by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and
the States of the Low-Countries. And therefore I know not with what
conscience, or with what shew of truth, the cause of this Civil Discord
may be ascribed unto the Subjects of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and not unto the king of
<hi>Spain</hi> and his evil Officers.</p>
            <p>The first and second Reasons are sufficiently refuted; Now to the
third.</p>
            <p>He hath promised the Popes Holiness not to admit any other Religion
but his in any part of his kingdoms or Dominions. How is his promise
proved? What ground hath it? Upon what Reasons standeth it? He is
in some manner subject unto the Pope; Be it; he holdeth all or most of
his kingdoms and dominions of him: Let it be so; he beareth the title
of the Catholick king, as an especial gift from him or his Predecessors;
It shall not be denied. Lastly, it is he whose friendship and amity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
willed him to embrace and entertain; this must also be granted: But
what of all this? He may not break promise with his Holiness. True, if
the promise be possible; for no man is bound to things impossible. And
is this promise impossible? It is; or at least-wise like to a promise that
standeth upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpossibilities; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o God, without effusion of blood, without ruin of his
Estate, and without manifest and great prejudice unto his honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that may in some respect be esteemed impossible; and whosoever
maketh any such vow or promise, first, it had been very good that he had
never made it; and next<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it were very convenient never to put the same in
execution; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cause the sin that hurteth but one man alone, is much more
tolerable then that which may endanger many. This promise therefore,
if it were never made, but suggested, requireth no performance; and if it
were once made, it likewise ought not to be performed, because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
and cannot be maintained without great effusion of blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hurt unto many, and prejudice unto a whole estate. From this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

as to be repeated. For the Emperor <hi>Constans</hi> maintained the

of both Religions to live under their Government. The Emperor <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
granted leave and liberty unto his subjects of <hi>Silecia</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:93045:79"/>
which are Provinces of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to change their Religion. And not
long after him, <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor licensed them to build Churches
after the manner and fashion of Protestants. Besides the Pope himself,
the Dukes of <hi>Mantua, Ferrara, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Baviera,</hi> together with
the Seigniory of <hi>Venice</hi> suffer <hi>Iewes</hi> to live in their Country. And the
Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Moscovia</hi> vouchsafe to suffer a number of <hi>Tartarians</hi>
and <hi>Mahometists</hi> to lead their lives in their Countries, Imitating therein
the example of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who after that he had established
Christian Religion in <hi>Rome,</hi> excluded not any <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> out of

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93045:79"/>
not in any wise suffer two Religions to be professed in his kingdom; but
because he would plant one onely there, he made wars a great while
against his own subjects, destroying their houses, wasting their Fields, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating
their Cities, and Massacring their persons. But who gave him
Counsel so to do? Was it not the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or his Pensioners? And
what advantage got he therefore? Truly no other but the ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of his Country: And what end had he of his war before he died?
Forsooth such an end as made him to repent that ever he undertook
those wars: And what continuance had these wars? Certainly they last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above thirty years, and the Protestants are now stronger then ever
they were. And what issue is come of these French troubles? Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the issue was such, that whereas the Realm was divided but into two
Factions, a little before the Kings death there were three; and of those
three the last was most unjust, pernitious, and execrable; For in the same
one Papist killed another, the son bore Arms against the father, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against the seed of his mothers womb, and the subjects (being in
their opinion of a good Religion) against their King, whose Religion was
as good or better then theirs. It is not then the French kings examples

               </gap>ck Majesty to be directed
by other Princes what to grant or what to deny to his subjects: This is
the last, and in effect the best of his Reasons. For it is usual amongst
Princes, and therefore no shame to crave counsel, advice and direction one
of another, in matters of great weight and moment; and happy ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s faithfull Friends abroad gave him: Thence it cometh that Princes
send Ambassadors one unto another, that they crave conference one
with another, that they have oftentimes Interviews and solemn Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and according to this custom he either dissembleth egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
or meant truly, that the Ambassadors sent by the Emperor,
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and other Princes of late years to <hi>Cullen,</hi>
should have ended all contentions and controversies betwixt him and
his Subjects. Again, this was no direction but an admonition,
no counsel but a request, and such a request as might rather have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
then disgraced him: For had it not been a great glory and
commendation unto him, not onely to have listened, but also to have
submitted himself unto the motion and final judgment of so many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Princely Intercessors? Was it, think you, a dishonour
unto <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Castile, and to <hi>Garsias</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
that they referred the contention betwixt them for the bounds and
limits of their Kingdoms unto the judgement and decision of <hi>Henry</hi>
the second, King of <hi>England?</hi> Wise Princes rather then they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into wars, or being at wars continue therein, do usually commit
their controversies sometimes to the determination of their equals, and
sometimes to their far inferiours; and although the cause be far greater,
and of more weight then the controversie betwixt the Spanish King
and his Subjects was, yet they have been content to stand to their
doom and judgement. The contention betwixt <hi>Artobazenes</hi> and <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi>
was one of the most famous and intricate questions that hath been
betwixt Prince and Prince; <hi>Artobazenes</hi> challenged the Kingdom
of the Medians,<note place="margin">Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> because he was the first begotten son of his father
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93045:80"/>
               <hi>Darius;</hi> and <hi>Zerzes</hi> thought himself worthy to be preferred, because his
Father was but a private man when his Brother was begotten, and a
King whenas he begat him; and therefore his Fathers private Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
belonged in his opinion unto his Brother, but the Kingdom
was his own Inheritance; the rather because <hi>Artobazenes</hi> came not
onely of a private man, but also of a Mother and Grandfather by the
Mothers side which were not Princes, whereas both his Mother and
Grandfather had kings to their Fathers. This contention by mutual
consent was referred unto the Uncle <hi>Artipherus,</hi> who after due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Cause, gave the Kingdom unto <hi>Zerzes;</hi> and this
judgement hath ever since remained, and been held for a lawfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

and to understand whether the same shall be profitable or glorious,
honest or commendable for him, it shall be very expedient to enter
into a particular consideration of the powers, qualities, conditions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93045:80"/>
and means of every one of these Allies; For although some, or most of
them have been spoken of before, when we handled their abilities and
means to hurt and annoy him; yet it shall not be now amiss to declare
what strength and sufficiency they have to help and further his intents and
purposes: The Pope as Christs Vicar, the Holy Father of the Church,

in this Alliance; For albeit he very seldom entereth into League with
Princes that are of less might then himself; yet be his confederates
never so great, let their charges never so much exceed his, and their
Armies (be they by Sea or by Land) far excel his, as well in number as

               </gap>cated by him; but because I shall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder accompt both Kings and meaner Potentates
have made of his turbulent and thundering Excommunications, I will leave
them, and come unto his demean, unto his treasure: For the better
determination whereof I think it convenient to declare unto you what
kinde of men our Popes are of late dayes; some of them are poor Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
of base parentage, brought up in beggery, advanced by corruption
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93045:81"/>
and preferred unto that Dignity by Bribes, Rewards aud Simony; And
they who have been of best birth amongst them, have been but the
younger brothers of Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> or of some
like mean Prince, and all of them have most commonly spent their poor
patrimony, and the small gains of their former life in the attaining of their
Pontifical Dignity. Besides when they come unto the height of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
either they spend their Revenues prodigally (as did <hi>Paulus Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who in less then fifteen years wasted 25 millions of Gold; or spare the
same thriftily to buy some estate for their children, as did <hi>Gregory</hi> the
13th; so that what with prodigal spending, what with extream covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
tending to the advancement of their posterity, the Popes have not
much money otherwise to help their Allies and Confederates. Moreover,
who so shal consider that their yearly Revenues are mightily decreased, by
by reason that <hi>Bohemia, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Scotland, Holland,
England,</hi> and most of <hi>France, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> are fallen from
their Obedience, and vouchsafe not to send them yearly such Tributes,
Pensions, Tenths and other Commodities as they were wont to receive
from them, must needs understand and confess, that there can arise no
great profit from their Alliance and Confederacy: The terrour of their
interdictions, of which some Princes, more Religious then wise, have in
times past made some small accompt; The regard of their Authority, of
which when their vertues were more then now they are, greater reckoning
was made then is at this present; &amp; the converting of their <hi>Crociados</hi> which
were wont to be imployed in holy Wars, into profane uses, are the onely
means and benefits wherewith they are now able to pleasure their best
friends. Leaving them therefore to their passions and extreme sorrows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for the small hope which they have to recover their losses, which
is in no respect answerable to the extremity of their desire, I will descend

any such strength; and he is greatly deceived that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an opinion of their might and power, The best guard that they have is
the reciprocal fear which one of them hath of another, the continual and
great jealousie which is betwixt them, and the small and slender Love
which one of them beareth unto another, every one of them not onely
enveighing, but also withstanding by all means possible the advancement
of the other, be it in wealth or in credit, in power or preheminence:
Their Subjects are not warlike; their best Souldiers are (as you have heard)
of no great value or estimation; their Courage is soon cooled, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are quickly defeated; there best Captains by reason of their long
Peace, are of mean experience, and their is scant any Town, City or
Country that is not a witness of their Cowardise, Adversity, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
and servitude; you shall hear hereafter what discommodities
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93045:81"/>
may arise unto those Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> which have unadvisedly entered into
this League, and therefore from them unto the Peers of <hi>France;</hi> These
Princes are no other then Traitors, Rebels, and Conspirators against their
Prince and Country; And therefore detestable before God, odious unto
the world, and execrable unto their Post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rity; For although Princes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Common saying, like such Treason as any wise is beneficial
unto them; yet all men hate and abhor Traitors, especially such as these
be, who having received great honour, pleasure, and prefermen of their

seize upon the Kings own person, their desire to bring him to <hi>Paris</hi> as a
Prisoner, their carriage towards him there, and their preparation, Army
and Hostility against him after his departure from thence, do abundantly
testifie and declare their Treason; now what honour can it be unto the

be ashamed to receive them into their Company, or to harbour them in
their houses? For I find in the Histories of <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that
whenas the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth intending to honour the Duke of
<hi>Burbon,</hi> who had revolted from his King unto his service, prayed one of
the chief and principal Dukes of <hi>Spain</hi> to lodge him in his Palace; the
Duke shewing himself therein a greater Enemy to Traitors, then a
Friend to Treason, answered the Emperor, that both he and his house
were at his Majesties commandment; but if that it pleased him to lodge
the Duke therein, he would set fire thereon as soon as the Duke should be
out of it, as on a house infected with the Treason of <hi>Burbon.</hi> But <hi>Francis</hi>
the first King of <hi>France</hi> used the like help of the Turks and Infidels to be
revenged upon his Enemies; and <hi>Lewis Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> to make

            <p>The great and large Priviledges which belong unto Princes appointed
by God to rule and governe his people, make me forbeare to say so much
as I might say in this place; and yet I may not spare to reprehend and
condemne the bad Consciences of those Consciousles Councellors who
have perswaded the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to forget and forgo his honour, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
his blood, and his Parentage, to joyne himself with those who
may increase the number, but not the Forces of his Allies. I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard say that the end honoureth all the rest of a mans life;<note place="margin">Finis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronat opus.</note> that the
elder a man is, the wiser he should be; that the Actions of al men that are
placed in high degree and dignity, are subject to the view, the sight, the

               </gap>; and
briefly that all men with open mouth speake boldly and freely that of
Princes when they are dead which they durst not muter whilest they lived.
I could with therefore, that either the vertues of the late French King, or
the affinitie, conjunction and parentage that was betwixt these two
Crownes, or the conformitie of their religion, or the remembrance of
the greatness and power of <hi>France</hi> might have been able to have diverted
and withdrawn the mightie Monarch of <hi>Spain</hi> from the Amitie of those

which misleadeth the greatest and wisest Princes of the world,
with a vaine hope of good success and prosperous fortune in all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
hath turned his love into hatred, and covered the spots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th that the custome of Princes is to receive into their protection
such Subjects as other Princes have banished ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of their Realms (although
in truth this kinde of Clemency ought to be shewed and extended unto
Princes only which are constrained by necessity to flie from their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,

               </gap>emies; it seemeth (I say) that this
custome doth somwhat excuse the Spanish Kings indiscretion in this action:
But wise men consider not so much what men do as what they ought
to do; and true Glory consisteth in vertue, and not in shew or shadow
of vertue; and as <hi>Caesar</hi> would not have her to wife who was more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
by suspition then by action, so it becometh the Princes of our time
to hate those who are vicious, not in deed onely, but in common fame
also; especially whenas it is in question whether the friendship of a kinsman
be to be preferred before the Amitie of a Stranger; of a king before that
of a Subject; of one that is equall in power to the greatest Prince of the
world, before those who depend wholy upon the power and authoritie of
others.</p>
            <p>And undoubtedly the Guisards of <hi>France</hi> have no other Credit, strength

the late French King and his predecessors, the which in time will decay
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93045:83"/>
and returne unto the place and person from whence it came; even as rivers
returne unto the Sea, from whence they have their first original and being.
I may therefore boldly say, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath carried himself
very indiscreetly in entring into League with these Guisards for four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
causes.</p>
            <p>The first because the shame and dishonour which will arise thereby shal
alwaies continue,<note place="margin">Four causes proving the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to League with the <hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or
voluntary silence of the Authors and writers of our time.</p>
            <p>The second, because the profit arising thereby will be of small con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
The third because the quarrel betwixt him and France proceeding
thereof will be both dangerous and immortall. The fourth, because the
hatred ingendred by this quarrell will rekindle the fire of old dissentions,
and revive the memorie of ancient rights, titles and Interests which the
Crown of France pretendeth unto diverse States lately fallen unto the
house of Spain. For the dishonor which is gotten by wicked waies, cannot
so be buried in silence but that it will alwaies be reported by the Father
unto the child,<note place="margin">Fama crescit eundo.</note> and by that child unto his posterity, alwaies finding increase
and augmentation by the report which is made thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is and alwaies hath been the nature of man to remember one only
error, evill deed or oversight of a Prince far better then many of his
vertues, valiant exployts, or wise and discreet Actions; Witness the
common consent and accord of all Historiographers as wel of ancient time
as of our Age, who although in other things they be oftentime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

contrary the one unto the other, yet they agree very well in this point,
that they all as it were with one mouth and one voyce, speak ill in their
writings of the wisest Philosophers; Orators, Emperors, Kings, Princes
and Captains that ever were in the world.</p>
            <p>So the Author that greatly busied himself in commending <hi>Alcibiades,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his life.</note>

too superfluous and effeminate in his usuall Attire; To maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in which things he often times took dishonest rewards and was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

that he had lett out his money at Interest, that he became so severe in
time that he took a very young damsell descended of base Parantage to

recounting the Valor, Magnanimitie, and vertues of <hi>Titus Quintus Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and of <hi>Philopaemon,</hi> two notable Captains, was so bold as to say, that
the one was Ambitious, Turbulent, and easie to be displeased; and the

So <hi>Pompey</hi> sirnamed the great, who had these qualities to make him well
beloved, Temperance in his Life, Dexterity in Armes, Eloquence in his
Speech, Faith and loyaltie in his Word, good Grace in his behavior,
and an Amiable Carriage towards all men that had to deale with him,
was hated, and in the end ruinated, because he would endure no Superior.
So <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who hath this commendation, that he took a thousand
Cities by Assault, subdued more then 300 sundry Nations, took above
a Million of Men prisoners, and slew better then an other Million in the
Field (the least of which things the best Captain of our Age never was
nor will be able to do) is greatly blamed, not only because he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted

of everlasting Ignominy.</p>
            <p>But now to declare unto you that this League cannot be of any long
continuance, I will use these few demonstrations.</p>
            <p>First, as many as have read either Ancient or Modern Histories, shall
easilie perceive by them, that Fortune, or rather the Eternal, never gave
unto Rebels any long Continuance of their prosperitie.</p>
            <p>Next, the Common People which easilie forsake the heads and chief
of their Rebellion, depart from them so soon as they perceive that their
strength decayeth; then feare, jealousie, suspition, distrust, and diffidence
alwaies attend upon Rebels to dismay, daunt and terrifie them.</p>
            <p>And lastly, these great and Archtraytors are beset with so many d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

that it is impossible for them to attain unto their pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pose. For if
there be many that are equall in Authoritie, credit and reputation, the
one alwais distrusteth the other; And if there be but one upon whom
the rest do depend, he must of necessitie please him that cometh nighest
unto him in Authoritie, least that he make the way hard and difficult
for him to worke his desire and pleasure. He must content the common
People, sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hardness and impossibilitie, because the desires of the Nobilitie,
People and Soldiers are most commonly contrary, and tend to diverse
purposes, the first seeking for advancement, the second for Peace, and
Tranquillitie, and the third Coveting nothing more then the continuance
of War. Moreover whereas the wisest amongst them begin to consider
that they have violated the Lawes, offended their Kings Majestie,

hold out long. And although fortune should show herself so favorable
unto these Traytors, as that they might, in process of time, effect and

strong to yeild unto his motions; hee perceiveth that he must keep them

succoured them, he withdraweth his forces and leaveth them somtimes
in such distress that the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> is constrained to forget that he

but that he was right glad to see his partakers reduced to so great an

to exercise all kinde of Hostility against the Spaniards, as soon as it shall

And if you remember what hath been said of the Strength of <hi>France,</hi> you
will think that the means which the French king may have to be revenged
of these wrongs, are far greater; and so in this respect the Spanish king
hath shewed his indiscretion in entring into League with the Guisards; Of
whose Friendship I pray you let us now consider what hold and good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
he may have.<note place="margin">That the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards can have no good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers firm friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> There are divers kindes of assurances to be taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
some content themselves with the faithfull promise of their Allies;
others require Hostages; many demand to have some Holds and Towns of
strength in their custody: and there be such as never think themselves safe
or well assured, unless they unarm their confederates; But the strongest and
best bond is, in the opinion of the wisest, a firm conjunction and binding of
the Allies together by the way of Wedlock. Now of all these sorts of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
which hath the king of <hi>Spain</hi> taken? Or which of them can he take
without shewing himself very indiscreet? May he content himself with the
faithfull promise of his Allies? Will they hold their promise unto him
who have violated their faith unto their Liege Lord and Sovereign? Hath
he taken Hostages of them? Will they carefull of other mens lives, who
have so small care of their own? Will they give him any strong holds?
With what reason can he detain them, since both they that give them have
no authority or sufficient power to deliver them up into his hands, and he is
not strong enough to keep and defend them when the hath them? Will he
unarm them? Take their weapons from them, and what good can they do
him? Will he make them assured to be at his devotion by a fast bond and
linck of marriage? What honour, or rather shame shall it be for him to
mingle his Blood, his Honour, and his House with the Infamy, Dishonour,
and Ignominy of Rebels and Traytors? But of Traytors some one of them
will become a king: O poor and unadvised Prince, who shall spend his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to honour him who deserveth no honour, and of whose faithfull
friendship he can have no fast assurance. But how shall he become a King?
By the Forces of <hi>Spain?</hi> O simple and indiscreet King, who thinketh to
purchase a great and invincible Kingdom from a Stranger, when he is not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93045:87"/>
able to recover a poor Country taken from him by his own Subjects. But
by what means, and by what colour shall he become a King? By the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and imitation of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who (as you have heard) was made
King by shewing unto the Pope and the People of <hi>France,</hi> that in choosing
a King, the man that is present ought to be preferred before him that is
absent; he that governeth in Person, before him that ruleth by a Deputy;
he that is both carefull and vertuous, before him that is careless and vicious.
But what manner of imitation is this, unless you call it an imitation when as
a man doth all things quite contrary to his Actions whom he proposeth to
himself to follow and imitate? For he that was deposed by <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>
governed by his Lieutenant, and the present King of <hi>France</hi> ruleth by his
own person; he was hated by reason of his great negligence, and this King
was beloved for his great pains and diligence: He was insufficient to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and this King hath given many Experiments of his great wit and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency;
And to be short, This <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who is proposed as a man
worthy to be imitated by the Arch-Traitor that would make himself king of
<hi>France,</hi> used as his most principle reason this Argument to shew that <hi>Charles</hi>
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Uncle unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the fifth, deserved not to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
king, because that in all controversies that fell out in his time betwixt the
Empire and the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> the said <hi>Charles</hi> shewed himself more
affectionate and friendly unto the Emperor then unto the French King.
How blinde then are those Guisards, who cannot see that when they shall
desire the people to make choice of one amongst them to be their King, the
greater part will hardly yeeld to their motion? they will cry out that their
King is yet alive, that it is not reason to take the crown from his head, and
to put it upon a Strangers, or upon one of his inferiour Vassals; that many
can witness, that in all contentions betwixt. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
shewed themselves more favourable unto <hi>Spain,</hi> then unto their own
Country; And lastly, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> because he was a Prince of
the Empire, had more Reason to favour the Emperor then the Guisards
have to befriend the Spanish king, whom they should hate and abhorre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loveth not their Country.<note place="margin">A Book written in Latine as it is supposed by the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Lyons.</note> You have seen the Spanish kings indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion

League<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s great solly in subscribing thereunto. The Causes which moved them
to enter into this League, were (as you understand already) very many: But
it appears not how true, or rather how false their pretentions are: This must
be discovered, and then their folly cannot be concealed.</p>
            <p>They lay to their late kings charge, that he was an Heretick, a Parricide,
a wicked and impious despiser of God, a Tyrant, and Hypocrite, a perjured
Prince, and a man given over to all kinde of vice and wickedness.</p>
            <p>They charge him further, that he wasted the Revenues of the Crown,
and that he committed many other follies long since mentioned. To all
these,<note place="margin">The same Authors accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> that their malice, falsehood and folly may appear, I will answer
briefly; A full denial of all that they say might serve for mine answer, were
it not that I seek by reason and truth to confound them that have neither
reason nor truth. I must therefore run thorow the kings life, and to purge
him of the crime of Heresie, I think it convenient to declare what he did
both before and after he was king, against those whom the Leaguers term
Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Now to omit other matters, testifying his great zeal and affection unto
the Roman Catholicks before he was king of France, I will prove the same
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93045:87"/>
by four principal Arguments. First, it is apparent unto the world, that he
was one of the chief Authors of the Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was general
through <hi>Erance,</hi> and practised with a great hope utterly to extirpe all the
Protestants in <hi>France:</hi> Next, it is certain that no Prince living could shew
greater hatred, stomach, or courage against men of a contrary Religion unto
himself, then he did at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> before which he lay, until he was
fetcht thence into <hi>Poland.</hi> Thirdly, it is notorious unto as many as know
any thing of his Election unto the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that more estranged the Affections of the Electors from him, then his
great hatred shewed against the Protestants, both in the time of the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre,
and also at the siege to <hi>Rochel;</hi> Insomuch that Mr. of <hi>Valence,</hi> who
was his Ambassador unto the Electors, was fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to publish a Book, wherein
he more cunningly then truly derived the fault and crime of that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssacre
from him unto the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who took the same in so evil part, that
after the king was est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>blished in <hi>Poland,</hi> the said Duke published an other
book wherein he cleared himself, and layed the chief blame upon the late
French king. Lastly, whenas he had ruled a while in <hi>Poland</hi> and saw the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of Religions there, he loathed the Country, detested their opinions,
and could hardly be brought to take the Oath which bound him to permit
and tolerate a plurality of Religions in that kingdom.</p>
            <p>But it may be thought, that as many Princes have shewed themselves
honest,<note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jection.</note> vertuous and religious before they were kings, to the end they might
the better attain unto a kingdom; so he being assured by his Mother, and by
a vain prophesie, that she should live to see all her sons kings, and knowing
that he should hardly come to the kingdom unless he gave some manifest
signes of his zeal in Religion, during the time that he lived as a Subject under
his Brother, repressed his nature, dissembled his manners and disguised his
Religion, that Heresie might not be a bar unto him for the kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the refuting of this Objection, I shall have occasion to confound ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Actions together,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> which will serve to confute some other crimes
layed to his charge. When his bother <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth died, he was in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where hearing he news of his death, he took such a course for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from thence, as highly commendeth his wisdom, and manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
his great and natural love and affection unto his native Country, with
which course it shall be very requisite and expedient to acquaint you
throughly, because his Adversaries draw from hence their principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove his Infidelity, and the beginning of his evil Government;
for where as he was (say they) bound by faithfull promise and oath to cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in <hi>Poland,</hi> and to have an especial care of the Wealth and welfare of
that Country, he left and abandoned them when they had most need of him,
as may appear by the Letter that was sent unto him after his departure, by
the principle Peers, Nobles and Senators of that Realm. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto any that know the State of <hi>France,</hi> and are conversant in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the later Accidents thereof, that he was very unwilling to go into
<hi>Poland,</hi> because that he saw that his brother was not likely to live long, and
that he dying, in his absence the kingdom, which was alwayes to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> might be wrongfully tranferred unto his
Brother, or unto some other whom his Brothers young years, or his
absence might encourage to affect the same. This consideration mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him not to give his consent unto that journey, before that his
Mother faithfully promised to revoke him with all possible diligence,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93045:88"/>
if his Brother should chance to die. And some write, that at his departure,
his mother, whether it were to make him the more willing to goe, or that
she was resolved to take such order that Charles the ninth should not live
long, said unto him; Take not his departure (my son) grievously, for it
shall not be long before thou shalt returne: Let it be spoken either to
comfort and encourage him; or with her foreknowledg and prejudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
he was scant setled in <hi>Poland</hi> when a Messenger came unto him,
to signifie his brothers death; This Message being delivered, he wisely and
providently called together the Nobilitie of <hi>Poland,</hi> imparted unto them his
Brothers death, required their Counsel in a case of such difficulty as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed his Wits, and not lightly troubled the wisest amongst them.</p>
            <p>The first thing that was decreed, was, that the Nobles should mourne
for him, in the same manner, and with the same solemnities that they us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually
observe in mourning for their own Kings, whereby they signified their
great love which they bore him.</p>
            <p>The next matter that was resolved, was to dispatch a present Messenger
into <hi>France,</hi> with Letters of Credit unto the Queen his mother, requiring
her for him to take upon her the Regency of <hi>France,</hi> untill his returne.</p>
            <p>And the third Conclusion of their consultation was, to call a general
Assembly of the States, and therein to deliberate and consult what might
be best for the King to do, whether to returne into <hi>France,</hi> or to continue
and remaine in <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this interim, he calling to minde the trubulent Estate of <hi>France,</hi> the
young years of his Brother, and the Ambitious and aspiring minds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the French Nobility: And li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>wise understanding, that the Peers
of <hi>Poland</hi> fearing his suddain departure, were about to take some order for
preventing the same, determined with himself to depart thence before his
going should be known, aswell because he would not have the same hindred
and crossed by the Nobilitie; as for that he knew it would be very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for him to pass homeward through the Countries of divers Princes that
bore him no great good will, if he should depart thence as that they might
have any foreknowledg and intelligence of the time of his departure, and of
the way which he went in returning into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This resolution thus taken, he writeth a letter with his owne hands unto
those in whome he reposed greatest confidence, and signified unto them,
that since the time of their last conference, he had received such Intelligence
out of <hi>France,</hi> as gave him just occasion to hasten thither in Poste, and
not to attend the general Assembly of the States of <hi>Poland;</hi> he promiseth
to returne so soon as he could conveniently; prayeth them to excuse his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
departure unto the rest of the Nobilitie; And for such matters as his
leisure would not permitt him to committ unto his Letter, he desireth them
to give credit unto a faithfull Counsellor of his, whom he left behinde him
with further instructions for them: The Nobilitie understanding by his
owne Letter, and these mens reports (marke the love they bore him, and
the care which they have of him) sent presently a Nobleman in Poste after
him, to beseech him to returne; and wrote their Letter un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Emperor
to certifie his Majestie, that his hastie returne into <hi>France</hi> proceeded not of
any offence given unto the King by them, nor of any evil opinion conceived
by the King against them, but of some urgent occasion requiring his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in <hi>France:</hi> They rested not here; but when they saw that he returned
not in such time as they looked for him, they wrote a large Letter unto
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93045:88"/>
him wherein they declared how lovingly they consented to choose him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a number of other P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nces that were competitors with him; how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
they sent for him into <hi>France,</hi> how royally they received him; how
dutifully they carried themselves towards him; how carefully they provided
for the safety of both his kingdoms, aswell of that which came unto him by
discent, as of that which he received from their Election; how greatly he
was honoured by their choice, and how dangerously he had forsaken
them: they prayed his returne if it might stand with his good liking, if it
mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> be to his benefit; if not, they humbly besought him to consider in
what danger they stood of Forreine Enemies, what troubles hung over their
heads by reason of the hatred and quarrels that were betwixt them and the
Princes of <hi>Walachia, Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Muscovia,</hi> and how needfull and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s for them not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be long without a King, whose presence might
comfort them, whose counsel might advise them, whose experience might
direct them, whose Authoritie might govern them, and whose Credit
might countenance them. They forgot not the Inconveniences that had
hapned unto them since his departure, nor the difficulty and impossibility
to provide for their redress, and their owne safetie without his presence; for
that it is an inviolable Law in <hi>Poland,</hi> that although the States of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
have decreed Wars against an Enemy, yet it can neither be denounced
nor prosecuted without the consent and suffrage of their King.</p>
            <p>These necessities being thus expressed, they set him down a peremptory
day within which to returne, with a plaine intimation, that if he shall not
returne by that day, they will proceed unto the Election of an other King;
beseeching him not to thinke that they will choose another for that they are
weary of him, or desirous to forsake him; there is no such conceit lodged
in their hearts, no such Cogitation entred into their heads; but they and
he must consider that <hi>Poland</hi> is so situated, that barbarous Enemies do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
it on every side, and that it is the stay of all <hi>Christendom,</hi> and that
therefore it behooveth them to be carefull when others are negligent, and
to watch that others might keep in quiet without danger. And lastlie, that
these premises well and dulie considered, such a kingdome cannot be long
without an Head, without a Captaine, without a King.</p>
            <p>He receiveth these Letters, and they receiving no such Answer from him
as might assure them of his returne unto them by the day appointed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a new Election: And hence his Enemies derive their best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to condemne him of Infideltie, and Heresie; Of Infidelitie, in that
he returned not according to his promise; and of Heresie, in that living
there amongst a number of sundry Sects, and Sectaries, he learned to bear
with Heretiques.</p>
            <p>I finde in the Histories of <hi>Poland,</hi> that when the States had agreed upon
his Election, the Ambassadors which he had sent into <hi>Poland</hi> about those
Affairs, were sworne in the name and behalfe of their Master, by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> to maintaine, uphold, conserve, and increase the
Ancient Laws, Rights, Liberties, and Immunities of the kingdome of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and of the great Dukedome of <hi>Lituania.</hi> The which Oath being
thus taken, the Palatine of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> being high Marshall of the Kingdom
of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the great Captaine of <hi>Samogitia,</hi> being Marshal of the great
Dukedome of <hi>Lituania,</hi> presently proclame him King of Poland, and
Duke of <hi>Lituania:</hi> Here is no promise to abide with them for ever; Here
is no Oath not to returne againe into <hi>France;</hi> Here is no Bond to tie him to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93045:89"/>
continuall Residence: And though he promised to return at his departure,
yet you shall understand, that although he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would have return'd, yet
hee had small occasion to return unto them: For first the kingdom of
<hi>France</hi> is farr better then that of <hi>Poland;</hi> Next few Princes have ever
left their native Countries unto the Government and administration of a
Lieutenant, to rule themselves in a Forreign Dominion: Then hee found
his own kingdom at his return, in such broyles and contentions, that hee
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld not possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly appease them to return into <hi>Poland</hi> at his day prefixed:
And lastly, they not admitting his lawfull excuses, chose another king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e refused to come back unto them.</p>
            <p>This last cause is sufficient to excuse his not returning into that kingdom:
And this is so true, that when I was in <hi>Italy,</hi> I remember that it was a fresh
news that the <hi>Polacks</hi> had sent an Ambassador unto the <hi>Pope</hi> to excuse
their suddain choise of their new King, and to do such ceremonies unto the
<hi>Pope</hi> as in such cases is required. This Ambassador p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssed by <hi>Padua,</hi> where
I saw him, and hee staied there so long, that he spent all the money that was
allowed for his Journy to <hi>Rome</hi> and home again, before he went thence.
The cause of his long stay, was the Protestation that was made by the
<hi>French</hi> Ambassador residing then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and requiring the <hi>Pope</hi> not to
accept of the said Ambassador, as an Ambassador sent unto him by the
lawfull King of <hi>Poland,</hi> because the <hi>French</hi> King his Master had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
his Right and Title unto that Crown: And the validity of this
exception was so long in debating, that intimation being given to the
<hi>Poland</hi> Ambassador not to proceed any further on his Journy towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> untill the same question was fully decided, he was enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so long as I have said in <hi>Padua,</hi> to the great hinderance of himself, and
of all his company. Besides, as our Kings still carry the Title of Kings of
<hi>France,</hi> in remembrance of their Right unto that kingdom; so the late
King of <hi>France</hi> ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sed himself to be called King of <hi>Poland</hi> untill his dying
day, in token that he never had resigned his Interest and claime there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>This Argument brought against his fidelitie is sufficiently refelled.
It resteth to refute the exception made against his carriage and Government
in <hi>Poland.</hi> This shall need no great Confutation, because it appeareth by
the aforementioned letters of the Senato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s unto him, and the Emperor
after his departure, that there was no d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aty which was made unto him to return, testifieth the
good opinion, hope, and confidence which they had to be well and wisely
ruled by him.</p>
            <p>Now whereas it is said, that he learned to bee favourable unto Hereticks
in <hi>Poland:</hi> It may be that he conversed with some of them whilst hee was
there, because he could not otherwise do (their generall Assemblies and
meetings requiring his presence, and consisting of such Peeres and Nobles
as were of diverse Religions) But it appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h by his letters written unto
his especiall Friends of that kingdom when he departed thence, that he
had no great confidence or trust in them that were contrary unto him in
Religion. For, besides the letter that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93045:90"/>
This is the kings behaviour and carriage before the holy League, the
which beginneth in the year, 1585.</p>
            <p>Of this League three especial causes are pretended; The Troubles of
<hi>France,</hi> the kings sterility, and the right of succession, which belongeth
unto the king of Navarr. By the confederates in this League these things
are required; That the Catholick Religion, and the Nobility that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the same, may be restored unto their ancient dignity; That a Parliament
might be called, that Tributes may be gathered for the king and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that extraordinary exactions may be mitigated; that ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry third
year a Parliament may be held. And lastly, that an Army of 16000. foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and 3000 horse may be gathered and maintained with the kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against the Hugonets, and the same Army to be lead by the kings own
person, or by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as his Lieutenant General. They set fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th
an Apology containing their Griefs and these Petitions, and end the same
with a promise to lay down their weapons, if the king will be content to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to these Articles, and to overthrow the Protestants.</p>
            <p>The king of Navarr finding himself to be the mark whereat these Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers
shot, published his Apology, proveth himself to be no Heretick,
Apostate, Persecutor, or Rebel; sheweth that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> is the
onely Perturber of the peace and quiet of <hi>France,</hi> and that he cannot feel
the wound thereof because he is a stranger; and lastly, for the ending of
all troubles without more effusion of blood, challengeth the combat.</p>
            <p>The late King published likewise his Answer to every Article, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
that all these things shall be done answerable to Gods Word and the
prescript rule of Justice; praying the Leaguers, that since both he and the
Queen are yet young enough to have children, and that children are the
Gift of God, they will not rashly think him to be without all hope of
children.</p>
            <p>Here I might trouble you with the rehearsal of many examples of many
Rebels like unto these, who when their demands have been so reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
answered as these were, desisted from wars, or had but an evil is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
But I must restrain my self, and labour to be short, otherwise I shall
be both too long and tedious. What could a king, nay the most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
king of the world, the mightiest king of <hi>Europe,</hi> do more then this king
did? Or what would they require more at this kings hands then he
performed? He entered not into this League; would not be one of
their confederates; <hi>Hinc nostri fundi Calamitas;</hi> But he seemeth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the proscription and disinheritance of <hi>Navarr;</hi> he banisheth all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
out of the Realm; he answereth the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who becometh
a sutor for them, that he neither can nor will have Peace with them; he
writeth to the Prince of <hi>Germany,</hi> who likewise intreated his favour for the
Protestants, That he knoweth well enough what to do without their counsel,
and marvelleth that they have so great leisure as to meddle with other mens
matters, and especially with such things wherewith they have nothing
to do.</p>
            <p>This is not enough; He provideth an Army against the Protestants, he
sendeth to encounter with the Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> that were coming into
<hi>France</hi> to succour them; The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> overthroweth them; and the
kings Brother-in-Law, the Duke of <hi>Ioyesa</hi> is overthrown by the king of
<hi>Navarr,</hi> with the loss of his own life, and of 12000. of his Souldiers. The
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> made proud and insolent with this victory, and having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93045:90"/>
above 120000 Crowns by the spoiles of the Enemies returneth to <hi>Paris,</hi>
boasteth of his conquest, preferreth himself before his idle &amp; loytering king,
(as he termeth him discovereth his secret intentions more openly then he
did before, and seeketh how he either might make away the king, or thrust
him to a Monastery. And when he heard that his secret practices were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
unto the king by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> he is sore troubled, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to free himself from all manner of suspition; What way taketh he
to bring this to pass? Submitteth he himself unto the king? Cleareth he
himself of the Accusations laid to his charge? Craveth he pardon of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency?
He doth; But how? Forsooth, in such manner, that even a man
with one eye might easily see that he dissembleth. He cometh to <hi>Paris</hi> with
a small Troop, but so disposeth his Army that his intention to carry away
the king by force could not be hidden. He craveth conference with the
king, is admitted to his presence; They spend three whole dayes together
in conference; he so playeth his part, that the king leaveth to suspect him,
removeth the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> from the Court and his company, who
had revealed his secrets, and is angry with the said Duke for accusing him
wrongfully. What followeth? God who knoweth the inward thoughts
of all men, and hath an especial care of Princes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afety, by a sudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
accident, layeth open his dissimulation, and bewrayeth the Dukes
Treachery.</p>
            <p>The king seeing that armed men came into <hi>Paris</hi> in great Troopes by
night and day, setteth his Switzers to watch and ward in every street of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ortuned that a Switzer by chance was striken by a Parisian, with
whom he had some private quarrel; hereof followeth a great slaughter. The
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> committeth the Switzers to prison, besetteth the <hi>Lover</hi>
with a Garison of Souldiers: The king beginneth to be afraid, he fleeth
from <hi>Paris</hi> secretly, taketh his mother thence with him, commende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> his Faith and Loyalty, and escapeth the danger of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that lay in wait for his life, for that time, but is to die the death within a
short time after, not by the sharp and merciless sword of the proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Duke (which had been more Princelike) but by a short and poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
knife of a Jacobin Fryer, which was too base a death for the greatest
Monarch of the World.</p>
            <p>But again to the Duke; who hearing that the king began to sound the
depth of his Treasons, and to suspect all his proceedings, to remove his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doubts, and to recover his good opinion, sendeth certain Ambassadors
unto him, (if they may be termed Ambassadors that go from a Rebel unto
a king) of his own, and of diverse Cities and Provinces which he had drawn
to his own Faction, and had alwayes ready at hand. By the mouth of these
Ministers (sufficiently instructed what to say) he protested that nothing was
further from his thoughts then to seize upon the kings person; For if he
had had any such minde, any such intention, he might have wrought his
pleasure upon him when he had him in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore he desireth, that the Duke of <hi>Espernons</hi> malice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
Accusations might carry no credit, at the least-wise not breed any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and discredit.</p>
            <p>Next, that whatsoever hath been heretofore done, or said, might be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in oblivion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and his brother Mr. <hi>de Valetta</hi>
might be banished the Court disturbers of the Common Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93045:91"/>
Fourthly, that the Government of <hi>Normandy</hi> might be given unto the
holy League.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that his Brother the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> might be created great
Master of the kings Pallace, and the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> made Governor
of all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, that two Armies might belevied, and maintained at the kings
charges against the Hugonets, and one of them to be sent into <hi>Picardy,</hi> under
the kings or the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his conduct, and the other into <hi>Dolphine,</hi> of
which the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> must be General.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that the king of <hi>Navarr,</hi> with all his Adherents, and all other
Hereticks, might be thrust out of the Court and utte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly destroyed, and a
Parliament presently called, wherein they might consult of matters of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
weight and consequence.</p>
            <p>The king perceived by these unreasonable demands that their pleasure and
purpose was to make him a king of <hi>Poland</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that is, such a king as
should carry the bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Name of a king, and others should rule,
thinking it high time to call his wits together, to be in no longer subjection,
and to begin to dissemble with them who go about to deceive and subvert
him by cunning and dissimulation; he therefore yeeldeth to all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
commandeth an Assembly of the three Estates to be held the next
<hi>September</hi> at <hi>Bloys,</hi> exhortethall his Subjects unto a general Peace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h
all means possible to supplant the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> To this Parliament
came the most and best Peers of the Realm. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> absenteth
himself, either for fear, because his guilty conscience accuseth him, or of set
purpose and cunning, because he seeketh to be intreated. In his absence they
began to consult of great matters, in all which the king rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> great a charge, and thinketh it expedient, both for
the Common-wealth, and for himself, to imitate the example of <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, and to shut himself; up as a Penitentiary in some Monastery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>ce and weight with them,
no man should contend for it. For no man was equal, much less to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> He is valiant in Arms, wise in Counsel,
zealous in Religion, faithfull to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Country, and wanteth nothing requisite

               </gap>hout any contradiction, and the Duke is sent for with all speed
possible. It is no need to bid him come, he flyeth, he seemeth to be in
Heaven; but falleth as suddenly as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did down to hell. The king
calleth him into his private Chamber, pretending to have some great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to confer with him; before the rest of the Nobility he giveth him into
his hands certain Letters of his own hand-writing s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt unto the king of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>echeth the kings pardon; And whiles
with frivolous Protestations, and false Oaths he laboureth to clear himself,
he is not so cruelly as justly murthered in the king presence.</p>
            <p>The Arch-Traytor being thus executed, the Queen Mother allowed the
execution, praiseth her Sons wisdom, thanketh God that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93045:91"/>
him to put that counsel into the Kings head, and to give him grace
to execute the same; and now (saith she) my Son playeth the king
indeed.</p>
            <p>The Parisians are presently certified of the Dukes death; there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gnashing of Teeth; the Crochilers have lost their Countenance, the
Fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h new Treasons:
They chuse the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> for their Head; they draw the kings pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
in the durt through the streets; they rob and ransack his Exchequer,
his Palace, his Store-houses; and for their last resolution, they conclude that
he must be no longer their king.</p>
            <p>According to this conclusion, after that their City was hardly beset,
and they had almost endured as hard a siege as the Citizens of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
they send out a desperate Jacobin Fryer, as their <hi>Iudith</hi> to behead <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi>
to execute their doom and devillish sentence upon the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed,
and their lawfull king. The Fryer goeth to the kings Camp, which
was at St. <hi>Clovis,</hi> feigneth to have Letters of great weight to deliver unto
the king; he is brought to his presence, kindly received, (for the king al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
loved those Fryers too well) and lovingly willed to declare the cause
of his coming; he delivereth his Letters; the king readeth them seriously,
and the Jaobin, more like a <hi>Iudas</hi> then a follower of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> seeing
the kings doublet loose about him, aiming at a place where he might be sure
to dispatch him, whilest he was busied in reading the Letters, thrusteth a
poysoned knife into his Bowels of which wound he died within a few
hours after.</p>
            <p>You have heard his Tragedy, his Reign, and his End, and what can you
finde that savoureth of Heresie? Was it Heretical to persecute those whom
they call Hereticks before he Reigned, and as long as he reigned? Was it
Schismatical to proscribe, banish, and massacre them? Was it Apostatical
to proclaim and make Wars against them, whensoever and wheresoever the
Guisards required him? Was it irreligious and hypocritical for him in a
Lent time, when men use to be penitent for their Sins, to whip themselves
while the blood followeth, by his own Example to induce the Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> and others his chiefest Counsellors and Courtiers to do the like?
Was he a despiser of God, who with consent of the Popes Holiness, to shew
his zeal, and to leave an Eternal Monument thereof, did erect a new order
of Knighthood of the Holy Ghost, and took an Oath to live and die in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Catholick Faith? Was it impious, and an Act not beseeming a
Christian Prince, to go in person, and accompanied with most of the
Peers of his Realm in Procession bare-headed and bare-footed? If none of
these things be Heresie, Apostacy, and contempt of God, and Religion;
then undoubted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y the late French King, having done all these things, was
no Heretick, no Apostate, no Schismitick, no despiser of God, but a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
a Religious, a Catholick, and a most Christian Prince.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his death is the matter that is most urged,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> is the
sore that most grieveth, is the objection that needeth a present and large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation:
He was murthered without any desert, without any rightfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice, without any manner of proof, that he had committed
a Crime worthy of death. God said unto <hi>Cain</hi> where is thy brother <hi>Abel;</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:93045:92"/>
He said unto the woman accused or Adultery, Where are thy Accusers? He
said unto his Disciples, In the mouth of two or three consisteth a Truth;
He said unto the Judges of the Earth, Be ye wise and discreet in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And why said he all these? Forsooth, to shew that in every Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cause there ought to be an Accuser, divers witnesses, and a Judge to give
Sentence according unto Law, and unto his Conscience.</p>
            <p>Truly the Laws of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> and the Lawes of all Nations require,<note place="margin">That the French King had just cause to kill the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
               </note> that
a man being held guilty of any Crime, be it never so odious, never so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
be called unto Judgement, and be convinced by his own confession,
or some other pregnant and forcible proof, before he can be condemned.
But if the crime whereof he is accused be so manifest that all the world
knoweth it, that he cannot deny it, and hath nothing to say for his defence;
it is lawfull to condemn him, yea, to execute him without hearing his Cause;
especially, if by giving him notice of his Arreignment, you give him time
and opportunity to escape without punishment: The Word of God saith,
<hi>Thou shalt do no murther;</hi> But the Laws of Nature, the Laws of Nations,
yea, the Laws of Princes say, That it is better to kill then to be killed: The
Apostles have taught, that the testimony of two or three witnesses is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in any Cause; but the Civil Laws require sometimes seven, other
times five, and commonly they are contented with two; and by Canonical
constitutions according to the degrees of dignities of Ecclesiastical persons,
the testimony of seventy two, of sixty four, of twenty seven, and of seven is
oftentimes requisite and necessary. God hath commanded every man to
do according to his conscience; but the Lawes of Princes command all
Judges to give judgement according to the proofs and allegations that are
made before them. I may therefore boldly say, that not onely the Pope,
(unto whom the Canonists onely attribute this power and authority) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
every lawfull secular Prince (unto whom God hath commanded that every
soul should be obedient) may, upon good occasion, and consideration of
some circumstances, qualify, and interpret the Lawes of God. <hi>He that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with the sword, shall perish with the sword,</hi> sayeth the holy Scripture;
and there is no express commandment given not to suffer Malefactors to
live. But Humane Policy hath thought it convenient and equitable, that
children because they know not what they do, that mad men because they
are deprived of the use of Reason and Understanding, that any man killeth
one another by mischance, because he offendeth through ignorance, and not
of malice: And lastly, that an honest man, if he chance to kill a Thief by
night or by day, in defending his own person or goods, because it is lawfull to
repel force by force, shall not be condemned to death, although his crime
in it self, in strictness of Law be Capital.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more certain then the commandment of God, not to
swear, and yet it is lawfull to swear, yea, it is an offence not to swear, if a
man be commanded by a Magistrate to swear; and if a truth cannot be
known but by an Oath, and the oath that a man hath taken must be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
It cannot be broken; and there is no mans more odious, no crime more
detestable then the sin of perjury; and yet a Judge that hath taken an oath
to keep the Statutes of his Country without breaking the same, or without
departing from the true sense and literal meaning of them, may violate them,
if the iniquity of the time will not give him leave and leasure to confer with
his superiour, or to ask his opinion, or if there be manifest dangers like to
follow of the delay which he shall use. Besides if a Judge be commanded,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93045:92"/>
yea sworn not to do any thing against the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not an absolute Prince have the like liberty? A Provost Marshal taking a

               </gap>s therefore being duly considered, it must follow that the

               </gap>d just cause to command the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to

that he was one of the Peers of <hi>France;</hi> one of the greatest of that Realme,
one of the best beloved Subjects of <hi>Europe,</hi> and one that was allied unto
great Kings and Princes: And that therefore the King causing him to be

               </gap>t well think, and justly feare, that in doing him
to death, he should highly offend his best friends, and give just occasion
unto as many as suffered any loss or detriment by his death, to revenge the
same.</p>
            <p>As therefore <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> winked at the Treason committed by <hi>Dunorix,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caesar Comment.</note>
and called him not into question for the same, for feare to offend his Brother
<hi>Divitiacus,</hi> who was an assured and faithful Friend unto the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and a man of great credit and Authority in his Country; even so the King
should have spared the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and not have used such c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Anmarle,</hi> of <hi>Exceter</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> of the Lands and possessions which
<hi>Richard</hi> the second gave them, and yet spared their lives; so the king had
done well if he had taken away the lands and livings, and not the life of the

            <p>Why then shall the death of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> be thought unlawfull,

            <p>He was Allied unto many great Princes which are displeased with his
death, and will not leave it unrevenged; But if these Princes were the Kings
friends before the Dukes death, they will not take the same in evill part;
and if they were his Enemies, he needs not to care for them, or to feare
their displeasure more then the universal ruine and destruction of his Subjects.

be suspected, but it is not notorious. This must appeare more manifestly
then it doth, or else all that is said will be to no purpose.</p>
            <p>To manifest this therefore I will briefly examine that which hath been
already said, and by his own Acts and Demands convince and prove his
intention. It is said that the foot shall not presume to rule the head, no
more should a Subject take upon him to controll the King, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
unto him what hee shall do: And yet the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> not once,
but many times rebuketh his Kings proceedings against she Protestants,
blameth him of Negligence, and telleth him more boldly, then wisely,
that hee must not spare them but subvert them. And what was that but
to spoile his kingdom? The Counsellor is commended which rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
as Office and charge with modesty, that is laid upon him, then
affecteth the same before he be thought worthy thereof; and yet the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> staieth not untill he was moved by the King, but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med
himself for his Lieutenant: And what was that but to appoint the Kings
Officers? Wee read of <hi>Saul,</hi> that it grieved him greatly when it was said
that <hi>David</hi> had killed Twenty thousand Enemies, and <hi>Saul</hi> but ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93045:94"/>
and yet the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> after that he had overthrown the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
is termed an other <hi>Gideon,</hi> and he termeth his King a loiterer; and
what was that but to disgrace his Soveraign? It is commonly said, that
where there is no offence committed, there needeth no pardon; and yet
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> would seem not to have offended, although hee desireth
to have all that was said or done to bee pardoned, and buried in Oblivion:
And what was that bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a guilry conscience, and an unwilling
minde to acknowledge and confess his offence? The Subject that armeth
multitudes without his kings commandment, when there is no fear of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemy, or any other in arms within a Realm, giveth many presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and arguments of a Rebellious minde; And yet the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
doth not onely arm Multitudes, but also prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>teth, that he and they will lay
down his and their arms until the king yeeldeth unto his demands; and what
was that but to threaten and menace his king? The Count of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> High
Constable of <hi>France,</hi> was held a Traytor by <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
because he betrayed his counsel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and kept certain Holds and Towns
of strength from the king; and yet the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> must be no Traytor,
who revealed the kings secrets, and withheld many Towns and Cities from
him, and drave him out of the principal City of his Realm. <hi>Francis</hi> the
first proclaimed the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to be a Rebel and a Traytor because
he fled to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and bore arms in his quarrel against him; and
yet the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> is no Traytor who favoureth the Spanish king more
then his own Prince, and bringeth Spaniards into <hi>France</hi> to murther and
massacre the kings loving Subjects.</p>
            <p>He saw that his conspiracies and secrets were discovered by the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> and therefore he must be banished the Court; He saw that the
king of Spain prevailed not against <hi>England,</hi> because he had no Towns in
<hi>France,</hi> to harbour his wearied and Sea-beaten Souldiers; and therefore at his
next coming he must have <hi>Normandy</hi> at his devotion; for that was his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
when he demanded that <hi>Normandy</hi> should be given to the holy League.
What meant he when he required that his brother should be made great
Master of the Kings Pallace, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Governour of all
<hi>France?</hi> Why demanded he no office for himself? Forsoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h, because it
was not yet time for him to say he must be king. <hi>France</hi> could not brook
two kings. The late king must be first deposed; and was it not his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to procure him to be depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which he required to be presently called and assembled? That was
the matter of great wait, the cause of such consequence whereof they must
consult; an to bring the matter to pass there must be two great Armies in
readiness (the one in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and the other in <hi>Dolphine)</hi> to bridle those
who were most likely to withstand h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Coronation, and not to admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him for their king. The Hugonets also must be all subverted. They
were the Orato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Roman Capitol; they therefore must be taken away, or else he must
fail of his purpose. That Nation whose king hath the honour to be called

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istian king, may not brook an Heretick for their king; and
therefore the king of <hi>Navarr</hi> must be taken away, he must not live any
longer; the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> next heir to the Crown after him, was already
dispatched by poyson, and his young infant was not fit to rule.</p>
            <p>But if the king of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s death might have contented him, if his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
might have set <hi>France</hi> at Liberty, and utterly have subverted the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93045:95"/>
Protestants, why was not this king of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s offer accepted? Why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
he the combat, whereunto he was challenged? Such a Champion as
the Duke was, should not have refused such a challenge; such a <hi>Gideon,</hi> that
flew so many Germans, should not have been afraid to encounter with
one Man, especially with such a man as forgat the name and state of a
King to fight with a Rebel, as debased himself to contend with a Traitor,
as if he won the battle, could not but lose some of his honour, because he
had encountered with an infamous person, and if he lost the field, lost both
his life and Scepter. Such a Father and Protector of his Country should not
have denied to hazard his life in such a quarrel as might have saved the lives
of many of his best friends, who have been killed since the time of that
challenge. But he thought it best to sleep in a whole skin, and he knew
how to be king without such a hazard: he had preferred many, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would and should prefer him.</p>
            <p>But of him enough. And from him to the rest wherewith the late king
was more vainly then truly charged. It followeth in the Accusation, that
he prodigally wasted the Revenues of the Crown, and gave himself to all
kinde of vice and wickedness.</p>
            <p>This wastfull spending of the Revenues of the Crown, is a fault that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
all other faults; a fault that offendeth a kings Subjects much more
then any other vice, because when Princes Treasures are wasted, they flie
to their subjects Coffers, and empty their Chests to fill their own Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers. Subjects therefore for their ease require that their king should be a
good husband. It was a commendation that <hi>Tully</hi> gave to king <hi>Demetri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;</hi>
It is a quality that is required in a good Steward; it is a property by so much
more requisite in a Prince, by how much his charge is greater then other
mens; but a though they desire that their Prince should be thrifty, yet
they would not have them covetous; and as they can be contented that they
should be liberal, so they like not that they shall be prodigal: Thrift maketh
them able to live with their own, Covetousness enforceth them to prey upon
their Subjects. Liberality procureth them the good will and love of all
men, and Prodigality bringeth them to Poverty, and Poverty teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them to invent and practice extraordinary wayes to supply their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wants.</p>
            <p>But I must not stand upon such a king as Subjects desire to have: I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to the Accusation, and in handling thereof I mean not to free the king
from all blame, but to lay the greatest blame upon them who are most to
blame.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the Revenues of <hi>France</hi> are now far greater then ever they
were, and that they have received their great increase of late years; yea,
that the ancient kings never did nor could impose such subsidies and charges
upon their Subjects as have been lately levied in <hi>France.</hi> For <hi>Charles</hi> the
seventh was the first king that got and begun this point of imposing charges
upon his Subjects at his own pleasure, and without the consent of the States
of his Realm; and yet this <hi>Charles</hi> never levied more of his Subjects
then eight hundred thousand Franks by the year, a smal sum in regard of
that which is now levied.</p>
            <p>After him succeeded <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh his son, who raised the Revenues
from ten hundred thousand, to forty and seven thousand, and yet he layed up
nothing at the years end into his Treasure-house; For he builded more
Houses, and fortified more Cities then all his Predecessors did before him;

he was presently drawn from that intention by suddain wars, procured
(as it was thought) by those who were guilty of mispending of his Revenues,
to the end that he might not have leisure to examine their abuses.</p>
            <p>It was shewed unto his Majesty, that in thirty one years after his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
<hi>Francis</hi> the first his death, the receipt of such money as came in those
years unto the Treasure amounted unto more then 400 millions of Crowns,
and the expences came but to 260 millions. It was shewed that besides
the same sums which entered into the kings Coffers in that time, the People
had payed to the king use fifteen millions of millions, and 246 millions of
Crowns, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as much money as 423 thousand Mules are able to carry.
It was shewed that the Pope in those few years had out of <hi>France</hi> better then
thirty millions of Crowns. It was shewed that this infinite Treasure was not
wasted by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> but by their Officers; That there were
above two hundred seventy four Families, whereof some might dispend an

thousand, others forty, thirty, twenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fifteen thousand, of which the best
could not dispend above nine or ten thousand Francks, and some not above
two or three hundred before they had the collection of the kings Rents and
Revenues. It was shewed that there were three hundred thirty eight Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers,
of which some were worth ten thousand, others twenty thousand,
some thirty thousand, some forty thousand, others sixty and eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

               </gap>ng might well have had two hundred
millions of Crowns in the Treasury, he was indebted above thirty millions.
And that there might be found six and thirty Ladies in <hi>France,</hi> whose heirs,
rather then they would be called to an accompt, would willingly pay the
twentieth part of the debts of the Crown; and the above mentioned Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
might think that they escaped very well if they might be freed from all
danger by paying the Residue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:93045:96"/>
Now considering that the house of <hi>Guise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> del Estate, &amp;c.</note> or such as depend upon them,
ruled not onely the Realm, but also managed the Treasure of <hi>France</hi> of late
years, during the minority of their Kings, considering that the late King
would and could not redress the abuses of such Officers as received, and
were countable for his Revenues; considering that he was charged with
greater burthens then his Predecessors, as the maintenance of his
Brother, the Dower of his Mother, and of the late Queen of Scots,
the marriage of his Sisters, and other debts in which he was left by
his Predecessors, considering that his Revenues were increased before his
time, or by such as ruled more then he in his time, and that Princes do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
augment and encrease, then diminish their yearly Rents and Demeasns;
And lastly, considering that of Thirty three Chambers of Account which
are in <hi>France,</hi> not above six of them were for the King towards his end,
and those of the poorest, and such as scant yeelded him Three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns, his Receits being, as it hath been said, almost eleven Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
no man may justly accuse him of consuming the wealth of his Crown
and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is likewise to be noted, that Wars are much more chargeable then
they have been, and that he seldom lived out of Wars; not through his
own folly, but by their fault who can blame him most; And it cannot be
denied but that he gave away much unto his Favourites, and to his Minions;
and yet his Gifts were nothing comparable to the excessive liberality of his
later Pred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cessors. For it is written that <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. gave to his physitian
in five months Fifty four thonsand Crowns, besides the Bishoprick of
<hi>Amiens</hi> for his Nephew, and divers Offices and Lands for himself and his
friends. <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Book <hi>De Republica</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Charls</hi> the Ninth
King of <hi>France</hi> his Brother, gave away in the year 1572. Two millons and
seven hundred thousand Francks, and the next year two millions and forty
four thousand Francks, and in the last year of his reign One million five
hundred and two thousand Francks, besides certain years Pentions, which
amounted unto One hundred thousaud Francks.</p>
            <p>But grant that he gave much more then he did; Is it not lawful for a
Prince to reward his Servants? Is it not in his liberty to cast his especial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
upon whom it pleaseth him? And is there any thing that sheweth a
Kings greatness, procureth him faithful Friends, and eternizeth his Name,
more then his bounty and liberality? I know that <hi>Nero</hi> was reprehended,
because that in Fifteen years he gave away above Fifty five millions. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that <hi>Caligula</hi> is blamed for that he spent in one year Sixty seven milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And I acknowledge that <hi>Dion</hi> reporteth it for no praise and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
unto <hi>Claudius</hi> that he wasted in three years five Miriades of Miriades
and Seventh usand seven hundred and eight drams, or as some report, One
thousand seven hundred and eight miriades. I allow no such prodigality, and
yet I think it not lawful for Subjects to rebel against their Princes if they
be over-prodigal; I know that there be other ways to be used to restrain their
excessive liberality.</p>
            <p>I read that the Parliament House, in the tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>England,</hi> considering that through the covetousness of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

spent, chose Thirteen Lords to have the oversight (under the King) of
the whole Government of the Realm. And I finde that divers Subjects
have revolted from their obedience to their Princes, because they having
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93045:96"/>
wasted their Revenues, they over-charged them with Subsidies and
Impositions. But I see that their rebellion wrought their own confusion.</p>
            <p>Now from the late Kings Prodigality, briefly in a few words to his other
vices; he is noted to have been somewhat more given to Venery then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a married Prince, but I find not that his wantonness was outragious;
and sure I am, that he never had so many Concubines as <hi>Solomon;</hi> nor
caused any man to be killed that he might enjoy his Wife, as <hi>David</hi> did to
<hi>Urias;</hi> nor made away with his own Wife to have another, as it is said the
Spanish King did: And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> was the wisest Prince that ever lived;
and no King ever pleased God more then <hi>David</hi> did; And the Leaguers
held King <hi>Philip</hi> to be the mirror of the Kings in our age. Neither did
the late King of <hi>France</hi> delight so greatly in the company of wanton wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but that he could and would have used the same with much more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
then he did, had not the Queen-Mother, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and
others who ruled all things under him, nourished that humour in him, to
the end that he following of his delights, they might the more freely govern
the whole Kingdom at their own will and pleasure; a policy borrowed of
Cardinal <hi>Wolsey.</hi> This <hi>Wolsey</hi> being <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his Chaplain, and
brought into credit and favour by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> made his House
a Paradise of all kind of pleasure, and oftentimes invited the King thither,
and so fed him with vain delights, that his Majesty during the greatest time
of his younger years, committed the Government of the whole Kingdom
into his hands.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that if he had had a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
in his youth, who would not onely have had a care of his health,
but also have given him good instructions, he would undoubtedly have
made a notable Prince; for he had a very good Wit, and a natural dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Vertue and Goodness: But the Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who by
his Father was left to be the Teacher and Informer of his Youth and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
being a very good Prince, but more delighting in Banquets, Dancings,
and other such Sports and Pastimes, then in serious and grave studies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
a Prince, brought the King up in those Vanities, wherein he took
such pleasure and delight, that he cared not how little he medled with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State. Good Education is a great Jewel for all men, but especially
for Princes, because that such doctrine and disposition as Children and
Young-men receive in their youth, such they retain in their elder years.

               </note> And the Prince is not so much to blame who is given unto vanities in his
riper years, as they are to be reprehended who trained him up in vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in the days of his indiscretion.</p>
            <p>The blame therefore of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third his wantonness, must light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them who were the Authors of his folly, and abused those good Gifts
and Graces which the Almighty had bestowed upon him, which were Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Wisdom, Eloquence, and the use of divers Languages, Qualities
not so common as commendable in a Prince: His Valour is proved by the
siege of <hi>Rechel,</hi> where (as it is written by Historiographers of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit)
it was impossible for a Prince (for such was he at that time) to shew
himself more truly valiant then he did; and the commendation which Sir
<hi>Henry Cobham</hi> (a discreet and wise Gentleman, and of great Judgement
and Experience) when he was Ambassador for her Majesty in <hi>France</hi> gave
him, upon occasion of talk at his Table (coming from such and so able a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93045:97"/>
man as was) may serve for a sufficient proof of the rest of his good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
For I well remember that the said Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> talking with his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
Mr. <hi>Maximilian Cobham</hi> (who was then lately come out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
into <hi>France</hi>) of the late King said, that he had been imploied as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
for her Majesty unto the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and divers
other Princes, but among them all, he never heard any forein Prince that
delivered his mind more eloquently, readily, and wisely then the said King;
and that as often as he had Audience of him, he would sometimes speak in
French, and sometimes in Italian; and although he Answered him fully
to every point whereof they conferred, before he departed from him, yet
(like a wise and discreet Prince) he would always require him not to take
it for his full and resolute Answer, untill he had talked with his Council;
and at their next meeting, his later Answer seldom or never varied
from the former; a manifest Argument of his great Wisdom, who was
able to answer an Ambassador upon the sudden, and that not at one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
onely, bnt upon as many and as great occasions as he the said Sir
<hi>Henry</hi> had to confer with his Majesty, in the space of three or four years,
so well and so wisely, that his greatest and gravest Councellors could not
upon deliberation amend his sudden and extemporal Answers.</p>
            <p>This commendation given him by Sir <hi>Henry Cobham</hi> is confirmed by the
Siegneur <hi>Darrennes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> de la pax del an. 1575.</note> one of the Ambassadors sent from the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dey</hi>
unto his Majesty in the year 1575. to negotiate a general peace betwixt
the King and his discontented Subjects, as well Papists as Protestants.
This Ambassador in the preamble of his Speech to the King used these
words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>We thank God that it hath pleased him so highly to favour us, as to
send us a King that both will and can hear himself the wants and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of his Subjects, and order and redress the same according to his
good pleasure, and the laudable course of Justice: For if our Writers have
imployed their Labours in writing to blame and reprehend those Kings
which hear not but by the Ears of others, which see not but by the Eyes
of others, and speak not but by the Mouthes of others; We have most
great occasion to think our selves very happy and blessed, unto whom
God hath sent a King so gentle, and so loving unto his Subjects, as that
he will hear all our causes and controversies himself; and a King of so rare
and excellent Wisdom, as that he is able to decide and determine our
Contentions.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This commendation given him by Seigneur <hi>Darennes</hi> far exceedeth Sir
<hi>Henry Cobhams,</hi> because he was the Ambassador of a Prince that was in
League with the late King, and the Siegneur <hi>Darennes</hi> of a Prince that not
long before had born arms against this King; And Sir <hi>Henry</hi> might speak
for favour, but the other spake as he thought; because it appeareth by the
rest of the speeches which he used in the same negotiation, that he neither
would or could dissemble: And because this praise and commendation was
given by an Enemy rather then by a friend, it cannot but be void of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
assertion, or flattery.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the French Kings Vertues and his Imperfections;
the Leaguers folly, and the Spanish Kings indiscretion.</p>
            <p>Now it resteth to declare unto you his further error, which although it
be the last, yet it is not the least; and I fear me I shall have occasion to
enlarge my self more of it then I did of the other three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:93045:97"/>
It is not unknown unto all or most part of the World, that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> too much crediting the light and false reports of certain English
Fugitives, did once attempt, and doth still intend to invade and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<hi>England.</hi> This attempt and this intention, although it seemeth to
be grounded upon good reasons, and to be allowed by the wisest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors;
yet I will shew that it was neither begun with wisdom, nor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with any great discretion.</p>
            <p>To shew this, it shall be needful to examine all and every of the causes
which moved him to undertake this attempt and purpose. The causes
are many, and some of them are already sufficiently declared; others rest,
first to be discovered, and then then to be confuted: It hath already been
shewed, that for succouring of <hi>France,</hi> for aiding of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
his money, and for favouring and furthering of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> his
resolution to recover the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Spanish King had
no just occasion to be offended with the Queens Majesty. It remaineth to
prove that the Popes Excommunication, That the false and sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of the English Fugitives, the death of the late Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> OF
the sending away of his Ambassador with some small disgrace out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
giveth him no just occasion to trouble her Majesties quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Government.</p>
            <p>All this being proved, his indiscretion shall be made appear by three
principal Reasons. The first, because he took no good course for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of his enterprise. The second, Because that although his
course had been good, yet he neither was, nor is able to subdue <hi>England.</hi>
And the third, Because albeit he should chance to conquer our Realm, yet
he could not hold the same long.</p>
            <p>The order whereunto I have tied my self, requireth that I begin with
the Popes Excommunication. And for the better clearing of this point, it
were necessary to shew what Authority he hath to excommunicate. But
this is a matter that requireth a whole and large Volume; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have thought good not to medle therewith, but to refer you for
your better instruction unto the large Apology which <hi>Marsilius Patu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
wrote above 266 years ago in the defence of the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Baviera</hi> against the Pope, that would not admit or allow him for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror:
There you shall see that the Pope, although he were Christs law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and indubitate Vicar, (a point which never was nor will be proved)
yet he hath no more Authority then Christ himself had. There you
shall read,<note place="margin">That the Popes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not to be feared, nor a lawful cause to invade <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> that Christ came not into the world to Rule, that he took not
upon him to Command Princes, but that both he himself obeyed, and taught
his Apostles to obey Princes. There you shall understand that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
the Apostle, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and other of Christs Disciples obeyed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, and submitted themselves unto Temporal Government.
There briefly, you shall learn that not Clergy man ought to meddle with
Temporal matters; And that the Pope hath no more Authority to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
sins, or excommunicate any man, then other Inferior Priests and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
have.</p>
            <p>All this being true, as in that Apology you shall finde it learnedly,
substantially and sufficiently proved, not by humane Reasons, which
may be erroneous, but by sacred Scriptures, which cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled;
your own discretion may sufficiently warrant you, that this
Excommunication can be of no great force; And yet because many
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93045:98"/>
of our Countrimen attribute too much unto the Popes Authority, and
cannot be perswaded but that he came unto the same directly, and holdeth
it immediately from Christ. I will shew you as briefly as I can, how the
Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> attained unto that great Authority which he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth.</p>
            <p>It appeareth by <hi>Du Haillan</hi> in the French Chronicle, that in the time of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> had no power or authority in <hi>Rome</hi>
it self; they medled but onely with matters of Religion, with Ecclesiastical
Discipline, and with points of Divinity. It appeareth also by <hi>Platina,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Illescas,</hi> and <hi>Robert Barnes,</hi> three notable Writers of the Popes lives;
the first being an Italian, the second a Spaniard, and the third an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that many years after Christs passion, and after St. <hi>Peters</hi> death, they
were cruelly massacred and martyred by the Emperors of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is also
notorious and apparent, by the testimony the same Writers, and of many
more, that they were wont to be chosen, approved, and confirmed by the
Roman Emperors, insomuch that he was not held for a lawful Pope which
had not the Emperors approbation; Briefly you shall find in the Histories
and Chronicles of <hi>France,</hi> that three Popes being chosen at one time, they
came into <hi>France</hi> (the Kings whereof were then also Emperors) to excuse
themselves and their election, because it was made without the consent or
privity of the Emperor, and to stand to his opinion that then was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
which of the three should be Pope; but now there is a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and a marvellous change. For the Servant commandeth the Master,
the Subject his Sovereign, the Inferior his Superior, the Vassal his Lord,
and the elegible the Elector; Whereat so many marvel, that it was
never more necessary or expedient then it is now, to declare how this came
to pass; you shall therefore understand that there was a time when as the
Emperor had power and preheminence over all the Princes of Christendom,
as well spirituall as temporal; and as long as this power and prerogative
continued, so long the name of the Emperor was honored of all men, his
Empire was large and ample, his Dominions great and excessive, and his
credit and authority was marvellous and incredible.</p>
            <p>About, or not long after this time, not God, but the Devil raised up a
man,<note place="margin">The Popes means to grow up to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> who seeking the preferment of this world, and the advancement of
his See, endeavoured by all means possible to attain his purpose. What
doth he? What course taketh he? What means useth he? What habit
putshe on? He thinketh it not good to use any violence; his Forces are
too weak, his Treasury too smal, his Arms are not great, and he wanteth
a Lyons skin, he therefore playeth the Fox; accommodateth himself unto
the humors of Princes, counterfeiteth an extraordinary kind of Holiness,
and more then a common and usual kind of Zeal, Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y and Devotion,
and entreateth the Emperor to make him Head of all the Churches of the
World; because as <hi>Rome</hi> was his Seat that commandeth the World in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
causes; so the Bishop that had his Sea at <hi>Rome,</hi> was worthy to govern
and rule all other Bishops in spiritual Affairs.</p>
            <p>The Emperor that then was, had killed his Predecessor, had usurped his
Empire, and had need of one to tolerate and excuse his murder, and to
countenance and allow his Usurpation; and therefore taking the Pope to
be the fittest man that then lived to further his purpose, yeeldeth to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
But the other Bishops, which before that time never acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any Superiour, refused to receive and acknowledge him for their Head,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93045:98"/>
who was wont to be their Equal and Companion. The Bishops contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
could not make him give over his Suit; he praieth, entreateth, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and never leaveth to be importunate untill <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperor grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Request. He might have contented himself with this, Grant, with
this favour; But as covetous men, the more they have, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
so this ambitious and proud Prelate studieth presently how to get new
Dignities, how to purchase new Honors; wherein he findeth not only For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but the time favourable and friendly unto him. For whenas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
began to decay, having lost <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Huns</hi>
conquered <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> became Lords of the greatest part of <hi>Africa,</hi>
and the dissolution and loss of the Empire began to be so great, that
the Emperors were fain to give over all the West Countries, and to sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
themselves in the East.</p>
            <p>It happened not long after, that there fell out a great contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Pope and the Emperor touching Images; the one commanded
them to be pulled down, and the other to be raised up, and he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
the Emperor for withstanding his commandment.</p>
            <p>And about this time, or not very long after, the <hi>Lumbards</hi> began to
make great Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> whose Forces the Pope (who was then very
weak) not being able to resist, was forced to flie for Aid to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> by whom being defended from the force and violence of his Enemies;
were it to be revenged of the Emperor of the East, or to recompence the
good turn and pleasure which the Frenchmen had done him in debasing
the pride of the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> or to make the way to encrease his own power
and magnificence more ready and easie, considering the weakness of the
Eastern Emperor, whose power began daily to decrease and diminish,
through the continual and cruel Wars which were between him and the
Turk, he presumed to declare the King of <hi>France,</hi> which was then <hi>Charls</hi>
the Great, for rightful Emperor. And so he, which at the beginning was
poor aud needy, feared not to deprive him of the Emperial Diadem, unto
whom God commanded all humane creatures should be obedient, and to
chuse the Roman Emperor, whose election belonged in former times to the
people or the Soldiers of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what were the fruits, what the effects of this choyce? Forsooth, a
division of the Empire, the which of one was made two; a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and long Wars, the beginning and end whereof was most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
For the Empire having continued a long time in the Race of <hi>Charls</hi>
the Great, the Princes and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs of <hi>Italy</hi> began to grieve and grudg
thereat; Insomuch, that entring into League and Confederacy together,
they chose <hi>Berengarius</hi> Emperor, and aided and animated him to make
Wars against the lawful Emperor who was then <hi>Lewis</hi> the Third. This
<hi>Lewis</hi> being hated of his own Subjects for his great Pride and Tyranny,
<hi>Othon</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> went into <hi>Italy</hi> with a great Army, and there sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<hi>Berengarius,</hi> and received of the Pope the Emperial Crown for his
guerdon and recompence, <hi>Lewis</hi> the right and lawful Emperor being then
alive: The Pope that then was being <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifth, and this <hi>Othon,</hi>
whom he had made Emperor, were both Germans, and naturally hated
all French men; And therefore began to devise with themselves, how
they might take away all possibility for ever from the French-men to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Pope shewing himself herein wiser then the Emperor, inventeth
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93045:99"/>
these means. He thought it convenient for the better countenance of the
Emperor, that he should be assisted and alwayes accompanied with certain
grave and wise Personages, as well for learning as for honour: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ordained that seven Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> should have full power and
authority to chuse the Emperor, whereunto the Emperor consented most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
as well in regard of the hatred which he bore unto <hi>France,</hi> as for that
there were like to rise quarrels and debates betwixt the Germans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
touching the Election.</p>
            <p>What doth the Pope when he hath gained this high point? Seeketh he
not for something more? Thought he that it was sufficient honour for his
Pontifical Seat, that three of the seven Electors of the Emperor were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and all of them sworn to be obedient unto him in all things? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
he alwayes their Election? Beareth he any respect or honour unto
them that were chosen by the same Elector? He meaneth no such thing:
For he setteth them at naught, seeketh to discredit them, and is not ashamed
to command them to swear that they shall alwayes defend, keep and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the goods of the Church, and the Popes, and also their Dignities, their
Priviledges, their Laws, and their Decrees; by vertue of which Oath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth
their Wills, abridgeth their Power, and enforceth them to be at
his devotion.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the Emperors <hi>Frederick</hi> the third and second, and <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, not vouchsafing to brook their Bravadoes, their Threats, and
their Outrages, opposed themselves against all their audacious Enterprises;
but they care not for the first, set as little by the second, contemned the third,
and excommunicated them all.</p>
            <p>They rest not satisfied with these honours; they proceed further, and
desire more; commanding that no secular Prince shall take upon him to give
any Spiritual Living, any Ecclesiastical Dignity; they excommunicate as
well those that give such Livings, as those which receive them at their hands;
having obtained this advantage, they covet still more; and think it not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to be Priviledged themselves, but all the Clergy must participate and
taste of their honours. All Priests and Ecclesiastical persons must be exempt
from all charges, subsidies, and impositions; no man must be so bold as
to meddle with their Rents, with their Revenues; The Bishops and
all the Clergy are bound to them for their Liberality: In requital
therefore of these great Priviledges and Immunities, it behooveth them
to purchase and get the favour, and good liking of all secular Princes;
of some, to get as much by them as they can possibly; of others, to have
their help against their enemies, and against those that will not yeeld and
condiscend to all their demands and desires. They deal herein so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
that they finde some so ready, willing, and desirous to help and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them, that they vouchsafe to imploy their Goods, their Subjects, yea,
their own lives to do them service.</p>
            <p>All Histories are full of Wars, of Battels, of Victories, begun, fought
and obtained at the instance, at the request, and in the behalf of the Popes.
I shall not need to name the Princes, to record the Battels, or to mention
the victories. Our Histories, and the Histories of all other Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them sufficiently. Our forefathers declared them unto their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and we may have heard of them of our Fathers, of our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
            <p>But to give the more credit unto my speech, and occasion unto the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93045:99"/>
to beleeve me the better, I will briefly discover unto you the means;
the cunning, and the subtilty which they have used to attain unto their
greatness, and height, and to the continuance and perpetuity of their Rule
and Government.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more profitable or expedient for him that will advance
himself in credit, reputation and authority, then to know the deliberations
and purposes of his Enemies: And because it is very difficult and hard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto this knowledge, he deserveth gret praise &amp; commendation, that can
behave himself so cunningly, so politickly, as to learn all his secret adversaries
intents, and practices; and it is not only necessary to understand his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
but also it is convenient and fitting sometimes to foresee and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them; yea, it is needfull to be acquainted with his Actions, and not
onely with those which he intendeth to do presently, and at home, but also
with them which he purposeth to do hereafter, and far from home; for by
understanding and knowing these things, a man may quickly either get all
that he desireth, or else so temporize and prolong matters until the time fall
out fit and favourable for his purpose.</p>
            <p>All Princes therefore, to have a certain and sure knowledge of these things,
are accustomed to have their Ambassadors in the Courts of their Friends
and Confederates, who do not onely send them certain news of the intents
and purposes of their Friends, but also whatsoever else is done or said in their
Courts or in their Councils. But the Pope as he challengeth unto himself a
Preheminence above all other Princes, so he far excelleth them all in this
kinde of providence.</p>
            <p>For besides that he hath his Ambassadors in the Courts of divers Princes,
he hath also his Espies, his Favorites and his sworn men. There are many
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and Cardinals which are Councellors unto Kings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have sworn to do nothing in prejudice of the Holy Church, to
condiscend unto nothing that shall weaken or diminish the Popes authority;
to learn, espy, understand, prove, attempt, foresee, and practice all things that
may any wayes befit or advance his Pontifical Dignity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to make his way more ready and easie for his Ambassadors to
understand all that may stand him in steed, he purchaseth the favour and
good opinion of Princes Favourites, and such as are neerest about them, by
rewards, promises, bribes, and corruptions: Unto some he giveth a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalship,
unto others his daughters or kinswomen in marriage; and not to leave
the Princes themselves uncorrupted, he sufferth them sometimes to take the
tenths of their Kingdoms, to make their profit of his Croicadoes; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them to be the more ready to do him pleasure, he feedeth them with
fair words, with sweet and sugered speeches, he adorneth them with new
titles, with new honours and dignities, that are more gorgeous in shew
then in deed; calling some of them Catholick Kings, others most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings, some Protectors of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others Defenders of the
Faith: and when he hath occasion to change or innovate any thing, then he
helpeth himself with a specious shew of a zeal of Religion, with the report and
remembrance of that authority which he challengeth to have received from
God, and with a vain flourish of that honour and reverence, which some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being more zealous and devout then wise, have shewed unto him, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to perswade others by their examples to do the like. But if it chance,
either by the iniquity of time, or by their incredulity whom he seeketh to
make his Friends, that they will not give ear unto his perswasions, he hath
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93045:100"/>
presently recourse unto the decrees and constitutions of his Predecessors, he
wresteth the Text of the holy Scripture to serve his purpose, and forgetteth
nothing that hath been either done or devised, and decreed for his advantage.
He putteth them therefore in mind, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth made a Decree,
That as many as would be saved, and have a part in the Kingdom of Heaven,
must of necessity be obedient in all cases and in all places unto the Pope:
Wherein he doth not onely resemble, but make himself equal to, and better
then his Master Christ, because he, while he was upon the earth, did not
onely shew obedience, but also taught his Apostles (as I have formerly
said) to be obedient unto Inferior Magistrates, and such as were in
Authority; And the Pope will be both honoured and obeyed of the
greatest Princes and Monarchs of the World; Yea, if all the Princes
of Europe, if the sacred and general Councils of all the Nations of the
World should make a Law or Ordinance, the same shall be of no force,
strength, or validity, if he do not approve, ratifie, and confirm the same;
and if any Prince being more bold then the rest, presumeth to say there
have been many bad and evil Popes, it shall be answered him presently that
he ought not therefore to contemn or reject their pontifical Authority, and
that no man upon earth may be so bold as to examine or reprehend, or
censure the Popes actions.</p>
            <p>I have acquainted you with many Devices, great Subtilties, and fine
policies, but the finest deceits are yet behind; For is it possible to
have a better means to overthrow and ruinate a Princes Enemies, then
to make them perish without laying hands upon them, without effusion
of blood, without spending of money, without imploying his own
Force and Authority? There is no Victory but is honourable, and yet
of all Victories that is most commendable which is purchased with least ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of blood or spending of money. The Pope therefore aiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with this kinde of policy, whenas some Prince or other being mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then he, will not bow under his yoak, against whom he dareth not
make open Wars, he seeketh by all means possible to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hatred with some other Prince; he slandereth him, spreadeth evil
rumors and reports of him, taketh away his good name, scandalizeth his
person, and imploreth the Aid and Assistance of all Christian Princes
against him; he giveth his Kingdom to him that can or will invade the
same, he declareth him to be an Hereticke, he depriveth him of his
Scepter, he taketh all his Titles from him, he commandeth his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
not to obey him, he suborneth his own Children to rise up in Arms
against him, he procureth his Subjects to seek his overthrow, he causeth
another to be crowned in his place, and he excommunicateth both him and
his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And if neither the Forces of his Enemies, nor the rebellion of his Subjects,
the confederacy of many Princes against him, nor the pollicies whereof
we have spoken be able to supplant and suppress him, then he procureth
some one or other to kill him, or to deliver him by some Treason into the
hands of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Truly these are strange policies, cruel devices, and such kind of revenge
as a man shall hardly find to have been practised by secular Princes; and
therefore that my words may carry the more credit, since they tend to the
discredit of the holy Father of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will prove by the Testimony of
authentical Histories all that I have said.</p>

<hi>Hildibr and</hi> sowed great dissentions and immortal warres betwixt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Germany</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. and commanded the Electors
to chuse another Emperor in his place; and when that would not prevaile,
he suborned the Son to beare armes against the Father, and to deprive him
of the Empire. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third procured the <hi>Millanois</hi> and other
Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> to rebell against <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor; and <hi>Alexander</hi>
the sixt took the name and Title of most <hi>Christian</hi> King from <hi>Charles</hi> the
eighth of <hi>France,</hi> and gave it unto the King of <hi>Castile.</hi> It is written that
<hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth held a Councell at <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and with the helpe
of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> thrust <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second from the Empire, and
caused <hi>Henry Landsgrave</hi> of <hi>Thuring</hi> to bee chosen in his place. And we
find in diverse true Histories, that Pope <hi>Pascall, Gregory</hi> the 7. <hi>Victor</hi> the

<hi>Conrad</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his son for the Collations and Installations of Bishops;

the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>But I have to tell you a more strange History, a more wicked Action,
and such a one as beseemed not a Christian, much less the Pope, who
calleth himself the Father of all Christians; And that is an History of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. who was so furious, indiscreet, and frantick in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

besides other malitious and wicked meanes by which he sought to have him
killed, whiles the good Emperor was busied in warring against the <hi>Turk</hi> for
the good and benefit of all Christendom, he sent word unto the <hi>Turk,</hi>
that he should look for no peace at the Christians hands so long as the
Emperor lived, and that therefore it behooved him to look for some
meanes to surprise and kill him; and to the end the Emperor should not
escape the <hi>Turks</hi> hands, unto whom hee was not known, hee sent him his
picture, whereby the <hi>Turk</hi> found a way within a small time after, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chamberlain, yet that could not helpe him. For the <hi>Sultan</hi> conferred
him with the Picture which the Pope had sent him, and thereby knew him.
And when the Emperor was sett at Liberty, not without great charges to
himself, and greater detriment to the whole State of <hi>Christendom,</hi> he
assembled the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> together, and there shewed them the

            </p>
            <p>There wanted no good will in <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. that the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the

               </gap>ung so cuningly and artificially right over the place where the
Emperor should heare Mass, that while he was upon his knees, and at his
devotion, it should have fallen down upon his head; but it pleased God to
preserve the Innocent Emperor, and to suffer the Store to fall upon the
chief Workemans head whiles hee was making tryall of his skill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>What shall I speak of his unsatiable desire of Revenge, who so much
forgat God and the reverence which his best Predecessors bore unto the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93045:101"/>
Sacrament of the Altar, that he caused the same to be poysoned and a
good Emperor to be poysoned therewith.</p>
            <p>But what do I trouble you with Forreign examples, with old and ancient
Histories, since we have some of later time, some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>igher unto us, some
domesticall Testimonies which do sufficiently witness the Fury, Enmity,
Hatred, Cruelty and Tyranny of Popes? Can any man desire a better
proof of the Popes Avarice then the History of King <hi>Iohn?</hi> This King
(as our Chronicles testifie) was somewhat too severe to his Clergy, and
over-hard to the Nobility of his Realme, insomuch that bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Holiness, who presently excommunicated him, and commanded all
Christian Princes, and especially the King of <hi>France,</hi> to invade his Country.
The <hi>French</hi> King obeyeth this commandement, and sendeth his Son <hi>Lewis</hi>
with a great Army into <hi>England,</hi> where he is received with great honor,
and aided by the rebellious Barons with all the helpe and power that they
could make for him.</p>
            <p>The King perceiving that he was too weak to encouunter with his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and with the Forreign supplies that were sent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, and thinking
that it was best for him to seek for helpe at his hands by whom he was hurt,
sent presently Ambassadors unto <hi>Rome</hi> to pacifie the Pope, by making his
kingdom Tributary unto him, and by promising to hold the same of him, to
take him for his Superior, and to bee obedient unto all his commandements.
The good old man presently changeth his mind, pacifieth his own wrath;
and of a deadly foe, becometh the Kings great friend, insomuch that he
revoketh whatsoever was before decreed; excommunicateth the King of
<hi>France</hi> for robbing the Patrimony of the holy Church, and commandeth
the English Subjects to return presently unto the dutifull obedience which
they owe unto their King.</p>
            <p>Is there any Man so ignorant within this Realme, that hath not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard how many times the later Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have sent not only
secular Men, but Seminary Priests into <hi>England</hi> to murther our gracious

who lament even at this day the death of their husbands, and of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
which have lost their lives because they would have deprived our
mercifull Queen of her life at the Popes instance and instigation.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished that poor <hi>France</hi> had not lately felt the great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which follow after the Popes heavie indignation; It should not have
lost within the space of 15 years 14 hundred thous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their late King, the first King that ever was murthered by his owne Subjects

kinsman the next of his owne kin; briefly, it should not be pestred and
plagued with such unnatural Subjects as delight in the slaughter of their
owne Country men, as comment and approve of the wicked, horrible, and
most odious and detestable Murther of their owne Leige Lord and Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>Now seeing that either the Approbation of murther, as in the Emperor
<hi>Phocas,</hi> or the Allowance of unlawfull usurpations as in <hi>Charles</hi> the great,
or the Toleration of wicked Rebellions, as in <hi>Henry</hi> the son against the

Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the Father; or the maintenance of wrong Titles, as in King
<hi>Pipin</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> or the practise of subtile and devillish devices, as in the

they now challenge.</p>
            <p>But to omit all that might here be conveniently spoken against the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Popes,</hi> against their Authoritie, their Pride, their abuses, and
the Iniuries offered unto all Nations that either voluntarily or forcibly

the great Wrongs, losses, and Indignities which our Realme alone hath
received by receiving the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Authoritie; for, of a brief declaration
hereof will follow this great benefit, that when it shall appeare (as it may
appeare unto as many as will vouchsafe to reade the before named <hi>Marsilius
Pativius</hi>) that their Authoritie is usurped, and that by receiving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the same, our Realm fele many inconveniences, and many
Miseries, from which it is now freed, no man should think her Majestie to
be Lawfully excommunicated, whome the <hi>Pope</hi> hath anathematized for
not reverening him, and his Authoritie, whom her Prede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>effors long since
rejected.</p>
            <p>There was a time when as our Kings, blinded with the same zeale and
affection which now possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the hearts of those Princes which are wholie
devoted unto the <hi>Popes</hi> holiness, honored him as those Princes now do; then
there was no Realme comparable to ours, neither for number, nor for
beautie of religious houses; There was no Country that yeilded greater
Obedience unto the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> no people that was more readie to receive
and entertaine the <hi>Popes</hi> Legats, to honor and reverence them, and to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
and accomplish whatsoever they required at our hands.</p>
            <p>This great zeale and obedience of ours, whereas it should have purchased
us especiall favors (for he that loveth most, ought to be required with most
love) procured us in time great hatred; for no Nation had the like injuries
offered unto them, as were proffered unto us. Whence this hatred proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I shall not need to relate, our H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ease me of that labour and paine,
and the manifold Abuses which are suffered will manifestly prove the
same.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that derogateth more from the Majesty of a King then
to be ruled by Forrein Laws, nor any thing that grieveth or offendeth Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
so much as to be drawen from home into remote and far distint places
to prosecute their Right and Suits in Law; The first is odious, because it
disgraceth the Country whose Prince endureth that Jndignitie; and the last
is grievous, because it is both troublesome and chargeable.</p>
            <p>In the time of our Superstitions and foolish zeale unto the Sea of <hi>Rome,
Thomas Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Cant.</hi> was slaine in his Cathedrall Church by
<hi>William Tracey, Reynold Ursin, Hugh Marvell,</hi> and <hi>Richard Britton;</hi> who

Commandment before our Kings Authoritie, and being grievously offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the great Indignities that were offered unto our King and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for his superstitious and contentious Bishops sake, came out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi>
of purpose to end by his death those troubles and vexations, from
which they thought that our Realme could not be freed so long as he
lived.</p>
            <p>The King when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>this Murther was committed in <hi>England,</hi> was in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
where hearing the News thereof, he greatly lamented his death.
Clothed himself in Sack-Cloth, confessed himself unto Almighty God, and
protested before his divine Majestie, that he neither was guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie or privie to
the Archbishops death, (unless he might be held for guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie which had
just occasion not to love him over well) besides <hi>Henry</hi> the second (for he
was then King) having for this Bishops sake, tasted somewhat of the bitter
fruits of the Popes Indignation, and fearing that when his death should be
known at <hi>Rome,</hi> he should incurr his further displeasure, sent presently
certain Ambassadors unto <hi>Rome</hi> to excuse him, and to signifie his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unto the <hi>Pope;</hi> but his Holiness would not admit them unto his sight,
untill that certaine of his Cardinals told him, that they had express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from their King, to signifie unto his Holiness, that he would stand
to the Popes and his Cardinals Iudgment, and undergo what Penance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it should please him and them to lay and inflict upon him.</p>
            <p>The Pope sendeth two Cardinals into <hi>England,</hi> before whom the King
sweareth, that the Murther of the Archbishop was undertaken and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
without his consent and privitie; And yet because he confessed that in
his wrath and anger he had spoken some words that might perhaps embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Malefactors to committ the same, he could not be Absolved before
he promised to give the Cardinals so much readie money as would maintaine
200. soldiers for a year in the Holy land, and also that all his Subiects should
have libertie to appeale from his Courts unto <hi>Rome;</hi> a great punishment for
a small offence: For what a trouble and grief was it thinke you unto the
Subjects of this Realme, to have all causes carried unto <hi>Rome,</hi> where
they spent their travel and their money many years before they could be
ended, and received no indifferent Iudgment, because their Contentions
were for the most par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (as you shall heare) with <hi>Italians,</hi> who found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
favour, either for money or for love, then our Countrimen, which were
meer Strangers unto the Judges.</p>
            <p>But these griefs are nothing in respect of those which we endured in the
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the which were so grievous, that the King together
with the Clergie and Nobility complained thereof unto the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
which was held in <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the third his time at <hi>Lyons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They complained, first that the Pope not being contented with his
Peter-pence, did newly exact new contributions of the English Clergy,
and still intended to extort more and more from them, contrary to the
ancient Customes and Liberties of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, that the Patrons of Churches, when they fell void, could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
fit Clerks unto them, as by grant from the Pope they might do,
but their Churches were collated unto <hi>Italians,</hi> who understood not our
Mother tongue, and therefore could not instruct their People, whose
Soules for lack of discipline and good instructions perished.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they complained that the Pope imposed upon their Churches
more Pensions then he had formerly promised to take of them, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93045:102"/>
divers taxes within this Realme, without the Kings knowledge or
consent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, that <hi>Italians</hi> succeeded unto <hi>Italians</hi> in the best
Benefices and Ecclesiastical livings of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which followed these Inconveniences; First, there was no Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
kept for the releif of the Poor. Next the word of God was not
preached to the edifying of mens Soules, their divine Service was not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
to the comfort of mens consciences; and lastly church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were
not repaired to the benefit of their next Incumbents.</p>
            <p>It was further shewed, that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> was enforced to
maintain and arme, some Ten Souldiers, others five, and others fifteen, to
bee sent with sufficient Armor and horses to serve the Pope, in what place
soever it pleased him.</p>
            <p>Again it was declared, that although there was an Ancient priviledg
in <hi>England,</hi> that no Legate should come into the Realme unless the King
required and allowed him; yet they came continually one after another,
and the later still exceeded the former in troubling and overcharging the
Realme.</p>
            <p>Moreover it was proved, that besides the Popes Tributes and Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>Italians</hi> held Benefices in <hi>England</hi> to the yeerly value of 60 Thousand
marks; and transported out of the kingdom t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e most part of that money,
to the great impoverishment of our Country.</p>
            <p>Neither were these griefes so lamentable, but that it grieved all estates
in our Country much more, that our best wits for lack of such preferment
as was due unto Learning, were fain to leave the Universities, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves unto Mechanical Trades, and such Occupations as were
not fit for men of their Gifts and capacities, whereby our Realme was
almost induced unto a very Barbarisme.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadors that made this complaint, were men of great dignity,
mature Judgment, and of exceeding great learning: But what could they
prevaile in a Councell where the Popes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Faction was so strong, that at the
very self same time he deposed the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> and sent away our
Ambassadors greatly discontented: For he gave them a charg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> streightly to
command all Bishops in <hi>England</hi> to set their hands and seales to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
Charter which King <hi>Iohn</hi> made to the Pope for a ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rly pension
to be paid unto the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> unto which commandement all the
Bishops (more indiscreetly then wisely) shewed themselves most obedient:
But the King protested that although the Bishops had bowed their knees
unto <hi>Baal,</hi> yet he would stand stoutly in the defence of the Liberty of his
Realme, and would never pay any yearly pension unto <hi>Rome</hi> under the
name of a Tribute.</p>
            <p>I might here take occasion to tell you how this Tribute grew, but you
must remember that I have already touched the same somewhat, in all that
may be said in the behalf of the Pope; and for the maintenance of that
Pension, it hath been lately confuted in a leamed Treatise called <hi>Anti-Sanderus;</hi>
I might also proceed in declaring other inconveniences which
our Realme hath endured by our voluntary subjection unto the Pope: But
these may suffice to commend those our Kings for their wisedome, and
magnanimitie which cast off that yoke, amongst whom there are none that
deserve greater commendation then the Queens Majesty that now raigneth,
and her Noble Father and godly Brother: For some of their predecessors
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93045:103"/>
(indeed) permitted not the Pope to overcharge their Subjects; but they
have discharged them of all kind of Grievances which he was wont to put
them unto, and have both wisely and boldly excluded him and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which he wrongfully usurped. Whereat both his Fatherly reverence
and our Romish S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctaries so much repine, that they cry out with open
mouth, that it is against all Reason, all Divinitie and Scriptures that secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Princes should have and arrogate unto themselves any manner of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in Ecclesiastical causes.</p>
            <p>This, and the Substraction of such Taxes and Impositions, as the
Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> was wont to impose upon the Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh Clergie, are the true and

our Gracious Sovereigne and her kingdom; although he pretendeth
that her dissent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diversitie from his Religion only moveth him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate

               </gap>ir Obedience.
These grievous Accusations be sufficiently answered in a little and very
learned Treatise Called the Execution of Justice.</p>
            <p>But the Chiefest Point which they reprehend in Her Highness Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is there unanswered, and therefore I have thought good to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell it

would be willing nor able not to defray so great charges as should be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
and necessary to maintain an Army by Sea, and an other by land; This
Accusation is auggravated, because her Majesty hath called a Parliement
almost every fourth years since she came to the Crown; and in some of them
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts
with a double Subsidy; A matter (as they say) never heard of in any
of her Predecessors times, nor then needfull when it was required.</p>
            <p>For the better answering of this obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction, I must run over the whole
Raignes of some of her Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sties Predecessors, thereby to make it appear
that they called Parliaments and levied Subsidies as often as her Highness
hath done; And because it would be tedious to trouble you with many, I
have restrained my self unto two only, namely unto <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:93045:104"/>
The Commons granted a Subsidy unto <hi>Edward</hi> the First in the third
year of his Reign, and another within two years after; then having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
expences until the eleventh year of his Reign (which was six
years after) he obtained another Subsidy; And when he had reigned two
and twenty years, the Clergy gave him the half of their goods, the
Inhabitants of the Cities the sixth part, and the rest of the common people
the tenth of all that they possessed. And yet within two years after, he
levied of all Towns-men and Citizens the Eighth part, and of the Country
people the Twelfth part of their goods; and because the Clergy refused
to grant him a Subsidy at that time, they were all excluded from his favor
and protection; for the recovery whereof, some by themselves, and others
by their friends gave him the Fifth part of all that they possessed. Neither
did the Liberality of the Laity, nor the bounty of the Clergy so free
them from further Contribution, but that the very next year after, the
King having occasion to War against <hi>Scotland,</hi> the common people gave
him very willingly the Ninth part of their Goods; the Clergy subject unto
the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> the Tenth, and the Clergy of <hi>York</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess
the Fifth part, because they were nearer to the danger and invasion
of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had a Subsidy of his people the sixth year of his
Reign, and another the next year after, and within four years after the
Commons granted him a Fifteenth, the Burgesses of Towns and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Cities a Tenth, and the Clergy as much for three years together;
And yet the same year, the City of <hi>London</hi> was charged with Two hundred
armed men, <hi>Canterbury</hi> with Forty, St. <hi>Albans</hi> with ten, and other Towns
and Cities according to their wealth and ability. Two years were not fully
ended, but the people were charged again, and so almost every third year
during his reign,, until that in the Forty fifth year thereof he levied a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sum of Fifty thousand Marks of his Subjects; aud within six years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he charged all persons of his Realm, as well men as women that were
fourteen years of age, to pay him Four pence a peece, except onely such as
went a begging from door to door. The like Subsidies were levied by
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
by all the rest of our Kings; the which for brevitie sake, I pass over
with silence.</p>
            <p>But to clear her Majesty the better of this accusation, and to make it
known unto her Subjects how greatly they are bound unto her Highness, for
sparing to use such means for money, as many of her Predecessors used
in time of their necessity; it will not be a miss to acquaint you and
them with many ways that our Princes have practised to releive their wants,
of which her Majesty, although her occasions to use money were greater,
or as great as theirs, never did put any one in practice. In the recital of
these practices, I will not name our Kings in order as they reigned,
but relate their means to make money as they shall come to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the First called (by a Writ called <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>) all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that held any Lands of him, to shew by what Title they held their
Lands, who recovered much money of the meaner sort, who having
no evidences to shew, durst not withstand his demand, untill the
Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> called before the Justices to the same effect, answered,
That he and his Ancestors entering into this Realm with <hi>William</hi> the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93045:104"/>
Conqueror won their Lands by the Sword, and that he would hold his by
the Sword; which stout answer made the king surcease his demand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh wanting money, caused all penal Statutes to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and all forfeitures layed upon his Subjects by them, to be strictly and
severely exacted. Which exaction cost <hi>Richard Empson</hi> and <hi>Edmond Dudly</hi>
their lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the first, in a Parliament held in the one and thirtieth year of his
Reign, put Priests to their fines who lived with their wives still in house with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1166. ordained a Collect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on on to be made through
all his Countries and Dominions of two pence in the pound of every mans
Lands and Goods (Jewels and Apparel onely excepted) to be paid the same
year; and for the space of four years next ensuing one penny of every pound
to be paid yearly; and those that had not the worth in goods and lands to
the value of twenty shillings, and were house-holders, and had any offices,
they should pay a penny to this Contribution. And those that departed
this life within the term that that this Collection was current, their debts
being paid, were appointed by the same Ordinance to pay the tenth part of
all the residue of their goods unto this Contribution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the first, to make money for his voyage against the Turks, levied
a Tax, engaged, sold, and let to Farm his Lands, his Tolls, his Customs,
and other his Revenues, with certain Countries and Offices; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that <hi>Hugh Pudley</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> had great store of ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
he sold to him the Mannor of <hi>Seggesfield,</hi> with the Wapentake belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto the same, and also found means to perswade him to buy his own
Province, which he did, and was thereupon created an Earl by the King
for the same, and was Intitled both Bishop and Earl of <hi>Durham:</hi> He had
likewise great sums of money of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> for Priviledges
granted unto them. Besides he had licence of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to dispence
with such as pleased him for their vows, and to go into the Holy Land, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had taken the cross on them for that purpose, and of those he
took abundantly; and divers others he compelled to fine. Also he feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he had lost his Seal, wherefore he commanded a new to be made, and
willed it to be proclaimed and published in every Country, that those to
whom he had granted any thing by his Deed or Charter, meaning to enjoy
the same in surety, should not think it much to come and have it confirmed
by his new Seal, least afterwards the other being lost, their lawful Titles might
be called in question. Lastly, he levied the tenth part of all the moveable
goods throughout the Realm of <hi>England</hi> to the aid of the Wars; and this
Collection passing under the name of an Alms, was extended upon the
goods of Spirituall men as well as Temporal. This King was (as you shall
hear hereafter) taken Prisoner in returning from those Wars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for his
Ransom order was taken that all manner of persons as well Spiritual as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
should give the fourth part of their whole Revenues due to them, for
that year toward the Kings Ransom. The same king after his retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
sold the Offices of Sheriffs and divers other Offices, and procured a Subsidie
to be given unto him of two shillings of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> lough-land, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that every man should make for him the third part of Knights service ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as every Fee might bear, to furnish him forth into <hi>Normandy.</hi>
The same King by vertue of a Parliament, called back, and resumed into his
hands all Patents, Annueties, Fees, and other Grants, before his voyage
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93045:105"/>
into the Holy Land, by him made, or otherwise granted or alienated. And
because it should not seem he used a meer extort violence herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he treated
with every one of them in most curteous wise, bearing them in hand that
he well knew they meant not to let forth their money unto him upon usury,
but would be contented with such reasonable gains and profit as had been
raised to their use in the time of his absence, of those things which they held
of him by Assignation in way of loan, so that now the same might be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him again, since he meant not to sell them, but to let them forth
as it were to Farm for a time, as all men might well understand, considering
that he could not maintain the port of a King without receipt of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which he had so set forth; And hereunto every man yeelded, although
no man had received a third part of the principal which they had layed forth.
The same King having borrowed a great sum of money of the Merchants
of the Staple, called the Monks of <hi>Osteaux,</hi> gat them to pay the same, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them that he borrowed it of certain Merchants beyond the Sea, upon
confidence of their good benevolence. The same King caused all Offices in
<hi>Aurmen, Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Mayne</hi> to fine with him for their Offices. The same
King seemed in appearance to be offended with his Lord Chancellor for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Truce with the French King, and therefore took the Seal from
him, and caused a new to be made, proclaiming through all his Dominions,
that not any thing sealed with the old Seal should stand in force, both for
that his Councellors had wrought more indiscreetly then was conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent,
and because the same Seal was lost when his Vice-Chancellor was drowned;
wherefore all men were commanded to come to the new Seal that would
have their Charters and Writings confirmed. The same King having levied
two shillings once before of every Hide of land, levied 5 s. of every Hide of
Land for a Subsidie, rating every Hide to certain hundred acres. Lastly, the
same King caused Turneys to be exercised in divers places for the better
trayning of men at Arms in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ats of Arms, whereby he raised no small sums
of money for granting license to his Subjects so to Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ney; every Earl paid
for his license twenty Marks, every Baron ten Marks, and every landed
Knight four Marks, and those that had no land two Marks.</p>
            <p>Now from this King unto others; King <hi>Iohn</hi> in the year 1204 levied
a Subsidie of two Marks and an half of every Knights Fee, belonging as well
unto Spiritual as unto Temporal men; the which exaction must needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great, considering that there were better then forty thousand Knights
Fees in <hi>England,</hi> and that every shilling then was worth three shillings in
these dayes, according to the rate which Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> maketh in his
Book <hi>de Republica Anglorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third revoked all lands granted in his Minority unto his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and called to an accompt all his Officers, displaced some, fined o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
sold his Plate, and borrowed so much money as he could get of the
Londoners, of Priors, Abbots, and of the Jews, of one of which named
<hi>Aaron,</hi> it is written that he had at one time above 30000 Marks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third again obtained certain Authentick Seals of the Prelates
of <hi>England,</hi> and sealed therewith certain writings and instruments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein
it was expressed that he had received certain sums of money for dispatch of
business pertaining to them and to their Churches, of these and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>Florence</hi> and of <hi>Sienna,</hi> whereby they stood bound for repaiment
by the same Instruments, made by him their Agent in their names. The
Pope yeelded his consent unto this shift, because it should go unto the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93045:105"/>
discharging of the kings debts into which he was run by bearing of the
charges of the Wars, whereof I have made mention in another place against
the king of <hi>Sicilie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Henry</hi> caused a Proclamation to be made, that all such as might
dispend 15 l. in land should receive the honour of Knighthood, and those
that would not, should pay their Fines; and five Marks were set on every
Sheriffs head for a Fine, because they had not distrained every person that
might dispend 15 l. land, to receive the order of Knighthood, as was to
the same Sheriffs commanded. The same <hi>Henry</hi> in the Forty fourth year
of his Reign, had granted him a <hi>Scutagium</hi> or <hi>Escuage,</hi> that is fourteen
shillings of every Knights Fee. The same <hi>Henry,</hi> in the second commotion
of the Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> engaged the Shrines of Saints, and other Jewels
and Relicks of the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi> for great sums of money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he got Aid out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> Briefly, the same <hi>Henry</hi> caused
all the weights and measures throughout all <hi>England</hi> to be perused and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and laid great Fines on their heads that were found with false
Weights and with false Measures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the second, for his defence against the Scots had the sixth penny
of temporal mens goods in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Wales:</hi> And <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third for the recovery of <hi>France,</hi> besides other Subsidies, took the ninth
Lamb, Fleece, and Sheaf of Corn through <hi>England.</hi>

                  </gap>hard</hi> the Second had a Mark of the Merchants for every Sack of their
Woolls for one year; and six pence of the buyers for every pound of Wares
brought in from beyond the Seas and here sold. He had likewise towards
his charges for the Wars of <hi>France</hi> a Noble of every Priest, Secular or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and as much of every Nun; and of every married or not married man
or woman being sixteen years old four pence, and forty shillings of every
Sack of Wooll; of which ten shillings to be imployed at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and thirty shillings to be reserved for his necessity.</p>
            <p>In the 24. year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his Reign, when his Majesty married
with her Highness Mother, the Lady <hi>Ann Bullein,</hi> Writs were directed to
all Sheriffs to certifie the names of all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of 40 <hi>l.</hi> lands to receive the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and order of Knighthood, or else to make a Fine.</p>
            <p>It is written by <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> that our Kings when they wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
were wont to feign that they would go into <hi>Scotland</hi> or into <hi>France</hi>
with an Army; and that to make great sums of money, they would levy
men, and pay them for a matter of two or three months, within which
space they would again dismiss their Armies, although they had taken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of their Subjects enough to maintain them for a whole year or more;
and many times they had money of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> or of <hi>France</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the charges of their Wars.</p>
            <p>It is written by <hi>du Haillan</hi> in the Tenth Book of his French History,
that <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> being in great want of money, enjoyed for six
years together all the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nefices of his Realm, and all his Bishopricks, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys,
and Monasteries, wherewith he defraied the expences of his House
and of his Armies; which he might do very well, because the Revenues of
such Benefices as Italian Priests enjoyed sometimes in <hi>England,</hi> came by
just computation to above seventy thousand Marks by the year. And it
was declared in a Parliament held in the 11. year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth
his Reign, that the King might have of the temporal possessions, Lands
and Revenues which were lewdly consumed by the Bishops, Abbots and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93045:106"/>
Priors of <hi>England,</hi> so much as would suffice plentifully to finde and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
150 Earls, 1500 Knights, 6209 Esquires, and an hundred Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
more then were at that time. The same King <hi>Iohn</hi> accused some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one, sometimes another Nobleman of <hi>England,</hi> that they lost his
Towns and Cities beyohd the Seas by their negligence, and fined them at
great sums of money.</p>
            <p>Thus I have with as much brevity as might be, waded through the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reigns of most of the longest-lived Kings of our Realm, and have set you
down about thirty sundry and divers kinds of ways which they have used to
make money in time of their want and necessities; of all which, her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
greatest enemies cannot truly shew or prove that her Highness in
thirty six years that her Grace hath now reigned, ever used as much as one;
and if it may please those that being Fugitives abroad, and most envy and
malign her peaceable and quiet Government at home, to confer the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of her Predecessors with the urgent occasions that her Grace hath
had to use much ready money, they shall finde that her Ancestors never had
so just occasions of necessary expences as her Majesty had of late years, yea
almost for the whole time of her reign.</p>
            <p>For albeit her Majesty hath not had continual open Wars, as some of them
had, yet her charge hath been nothing inferior unto theirs. For first, Wars
are now adays (as I have said) far more chargeable then they were wont
to be. Then her Grace hath had no other Princes to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her expences as her Predecessors had. Next her Loans to foreign
Princes, as to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Navar,</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the late
Duke of <hi>Alencon,</hi> and to the States of the Low Countries have been
very great. And lastly, her charges both by land and Sea could not chuse
but amount yearly to infinite sums, considering how many times her
Highness hath been constrained to send her Navy to the Seas, and her Land
Souldiers forth of the Realm. Besides, her Predecessors charges were
for the most part voluntary, being undertaken to conquer, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Realms, to get other Princes Dominions, and not to conserve
their own; to revenge forein injuries, and not to repulse domestical invasions;
briefly, their Wars were for their own profit, and hers for her Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
considering therefore, that whatsoever her Grace hath levied, not
granted unto her by her Parliament, without any contradiction, without
any accusing her of Prodigal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thout any such exception taken against her
demands, as hath been taken against other her Predecessors, without any sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r evil Government, therefore without any consigning the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and government of the same unto others, then unto them who by her
Majesties appointment have the custody thereof; it is a manifest argument,
that her Subjects were always most willing to yeeld to all manner of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
that her Highness in her Princely Wisdom and Discretion did take
to be necessary for the defence of her Realm. And if these malicious Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
would look upon the governments, upon the Exactions, upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions
of such Princes in whose Realms they either live by Alms, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
up and down as Vagabonds, their own consciences (if at least they have
any) would condemn them of malice, of untruth, or of gross ignorance; for
the wisest amongst them may and are well able to make large volumes of such
Subsidies, Taxes, Impositions and Grievances as are levied in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Spain,</hi> of which the hundreth parts are unknown, much less practised in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and this must needs appear to be most true and manifest, since it cannot
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93045:106"/>
be denied that in some Dukedoms of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Circuit of which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
unto one Shire of <hi>England,</hi> the yearly Revenues of the Duke far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Revenues and Rents of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, if it may please this Viperous generation of Fugitives to call to
mind the Interest that Princes have in their Subjects Goods, and the great
power that is given unto kings in the Old Testament over the Lands and
Possessions of as many as live under their Obedience; and also to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that Princes, the longer they live, the more absolute, Imperious, and
self-conceited they are in the Execution of their Government, and the
more Experienced in their proof, they must rather commend then condemn
her Majesty, whom neither continuance of time, nor fulness of Authority,
nor presumption upon the good Wills of her people, nor confidence upon
the Equity of her Cause, nor the consideration of her Subjects weal,
wholly depending upon her welfare; nor briefly, the remembrance of her
gentle and sweet-Government, hath ever imboldened to be over-chargable
unto the Realm, or over-burthensome unto her Subjects. This grievous
accusation is more truly then briefly refelled.</p>
            <p>Now leaving the rest of these Fugitives suggestions unto another place,
wherein I shall have occasion to handle them more fitly; I will end this point
with condemning the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for being too light in crediting these
Rebels in two principal points.</p>
            <p>For first he ought to have considered,<note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in crediting our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives.</note> that neither the vain Pamphlets dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
by his lying Ambassador <hi>Mendoza,</hi> nor the malicious book written by
Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> was able to alter, remove, or shake the natural and dutifull
affections of our English Subjects; they were too well acquainted with the
Ambassadors old and inveterate malice, with his hostile practices, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
intents. They knew the Cardinal to be a Religious Fugitive, to sell
his tongue and the use thereof for money, to be like unto <hi>Richard Shaw,</hi> that
was hired to preach at <hi>Pauls</hi>-Cross, and there publickly to justifie the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
usurpation of <hi>Richard</hi> the third; to resemble the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
who neither feared nor blushed to commend the same cause for just and most
lawfull in the <hi>Guildhall London;</hi> to imitate <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> a Preacher of <hi>France,</hi>
who for a far less bribe then a Cardinalship, allowed, approved, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
in Pulpit and in writing, the most horrible murther committed by
the Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> on the person of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> And lastly to
follow his example, who (without all example) was not ashamed to write
a large volumn against the late king of <hi>France,</hi> and therein to deduce many
reasons, many causes, for and by which he maintained that the said King
might be lawfully deposed, and another set up and established in his place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he might have considered that those Fugitives are (for the
most part) peevish and discontented Schollers, fitter to mannage a Pen then
a Lance, to dispute of Philosophy, then to discourse of War, to be partial
in their own conceits, then to be prodigal in their assurance; briefly, to be
ready to say more then they know, especially when they are either assured, or
in good hope, by saying much to obtain much: he might have remembred
that <hi>Iohannes Viennensis</hi> sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth of
<hi>France,</hi> although he was a man of great experience, a Captain of
long continuance, aud one that by his long abode in <hi>Scotland</hi> knew
<hi>England</hi> and her Forces far better then our Fugitives do, deceived his
King at his return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in reporting unto him the strength of
our Nation; he had fought with many of our Armies, had seen 60000 Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93045:107"/>
8000 and Horsmen of ours in the Field, was of opinion that our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was easie to be conquered within the Realm, howsoever it prevailed and
conquered abroad; And lastly, he both knew and signified unto the king,
that the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was absent in <hi>Portugal</hi> with the Flower and chief
Youth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moved the French king to determine to invade <hi>England</hi>
presently, to carry an huge Army to <hi>Sluce</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to assemble all the
Nobility and Peers of his Realm for that voyage, and to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>se unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an assured victory against <hi>England.</hi> But what event had this Journey?
What effect followed of this perswasion? The king hearing that the Duke
of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was returned out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that in <hi>England</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r greater
Forces were prepared to resist his invasion then <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
withdrew his Forces from <hi>Sluce</hi> unto the places from whence they
came; and as the Spaniards would cover their dishonour received in their
attempt against <hi>England</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> his not joyning with them
in convenient time, as it was decreed in <hi>Spain</hi> before they departed out of
<hi>Spain;</hi> so they laid the fault of not proceeding in the journey upon the Duke
of <hi>Berry,</hi> who knowing the Forces of <hi>England</hi> (as undoubtedly the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> did far better then those that took upon them to make report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
came not unto the French king at <hi>Sluce</hi> until the dead of <hi>Winter,</hi> when it
it was too late to depart thence to invade <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Frenchmen falsly charged the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Bribes of the king of <hi>England</hi> to divert his king from his intended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
against <hi>England;</hi> So the Spaniards more indirectly then justly,
blame the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that in consideration of some reward either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
or promised from us, he held not his promise to joyn his power with
the <hi>Spanish</hi> strength against us.</p>
            <p>And lastly, as of the French vain enterprises and all the preparations
thereof, there came nothing else into <hi>England</hi> but certain great Tents and
lodgings of Wood, capable, (as their Authors report) of all their kings
huge Army; So of the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh invincible Navy, and of their mighty
Army, nothing was seen in <hi>England</hi> but the spoil of their strong Armado,
and the flags of their tallest ships, which were brought to <hi>Pauls</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>Cross and
there shewed unto the People as notable monuments of their wonderous
overthrow.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the death of the Queen of Scots, a Queen in whom God
had joyned some vertues with many vices;<note place="margin">The late Scotish Queens death gave the Spaniard no just occasion to invade <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> a happy Queen, if she had not
been too much affected unto the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> too much lead and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
by the Spanish King; a Pope and a King that have overthrown more
noble Families in <hi>England, France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> then they
have true and good Noblemen within their Realms and Dominions.</p>
            <p>Of this Queen because she was nobly descended, and the mother of a
most noble King, I forbear to set down what <hi>Buchanan</hi> hath written: And
yet because her Majesty is charged to have done her to death wrongfully, I
cannot but relate what another reporteth of her; Another, that was neither
an Englishman, nor a Scot, but a German: Another that writeth of her as
<hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> doth of his Emperors, <hi>Sine ira &amp; studio,</hi> without hatred or
affection; for she was unto him as those Emperors were to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> neither
known for any good turn that ever he received of her, nor hated for any
wrong that ever she did unto him. <hi>This Queen</hi> saith my Author) <hi>being
weary of her second husband, whose life was often sought, and at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily

shortned, not long after his death married</hi> James Hepborn <hi>Earl of</hi>
Bothwel, <hi>whom during her Husbands life she had used most fumiliurly.
Certain Noblemon of</hi> Scotland, <hi>being greatly moved with the indignity of
so wicked a deed, and desirous to revenge so horrible a Parricide, raised
an Army against the Queen, and forced her to resign her Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her young Son; But they confined her unto a certain Island, whence
escaping the next year by corrupting her Keepers, and the</hi> Hamiltons <hi>Forces
which fought in her defence, but overthrown by the Lord Protector of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>she meaning to go unto her Mothers friends into</hi> France, <hi>took her

intended by the instigation of the Pope against the Queen of</hi> England <hi>her
State for the delivery of the</hi> Scottish <hi>Queen, and establishing her in both
Kingdoms, were revealed and discovered, she was more straightly kept and

Commons of the Parliament House, and executed the same year accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against this Sentence,<note place="margin">Six Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>half of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Q. used by her friends to prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that she could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Queen.</note> and his execution there are made these excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
First, it is said, That the late Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being an absolute
Prince as well as the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> could not be condemned to death
by her, because <hi>Par in parem non habet potestatem.</hi> Next it is alleadged,
that if a Prince should so much forget himself, as not onely to pronounce,
but also to execute a sentence of death upon his Equal, over whom he hath
no manner of Jurisdiction or Authority, other Princes will be greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with this Sentence, and never endure that it should be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
To these Reasons there is added a Third, That since there is no
Law as yet written to punish a Prince with death, they think it unlawful to
make new Laws, new Statutes for the punishment of a Prince; and in case
it were lawful, it is not known who should make these Laws, who should
adminster them, who should execute them; and therefore sithence there is
no law against Princes, there can be no great punishment inflicted upon
Princes; and because there was never any custom known or practised to
proceed so severely against Princes Lives, it must needs be against all good
Cust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m to call their Behaviour in question, or their Lives into danger.</p>
            <p>The favourers of this cause proceed further, and look upon the malice
and wickedness of Subjects, who as soon as they begin to hate their Prince,
unjustly and for no occasion, would quickly by themselves or by other
Princes, by open violence, or by secret conspiracies, be rid of their Princes;
So (say they) would it come to pass, that by whom Princes ought to be
preserved, by them they should perish; and by whose help they mould be
delivered against all others, through their hatred they should be destroyed
by themselves.</p>
            <p>The Patrons and Advocates of this Queen bring another reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their opinion. For (say they) if a Prince fall willingly into another
Princes hands, or if it happen that flying from his malicious Subjects, or
from his foreign Enemies, or being driven by Tempest, or other casualty
into one Kingdom, when he meant to go into another, or that being in the
field, one Prince is detained by another, the detainer that shall not ransom
but execute such a Prince, shall break and violate the Laws of Arms, of
Humanity, or of Hospitality.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Laws of Nations require, that Princes Ambassadors, even
in the hottest broils, and most bloody contentions that are betwixt Princes,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93045:108"/>
shall have free ingress and egress into and out of the Kingdoms into which
they are sent: But if the Laws permit, or rather command Ambassadors,
who do but represent the persons of Princes, to be free from all dangers;
what honest or just pretext can there be to violate or wrong their Lords
and Masters? For, it is against all reason, against common pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
to spare the Servant, and to spoil the Master; not to hurt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and to murder the Prince; to dismiss the Messenger, and to detain the
Sender; briefly, to honor him who representeth another mans person, and
to disgrace the party whose person is represented.</p>
            <p>These are the most substantial Reasons that are made against this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
And to every one of these I will frame a brief Answer. <hi>Par in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
non habet potestatem.</hi> And therefore Princes who are most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
equals,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the first Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> cannot exercise any power or authority one against ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her. True
it is, that this is an ancient principle or maxime in Law; but as other Rules
or Maximes have their exceptions, so this position is not without a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without an exception or interpretation. Two Magistrates (I grant)
being made and constitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by their Superior with equal power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
have no power or jurisdiction one over another; but they are created
as it were with this condition, that they shall use the authority which is
given them by their Princes against their Inferiors, and to those that are
subject to their several jurisdictions. But sithence this Law was made in
their behalf onely who do acknowledge a Superior, and that in such a time,
and in such a State in which there were many Magistrates but one King;
many Judges but one Emperor; many that were equa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s among themselves,
but one that excelled them all in power and and authority; I take it that the
same concerneth absolute Princes no more then a privilege granted to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
alone belongeth unto <hi>Marius;</hi> For sithence that the charge and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of time hath brought forth so many Kings instead of one Emperor,
that almost every Country hath now his several King: Since the consent
and general agreement of people hath given full power and authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Kings to make what Laws they pleased; since need and necessity
requireth that new Laws be made and published almost every day; and
that they being once made, shall not be of force out of those Realms within
which they are established, it cannot be but both absurd and ridiculous to
beleeve and affirm that a Law made many hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed years ago, by a Roman
Emperor, and that in <hi>Italy,</hi> shall in these days bind those Princes over
whom the Emperor hath no manner of power, and that when a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
had it long sithence abrogated and abolished. For as many Shires
and Provinces of <hi>England, France</hi> and other Countries, which had their
several Kings, are now reduced under the obedience of one King; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
the Emperor, which was wont to command many Nations, is now
brought to such alow ebb, to so smal and slender an Estate, that he can hardly
challenge the absolute Rule and Government over the twentieth part of
one Nation;</p>
            <p>Since therefore Laws made by our Ancestors are so derived to our after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commers,
that it may be well said, that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as well Successors unto
them in their Laws, as they are their Heirs in their goods; it is certain that
many Laws remain still which were made many years ago; but no Prince
will admit or allow them any longer then they shall be found to be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and expedient for the Commonwealth, or then they shall not diminish
their royal Authority; hence it cometh that some men hold opinion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93045:108"/>
King cannot make a Law which shall prejudice his Successors: hence it
cometh that former Laws may Lawfully be abrogated; and others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be quite contrary, made in their stead, so that they be found
profitable for the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate. Hence lastly it cometh that the latter Statute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
the former, and that which came last to light obtained most force.
Neither although there be but very few or no Princes, (especially in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome)
which even in these days of Weakness and infirmity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
do not greatly respect and reverence the Emperor; And albeit there
be very few Lawyers which do not both read and admire the large volumes
of the Civil Laws, Compiled, or rather digested into order by <hi>Iustinian</hi>
the Emperor; yet is there any King that useth the same Laws as <hi>Iustinian</hi>
his Laws? Or any Civilian that joyneth not the knowledge of the Statutes
and Constitutions of his Country with the Studie of the Imperial decrees
and Ordinance? In <hi>England</hi> the Civil Law hath small force, and lesse use:
In <hi>France</hi> it is in great Credit; but there is a Capital punishment laid upon
them who in pleading a Cause presume to alledge a Civill Text as a Law
made by the Emperor, but they alledged them as Laws approved by the
French King. For, when as the King of <hi>France</hi> perceived that his Majesty
should be greatly blemished and prejudiced, if he should Govern his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Forreigne Laws, and yet he saw that it was impossible to have or
invent better Laws then the Civil Laws are, he entertained the best of
them, being very loth that so good Laws should utterly perish, and be
forgotten; But he commanded them to be Called his and his Successors
Lawes, least that it might turn to his discredit to Governe by other Princes
Laws. What accompt other Nations make of the Civil Laws, it is
easie to Conjecture by this; That in <hi>Germany</hi> it self, in which only
Country the Emperor hath Imperial authority, there are many Provinces
which have banished the Civil Law.</p>
            <p>Considering therefore that Laws made in <hi>Spaine</hi> binde not us in <hi>England;</hi>
and that the Frenchmen are not tyed to ours; who shall be esteemed wise
that will affirm, that these Kings are Subject unto <hi>Iustinians</hi> Laws, which
are nothing inferior unto <hi>Iustinian</hi> his Successor in power and Authority?
But grant that the Emperors Laws have now as great Force and Strength
as ever they had, and that this Maxime, Principle, or Rule in Law (<hi>Par in
parem non habet potestatem</hi>) doe bind all the Kings of the World; yet
it shall appear that it cannot any thing at all availe the late Scottish
Queen.</p>
            <p>For First, as it oftentimes happeneth that men of great Authority, lose
the same by their own default, or Negligence; So princes going our of their
own Countries into other kingdoms and Dominions, make themselves infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
unto them in whose kingdom they remaine.</p>
            <p>This is proved by Common experience. For, what Householder (be he
never so poor will suffer a rich man to rule, or be his better in his own
House? What Master of a Ship will permit a Passenger, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he of never so
great Wealth, to Guide or Governe his ship? Or what Captain can or
will endure that a young Nobleman, be he of never so great birth and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
shall lead and direct his Soldiers? The sweetness which is in Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
admitteth no Companion; The Pope, the Emperor, or if there were any
greater then they, hath no share, no part or Portion therein; but all, were it
never so much, belongeth wholy unto him that ruleth; And there is such a
feeling, such pleasure in this sweetness, that to extenuate the same by words
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93045:109"/>
is dangerous, to diminish it by deeds perilous, and to make others partakers
of it, foolish in a King, and Capital in a Subject. <hi>Eumenes</hi> was King but of
a poore Castle, and yet he would not accknowledge mightie <hi>Antigonus</hi> for
his Superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> was a Subject, and yet he could not endure any one
man to bee above him. <hi>Caesar</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet he could not
brooke an equall: And the late Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> a Prince of no great
Power or Wealth, and yet he held himself for as absolute a Prince as the
mightie Monarch of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This again is proved by a notable example of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the
4. who coming into <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. King of <hi>France,</hi>
to end all debates and quarrells betwixt him and our King, was mett upon
the way by the <hi>French</hi> King; which is a ceremony observed by them who
acknowledge themselves to bee inferior unto him whom they meet, but
the Emperor as soon as they were mett, would have yeilded the highest
place unto the King, and accepted it not without great ceremony; and it
was written that it was given him but of Curtesie, a Curtesie usuall among
Princes aswell as amongst private men; for as private men in their own
houses, and at their own Tables, will of Curte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie sett meaner men then they
are before themselves; so Princes when strange Kings come into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
will preferr them before themselves. It is ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tain that the Emperor
precedeth of right, all the Princes of Christendom. And yet when
<hi>Francis</hi> the first King of <hi>France,</hi> was brought from <hi>Pavia,</hi> where he was
taken Prisoner, into <hi>Spain,</hi> at their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st meeting, the Emprror and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
one another on horseback, with their Capps in their hands, and in
covering their heads there pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d great ceremony betwixt them, each
of them striving to bee the last that should bee covered, and after
that they had talked a while, they both covered their heads at one very
selfesame time. And after that there was a new strife betwixt them for the
right hand.</p>
            <p>This again is proved by the Emperor <hi>Sigismond,</hi> who when hee would
have made the Earle of <hi>Savoy</hi> (as you have heard upon an other occasion)
Duke at <hi>Lyons,</hi> hee was commanded by the Kings Attorney not to attempt
any such thing in <hi>France,</hi> aswell because it was thought, that being in an
other Kings Country, he lost his Authority and Power to create a Duke,
as for that it seemed unto the <hi>French</hi> King that he was not to suffer him to
use any Royall Authority within his dominions.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Scotts</hi> therefore when shee was in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Queens Majesty.</note> was inferior
unto the Queens Majesty, and this inferioritie is proved by three other
principal Reasons. The one because there is an inequalitie betwixt
Kings; one of them being better then an other. The other because she
was her Majesties Vassall; and the third because she was deposed, and so
no longer a Queen; First for the inequality, it is certain that the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> be both resolute Princes, and yet <hi>France</hi> challengeth
precedency before <hi>Spain</hi> for five principal causes.</p>
            <p>The first, because the consent and opinion of the learned is for <hi>France,</hi>
and not for <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, because the <hi>French</hi> Kings have a long time had the honor to
be Emperors, and not the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, because the <hi>French</hi> Kings have been called most <hi>Christian</hi>
Kings these many hundred yeares, and <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the fift was the first (and
that but lately) that was called the Catholick King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:93045:109"/>
The fourth, because at the Feast of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>England, France</hi> even
in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, was preferred before <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift, because the house of <hi>France</hi> is more ancient then that of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which raigned long before the Castle of <hi>Hapsburg</hi> was builded.</p>
            <p>The sixt and last, because the book of ceremonies (which is kept at <hi>Rome</hi>)
preferreth <hi>France</hi> before <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to <hi>France</hi> is <hi>England,</hi> as appeareth by the same book, which
putteth <hi>England</hi> in the second place, and <hi>Spain</hi> in the third. Again, those
Kings are best which are Crowned; and by the same book it is evident, that
<hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> only have Crowned Kings. Next it seemeth
that the meaner sort of Kings also strive for Precedency, and one of them
will be accompted better then another; For it is written that <hi>Matthew</hi> King
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> thinking himself better then <hi>Ladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> when
they met once together, <hi>Matthew</hi> went bare-headed, and tyed about the
head with a green Garland, because hee would not put off his Capp
unto the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> but have him put off his unto him; which the King of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> perceiving, deceived his expectation, by tying his own Capp
so fast unto his head, that when they met hee could not put it off;
and so the <hi>Hungarian</hi> being bare-headed, saluted the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> that was
covered.</p>
            <p>But to leave these Inequalities,<note place="margin">That the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> owe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage unto the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> and to come unto the second point, which
being proved, it must needs follow, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen was farr inferior
unto our Queen, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>o whom shee owed honor, homage, and obedience:</p>
            <p>Many of our Kings have challenged the Soveraignity over <hi>Scotland,</hi> but
none prosecuted the same more eagerly then <hi>Edward</hi> the first; who because
hee would be sure that his right thereunto was good, caused all the

bookes he could finde in them to prove his Title. The King found in the
Chronicles of <hi>Mariamis Scotus,</hi> of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesburg,</hi> of <hi>Roger</hi>
of <hi>Hoveden,</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both these kingdoms, in the nine hundred and eleventh year, chose the said
<hi>Edward</hi> for their Soveraign Lord. He found further that <hi>Adeslaus</hi> King of
<hi>England</hi> subdued in the yeare nine hundred twenty six <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
and that the People of both Countries submitting themselves
unto him, swore unto him both fidelity and homage. Hee found again that
King <hi>Edgar</hi> overcame <hi>Rinad</hi> the son of <hi>Alphinus</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and that by
that victory, he became King of Four kingdoms, namely of <hi>England,
Scotland, Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> He found also that St. <hi>Edward</hi> gave
the kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bee held under him, unto <hi>Malcolm,</hi>
son unto the King of <hi>Cumberland;</hi> and that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror in
the sixt year of his raigne conquered the said <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and took an
oath of homage and fidelity of him. The like did <hi>William Rufus</hi> unto
the same <hi>Malcolm,</hi> and unto his two Sons, who raigned one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
Besides it appeareth unto the said <hi>Edward,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi>
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the consent of <hi>Henry</hi> the first King of <hi>England;</hi> that <hi>David</hi>
King of <hi>Scots</hi> did homage unto King <hi>Stephen;</hi> and <hi>William</hi> unto King

            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93045:110"/>
It appeared again by the Chronicles of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> King
of <hi>Scots</hi> in the thirty year of King <hi>Henries</hi> Raigne, married <hi>Margaret</hi>
his Daughter at <hi>Yorke,</hi> and then and there did him homage for his
Kingdom; Lastly it appeared by the Popes Bulls written into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were excommunicated by divers Popes because
they would not obey the Kings of <hi>England</hi> their Lords and Soveraignes.</p>
            <p>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> against all this and whatsoever else may be said by us to fortifie and
defend our Title, the <hi>Scots</hi> make three principall Objections.</p>
            <p>The first that their King never did homage unto us but for the Countries
of <hi>Northumberland; Cumberland, Westmerland</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> the which
they confess they held of our Kings, and by their grant and guift.</p>
            <p>The second, that <hi>Edward</hi> the third being chosen Arbitrator of the great
and notable contention that was betwixt <hi>Iohn Bali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>
for the Kingdom, took the two Competitors aside, and sounded which
of them would take the kingdom to hold it of him, which when <hi>Robert</hi>
(whose Title was, as they thought best) refused to do, and <hi>Iohn</hi> was
content to performe, hee wrongfully pronounced Judgement for <hi>Iohn
Baliol;</hi> and so extorted this Homage by Fraud and Corruption.</p>
            <p>The third, that the Estates of the Realme never acknowledged this
Homage, but were so farr from yeilding thereunto, that the Nobility
of <hi>Scotland</hi> deprived <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> of the Crown, and gave the same unto
<hi>Robert</hi> the first, because he submitted himself and his Kingdom unto King <hi>Ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions may not be unanswered; and therefore unto
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>very one of them in Order. True it is that a King may hold his Kingdom
of no Superior, and yet owe Homage for some Member thereof unto
another, or some Principality that hee holdeth of an other, and he
shall still nevertheless remaine a most absolute King: For who will
deny King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England</hi> to be either absolute or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
King of <hi>England,</hi> although he swore Homage and Fidelity
unto King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Gascoigne</hi> and other Dominions which
he held of him in <hi>France?</hi> Or who will take the Emperor <hi>Chales</hi>
the fift not to bee an absolute and Soveraign King in <hi>Spain</hi> or other
his Dominions and Kingdomes, because hee sometimes owed Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and Homage unto the <hi>French</hi> King for the Dukedome of
<hi>Burgondy?</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the case is altered in the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> because hee
did Homage both for these Countries and for his Kingdom:
And this is no good Argument. The King of <hi>Scots</hi> did Homage
unto <hi>England</hi> for certain English Provinces held of <hi>England,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did not Homage for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the second Objection is of better weight, and yet may bee thus
answered; I might here oppose the Credit of an English man against
a Scots credit, and desire to have <hi>Holinshed,</hi> and <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for us, to be as well believed as <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> and <hi>George Buchanan</hi>
would bee credited when they speake for <hi>Scotland.</hi> But you shall heare
this Objection confuted by an <hi>Italian,</hi> namely by <hi>Pelidore Virgil,</hi> a man
of more indifferency, of less partiality, and perhaps of better Judgement:
against whom if it be be said, that he was either hired to write our History
favorably, or that he could write nothing of us but what he had from us; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that there was never any man justly condemned upon a bare and light
suspition; and I eftsoones say as I once said before, that where a matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved but by domestical witnesses, there such a proof is both allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:93045:110"/>
Then to refell this Objection, I say out of <hi>Polid. Virgil,</hi> that K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
pronounced not Judgment for <hi>Iohn Balioll</hi> because he promised to
hold <hi>Scotland</hi> in homage of him, but because he came of the eldest
Daughter of King <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> of the Second. I strengthen
my saying by these Arguments; First, it is said, that King <hi>Edward</hi> very
wisely, when as this great con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ention was referred unto his Audience and
determination, he called together (as <hi>Hector Boeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> himself writeth) the
learnedst men of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Scotland;</hi> he sent the State of the Question
into <hi>France,</hi> whence he received Answer, that <hi>Iohn Baliolls</hi> Title was the
better; And because he might be su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pected if he should examine the matter
alone, and give sentence himself, he chose 12. <hi>English</hi> men (as <hi>Boetius</hi> saith)
or 20. (as <hi>Holinshed</hi> reporte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h) and as many <hi>Scots</hi> as English men, whom
he made Judges of the controversie; and they when they had throughly
discussed both conpetitors Rights, gave Judgment for <hi>Iohn Balioll,</hi> which
Award was confirmed by the King. Then whenas the King had seen so
many Evidences and proofs confirming his Right and Title unto the
Soveraignity of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as are before mentioned, is it likely that he who
had Right to that which he demanded, would condition with the
Competitors in such manner as is objected? Lastly although he had
made <hi>Iohn Bali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll</hi> to enter into such a condition, and to binde himselfe
thereunto, this cannot help the <hi>Scots,</hi> for that it is lawfull for any
Man to Claime his Right at any time, and to tell him that is likely
to detaine and withstand his Right, that he shall not have his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Favor unlesse he will be content. And this is most lawful in a
cause of Contention betwixt the Soveraigne and his Vassal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Soveraigne must require Homage at his hands, and the
Vassal is not (in some Mens opinion) bound to do him homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be required.</p>
            <p>The third Objection is Answered with as little difficultie as the rest:
For the chief Peers of <hi>Scotland</hi> acknowledged Obedience and homage
unto King <hi>Edward:</hi> They consented unto the delivery which <hi>Iohn Balioll</hi>
made unto our king of his kingdom; they required our king to be bound
(as he was) in an hundred thousand Marks to deliver the kingdom to thier
king again within two moneths; and they appointed certain principal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
to receive and keep the Revenues and Profits of the Crown to his
use, whom King <hi>Edward</hi> should declare to have best Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Iohn Balioll</hi> was not deprived of his Crown by the States
and Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as <hi>Bucanan</hi> reporteth) but was enforced (as
<hi>Hector Boetius</hi> restifieth) to resigne all his right in the Crown unto
King <hi>Edward,</hi> and to relinquish and give over his kingdom and at; the same
time all the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> did swear homage and Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence unto
our King: and <hi>Boetius</hi> hath nothing to say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their defence, but that our
King enforced them thereunto; As though it were not lawfull for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to constraine his Vassals and Subjects (in case fair means cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with them) by violence to acknowledge their duty and service unto
him. But it pleased the Almighty to punish the Scotish disloyalty, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Rebellion: they revolted often; They broke their promise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times; They thought it lawfull to delude us with fair words, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us with vaine promises; But the eternall who hateth deceivers, and
deceitfull dealings, so prospered all our Attemps against them, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93045:111"/>
our King for a while left them destitute of a King, caused them to swear
and submit themselves unto some of his own laws; made the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
(whose name was <hi>Odomar Valentinian</hi>) Governor of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to
the end they should have no Memory, no Monument nor Testimony of a
Royal Majesty, he transferred a Seate of Stone (whereupon their Kings were
wont to sit at their Coronation) out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and the same
remainth at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s day at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to leave these and the like Testimonies, because they carry the
lesse credit, for that they are reported by our own Historiographers, I will
come to the violent presumptions which may be gathered out of their own
Histories.</p>
            <p>First, it cannot be denyed that God hath blessed us with many famous
and notable Victories against the <hi>Scots.</hi> Then it must be granted that we
had alwaies wit enough to make our best advantage of those victories.
Next, it is not likely but that we took the benefit of such advantage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: And
who will think that when we were so often provoked, so many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
so throughly informed of our Right, that we would not claime
our Right? Againe, at the very time of this notable competency betwixt
<hi>Iohn Balioll</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> it is written that <hi>Ericus</hi> King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stly, why may it not be thought, that as these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Dominions remaine still in their old Subjection and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
their Ancient Soveraigne, so <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to do the like? Our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
seldome failed us against them; They never used us so kindly, nor
our kings at any time behaved themselves so unwisely, that they Resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Right and Title unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> as other Princes have done.</p>
            <p>But now to the like advantage of this kind of inferiority, as a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
contracting or bargaining with one of our Nation in <hi>England,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself by this contract and Bargaine a Subject unto our Laws; so
any man whatsoever offending within our Realm subjecteth himself, by
reason of his offence, unto our Jurisdiction: And this is so true, that a
very mean man being a Judge, if a great personage remaining under his
Jurisdiction (who by reason of his greatness may seem to be freed from
his Authority) shall commit an offence worthie of Punishment during his
abode there, the same mean and Inferior Judge may lawfully punish his
Offence. Example will make this matter more cleer. For Example sake
then, grant that a Bishop abideth a while within an Archdeacons
Jurisdiction, and there offendeth in some Crime that deserveth Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the question may be, whether the Archdacon may punish this
delinquent?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:93045:111"/>
For the Negative, it may be said, that <hi>Par in parem non habet protestatem,</hi>
much lesse an Inferior against his Superior; and that an Archdeacon is <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Episcopi,</hi> and <hi>Major post Episcopum;</hi> and therefore can have no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over a Bishop; yet it is resolved, that if the Bishop be a stranger, and not
a Bishop of the Diocesse, the Archdeacon hath sufficient Authority and
the power to Chastise and Correct his offence; but he cannot meddle
with him if he be his own Bishop; and the reason of the diversity is, because
his own B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shop is as it were the Archdeacons spirituall Father, and it is not
Convenient that the Son should have any manner of Authority over the
Father. Now since it is certaine, that where there is the like reason, there the
like Law shall be, I may boldly infer by this Law; that the Scottish Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
offending within her Majesties Dominion, may be punished by her Grace, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she were her farr better.</p>
            <p>I might here, before I come unto her voluntary and forcible Resignation
of the Crown, tell you, that she committed many things, both before and
after her Imprisonment, that made a plaine forfeture of her Kingdome; But
although when I t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uched the duties of Vassals in some part, I promised to
touch the same in this pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce more largely; yet for brevitie sake, I must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this large discourse, and only tell you, that as the French King called our
King <hi>Iohn</hi> in question for the murther commited by him (at his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation)
on the person of his Nephew <hi>Arthur,</hi> and forfeited his States in
<hi>France</hi> for his not Apperance, or insufficient Answer unto that Crime; so
if the Scottish Subjects had not deprived their Queen for the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icide la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to her charge, our Queens most excellent Majestie might not only have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
notice thereof, but also have punished the same. For, albeit the Fact
was committed without her Highness Realm and Dominion, yet the
person who was murthered being her Subject and Kinsman, her grace
might <hi>ex eo capite,</hi> in my simple opinion, lawfully have proceeded against the
Malefactor. And I remember that I saw a man executed at <hi>Venice</hi> because he
killed his own Wife in <hi>Turky;</hi> and the reason why they proceeded against
him, was the hainousness of the Fact, and for that his Wife (although
she were not so) was their naturall Subject. And yet I confesse that our
Common Laws regard not offences commited without our Realm; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me thinketh they have small reason; For, sithence that for a Bargain made
beyond the Seas I may have my re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edy here; why shall not have the benefit
of Law for my Child and Kinsman, or any other that is near and dear unto
me murthered beyond the Seas, since the life of a Subject ought to be of far
greater value and worth then his goods? And if in a Civill action, of which
the Cause and originall is given beyond the Seas, they can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Bond and
Obligation to be made at <hi>Lyons,</hi> within some Shire in <hi>England,</hi> when indeed
the same <hi>Lyons</hi> which they meane, and where the Bond was made, is in
<hi>France,</hi> why may they not lawfully use the like Fiction in a Criminal Cause?</p>
            <p>But now the third point that Argueth the late Scottish Queens Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
unto our Queen; She was deposed, and therefore no longer a
Queen.</p>
            <p>This point hath in it two very strange points. It is strange to hear that a
Man or a woman being borne a Prince should be deprived; and that he which
receiveth a Kingdom by his birth, should lose the same before his
death. But because this point hath great affinitie which the third objection
that is made against the unfortunate Queens Execution, I will forbear to
speak thereof untill I come to that Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93045:112"/>
Considering therefore all the premisses, I may boldly conclude, that
notwithstanding our often repeated Maxime, <hi>Par in Parem non habet potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem;</hi>
Her Majesties proceeding against the Scotish Lady was most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
For, although as there is but one Sun and one Moon in the Firmament,
so there should be but one king in a kingdome, yet this king may receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
coming into his Dominion (if he will) gentlie, for that is huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
but let him neither admit him to be his Companion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he earnestly intreat him; for that were folly; nor to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to punish him if he offend; for that would argue foolish Pusillanimitie.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperor, that he having taken <hi>Frederick</hi> his
Competitor Prisoner in the Wars, took his Oath that he should never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

greatly rebounded (say the Scotish Queens favourers) unto her Majesties
Commendation, if it had pleased her to have preserved the unfortunate

            <p>Truly, Compassion and Mercy in a Queen towards a Queen is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and it becometh the Feminine Sex (whose hearts are more tender

be shewed without manifest danger unto him that shall shew it, I hold it for
crueltie rather then clemency to use it; For there is <hi>quaedam credulis miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia;</hi>
and sometimes to spare a sinner, is as much as to kill a sinner; and

This Ayde was deferred from day to day; and the longer it was delayed,
the greater was <hi>Cleomenes</hi> desire to return into his country; And therefore
finding that his courteous host was so given unto Wine and Drunkennesse
that there was small hope to have present helpe from him, he entred into
conspiracy with some of his Nobles against him, and thought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
by force, what he could not obtaine by intreaty, but he failed of
his purpose; And he that meant to have killed, was killed.</p>
            <p>But what if <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had understood his Treason before it was put in
practise, and he punished him according to his deserts, who would or
could have justly blamed him for repelling Force by Force? who would
have been grieved at so unthankfull a Guests death? who would have
sought revenge for so ungratefull a person? who, to be short, would have
reproved in an other that which he would have done himself, if the like

Some cannot endure that any man should presume to tell them of their
faults, and very few can finde in their hearts to pardon him that would take
away their lives: In which opinion the more stiffly they dwell, the more
reason I give them, because such Lenity would encourage wicked and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
men to intend and procure their final destruction. For if <hi>Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had killed <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with impunity, who would not have been animated by
his Example to have made the like Attempt, especially against him whose
death might yeeld him any manner of benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In regard whereof <hi>Ptolemy</hi>
examined <hi>Cleomenes</hi> his Treason after his death, and finding him guilty,
condemned his memory, and caused his dead carcass to be hanged up to his
great dishonour and perpetual infamy. There lived many good and courteous
Princes in that age; but none of them reprehended <hi>Ptolomy</hi> his action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they saw that if they tolerated or allowed <hi>Cleomenes</hi> his Ingratitude
and Treason, being such as no man but a most wicked man ever adventured

conscience or difficulty to have done the like.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Scotish Queen, not onely resembled, but exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor could not serve her for so faithfull a Councellor as was <hi>Craesus;</hi> nor in
sparing her, she was to regard any mans favour or friendship, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the

he shewed mercy unto his Competitor <hi>Frederick;</hi> why should her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

her in her enterprises; And therefore it had been as much to fear him,
as to be afraid to execute a Thief, for fear of his Companion. Should she
have born respect unto the Guisards? Why she knew their hatred was so
great towards her, that she needed not to fear to increase the same, and she had
so provided that they should not be able to annoy her. Should she have been
afraid of the French Kings displeasure? Why she sent her Process, her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
her Arraignment unto him, and found that he rested well and
throughly satisfied therewith, and he was to reap a great benefit by her
death; for he was discharged of the Dower which she had yearly out of
<hi>France.</hi> Lastly, should she have stood in fear of her sons displeasure? Why
she saw that so long as she lived he could not live in peace, in quiet, in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and as for his Subjects, they when they deposed her, or rather when
they caused her to resigne her Diadem, shewed their minde and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her. The rest of the princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> some might perhaps
marvail for a while at her death, because it was a strange President; others
might pitty her, because she was a woman, and a Queen, but none will fight
for her, because that they which were allied unto her were not able; and they
that had no alliance unto her, had no cause to Revenge her death.</p>
            <p>The second Objection is fully answered; now followeth the third; a
dangerous Question to be handled by a Subject,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the third Objection.</note> and yet too boldly discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some learned Subjects; for considering we finde many Texts in the
Holy Scripture, whereby we are commanded to obey Princes, to be subject
unto them, to honour them, to pray for them; since they are called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and we Children; they Shepherds, and we their Flocks; they
Heads, and we their Feet; it is an hard Resolution, and (in my opinion) an
heavy sentence that Children should disobey their Parents, a Flock to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93045:113"/>
Rebel against their Shepherd, or the Feet to presume to command and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Head.</p>
            <p>This question, notwithstanding that it is dangerous and difficult, is larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discussed by <hi>George Buchanan</hi> in his Book <hi>de Iure Regni apud Scotes,</hi> and
also by him who was ashamed to put his name unto the Book that was lately
written against the French king. In these two authors you shall finde every
point of this third Objection sufficiently debated: You shall finde the Text
alledged out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the behalf of Princes, and other places of the
Scripture learnedly answered: You shall finde many examples of profane and
Ecclesiastical Histories, of Princes that have been done to death. Briefly,
you shall finde more to move others perhaps then there is to move me to
subscribe to their opinion. For <hi>Buchanan</hi> argueth in such manner, as I may
rather commend his subtilty, then his conscience. And he that writeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the French king, sheweth himself too partial, too malicious, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to Princes: And <hi>Buchanan</hi> giveth too great Authority unto Subjects,
and the other too much power unto the Pope. It cannot be denied that
Princes received their first Authority from the consent of the people; It
is likewise certain, that this Authority was given them to be used to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the people. And no man will deny that Countries can subsist and
stand without kings: But shall every man that receiveth a benefit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be alwayes subject unto him that once pleasured him? Shall either
a rude multitude, or a few contentious Rebels judge when a King
useth his Authority to the benefit of the people? And because Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have flourished, and may still flourish without a king, shall therefore
every Country reject their king, when they dislike their king? It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that <hi>Buchanan</hi> is of this opinion, because he approveth the death of
king <hi>Iames</hi> the third, and alloweth the approbation that was made thereof
by some of the people and Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were the principal
Actors in the Rebellion against the same king, and the chief Authors of
his death.</p>
            <p>The causes which moved those Rebels to bear Arms against their
King, were but two; The one, that he had made certain base money,
and called it not in again at their pleasure. The other that he had advanced
certain base Personages unto high places of great credit and dignity; if these
two faults might be amended, the Rebels offered to submit themselves to
their King. The King yeelded not unto these motions; Why? The History
giveth a good reason for the King. They made these demands being in Arms.
It seemeth that they would not entreat, but inforce their King; and the
King thought it convenient to chastise their insolency and boldness, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to War against him at home, when he and his Kingdom stood in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
danger of foreign Enemies. There was amongst them, namely the
Duke of <hi>Albania,</hi> who affected the kingdom, who to further his Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
purposes, had joyned with the King of <hi>England,</hi> against his native
Country, and animated his lewd confederates to continue in their obstinate
and unlawful demands. They considered not that extream necessity and
want compelled their King to use that money; and when they had taken
these base persons from the King for which they seemed to rebel, and had
hanged them, contrary to all Law and Equity, they laid not down their
Weapons, but followed the poor King, and so followed him that at length
they flew him. And why? My Author giveth this reason, Because they knew
that they had so highly offended him, that they feared, that if they should
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93045:113"/>
have spared him (as some better minded then the rest purposed to have done)
he would have been revenged of them. This murther, the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(saith <hi>Buchanan</hi>) allowed, and ordained that no man should be
called in question or troubled for the same. But what States are these?
Those (saith my Author) that had born Arms against him, and for whose
sake he was murthered: And they had good cause to decree that no man
should be accused of his death.</p>
            <p>But what will some man of <hi>Buchanans</hi> opinion say unto me? Shall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do what they list, and no man censure them? Are they not subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Laws? May they not be called to an accompt? Shall the people,
from whence they derive their Authority, have no manner of authority over
them? And hath it not been always held very dangerous in a State to have
any man so mighty that no man may or dare controle him? Truly I allow
not that liberty unto Princes, that their pleasure shall stand always for a
Law: I limit their Wills unto Reason, I tie their commandments unto the
Word of God; I fasten their Decrees unto the Laws of Nature, unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and unto the Weal of the people. And if these things be not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I take their Laws to be unlawful, their Commandmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s unjust, their
Decrees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ique. I know that good Princes are so far from nor subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves unto their Laws, that they suffer themselves and their causes
to be tried daily by their Laws. And if any of them, by negligence or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
by folly or ignorance, by malice or forgetfulness, begin to contemn
their Laws. I think it convenient that they should be modestly rebuked,
but not utterly rejected; be in a mannerly sort checked, but not violently
condemned; be gently admonished, but not straight ways furiously and
turbulently punished. Is there no way but down with them, depose them,
kill them? Must we cry against the Lords annointed with the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they
did against Christ, <hi>Crucifige, Crucifige;</hi> and not rather learn by the Jews,
that the common people is no competent Judge to determine matters of
great weight and consequence.</p>
            <p>I am not such a stranger in the course of Histories, but that I know that
some Princes have been deposed for their insufficiency, as in <hi>France, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick,</hi>
and <hi>Chilperick;</hi> others for their negligence, as again in <hi>France, Lewis</hi>
sirnamed <hi>Do nothing;</hi> some for poysoning the next Heir of the Crown,
as <hi>Martina</hi> Empress of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> others for perjury, and not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
promise with their Enemies, as <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Fourth; some for not tendring the Weal, and publick Welfare of their
Subjects, as <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> others for murthering them which
reprehended their vices, as <hi>Boleslaus</hi> King of <hi>Polonia;</hi> some for usurping
things not belonging unto their Crown, as <hi>Sumberlanus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi>
others for their extream rigor and cruelty, as <hi>Sigismond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary;</hi>
some for their childrens Adultery, as <hi>Tarquine</hi> King of <hi>Rome;</hi> others for
Tyranny, as <hi>Archilaus,</hi> Son to <hi>Herod;</hi> some for unreasonable exactions,
as <hi>Slaomire</hi> King of <hi>Abredites;</hi> and others for corruption, as <hi>Adolph</hi> the
Emperor.</p>
            <p>But if all these Depositions were examined and tried by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of Law, I think the most part of them will be found scant lawful. For
all these crimes in private men, are not capital, and therefore why should
they be so severely punished in Princes? How many judges take Bribes,
and are not deposed? How many Magistrates are negligent, and are not
punished? How many Officers execute not their Offices and are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved?
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93045:114"/>
How many rich men offend in Adultery, and are not censured?
briefly, How many Noble men commit Adultery and Murther, and are
not condemned? In <hi>Poland</hi> the Gentleman that killeth a Yeoman payeth
but a certain Fine in money; in <hi>France</hi> he that killeth another manfully
and in the field, is seldom executed. In <hi>Italy</hi> many are vilely murthered, and
the Murtherers are not always punished. And in all Countries grievous
Crimes are either tolerated or pardoned, sometimes because the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
are descended of notable parents, whom Princes are loth to offend
and discontent.</p>
            <p>You have heard how <hi>Dunorix</hi> was spared, although he were a Traytor,
for <hi>Diviaticus</hi> his Brothers sake; and our Chronicles report, that <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third, having taken in the Barons Wars many Schollars of <hi>Oxford</hi> in
<hi>Northampton,</hi> who did him more harm then all the rest of his Enemies,
would have hanged them all, had not his Council perswaded him to save
them, because in executing them he might displease their friends, who
were Gentlemen and Noblemen of great Houses. Shall mean personages,
vile murtherers, private men escape unpunished, and must the Law be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
with all severity upon Princes? They are in higher places, their
actions are beheld of all men, and most men are lead by their example.
True, but <hi>David</hi> was not punished as soon as he had killed <hi>Uriah; Solomon</hi>
was not deposed although he kept many Concubines; <hi>Herod</hi> was not
streightways deprived for murthering of <hi>Iohn Baptist;</hi> and it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Saul</hi> was removed by <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how then? May Princes offend as often as they will, and never be
punished? No; Must their Subjects endure all their Cruelties and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?
No; May they be troublesom unto their Neighbours, untrue unto
their Confederates, Enemies unto the common peace, and never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended?
No; What course is then to be taken to bridle their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
and restrain their Insolency? Truly I finde two notable Laws for
the punishment of such Princes, the one made by <hi>Conrad</hi> the Emperor, and
the other by <hi>Otho</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conrad</hi> his Law commanded all Princes to embrace Peace, to maintain
Law and Equity, and not to disturb the quiet and peaceable Estate of the
Empire; and that whosoever transgressed in any of these three points, should
suffer death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Othon</hi> his Law was much to the same effect; but he added, That the
Prince offending in any of these three points, should besides the loss of life,
lose all his States and Dominions, and be held for a common enemy; and
that all the Princes of Christendom should rise in arms against him, as a
perturber of Christian peace and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>But in these days Princes neither are, nor will be, nor can be ready to
help every one that complaineth; and why should Subjects seek for releif
abroad, that may be releived and succoured at home? The course is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
the remedy easie, if men will not deceive themselves in taking their
course. Every Country hath its Parliament, every Kingdom the Assembly
of their Estates; there may their Griefs be heard, their Wrongs red ressed,
and their Princes repressed: And in this course the common people loseth
not a jot of their Authority; for they which attribute most unto the people,
take not every confused, rude, and tumultuous multitude for the people, but
a choice company of the wisest Nobility, and of the most grave, honest,
discreet and wise men amongst the Commonalty. It must not be such base and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93045:114"/>
busie companions, as was <hi>Iack Straw</hi> in <hi>England, Nicholas Rency</hi> in <hi>Rome,
Iaques Artevilla</hi> in <hi>Flanders, George Zechius</hi> in <hi>Bohemia, Anthony Bavadella</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>William Siler</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> that must presume to controll
mighty Kings, or to alter well governed States: For such petty Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are better able to mislead a number of simple people with their venemous
tongues, then to consider with discretion, that many things are done in
every Kingdom which Princes know not of, and that divers abuses are
committed, which the Officers that commit them keep, as long as they
can possible, from their Princes knowledge; which abuses should be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redressed if the king might be made acquainted with them.</p>
            <p>These Companions consider not, that there is an High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unto which Princes either can be contented, or be constrained to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves, and wherein Subjects may speak unto their King freely,
so they speak reverently, any thing that may benefit their Country; I said,
reverently, because methinks it is not tolerable, that any Subject be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great and mighty, should use unreverent speeches unto his King secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
much less in an open Parliament, as did <hi>Richard</hi> Earl Marshal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
unto King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who when the King called him in choler
(and perhaps not without occasion) Traytor, gave him the lye in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
House, and told him to his face he cared not for him because he
was well assured, that as long as he lived in obedience unto the Laws of the
the Realm, he could not hurt him; And when the king answered, he could
intercept his victuals, and suffer no man to bring him any manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
he replyed, that if he sent any to intercept his victuals, he would send
them home shorter by the heads then they came. Such an audacious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
speech coming to the ears of such busie Companions as <hi>Iack Straw</hi>
and <hi>Iack Cade</hi> were in <hi>England,</hi> would make them take the Speaker for a
Demy God, for a Patron of his Country, for a Protector of their Liberty,
and being carried from them unto others, may draw them like a company
of mad-men, to adventure life and limbs for such a desperate <hi>Cataline,</hi> and
without ever considering whereabout they go, to undertake for his sake the
utter subversion of Town and Country.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, that I am like the Physitian that prescribeth a remedy
unto his Patient, but telleth him not how he shall come by it; so I talk
much of a Parliament, but I conceal how difficult it will be to have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
especially when a Prince, without whose consent and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the same cannot be called, knoweth, or mistrusteth that any thing
shall be debated and determined therein to his prejudice. I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this difficulty, and therefore if the wrongs that are offered be not
too great, it is better to suffer them with patience, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to seek to reform
them by violence. But if the outrages grow once to be so extream that they
are no longer to be endured, I hold the same for a most unfortunate, unhappy,
and servile State, wherein the Nobility is either too timerous, or so besotted
with the love unto a bad King, that they will not be moved upon the just
complaints of the poor and distressed Commonalty, to enforce him to call a
Parliament: and in this kind of violence, I require discretion and judgement
in the Confederates, lest they mar a good Cause with evil handling thereof,
as did <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who when he had deserved a triumph, took so violent a
course in demanding the same, that his sure was rejected, to his endless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
and his Countries great detriment. Let the Subjects be therefore
humble Petitioners unto the Princes to reform such abuses as are notoriously
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93045:115"/>
known to be abuses. Let them yeeld such measure unto their kings as they
would desire for themselves; let them when neither their humble suits may
prevail, nor their gentle connivence or toleration mitigate the wrath, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
the affections of their Soveraigns, humbly beseech the Peers of the
Realm to be their Patrons and Protectors of their Innocency. Then will
he that ruleth Princes, and hath their hearts in his hand, that can prevent
their imaginations, and cross their intentions, raise up some better disposed
then others, better minded then the common sort of men are, better able
then the Commonalty is to judge of wrongs, to redress injuries, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
evil-disposed Princes.</p>
            <p>All Authority is divided into Ecclesiastical and Temporal; of the one
the Pope, of the other the Emperor challengeth superiority; and yet both
these Heads, notwithstanding their preheminence, their power and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
have been reduced to Reason, when they have swerved from all
Reason, by those who by Reason were led to challenge Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them. For both the Colledge of Cardinals and the States of
the Empire have claimed, and according to their claims have used a certain
Right both over the Pope and over the Emperor, when the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them hath been found negligent in their duties; and therefore have
presumed that the power of the one and the other hath been devolved unto
them. Even when an inferiour Prelate is negligent, the Bishop may assume
into his hands all his Jurisdiction and Authority; or when the Bishop is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in performance of his duty, either the Dean and Chapter or the
Arch-bishop may lawfully rebuke his negligence, and reform whatsoever he
vouchsafed not to amend; so although the Pope challengeth to be by many
degrees higher then all the Princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> yet divers Cardinals in
the time of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, considering that the Church had
need of Reformation, as well in the Head, as others Member thereof, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
the aid of the Emperor, and of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their help and assistance caused certain peremptory citations to be set
up in <hi>Modena, Bolognia,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> by which they cited the
said Pope to appear at a general Councel to be he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d at <hi>Pisa,</hi> and to answer
to such Articles as should be layed in against him, touching his Simony, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and other abuses not specified in the said Citations; In regard of
which faults, and of his Negligence, they affirmed that the Pope was not
sufficient and fit to govern the Universal Church of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and that
the Power and Authority to call and summon a general Councel was lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devolved unto them. So although our Kings (as I have said) are the
greatest and most absolute Kings of the world, next unto the Kings of
<hi>France;</hi> yet the Barons, after the battel of <hi>Lewis,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, ordained that two Earls and a Bishop elected by the Commonalty
should chose to them nine other persons, whereof three should alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
about the King, and by the whole twelve both the Court and the
Realm should be governed. So in the fourth year of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi>
the second, the Prelates, Earls and Barons made Ordinances for the State
and Government of the Realm, which because the King would neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
not allow, were confirmed by sentence of Excommunication against
all them that should go to break the same. So the Scotchmen in the time of
<hi>Iohn</hi> their King, being moved thereunto by his negligence, chose twelve
Peers, and four Bishops, four Earls, and four Barons, by whose advice and
counsel the King should Govern the Realm. So to be short, although (as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93045:115"/>
               <hi>Bodin</hi> reporteth) when a certain Advocate pleading a cause in <hi>France</hi> said,
that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had received their Power and Authority from the
Common-people, the Kings Atturney stepped up and requested the Court,
that those things might be razed out of his Plea; shewing that the Kings
thereof never received any Power or Authority from the common people
and required, that both that Advocate and all others might be commanded
(as he and they were) never to use the like words in their pleas: yet before
and since that time divers Kings of <hi>France</hi> have been censured by the three
Estates of their Realm, as it may appear by the examples of those Kings
which were (as I have said) deposed in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth, that if Princes offend, they may be chastened accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature and quality of their offences; and it cannot justly or truly
be said, that that is against a Law or without Law which is done by an high
Court of Parliament, from whence all or most Laws have their beginning,
their foundation, their strength. Neither can this manner of correction
embolden Subjects to conspire against the life of their Soveraign. For either
the Majesty of their Prince, or the remembrance of their du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y towards him,
or the fear of punishment, or the danger that followeth Rebellions, or
the hope of Reformation by imploying the aid of the Peers and Nobility
will alwayes restrain their insolency, and keep them within the bounds and
limits of true obedience.</p>
            <p>But when Subjects are disposed to be rid of their Kings, they may (say
the Favourers of the Scotish Queen) implore the aid of Forreign Princes
to suppress them.</p>
            <p>Whereunto I answer, that if their cause be just and good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I grant it to be
lawfull so to do; But if it shall proceed of Malice, and not of Justice, of
their desire, and not of their Princes desert; of a rash and foolish dislike,
and not of manifest Tyranny or evil Government, there will be no Prince
so ill advised as to hear them, much less to succour them; for he that should
hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en to such light complaints, and in regard of them molest another
King, would undoubtedly by Gods good and just punishment, in time be
troubled with the like Subjects himself.</p>
            <p>Now whereas it is said, that a Prince coming upon what occasion soever
into another Princes Country cannot be put to death without the breach of
Humanity and Hospitality. Hereunto I answer briefly, that if such a Prince
shall so much forget himself, as, although he be detained for never so unjust
a cause, to attempt and conspire by himself or others his death that detaineth
him; truly, neither the Laws of Humanity or Hospitality are or can justly
be said to be broken, if such a Prince be severely punished; for since he first
violateth these Laws himself, he giveth thereby just occasion unto him whose
death he seeketh by unlawfull means to use the benefit of Law, for the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of so unthankfull a Guests life; especially if before his attempt and
conspiracy his detainor always used him gently and curteously.</p>
            <p>But it was never seen (say the Scotish Queens friends) that a Prince flying
from the violence of her Subjects, or passing by another Princes Realm (as
the Scotish Queen did) to go into another Country, was detained prisoner;
It is a thing never heard of, never practised in any Age, or by any Prince,
were he never so barbarous, never so void of Humanity.</p>
            <p>This is a vehement Objection; but not so vehement as ridiculous: For as
a private man cannot come upon his neighbours ground without his leave, so
Princes may not set their feet on their neighbours Territories without asking
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93045:116"/>
them leave and license; and the Prince that shall presume to come into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes Country without his leave, is thought too indiscreet and unwise,
although the occasion of his coming be never so just and lawfull. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of <hi>Baldwine</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that when he being driven
from his Imperial Seat, came into <hi>England</hi> to demand aid of our King, the
cause of his coming was very just and equitable; but when landed at <hi>Dover,</hi>
word was sent him by our King, that he had done unadvisedly and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then it became a king of his Magnificence and Majesty, to adventure
to come into our Realm without making them privy before hand to his
coming; and because he vouchsafed not to ask leave, it was held for a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
sign of great pride and contempt.</p>
            <p>Was there ever Prince that took a more just and necessary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
voyage then <hi>Richard</hi> the first king of <hi>England</hi> did unto the Holy
land? Was there ever any journey of which followed better success then of
that his voyage? Had ever Prince more just occasion to hope to pass by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Princes Country without danger or detriment then he had? And
yet as he returned, although he was disguised in apparel, to the end he might
not be known, and pass safely, he was intercepted by <hi>Leopald</hi> Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>
and held a long time in prison by him, and afterwards dilivered unto the
Emperor. And albeit that the Pope and other Princes, considering that he
was unlawfully detained, became Mediators and Intercessors for his liberty,
yet he could not be delivered before he had endured twenty two moneths
imprisonment, and had paid better then one hundred and fifty thousand
pounds for his Ransom.</p>
            <p>Both our Chronicles and the Scotish Histories report, that <hi>Iames</hi> son
unto <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (when his Uncle being Governor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
had murthered his Elder brother, and purposed to have made him
away also) was sent by his father into <hi>France</hi> or into <hi>England,</hi> with letters
of recomenmdation unto both Kings, wherein the poor and distressed Father
besought both Kings to have compassion of his wofull and unhappy estate,
and to receive and entertain his Son with all kindeness. The young Prince,
after that he had been but a small while upon the Seas, not brooking them
very well, commanded the Master of the ship to land him in <hi>England;</hi> He
is presently brought unto the presence of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, to whom he
shewed his Fathers letters; The King having perused them, called his
Councel together; they deliberate what were best to do with the
Prince; some think it good to send him into <hi>France;</hi> others (whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was followed) perswade the king to detain him as prisoner. I might
alledge a number of Examples like unto these two, but they may suffice to
refute this frivolous Objection: And the late Queen of Scots might have
learned of either these Princes how to have carried her self in the time of her
Captivity.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> was a valiant, a mighty, and a notable wise Prince. His
case was lamented of all the Princes of <hi>Christendom:</hi> His Subjects were
both willing and able to have constrained his Detainers to deliver him: His
journey was undertaken for the benefit of all <hi>Christendom;</hi> and therefore it
behoved all Princes to be offended with his imprisonment. Briefly, neither
the Duke nor the Emperor had just occasion to detain him; and yet during
the long and tedious time of his durance, he neither sought any unlawfull
means to escape out of prison, nor practised any treacherous wayes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of his Detainers. The Scotish Prince doubtless was to be pittied:

               </gap> rather hatefull then honourable; and yet this poor Prince carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not onely honestly and faithfully as long as he was prisoner in <hi>England,</hi>
but also when our king caused him to attend upon him into <hi>France,</hi>
where he might have easily escaped from his keepers, or quickly ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll
a faithfull prisoner; And was so far (at all times) from seeking revenge for
his hard and long imprisonment, that he alwayes thought that he was
well and courteously used; and in requital of that courtesie, when as <hi>Henry</hi>
the sixth, Son unto the same <hi>Henry</hi> who kept him Prisoner, was driven out
his kingdom, he not onely ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>boured him, but also helped to restore him to
his kingdom.</p>
            <p>The good carriages of these two Princes condemneth the Scottish Queen;
and the general custom of Princes as not onely to crave leave when they
come into other Princes Dominions, but also to provide for their safety and
security as long as they shall be there, confuteth this foolish, this fond, this
ridiculous and childish Objection.</p>
            <p>It is written of a King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that when he had occasion to come
into <hi>England,</hi> in the four and fortieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third his reign,
not to conspire against us but to intreat a League with us, and to fight for
us, he not onely demanded leave, but also durst not adventure to come,
before that the King had sent unto his Realm certain Bishops, Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
to remain as Hostages and Sureties that he should be well used so long
as he continued in <hi>England.</hi> And surely Princes have great reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
such Assurance, since many Kings and Princes have been in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be killed, yea and some have been killed when they met of purpose
to talk of Common Affairs: So was <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in danger to have been
in conference with <hi>Ariovis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thered at a meeting with the Dolphin of <hi>France.</hi> And these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples have made Princes more provident and wise then they were wont
to be, for that they will hardly be perswaded or intreated to any such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews;
or if they must needs meet, they cause places to be made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
before the meeting, in such manner that they may see and hear one
another, but not come so near together that the one may hurt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But Ambassadors are safe in their enemies Countries; why then should
Princes be in danger in their Neighbors Dominions? The Answer is very
easie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecause Ambassadors are not spared either for their own sak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, or
for their Masters, but because that without them there would never be an
end of Hostility, nor any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eace after Wars. Neither is the name or person
of an Ambassador so inviolable either in peace or in the time of War, but
that there may be both a convenient time, and a good occasion to pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh an
Ambassador. For to omit that <hi>Olaus</hi> and <hi>Euetus</hi> killed the Ambassador
of <hi>Illalcolnius</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> recordeth; that <hi>Teaca</hi>
Queen of <hi>Selavonia</hi> slew a Roman Ambassador, as <hi>Polybius</hi> reporteth;
that the <hi>Athenians</hi> caused King <hi>Darius</hi> his Ambassador to be thrown and
drowned in a deep Well, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> testifieth; and that <hi>William</hi> King of
<hi>Sicily</hi> plucked out the eyes of <hi>Henry Dandelo,</hi> Ambassador unto him from
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as <hi>Illescas</hi> writeth; because these and the like examples are
manifest Presidents of barbarous cruelty, rather then of Justice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93045:117"/>
I will shew you by a few examples, that an Ambassador hath been, and
may as often as the like occasion happeneth, be lawfully punished or sent out
of the Realm wherein he remaineth as an Ambassador.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titus Livius</hi> writeth, that when <hi>Brennus</hi> had found <hi>Quintus Fabius
Ambustus</hi> fighting in the Camp of the <hi>Clusians</hi> against him, he sent presently
as Herald of Arms unto <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand him to be delivered into his
hands, as a Breaker of the Laws of Arms, because that being sent from the
<hi>Romans</hi> as Ambassador unto him, he returned not home as soon as he had
done his Ambassage, but remained still in the <hi>Clusians</hi> Camp; and because
the <hi>Romans</hi> did not deliver unto his Messenger the said <hi>Ambustus,</hi> he left the
siege of <hi>Clusius,</hi> and conveyed his invincible Army unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
spoiled and sackt the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> sent his Chancellor <hi>Rowland,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Bernard</hi> unto <hi>Fredrick</hi> the Fourth, who used such unreverend speeches
unto the Emperor, that the County Palatine of <hi>Vitilispatch,</hi> not brooking
the indignity that was offered unto his Master, drew his sword, and had not
the Emperor staid his hand, he had slain the Ambassador in his presence; and
the Emperor was so moved with indignation to see his insolent carriage and
behaviour, that he presently commanded him to avoid out of his Court, and
not to stay so long as to dispatch his necessary business.</p>
            <p>The Romans when <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hands of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to be used at their pleasure and discretion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had beaten their Ambassadors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> amongst others sent a French
Gentleman Ambassador into <hi>France,</hi> whom the French King (had not the
Queen purchased his pardon) had excommunicated as a Traytor, because
he presumed to serve his enemy for an Ambassador unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis</hi> the First, King of <hi>France,</hi> sent <hi>Caesar Fregosus</hi> and <hi>Antony
Rincone</hi> Ambassadors unto the Great Turk; <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth his Soldiers
took them upon the River of <hi>Poe</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and presently slew them both:
The French King complaineth that they were wrongfully murthered; the
Emperor justifieth their death because the one being a <hi>Genouis,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Milanois,</hi> and both in some manner his Subjects, they feared not to
serve the French King his enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> commanded a French Ambassador
to depart presently out of his Realm, for no other occasion but for that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
was the professed enemy of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Seigniory of <hi>Venice</hi> understanding that certain Traitors who had
revealed their secrets to the <hi>Turk,</hi> were fled to hide themselves to the
French Ambassadors house at <hi>Venice,</hi> sent certain Offices to search the
Ambassadors house for them, and when the Ambassador forbad and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to suffer those Officers to enter into his house, the Senate made no more
ado, but sent for certain peeces of great Ordnance out of their Arsenal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they would have beaten down the house, had not the said Ambassador as
soon as he saw the same Ordnance, yeelded the Traytors to their mercy and
discretion.</p>
            <p>I might alledge many more Histories to this purpose, but I should be
over long and tedious; And yet I may not omit these two following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are worthy observation, and make more for my purpose then all
the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:93045:117"/>
In the year 1544 the French King sent certain Ambassadors unto <hi>Charls</hi>
the Fifth to <hi>Spires,</hi> sending an Herald of Arms before with Letters unto
the Emperor, and unto the Princes Electors, in which he required a safe
Conduct for his Ambassadors. The Herald is staid by the Cardinal <hi>Gavilla</hi>
and made to deliver him his Letters, and to shew the cause of his coming;
further he is commanded to keep his lodging, and that no man should be
suffered to speak with him, and within four days he is willed to depart, and
take heed that he presume not to come within the Emperors Dominions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time without his leave; he was now pardoned rather of lenity then
of desert, because he had broken the Laws of Arms: And as concerning his
Letters, it was told him that the King his Master had so deserved of the
Emperor, and all the whole state of Christendom, that the Emperor neither
could nor would receive them. This answer was given unto him written in
French, and certain Soldiers appointed to bring him to the Borders of
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second example is of a Bishop, who in the year 1302 being sent
Ambassador unto the French King from the Pope, practised certain Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in <hi>France</hi> against the King, whereof he is accused, arraigned in the
Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> and being found guilty is committed unto
prison. But he is delivered out of prison at the Popes request, and both he
and the Popes Nuntio are commanded to avoid the Realm. The Pope
excommunicateth the King for proceeding thus against his Ambassador;
and the King to requite him with the like courtesie, commanded that no
more money should be carried out of his Realm to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these examples I may boldly infer two necessary Consequents; the
one, that if Ambassadors fail in their duty, or fall into these follies which
I have mentioned, they are either punishable, or may be sent away in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
The other that the Spanish King hath no just cause to be offended
with our Queens Majesty for the sending away of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Bernardine Mendoza</hi>
his last Ambassador in <hi>England.</hi> For although he fought not in any Camp
against her Majesty, as did <hi>Ambustus</hi> against <hi>Brennus,</hi> yet he perswaded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of her Subjects to bear Arms against her; although he used no unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and unreverent speeches against her Majesty as the Cardinal <hi>Bernard</hi> did
unto the Emperor <hi>Fredrick,</hi> yet he did both backbite and slander her unto
her Subjects and unto other Princes; although he did not beat her Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors,
as <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> did the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors, yet
he did both vilifie and discredit her Ambassadors abroad; spared not to
speak evil of her best and wisest Councellors at home; although he was not
an Ambassador of a professed enemy to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> as was the French
Ambassador residing in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Eighth his time, yet he was
an Ambassador of a professed enemy unto her Highness, because he was
his Ambassador who was in league with the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> Briefly, although
he denied not to deliver Traitors unto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Majesty, as the French Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
did at <hi>Venice;</hi> yet he not onely received but procured her many Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and both counselled and encouraged them to commit sundry Treasons
against her Majesty.</p>
            <p>The premises being therefore duly considered, why might not her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
imitate <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, who hardly admitted the French King <hi>Lerold</hi>
to his presence, because his Master was his professed Enemy? Why might
not her Grace command the Spanish Ambassador to depart out of her Realm,
since he had lived many years in <hi>England,</hi> not as a Mediator, but as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93045:118"/>
of a peace; not as a friend to her Estate, but as a debaucher and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
of her loyal Subjects; not as one that desired her welfare, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to procure her overthrow? Why might not her Highness send
him away in peace, who as long as he lived in her Realms, would continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have interrupted her peace? Might the King of <hi>France</hi> arreign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
a Bishop for practising Treason against his person? might he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to prison, and after his deliverance profess open enmity against
the Pope his Master, against the Pope that had, or at lestwise challengeth
some authority over him? and might not her Majesty do the like unto a
Spanish Gentleman, a meer Lay-man, not so priviledged as a Prelate,
not so favoured in Law as a Bishop; briefly, not so worthy of favour or
compassion as was a Popes Legate, a Legate either equal, or as the
days were then, and are in some places yet, not inferior to a Prince?
It was <hi>Mendoza</hi> that misled the Scottish Queen; it was he that drew
<hi>Francis Throgmorton</hi> into dangerous Treasons; it was he that had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Intelligence with <hi>Babington</hi> and his Complices; it was he that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Paget</hi> abroad; it was he that studied night and
day to procure us Enemies at home; Briefly it was he that spared no labour,
no money, no expences, whereby he might either openly or secretly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
our State.</p>
            <p>He lived not many months but years in <hi>England</hi> without bringing
so much as a Letter from his Majesty unto her Majesty, without perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Function belonging to an Ambassador: And how lived he?
Not in Court, but in the City; not in open view of the World, but
in secret corners; not as an Ambassador, but as a Spy. And when
was he dismissed? Not so soon as he was found to have committed one
action of hostility, but after that he was admonished, not once, but many
times, to leave off his Treachery; not when he was suspected, but after
that many Traytors had confessed that he was not only privy but principal
unto their Treasons. Breifly, how was he dismissed? Not with a crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and threatning, as was the French Herald, but with fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r words and
a kindly farewel; not with a Troop of Soldiers to conduct him to Sea
side, but with a company of Gentlemen to associate him to the place where
he took shipping; not to pass with danger through the Country that
hated him for his Treasons, but to be conveyed without danger unto the
Country that loved him for his Treachery intended against her Majesty:
To be short, not slightly sent away in disgrace, but then commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
when as his Master would not vouchsafe audience unto a wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Gentleman sent by her Majesty unto him, to signifie his demeanor
and his carriage.</p>
            <p>Well, he is gone out of <hi>England,</hi> and whether? Into <hi>France;</hi>
And to what place in <hi>France?</hi> To <hi>Paris:</hi> And what to do there? To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
in his malice against <hi>England,</hi> to confer with the English Traytors
personally, with whom he talked before by Letters; to confirm the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sards</hi>
in their Treasons, to dispose the French Leaguers to favour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Majesty against us and our friends: Briefly, so to behave himself,
that without him, neither whole <hi>France,</hi> nor rebellious and obstinate <hi>Paris</hi>
had held out so long as it did against the late and present French king; for
the people of <hi>Paris</hi> are (as a Spanish writer reporteth of them) proud, rich,
and rebellious, which humor this Ambassador nourisheth in them; and when
they were most hardly besieged, there were five things (as the same Author
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93045:118"/>
writeth) that made them hold out; First, The valour and courage of
the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> Governour of the Town; Secondly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Popes Legate; Thirdly, the Alms and Liberality of this
Embassador; Fourthly, the perswasions of the Preachers; Fifthly, the
news that were daily sent to the Town by the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> and
published by <hi>Mendoza</hi> and other Princes.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth that he was a notable Instrument of Rebellion, and a
fit man to be imployed in factious services: For, as God hath deprived him
of his sight, and made him blinde; so he intended to deprive others of their
senses, and to blinde their fight and judgement, to the end they might
not be abe to see and discern the hidden projects of his conspiracies. But of
him enough. Now again unto the Queen of Scots.</p>
            <p>It appeareth that being culpable, she might be arraigned; and being
found guilty, she might be condemned. But the manner of her arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and of her condemnation seemeth very strange unto as many as hear
of it; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is repugnant unto the Laws and Customs of <hi>England,</hi>
observed in the Trial of meaner Subjects. It seemeth strange that her
Majesty should be a judge in her own cause, in a matter of Treason;
and especially against a Princess: And of this strangeness many of the
Scotish Queens Favourites take such hold, as they hold it for a matter
without Example, without any former Presidents.</p>
            <p>But if it might please these her Favorers to consider, that although it
be a certain rule in Law, that no man shall be a Judge in his own cause,
yet the Preheminence, Excellency and Prerogative of Kings and Princes,
is, and hath alwayes been such, that they may Judge and determine in
any causes that concern themselves. For <hi>Tiberi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Caesar</hi> sate Judge in
his own cause, in dividing certain Inheritances: with him was substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
one <hi>Parthenius, Caesars</hi> servant. <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
judged that the goods of <hi>Valerius Nepos</hi> were lawfully devolved,
and as it were confiscated unto the Exchequer. And <hi>Quiltilian</hi> testifieth,
that he pleaded a cause for Queen <hi>Berenne,</hi> whereon she her self sat as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Judge.</p>
            <p>What Scholar hath not read the Orations of M. <hi>Tullius Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
made in defence of <hi>Quintus Ligarius,</hi> of <hi>Deiotarius,</hi> of <hi>Marcus
Marcellus</hi> before <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> he being the onely Judge and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of his own cause? And it was the custom of the first kings
of <hi>Rome</hi> to hear all causes themselves, as well concerning their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as themselves, until that <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> the sixth king, reserved
all publick causes for his own audience, and referred his own private
matters unto the Senate; There was nothing so great or so small
(saith <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi>) but <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he began to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of managing of publick affairs, referred the same unto his Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
And so did <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> testifieth. But after
that Princes began to grow absolute, after that their States became he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
and they had established a certain order in Judgement, then
began they to have their Judges, who sat as their substitutues, as well
in other mens as in their own causes, as <hi>Choppianus</hi> reporteth. And
although they appoint such Judges, yet they wrong not their Subjects
therein, because both they themselves vouchsafe to swear to see their
Laws maintained, and their Judges are sworn to Judge according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Laws. But our Queens Majesty was not Judge in the Scotish
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93045:119"/>
Queens cause; It pleased her to make the high Court of Parliament judge
thereof. What wrong then was there offered unto her, since she had the
same Trial which many Kings of <hi>England</hi> have had? As namely, <hi>Richard</hi>
the second and third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and sixth.</p>
            <p>She had not the favour which was shewed unto Subjects or Strangers.
She should have had a Jury of Twelve Peers to pass on her, whereof the
one half should have been Englishmen, and the other Scots, or other
strangers?</p>
            <p>This in truth is the usuall and ordinary manner of Tryal for strangers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
within the Queen Dominions: But where should such strangers have
been had, but that they would have been partial on the one side, or on the
other? what course might have been taken for their coming into <hi>England?</hi>
And when they were come, if she had made, as she might have done, any
manner of exception against them, had it not been dangerous to stay the
coming of others? Had it not been costly to have defrayed their Charges?
And who should have born their charges? The strangers themselves
would not have been at the cost. The Scotish Queen was not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them: And there was no reason to put her Majesty to such charges. It
may be that the Spanish King would have been content to have paid their
charges. Let it be granted; yea, and those whom he would have sent,
would have saved her life, because they durst not displease him, and he
must needs have gratified her, because she had (as she confessed) sold
unto him her pretensive Right unto the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Is it likely,
that six Peers of our Realm would have spared her, when six and thirty
of the chiefest of our Nobility, and of the most discreet Judges and
Lawyers of our Realm found her guilty, and the whole Parliament
condemned her? In which Parliament, by reason of the Priviledges and
Liberties thereof, any man might have spoken more freely, in her defence,
then in any other place? And was it not seen, that before she had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by so many wayes and means as she did, to take away our most
gratious Soveraigns life and Scepter, that very mean men presumed to
speak for her in the Parliament House, and were heard with all favour
and indifferency? And if she had been saved by the Spaniards bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
would he not have used her to our destruction? And should not
we have lived in continual servitude, then which nothing is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
unto a good minde, nothing more contrary and repugnant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nature and quality of a Prince? May it be thought that that
King, who objected unto our Queen, in a most disdainfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull
manner, that he had saved her life, and that her Majesty
was bound unto him for the same, when as indeed there was no
cause why she should have ever have been in danger to lose her
life? May it be thought (I say) that he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not have done the like
unto the Scotish Queen, if she had not been alwayes at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?</p>
            <p>But it was strange that a Prince should be put to death. It was not
strange in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where more Kings have been slain and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then have died a natural death; where <hi>Alphinus,</hi> not onely King
of Scots, but also Heir unto the Kingdom of the Picts, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beheaded. It was not strange in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where Queen <hi>Ioan</hi>
was executed for the murther committed on the person of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:93045:119"/>
It was not strange in <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and lawful
King of <hi>France,</hi> was adjudged and done to death. It was not strange in <hi>Asia,</hi>
where <hi>Hercules</hi> slew <hi>Laomedon</hi> for his tyranny and cruelty. It was not
strange in <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> the Bastard executed <hi>Peter</hi> the lawful
King. It was not strange in the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where <hi>Conrad</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King thereof was beheaded. Briefly, it was not strange in the holy
Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures, where we read that <hi>Ioshuah</hi> discomfited five Kings, and hung
them all upon trees; that <hi>Saul</hi> was reprehended by <hi>Samuel</hi> for not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Agag</hi> King of the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> whom <hi>Samuel</hi> took and hewed in

King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing then strange or without example in the execution of
the Scotish Queen, unless it be strange that our Queens Majesty was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of her life, when her Subject were careful of the same; that she
would not hear of her death, when they desired nothing more then her
death: That when the Parliament had condemned her, she could not be in
treated to subscribe to their Judgment.</p>
            <p>Briefly, That when with great labour and many perswasions she was
won by her privy Councel and others, who were of opinion that <hi>Vita Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae</hi>
would be <hi>Mors Elizabethae,</hi> as <hi>Vita Conradini</hi> was thought by the Pope
to be <hi>Mors Caroli,</hi> to deliver her Warrant to one of her Secretaries for
her death, she imprisoned, and grievously fined that Secretaryfor sending
that Warrant with such speed as he did, whereby it seemed, that had not
the Warrant been obtained when it was, she would hardly have yeeled to
her execution; and by punishing him that was so willing and ready to have
her executed, it appeareth that her Majesty not onely loved her whilst she
lived, but also after she was dead; and her Highness grave and wise speeches
delivered unto her loving Subjects in the Parliament House, do testifie
how sorrowful and unwilling her Majesty was to consent unto her death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was there made most apparent unto her Grace, that as long
as that Queen lived, she could not be without continual danger of losing
her life.</p>
            <p>This opinion being therefore confirmed to be most true since her
death, because there have no such Treasons been either intended or
practised against her Majesty since, as before that time; It followeth,
that her execution gave the King of <hi>Spain</hi> not just occasion to invade her
Highness Realms. The causes then of this invasion are unjust; now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the course, a course not beseeming a Prince of his might, of his years,
of his long continuance and experience in the exercise and administration of
a kingdom.</p>
            <p>For first, his years are fitter for peace then for war; for rest and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then for troubles and unquietness; and many wise and mighty Princes,
either before or as soon as they came to his years, have given over the World,
resigned their kingdom, and spent the residue of their time in Monastical
idleness. I read that <hi>Sigisbert, Etheldred, Elured, Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Inas</hi>
King of <hi>England;</hi> that <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Uladislaus</hi> kings of <hi>Bohemia,
Constantine</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> before they
came to the Spanish kings age, renounced the world to live unto God in
houses of Religion. I record oftentimes the notable exploits, the marvellous
victories, and the rare and admirable vertues of <hi>Pompey,</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> of
<hi>Antiochus</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and of <hi>Charls</hi> king of <hi>France</hi> (who were all, as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93045:120"/>
you have heard sirnamed the Great) and I find that they were all so far off
at his age from seeking new occasions of Wars, of new Conquests, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all, or the most part of them commended their souls unto God, and
committed their bodies unto the earth before they attained his years. I
remember all this, and in remembring it, I think that it pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to take them out of this world so soon as they were no more fit
and able to conquer in the World; thereby giving to understand unto their
after-commers, that in their youth they may lawfully attend upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
upon Arms, upon Wars as occasion shall be presented unto them,
but that in their elder age, they ought to have their thoughts, their cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and their eyes fixed upon no other things then upon the conservation
of their kingdoms, the wealth of their Subjects, and the health of their own
souls: For when private men, much more Princes, attain unto threescore
and odd years, it is high time for them to amend their lives, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
themselves unto God, because their strength faileth them, their vital
spirits decay, and the hour of death approacheth.</p>
            <p>Here you see one great over-sight in his course; now followeth another.
Wise and discreet Princes most commonly before they enter into dangerous
and long Wars, appoint and compose the Quarrels and contentions which
they have with their Neighbors, or with any other Princes that are able to
cross their Enterprises. It is written of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> of whose commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
all Histories are plentiful, that when he was fully resolved to war with
the <hi>Veyans,</hi> he sent a Gentleman accustomed and acquainted with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
disposition of those people, to contain the Inhabitants of the River of
<hi>Rhine</hi> in their duty and obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and to take order that the Gascoines
should not in any wise help or assist his enemies. The Romans being entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spaniardw, with whom they were in league, to succor them against
the Carthaginians, denied them such aid as they demanded, because that the
Frenchmen at the sametime warred in <hi>Italy. Richard</hi> the first, king of <hi>England,</hi>
being determined to make a voyage into the Holy Land for relief thereof;
and fearing that either the King of Scots or his Brother <hi>Iohn</hi> might at the
instigation of the French king, trouble and disquiet his Realm in his absence,
would not undertake that journey before he assured unto himself the king of
Scots and his Brother by many gifts and rewards; and also bound the
French king by vow and oath to attempt nothing against his kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that fifty days should be expired after his return out of <hi>Syria.</hi> And
that victorious king of <hi>France</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>who passed triumphantly from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Italy</hi> unto the end thereof without striking a stroak) would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to enter into <hi>Italy</hi> before he had made a very fast ane strong League
of Amity and Friendship with <hi>Fardinando</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> King and Queen of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and before he had purchased through Bribes and Corruption, the
assured friendship of the king of <hi>England,</hi> and had also accommodated and
appeased all causes and occasions of contentions and variance betwixt <hi>France</hi>
and the Emperor <hi>Maximilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth the Spanish king either regarded not, or remembred not
these examples, because that intending and fully resolving to invade
<hi>England,</hi> he made the French king his enemy rather than his friend; from
whom he might receive far greater annoyance and disturbance in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
purpose and enterprise, then from any other Prince in Christendom.
But the Catholick kings Councellors perswade him that he and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
are well enough able of themselves, not onely to withstand,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93045:120"/>
but also to subdue and subjugate all those Princes which are not in league
with him; and that the next way to recover his own patrimony in the Low
Countries, was to distress and destroy <hi>England</hi> first; which being once
happily effected, he should finde it very easie and nothing at all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to master his Subjects, and inforce them by open violence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
both him and his Religion; he must therefore bend his whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that may easily be subdued, because he shall finde many there, who being
weary and discontented with the present Government, will be ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his Armies, and immediately will joyn their strength with his
Forces.</p>
            <p>But not to stand long upon the confutation hereof, let these grave
Councellors, or these discontented Fugitives, unto whose perswasions both
the Spanish King, and his wisest Councellors give too much credit,
tell me whether ever any Prince had, or may desire to have a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
or an easier means to invade and conqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r <hi>England,</hi> then

the Realm by the Barons, with a faithful assurance of all the best help
and furtherance that they could yeeld him against King <hi>Iohn,</hi> but also was
comforted and accompanied with all the good wishes and blessings that the
holy Father of <hi>Rome</hi> could bestow upon him; and wanted not the many
Forces, and continual Supplies which the mighty Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
was able to afford him: And yet how speeded this valiant <hi>Lewis?</hi> What
success had his ambitious Enterprise? Forsooth he prevailed for a time;

            <p>But what need I speak of matters beyond mans memory, worn out

how to trust the vain reports of lying Fugitives, and how to make great
preparations against a mighty Kingdom in hope of assistance within the
Realm? Was there any man that gave them succour either of Men or
Victuals? Was there ever an Haven that was either able or willing
to harbour their Ships their Ships that needed both harbour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations?
Was there any friend either within the Country, or nigh unto

many of their people died? Was there ever a Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cessary, for want whereof most of
their Navy perished?</p>
            <p>I will tell you a thing which may be strange to others, but no news
to you, and yet worthy to be told, because it is meet that it should be
known unto all men. When the report was certain in <hi>England</hi> that
the Spanish Fleet and Forces were at hand, instead of lamentat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons,
weepings, out-cries (which things in time of sudden accidents are
common, and even used amongst valiant people) the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
ears were filled with Prayers, Petitions, and Motions, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of one Shire, sometimes of another, most humbly beseeching her
Highness to give the Spaniards liberty to land with their Forces, and them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93045:121"/>
leave to encounter with them alone. I my self do marvel, and I think
as many as shall hear it will marvel thereat, that in men of one and the
same Religion, there should be divers opinions, and different Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in matters concerning the advancement of their Religion; Yet I
know, and you shall understand, that the English Catholicks which are
out of <hi>England,</hi> and those that live within the same Realm, were not
all of one opinion, of one minde, when the Spaniards were coming
for <hi>England;</hi> for the one sort wished them all manner of happiness and
prosperity; and the other prayed to God not to prosper their journey,
much less their Attempt, and besought the Queens Majesty to place
them in the foremost Range and Ranck against the Spaniards, and where
they might endanger themselves most, and do her Highness most service;
not because they were weary of their lives, but for that they thought it
most honorable to die in the defence of their Country, and that God
would never forsake them in so just a cause.</p>
            <p>This may serve to shew that the Spaniards had, and may have very small
hope to finde any manner of aid within <hi>England.</hi> And yet to clear
this point the better, may it please you to remember, that when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Spaniards coming began to be certain, all those which we call
Papists, and our Adversaries term Catholicks, at least the better sort of
them, were conveyed to several houses far distant the one from the other,
and there kept, not like Prisoners, but like Gentlemen of their calling, and
all the Nobility was commanded to repair to the Court; of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
their followed two commodities: The one, That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
being under safe custody, there was no man of account to sollicite the
Subjects to Rebellion; the other, that if any small or great number had
been disposed to rebell, there was not any man of worth to be their
Head; And it hath seldom been seen that Rebels ever durst adventure
to shew their evil inclination; or adventuring, had at any time good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
without having some man of special accompt and authority for their
head.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> may be thought to favour the Spanish King,
and undoubtedly he hath been made beleeve, that in either of those
Realms he shall finde faithful friends, and such as will adventure their
lives to do him service. Truly <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been a long time subject to the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but always divided into two Factions; the one of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and discreet people, the other of wilde and savage men; the first sort,
true and faithful Subjects unto their Soveraign, and the other prone and
ready to spurn against their Superiors, but not able to do any great hurt,
no more then the <hi>Banditti</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> which may rob a house, spoil a little
Village, and set fire on a Castle, and run away by the light when they have
done; and yet to be sure that no great annoyance should come from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to <hi>England,</hi> the best part of the Nobility of the Country was
likewise called to the Court; the strongest Holds were committed to
the custody of faithful keepers; and to hold them in better obedience,
there was sent over such a Lord Deputy as was well acquainted with
their Customs practised in the Country, and very well beloved of the
people.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> although the Kings thereof have always been for
these many hundred years in firm league and amity with the Kings of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93045:121"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and of late years have had some occasion of extraordinary great
love and friendship with the house of <hi>Guise</hi> (the House that hath been,

Fact on in <hi>France</hi>) yet because the present King of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been
nourished up from his infancy in the same Religion which the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> professeth; and for that he is bound unto her Highness for divers
favors and courtesies shewed unto him in the time of his distress and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
he is very well affected unto the State of <hi>England,</hi> and desireth
nothing more then the welfare of that Country, the health and safety of
the Queens Majesty, and the reign and overthrow of all her Enemies;
which desire he signified unto her Majesty at such time as she thought
she stood in need of his help, offering to come in person to aid her
Grace against the Spainards wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the greatest power he was able to
make.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> brag of the strength of their City, because it is distant
five miles from any land, and defended by a little natural Bank from the
violence of the Sea: How may <hi>England</hi> therefore boast of her strength,
since she is severed above thirty miles at the least from any other Nation,
not by a little Bank, but by a great Sea; especially if <hi>

<hi>England;</hi> but he that will undertake to conquer our Realm, must first
overthrow our invincible Navy, and then encounter with our strengths
by Land, and not obtain one onely, but many Victories against them;
a matter in my simple conceit almost impossible, especially for the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> For besides that Fortune is seldom or never so constant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of her favours, that she vouchsafeth unto any man any long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of desired happiness; this impossibility will easily appear unto him
that shall call to remembrance what hath been already said touching the
Forces of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <p>But the <hi>Romans</hi> first, then the <hi>Danes,</hi> next <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
Lastly, Divers English Princes pretending right unto the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> have with very small difficulty, and with no great Armies
subdued the same; and why may not the like fortune happen to the
Spainard? Truely, if it might be inferred as a necessary consequent,
that the Country that hath been conquered many times, and by many
Nations, should always be very easily conquered; This inference might
be far better made and used against <hi>Spain,</hi> then against <hi>England.</hi> For
<hi>Spain</hi> was first governed by <hi>Tuball</hi> the Son of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Noe,</hi> and by his posterity, who were deprived of the Possession and
Government thereof by the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> and they by the <hi>Thracians,</hi>

(as it may be well supposed) the conquest thereof (as
Conquerors most commonly do in great Enterprises) for the last and
greatest Exploit which they had to do, or for the best reward that
they could attain or expect of their long and tedious Wars. And it
is written that they boasted more of the Conquest thereof, then of
all the Victories which they had obtained in their dayes, because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that <hi>England</hi> which was divided from the rest of the World by the
Sea, was no part of the World; and therefore they made two Triumphs
thereof; the one of the main Land, and the other of the huge and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless Sea.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> likewise subdued <hi>England,</hi> but they enjoyed
their Conquest but a very few years; And how subdued they <hi>England?</hi>
Not by main force (as <hi>Spain</hi> was always conquered) but by cunning
and deceit; for <hi>Vortiger</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> being continually molested
by Pirates, and by the <hi>Scots,</hi> was constrained to require Aid of the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> who sent him a great Army under the Conduct of two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Engistus</hi> and <hi>Orsus;</hi> of which, <hi>Engistus</hi> having cunningly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the King a convenient place for his people to dwell in, fortified the
same secretly, got more thereunto covertly, politickly perswaded the King
to send for more forces out of <hi>Saxony;</hi> and lastly, Married his Daughter
unto the King, by whose means he brought his Countrymen in great
credit with his Majesty, made him banish the chief Nobility from the
Court, caused the King by this means to incur the hatred of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and when he perceived that our Country-men began to suspect
and fear his over-growing Greatness, he suddenly entred into league with
the <hi>Picts,</hi> the Antient Enemies of <hi>England,</hi> and with their helps made an
easie conquest thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror became Master of <hi>England</hi> in this manner;
<hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> dying in the year 1065. made by his last Will
and Testament, <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> his sole and lawful Heir,
with the consent and counsel of the cheif Peers and Barons of his Realm;
But afterwards, being wone thereunto by the flattery and sweet words
of his Wife, he changed his maid, and adopted <hi>Harrold</hi> his Brother for
his Heir; whereupon there grew a great variance and contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the said <hi>VVilliam</hi> and <hi>Harrold;</hi> who having some occasion to go
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> was by contrary winds driven into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he
was presently intercepted and carried unto the Duke as a Prisoner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom, when he came, fearing that he should not be set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a long time, nor without a great Ransom, unlesse he used
some cunning device for his present delivery; He said unto the Duke;
Other Princes (Noble Duke) when they have occasion to require
Helps or any thing else of their Neighbours or Confederates, use to
demand the same by their Ambassadors; But I, contrary to this
Custom, knowing that there is no better way to end this contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and competency which is betwixt you and me, then for me to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
your Daughter, am come in person to pray your good Will, that
I may have her for my Wife.</p>
            <p>The Duke yeeldeth to his desire; <hi>Harrold</hi> with his new Spouse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93045:122"/>
speedily into <hi>England,</hi> commandeth all Normans upon pain
of death to depart out off his Realm within three dayes, prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his wife unto his meanest servants, cutteth of her nose and her ears,
and sendeth her back unto her Father in a Fisher-mens Boat. This
Injury and Indignity may seem grievous unto you that hear it; No
marvel then if it so grieved her poor Father, that to be revenged
thereof he presently implored the help of his Friends; who what
for pitty of the distrested Princess, what in hope of high rewards,
what in regard of the love and duty that some bare unto the Duke,
were so many, that the greatest part of the Nobility of <hi>France,</hi>
with all the power that they could possibly make, accompanied him in
his journey.</p>
            <p>But from him unto those kings of <hi>England,</hi> who being driven from
their Kingdoms, recovered the same with small difficulty. And not to be
over tedious, it shall suffice to mention unto you but two Princes of that
kinde, namely <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh.</p>
            <p>And first to <hi>Edward,</hi> who being deprived by his own Subjects of his
Royal Diadem, fled unto the Duke of <hi>Bugundy,</hi> of whom obtaining an
Army but of two thousand men onely, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and
finding that very few favoured him, so long as he demanded the Crown,
he caused it to be proclaimed and published, that he required nothing
but the Dukedom of <hi>York,</hi> whereunto every man knowing that he had
Right, many began to favour him, and no man at his first landing in
<hi>Yorkshire</hi> would resist him; and yet he was not received into the City
of <hi>York,</hi> before that he had sworn faith and obedience unto the
King.</p>
            <p>This Oath being solemnly taken, he goeth forward towards <hi>London;</hi>
Some few of his Friends came unto him upon the way. The <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Warwick</hi> his Brother, who was incamped neer about <hi>York</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
him on the way, either for fear, or through ignorance, suffereth
him to proceed on his journey, and so without so much as one stroke
he came to <hi>London,</hi> where he was received by the Citizens with great
joy and gladness, because divers of the richest sort, doubting that they
should never have again such sums of money, as they had lent him
whiles he was their king, unless he recovered the Kingdom, had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him the favour and friendship of the greatest part of the City; of
which being once Master, he increased daily in power and strength; and
his Brother the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and others, leaving the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
and his Faction, made him so strong that he daily subdued the rest of his
Enemies. Thus prevailed he.</p>
            <p>Now from him unto <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, who living a long time as
a banished man in <hi>Brittany</hi> with the Duke thereof, could never be sent
into his Country unto <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, or <hi>Richard</hi> the third al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
both of them, knowing that that they could not Reign
in security so long as he lived, had requested him very earnestly
of the Duke; And the last of them ruled still in great fear, but
in Peace and Quietness, untill that <hi>Isabella,</hi> wife of <hi>Edward</hi> the
fourth, and <hi>Margaret</hi> the said <hi>Henries</hi> Mother, by the help of
a Physitian came to conferre together, and in the end they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
of this agreement, that they would cause her Son, the said
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93045:123"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> to return into <hi>England,</hi> and to possess the Crown thereof, with
the help of his aid and their friends, if he would take to wife the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. <hi>Henry</hi> being certified hereof, and also given
to undeastand, that <hi>Richard Thomas,</hi> a man trained up in arms all the
dayes of his life, and Sir <hi>Iohn Savage</hi> would adventure their lives for
him, and that the Lord <hi>Bray</hi> had provided great sums of money to pay
his Souldiers withal, easily obtained of the king of <hi>France</hi> a small Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of 2000 men, with which arriving in <hi>Wales,</hi> and joyning with the
Forces of the said <hi>Thomas,</hi> he went towards <hi>London;</hi> and upon his
way daily received greater strength, even of the Souldiers of king
<hi>Richard,</hi> his Enemy, who by reason of the great cruelty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
which he used, was forsaken of his own Friends; and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
detesting his proud and cruel Government, fought so in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
that they seemed more desirous he should lose then win the
Field; which fell out according to their desire.</p>
            <p>By these Examples and others like unto these, you may perceive that
never any man had any good success against <hi>England,</hi> who had not
both a just cause to invade the same, and a strong faction within the
Realm. And by that which hath been spoken you may understand that
the Spaniard wanteth both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Here might I conveniently (if I had not sufficiently declared the
strength of <hi>England,</hi> to make the difficulty and impossibility of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
purpose more apparent) enter into a large discourse of the Forces
thereof; but let that suffice that hath been spoken. And yet I may not
forget to let you, and as many as doubt of our strength, understand that
we have been (and I know not why we should not still be) so strong and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
that when the French were so many in the Field against us, that
they thought the very Boyes and Lacques in their Camp were able
to subdue our Army; and when the Scots, thinking that because our
king was in <hi>France</hi> with fourscore thousand English, we had none but
Priests and women left at home to encounter with them, entred with
main force into our Country, and with assured hope and confidence to
conquer the same, we neither fearing the multitudes of the French, nor
being danted or terrified with the Scots suddain and advantagious
Invasion, subdued both Nations, and took both their kings prisoners in the
Field.</p>
            <p>But our Englishmen cannot live with a little Bread and a Cup of
Wine, as the Spaniards can do; they are not accustomed to endure
cold, to lie abroad in the Field, to stand up to the knees in dirt and
water, to watch nights and dayes, and briefly to take other such pains
and travels as are incident unto wars.</p>
            <p>To pleasure our Adversaries, let us grant this to be so (although the
the contrary indeed is most true) who amongst the bravest Spaniards,
or the greatest Souldiers in the World would willingly go to the wars,
if he should alwayes be subject unto these or the like incommodities?
And yet who would not rather endure, and suffer them patiently. then
live in servitude or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aldom, or yeeld unto his mortal Enemies? All Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
are full of examples of base and faint-hearted people, the which
having been compelled to fight for their lives, because there was no
other way to save or redeem the same, have behaved themselves most man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93045:123"/>
and have enforced their Enemies to yeeld unto reasonable Conditions
of Peace, which sometimes would not hearken unto any agreement, and
have constrained them to become humble Sutors, who would not once
vouchfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to hear their humble Petitions; and truly extream perils and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
necessities have such force and vertue, that oftentimes they put
both heart and Courage into them which by nature are neither hearty nor
couragious. Considering therefore that our men shall fight at home, and
the Spaniard abroad; that we will be as valiant to defend our selves, as
they can be couragious to offend us; that when they have soiled us by Sea,
they must fight afresh with us by Land; they being weary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and we fresh;
they weak, and we strong; they lame and diseased, and we whole and in
perfect health; Briefly, they far from home, and we at home, for our
wives, for our houses, for our children, and for our goods; Is it not
likely that we should fight with greater courage, with better success
then they? Considering again the <hi>England</hi> is fertile, and replenished
with all things necessary for mans sustentation; That her Majesties
Councellors are wise and provident; her people rich and full of money,
her Subjects loving and well affected to her Highness and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
Can there be any thing wanting that shall be needfull for the
maintenance of a convenient Army? Considering thirdly, that if any
want shall fall out, their cause being general, as the maintenance of the
Spaniards Religion is universal and common to all his Confederates;
is it not to be thought that the Princes Protestants will supply those
wants, and fight for <hi>England,</hi> as well and as willingly, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
will for <hi>Spain?</hi> Considering fourthly, that when <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth, a Prince (as I have said) of greater power and of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
experience then the Spanish king, warred with the Protestants of
<hi>Germany,</hi> not onely the Princes of the Reformed Religion, but also
the French (which hated their Religion) aided and assisted them; Can
it be supposed that <hi>England</hi> should not finde the like aid and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?</p>
            <p>Briefly, Considering that the Spaniard cannot land his Army in
any place in <hi>England,</hi> where he shall not finde at the least ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, to finde him work until a greater power come; what
hope can he then have to Land without Resistance, to proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Battel, to fight without loss, and to lose without extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion?</p>
            <p>Our Armies therefore being equal to his, and our hope more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then his, no wise or Politick man will doubt, but that our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is likely to be far better then his, and therefore his hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
vain, his purpose and intention ridiculous, as well in regard of
his course taken therein, as of his possibility to attain thereunto. But
it behooveth a king to bridle and correct his Rebellious subjects; and
it is the part of a Protector of the Catholicks, not to permit his own
subjects, or any other aiding or assisting them in the maintenance of
their Errors and Heresies, to profess a contrary Religion unto his,
especially when he is able to suppress them and their Patrons. This
supposed Ability emboldeneth the Spaniard, and his confidence must
be shewn to be as foolish, as other of his vain hopes, of his rash
conceits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:93045:124"/>
First therefore I will make it appear, that he is not able to enforce
any general alteration in Religion; Then, that though he could, yet he
should not compell his Subjects by force and violence to change and
alter their opinions.</p>
            <p>There is nothing (as I have said) more common then to judge of things
to come by things that are past, and to conjecture what a Prince can do,
by that which his Predecessors did, and were able to do before him: And
therefore to clear this question, it shall not be amiss to consider what
the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh kings Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r did, and was able to do, during the long time
of his Reign, against <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers; and if it shall appear that
he with all his might, his Friends, his Allies, could not suppress
the Princes Protestants at their first beginning, and when neither
the number, nor the power was so great as it is now, It must needs
follow, as a necessary consequent, that the Spaniard with all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
shall never be able to enforce a general alteration and change in
Religion.</p>
            <p>At what time <hi>Martin Luther</hi> began first to discover the Abuses, Errors,
and Heresies of Papistry, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth of that name, thinking it
convenient to withstand an Evil at the beginning thereof, and knowing
that if <hi>Luther</hi> were suffered, great danger and many inconveniences would
follow thereof, he Excommunicated his person, condemned his opinions,
and intreated the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth to ratifie his condemnation in a
general Assembly, held in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to command all his Subjects to
take him prisoner wheresoever they should finde him: But what was the
end and issue of this rigorous Sentence? Did the Almighty suffer it to be
put it in execution? No, but he so crossed the Pope, and the Emperor
therein, that neither their Counsel not their condemnation took effect.
About twenty three years after, this sentence was published; and although
that the Advancement of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine depended onely upon his life,
and that it was a matter of no great diffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulty to supplant him, and to
suppress his discipline; yet it pleased God (meaning to shew thereby, that
it lieth not in mans power to Prevent, much less to Cross his resolute intent
and purpose not to permit any manner of prejudice to grow unto the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion by the same Excommunication: For he presently troubled the
Emperor, and busied him with a sudden and unexpected occasion of wars;
which gave unto the Protestants sufficient time and opportunity to
strengthen themselves against their Enemies. Not long after the Emperor,
to subvert <hi>Luther</hi> and all that followed him, entred into League with
<hi>Francis</hi> the first King of <hi>France;</hi> and they agreed not onely to imploy all
their own Forces, but also to implore the aid and assistance of the
Pope, and of all others of his profession, against the Princes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</p>
            <p>This undoubtedly was a great conspiracy, not onely intended, but
also very like to be executed, by two mighty Princes, had not the
Almighty hindred the accomplishment of their designes and purposes,
by breaking the bond of their League and Amity, and by sending a
suddain occasion of Wars betwixt them. But as after Rain there
follows fair weather, so after those Wars succeeded a friendly Peace,
in the Articles whereof the Emperour and the said <hi>Francis</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted,
that they should joyntly, and with all the Forces they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93045:124"/>
could possibly make War against the Protestants, and use the Popes
<hi>Cruciadoes</hi> in these Wars, even as Christian Princes were and are wont to
do, when they wage War against the Turk. Besides, the Emperor made
a Proclamation, that all <hi>Lutherans</hi> should either convince and prove their
Doctrine to be answerable unto the Word of God, or else leave and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the same within the space of five moneths; And the Pope at the
Emperors Coronation, gave him great charge to see the same Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
duely executed. The Protestants had never greater occasion to
be afraid then they had at that time, when the Emperor was so bent,
and so many Princes joyned with him against them. But whether it were
because the Protestants, during the time of the War betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and the King of <hi>France,</hi> grew so strong that their Enemies feared
them; or because the Lord of Hosts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who never f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ileth his people, had
undertaken to protect them; or because that the true and holy Religion
of the immortal God increaseth daily, notwithstanding the Threats and
Menaces of mortal men; this alliance and confederacy availed <hi>Caesar</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all; but it pleased God so to abate his pride and humble him,
that when he purposed most of all to hurt and annoy the Protestant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he
was constrained to crave their Aid against the Turk, who with a mighty
and terrible Army invaded <hi>Austria,</hi> and had undoubtedly endangered
the Emperor, had not the Princes of our Religion assisted him, and God
so disposed his heart, that to make the Protestants more willing to help, he
most will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngly and of himself, without any manner of intercession and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
so mitigated the rigor and extremity of his former Proclamation
that through his lenity and sufferance our Religion began to receive great
increase.</p>
            <p>For, as Dogs, although they bark and bite one another; yet as soon
as they see and discover the Wolf, they agree presently: And as when fire
taketh hold of an house, of which the Master and Family are at variance,
they forget their private contentions, their hatred, and their quarrels, and
run with one consent and mind together to extinguish the fire: And as in
a great Tempest, the Master and Mariners of a Ship, who before the
Tempest were at mortall feud amongst themselves, become friends,
and endeavor by all means possible to save their Ship, least they all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
together with their Ship:</p>
            <p>So the Protestants, seeing there was no Wolfe more cruel, no fire
more terrible, no Tempest more dangerous then the Turk, submitted
themselves with all humility unto the Emperor, and aided him with all their
power against the Turk.</p>
            <p>In regard of which, his Majesty used them most courteously, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much more unto them then they hoped to obtain of him: And because
his Highness found a rare Loyalty, a strange constancy, and a marvellous
affection in them, he vouchsafed to afford them all kind of courtesie, until
that after that he returned from <hi>Tunis,</hi> where he had got a notable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Catholick Princes bearing themselves bold in regard of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
and happy Success, began to brave, contemn, and despise the
Protestants, and to threaten them that the Emperor should not keep the
Peace of <hi>Norimberge,</hi> nor of <hi>Ratisbone:</hi> Of which insolency the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Protestants complained unto his Majesty, who answered them most
lovingly, and assured them that he desired to end and compose all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and Controversies that were in <hi>Germany</hi> for Religion, not by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93045:125"/>
force and violence, but by fair means and gentleness, praying them to
have such an opinion of him, and not to be moved with the threats and
menaces of their Adversaries: This Answer was given unto them, when
the Emperor was leading his Forces unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> against the
King thereof; with whom, as soon as he was reconciled, the Catholicks
thinking that he had but dissembled with the Protestants but for a time,
hoping that he would bend his whole Forces against the <hi>Lutherans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
But he deceived them all, and went into <hi>Spain;</hi> from whence he sent
an Honourable Ambassage into <hi>Germany,</hi> to let the Protestants and all
others understand, that he would be very glad that all Contentions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
and Controversies touching Religion, should receive a final end and
agreement by a General Assembly and Disputation of learned Divines, to the
end that the right and true Doctrine of Jesus Christ being by that means
laid open and discovered, he might establish and confirm the same with his
Imperial power and authority.</p>
            <p>It happened not long after, that the Emperor had an occasion to pass
through <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Flanders;</hi> then the Enemies of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
began to promise to themselves great wonders, and to conceive
an ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red hope of an invincible power to be levied by the Emperor
and the King of <hi>France</hi> against the Protestants, for, that then the two
cheif Protectors of their Catholick Faith, were throughly reconciled,
and were equally bent against <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers; and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
proved to be most vain; and of that Journey followed no good
success for them: For the Emperor, either because he would be still
mindful of his promise; or for that he knew that the Protestants strength
increased daily, caused a General Diet to be Assembled; wherein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was daily entreated by the Catholicks to declare open Wars
against the Protestants, yet he would never take that violent course, but
ordered,
that shortly after there should be a general Assembly, in which
the cause of Religion might be freely and lovingly decided by learned
Divines; who having lightly discussed some Points of Controversie,
were commanded by his Majesty to come to <hi>Ratis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one;</hi> Where when
as all Contentions could not be fully ended, his Majesty was contented
to refer the final Conclusion unto another General Assembly; of which the
success and event was so well known, that I shall not need to acquaint you
with the particulars thereof.</p>
            <p>Now considering the Reasons, Varieties and Circumstances of all
that hath been said, what may a man judge thereof, but that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
prevented, crossed and hindered the determinations, purposes,
and Enterprises of the Emperor, and so guided and directed them, that
it lay not in their power to confo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd the Protestants by force of Arms;
For, if we shall consider the great strength of the Catholick Princes,
as well in Foot as in Horse, the number of their Souldiers, the multitude
of their Provisions, the greatness of their Treasure, the vehemency of
their hatred, the wilfulness of their perseverance therein, their courage,
their animating and provoking the Emperor against the Protestants, and
how to win him thereunto, they spared no kind of policy, cunning and
deceit that humane wit could invent; and that notwithstanding all their
utmost endeavors, they were then so far from attaining their purpose,
that in the very last Diet that was held, certain points of Doctine were
yeelded unto, which before that Assemby both the Emperor, and his best
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93045:125"/>
Divines, held to be most erroneous. It must needs be confessed that it
was Gods pleasure so to dispose and govern the hearts of those Princes;
for in that Diet many opinions were received and allowed for good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the maintenance whereof many Protestants had lost their goods,
their Countries, and their lives.</p>
            <p>The Catholicks therefore, seeing that they prevailed not greatly by
force and violence, they cast off the Lyons skin, and put on the Foxes,
whom they counterfeited so well, that they brought the Protestants
into disgrace, by sowing false Rumors and Accusations against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And because they had rather lost much, then gotten any thing by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
with them, they caused it to be bruited abroad that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
durst no longer dispute with them, and they gave liberty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all sorts of people, without any regard of learning or modesty, to
raile upon <hi>Luther,</hi> and to write malicious and false Invectives against
him:</p>
            <p>A strange course, and too much used in these dayes! but in my
simple opinion, a course not now like to have better success then that
course then had: For, as <hi>Luther,</hi> when he saw that it was law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for every
man to exercise the bitterness of his pen against him, conceived such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against the Pope, that he discovered many of his follies, which might
have lien hidden unto this day: Even so it is greatly to be feared, if
men having more Zeal then Learning, of greater Malice then Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shall be suffered to preach and write against the foolish impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of our Ecclesiastical Discipline, that either their Malice or their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
will utterly disgrace the same, because preaching by preaching
may unhapply be disgraced, and a few turbulent and unqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts
may with a small Pamphlet, or with a simple Sermon do more harm
then a number of learned men shall be able to amend or reform with great
pains and travel.</p>
            <p>Had not the Pope given too great encouragement to such as wrote
against <hi>Luther,</hi> Had not rude and ignorant men been suffered bitterly
to inveigh against his Doctrine, Had not certain malicious persons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to disgrace him with the Pope and the Emperor, Had he not
been condemned before he was heard: Briefly, had not his Books been
unjustly adjudged to the fire, he had never appealed from the Pope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a General Council; he had never laboured so much as he did in
searching out, and laying open the Popes Errors; He had never made so
bitter Invectives as he wrote against the Pope and his Bishops; He
had never impugned the Pope and his General Councils Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hority;
He had never implored the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and other Princes help and
countenance; He had never procured the Popes Canons to be burned;
Briefly, he had never written a Book against the Catholicks Reformation;
so many things might and should still have remained, as it were buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity,
which are now brought to light, and made known and palpable to
very Babes and Infants.</p>
            <p>They therefore (in my simple cenceir) did not a little hurt and
prejudice unto the Papists and their Cause, who pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>swaded the Pope
and Emperor to make wars against <hi>Luther</hi> and his Adherents. For
since that time many other Nations besides <hi>Germany</hi> are fallen from
their obedience to the Pope, and from their good liking of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93045:126"/>
and so many and divers opinions are now crept into mens
hearts, that I take it a thing almost impossible to reconcile those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities.
For such is the nature of man that we hardly change our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinons;
and yet when we have changed, we stand stiff and obstinate in
our new and late received conceits, and are very hardly removed from
them;<note place="margin">Quo semel est imbu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A man may therefore boldly say, yea swear, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
(let him try all the means he can possible) shall never inforce a
general change in Religion. For since his Father (whose power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he should surpass, yet he shall never match him in good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune)
could not constrain the Protestants (in the very infancy of
Religion) to return unto his profession; is it credible that the Son should
ever be able to compel far and remote Nations, mighty and great Princes,
manly and warlike people, which of late years have forsaken Popery, to
reassume their old opinions?</p>
            <p>But if any man think him great, sufficient, and mighty enough to
effect his disire; let that man consider, how many, how noble, and
how learned men the cruel War of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in <hi>Germany,</hi> the most barbarous cruelty of <hi>Francis</hi> the First a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in <hi>France,</hi> the bloody five years persecution of Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the Spanish Kings terrible and horrible Inquisition
in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> lastly, the most execrable and hateful
Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> hath sent headlong, and before their times unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World: And when he hath considered all these, let him likewise
remember, that the more these Tyrants murthered, the more the
Protestants (as though others sprang out of their blood) encreased
daily.</p>
            <p>If all these shall not content and satisfie him,<note place="margin">Sanguis Martyrum semen Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae.</note> let him call to mind
how many years the Wars continued in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with far greater obstinacy then with good success and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Let that man weigh with himself how unlikely a thing it
is for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to prevail against so many Nations, who in almost
Thirty years continuance, hath not been able to replant his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in a few Provinces of one Nation: Besides the rare success,
and the wondrous events that have alwayes followed the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estants,
make me beleeve that their Cause is a good Cause; and whosoever so
beleeveth, must likewise beleeve, that were their number smaller,
their Forces weaker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, their exprience far more slender then it is; yet
God that can win with a few as well as with many, with the weak
as well as with the strong, will not onely protect them, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
their Adversaries. How many examples find we in prophane
Histories, which record that small sroops have oftentimes subdued
great Armies, and that mighty Kings have been put to flight by
weak Princes? How can we then but think, that the Protestants
who are Gods Souldiers, who fight in his Cause, and are defended
by his Forces, are able to beard the proud <hi>Spainard;</hi> yea, to brave
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93045:126"/>
and foil all his Confederates? It is no small comfort to have God
on our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide. It is a geat Consolation to sight in a good cause. And
who can desire better advantage then to contend with and Adversary,
that beginneth to decline, that is ready of himself to fall? And is
not the Pope and his Kingdom in this case? Have not many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(as I said said) long since shaken off the intolerable burthen of
his grievous yoke and bondage? And do not all States, when they
begin once to decline, sooner fall from the half way towards the end,
and to their utter destruction, then from the beginning of their first
declination unto the middest of their downfull? Shall not those then
that seek to defend Popery, do even as a Physitian doth, when he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to preserve a very weak and old man from the danger of
death? Hath not St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, that Antichrist shall perish as soon as
he beginneth to be known? And if God by the mouth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
hath pronounced this Judgement, this Sentence against him; who
either can or will be able to prevent or hinder the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
He is now no more able to encounter with <hi>Henries, Othons</hi> and
<hi>Fredericks,</hi> great and mighty Emperors: He hath no more Kings of
<hi>France</hi> to fight in his quarrels; No more Kings of <hi>England</hi> to be
Defenders of his Faith; No more Switzers to be Protectors of his
Church; all these have forsaken him, and by Example of these, many
other Princes have learned not to set a Fig by him.</p>
            <p>Thus the First point is cleared; now it remaineth to clear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and to make it appear that the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard, although he could, yet
he should not constrain his Subjects by force of Armes to change their
Religion. This point, although it hath been already touched in some
manner, yet it was not so sufficiently handled, but that it needeth a
more ample Declaration.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding therefore of this Question, you shall
understand that the Common people (which are Princes Subjects) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did; and particular men, although they change their lives, yet they
leave most commonly behinde them their posterity and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which succeed them not onely in their Lands and Inheritances,
but also in their quarrels and affections; Insomuch that there dieth
scant any man so bad, so wicked, so unbeloved, but that he leaveth
behinde him, either children, kinsmen, or friends, who will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be sorry for his death, but also revenge the same, if he chance
to be violently or wrongfully put to death.</p>
            <p>This appeareth by the Wars of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> This appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most evidently, by the Bloody and long Civil contentions that were
betwixt <hi>Lewis</hi> the last Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> (for after his death the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fell to the House of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> as it did after the death of the
County <hi>Charles</hi> unto the house of <hi>Austria</hi>) and the Citizens of
<hi>Gaunt;</hi> who after that they had unadvisedly born arms against their
said Earl, and began to repent themselves of their folly, most humbly
intreated the Dutchesse of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Leige,</hi> and other
Noble men to be Mediators of a friendly peace betwixt them and
their Earl. The Dutchesse and the rest became humble Suitors
for the poor <hi>Gantois;</hi> the Earl was obstinate, and would not yeeld to
their Request, unless the Inhabitants of <hi>Gaunt</hi> would be content to meet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93045:127"/>
him at a place appointed, bare-headed, and bare-footed, with halters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their necks, and there ask him pardon and forgiveness, which being
done, he would then pardon them if he thought good. The rich Citizens
hearing these hard conditions, and considering that when they had made
this humble submission, it was doubtfull and uncertain whether they
should be pardoned or no; of humble Suitors, became most desperate
Rebels; and (as Men careless of their lives) resolved rather to die then
to yeeld to so unreasonable conditions; and with this resolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were constrained to leave their Town, not above Five
Thousand of them issued out of the City, and (as roaving Wolves
seeking for their prey) went in a great rage and fury to <hi>Bruges,</hi> where
the Earl lay with his Forces, who with an Army of Forty Thousand
at the least, set presently upon them, with a full resolution to kill eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mothers Son of them; But God who saved the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
from the persecution of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> unto whom they had humbled
themselves, and drowned the Persecutors in the Red-Sea, vouchsafed
to be their Protector, and gave them such Courage, such Fortune and
good success, that they overthrew the Earl, and made him hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a poor Cottage under an old womans bed, ransacked his Houses,
took <hi>Bruge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m (as it was thought) by the Earls means.</p>
            <p>Then was there great hope to mitigate the rage of the common
people; and yet the war ceased not: The cause of the continuance was,
that the Nobility favoured the Earl, and began to malice and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
the Common People; and the Magistrates of <hi>Bruges,</hi> in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
that was betwixt the Gentlemen and the Weavers of the
Town, shewed themselves more favourable unto the Gentlemen then
unto the Weavers; of this small Cause followed so great a War, as
continued above seven years, and consumed above two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Flemings.</p>
            <p>In those Wars, sometimes <hi>Iames Artevild,</hi> other times <hi>Philip
Artevild;</hi> sometimes <hi>Basconius,</hi> other times <hi>Francis Agricola,</hi> all
base men, and of no accompt before they began to be Rebels, so
ruled the people, that they led them whither they would, and how
they would. <hi>Artevild</hi> imposed upon them what Tributes soever it
pleased him. <hi>Basconius</hi> hung up so many of them as but once
spake of Peace. <hi>Artevild</hi> was served in Plate of Silver and Gold
like an Earl; Feasted the Dames and Ladies as an E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rl; Swore
his Subjects; and was sworn unto them as an Earl; Contracted Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Alliance with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and used his help as
an Earl: Briefly, lived with far greater Magnificence then an Earl.
<hi>Agricola</hi> wanted not his commendation. He was adored like a god;
preferred before the Duke of <hi>Burgondy</hi> (who for his val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Philip</hi> the audacious) both for Valour and Wisdom promised to be
made Duke, and in all respects more honoured then the Duke. <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vild</hi>
had one named <hi>Carpenty,</hi> to extol his Vertues, to recommend him to
the people. And <hi>Agricola</hi> used <hi>Besconius</hi> for his Instrument, who so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the peoples ears, that they would willingly hear no s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>und, no voyce but
his. It was he that when <hi>Artevild</hi> was slain brought <hi>Agricola</hi> into favour
and credit. It was he that when the people was dismaid and out of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
because of <hi>Artevilds</hi> death, put them in heart, and made them more
couragious then ever they were. It was he that perswaded the relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commons that <hi>Artevild</hi> lost the field and his Army by indiscretion
and rashness, and that <hi>Agricola</hi> would easily overcome their enemies by
valour and wisdom.</p>
            <p>The like instruments unto these had the Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he had never obtained so much as he did of the people, nor contained
them so much in their devotion, had he not used the malici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us help and

the Ministers of his fury, and misl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aders of the ignorant, rude and seditious
Commonalty.</p>
            <p>By this you may see how one mutinous Subject begets another. By
this you may observe and note, that if Princes could be content to yeeld
somewhat unto such mutinous Subjects, and now and then wink at their
follies, pardon their boldness, and pacifie their rage and anger, they might
live in quiet, and save the lives of many of their loving Subjects: And by
this you may perceive, that Princes by Civil Wars incur the hatred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their loving Subjects; which sometimes taketh such deep roo: in
their hearts, that it is hard, yea almost impossible to root it out. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
By that which followeth you may understand, that when a multitude
of Subjects are discontented, it is far better to pacifie and reconcile them
with courtesie and gentleness, then to provoke and punish them with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and cruelty. For the Prince that either openly or secretly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the death of his Subjects, and delighteth to see them massacred
and murthered, very seldome or never escapeth himselfe unmassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Caligula</hi> caused many of his Subjects to be done to death;
some for his pleasure, and others without any just occasion, especially
those that reprehended his actions, or disliked his Government. He
thought by these murthers to dispatch all those that hated him, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that when they were dead, he might reign and rule at his pleasure;
but he was greatly deceived, for the more he caused to be killed, the more
he displeased; and if he slew one Enemy, that one begat him ten far worse
Adversaries; insomuch that seeing himself hated of all the people, he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as you have heard) that all the Subjects of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one head,
that he might have cut it off at a blow; and in the end, when it was too
late he perceived that the people multiplied daily, and had infinite heads,
and he himself but one, of which he was deprived sooner then he thought
he should have been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperor, who was so strong of body that with the
blow of his fist he could strike out the tooth of an Horse, and with his
hands break in sunder an horse-shoo, presuming on his strength and the
multitude of his Souldiers, cared not whom he put to death wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
but after that he had murthered above Four thousand Gentlemen
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93045:128"/>
without any due observance of Justice and Equity, he himself was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by his own Soldiers, who hated his barbarous cruelty more then
they honoured his Imperial Majesty. I might trouble you with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
like unto these, as with the Emperors <hi>Nero, Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Gallienus.</hi>
But I must proceed.</p>
            <p>Briefly to my purpose: As the people therefore live still, and live to
revenge the wrongs and injuries done into them; so contrariwise, Princes
die, and their Quarrels, their Designs, and their Purposes many times
die with them; for their Successors are not alwayes of their minds,
nor of their Humors, but oftentimes govern themselves otherwise then
they did, and taking a quite contrary course unto theirs, most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
break the Laws they have made, distress the persons whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and exalt them whom they depress; In regard whereof it is usual
amongst wise Courtiers not onely to pleasure him that ruleth, but also him
that shall succeed the Ruler; and as <hi>Pompey</hi> said unto <hi>Sylla, More do adore
the Sun rising then the Sun setting,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is wondrous that is reported of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> how with
an Army of Thirty thousand <hi>Macedonians</hi> onely, he overthrew <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
in Three sundry Battels; in the first of which <hi>Darius</hi> had Three
hundred thousand Souldiers, which was Ten to One; in the second,
Six hundred thousand, which was Twenty to One; in the third, a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
which was better then Thirty to One. He conquered all <hi>Darius</hi>
Empire, <hi>Persia, Media, Parthia, Armenia, Babylonia, Aegypt, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,
Syria,</hi> and all the rest of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> that was then inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
            <p>But these Conquests quickly vanished away; For he died very young,
and left not any valiant Successor like unto himself behind him; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Titus Livius</hi> moveth this Question, Whether if <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great
had warred in his time with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he might easily have subdued them
as he did <hi>Darius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He Answereth Negatively, and giveth a Reason for his Negative:
<hi>Alexander</hi> was a valiant King, and a very brave and very notable
good Souldier; but he was but one man, and when he dealt with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
he medled but with one Captain; Whereas if he had encountred
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he should have made trial, not of one, but of many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals the one after the other, as of <hi>Valerius Cervinus, Martius Rutilius,
Caius Sulpitius, Manlius Torquatus, Publius Philo, Papirius Cursor, Fabius
Maximus, Lucius Volunius, Marius Curius,</hi> and many others who were most
valiant Captains, and would haue made <hi>Alexander</hi> know that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the manner and Stratagems of War as well as he did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<hi>Alexander</hi> was young, and could not have so good counsel given him
as those men had who were directed in their Actions by a grave and wise
Senate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tit. Livius</hi> concluded his speech in this manner. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> had
but one <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> had many Captains which were nothing
Inferior unto him, every one of which lived and died without any great
loss or danger to the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome;</hi> but whenas <hi>Alexander</hi> died,
the State and Honor of his <hi>Monarchy</hi> perished. The reason of this speech is
verified, and the experience thereof seen in the wars <hi>Hanibal</hi> had against
the <hi>Romans.</hi> For <hi>Hanibal</hi> was such a Captain as you have heard me describe
him long since, and he overthrew many Captains of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Flaminius,

that popular Commotion. The Senators in order delivered their opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> in a rigorous and cruell Senator, was of opinion that the
usurpers should be paid all that was due unto them, and that it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to suffer the Common people to breake such Contracts, Bonds and
Obligations, which they had made with good advise, and when they had
great occasion to borrow. And that if they punished those severely which
were most mutinous, and had been the chiefest Authors of the mutiny, the
rest would be quickly terrified, and taught by their examples never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the like Follies again. The Consul <hi>Servilius</hi> was of a contrary
mind, and thought it best to content the Seditious by some Gentle meanes,
saying, that it was far more easie to bend then to breake the hearts of the
Common people; and that gentleness and lenity is a far better meanes
then rigor and severity to conserve and preserve any State whatsoever,
because if a rigorous course take not good success, presently the People
wax insolent, hard to be reconciled, and so peremptory and obstinate, that
it will be impossible to reduce them to good order. The Senate allowed
<hi>Servilius</hi> his opinion; and order was taken th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Usurpers should forbeare
their money and Interest for the same, untill their debtors were more
willing and better able to pay them. The same <hi>Romans</hi> can also reach
Princes, that if they commit any extraordinary kind of violence, and the
Subjects for a time forbeare to shew their dislike thereof, yet they must not
presume upon that forbearance to offend and displease again in the like
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93045:129"/>
manner; because he that winketh at a fault once, will not beare with offences
of the like nature alwaies. It hapned that not long after the Tumult before
mentioned, som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> few of the greatest Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> had secretly caused
a <hi>Trbiunes</hi> of the people to be murthered, because under the colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his Office, he had (as they were informed) done his best endeavor
to make a commotion amongst the common people. The <hi>Tribune</hi> thus

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thered, the people shewed no outward sign of discontentment, because
they knew not unto whom they might impute his death, or whom to blame
or accuse for the same. The Senators were glad to see that his death was so
well taken, thinking that they had used a very good course to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and withstand the like seditions, and that the other Tribunes would
be warned by their Fellow and Colleagues punishment never hereafter to
move the common people to rebell. They supposed that by one mans
death they had removed all occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sions of Tumultuous disorders; But expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
taught them not long after, that they were greatly deceived. For
when they were to levy an Army of men to use in their warres, and
thinking that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> death was forgotten; they commanded one
<hi>Volero,</hi> one of the common people who had been Captain of certain foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to have his company in a readiness, he answered them plainly, that he
would not obey their commandment Whereupon the Consuls <hi>Emilius</hi>
and <hi>Virginius,</hi> sent certain Sergeants unto him to carry him to prison;
He escapeth out of their hands, getteth himself into a press of common
people, there he crieth out with open mouth, My masters, let us defend our
selves; we must not think to be any more supported by our <hi>Tribunes</hi> who

               </gap>led, as one hath been already
that favoured us in our honest causes. He had no sooner said this, but that
the people, although the Consuls endeavoured to appease the Tumult, ran
upon the Serjeants, who after that they had been well beaten, and their
Maces broken about their heads, saved themselves in the Palace where
the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te was assembled. The Senators deliberate presently how they
might pacifie this sedition; many thought it meet to repress force by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce; but the graver sort was of opinion, that it were not good to tame
the members of a body by violence, and that they had already too much
offended who were Authors of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> death, and much more they
who intreated <hi>Volero</hi> hardly, for that in Popular diseases, the gentler a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, the
better he fareth. The same <hi>Romans</hi> will likewise teach Princes, that the
eldest Counsellors are not alwaies the wisest, and that the most voices are
not oftentimes the soundest voices. It chanced another time in <hi>Rome,</hi> that
the Commonalty was so greatly discontented, that the greater part of the
people were purposed to forsake their City, and to inhabit in some place
where the Nobility should not carry so heavy an hand over them as the
Senators did; and with this resolution they left their houses, and were
ready to betake themselves to their journey. The Senators understanding
of this determination, cast their heads together, and advised among
themselves what it were best to do to remove this setled opinion, and to
hold them still in the City, which was almost past all hope. <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi>
according to his rigorous nature and old custome, perswaded them to bridle
the mutinous by rigor, and severity; For saith he, the common people, if
they be not held in continual awe, wax proud, disdainfull and insolent, not
caring what they do, or how often they offend; And therefore to suffer them
in one Folly, were to encourage them to commit another. This opinion was
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93045:129"/>
presently approved by all the younger Senators, whose hands tickled and
hearts burned with a desire of revenge for some small indignities offered
unto them by the Commonalty. <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> a Senator of few
yeares, but greater clemency then <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> contradicted this
opinion; because the Commonwealth representeth, saith he, the body of
a man; and a good Physitian will not presently cut off a member or joynt
that is grieved, but will seeke some gentle meanes to affwage the griefe;
and experience hath taught us, that as a wild beast being gently used wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
tame, and contrariwise a tame one being rudely handled becom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th
wild; so the most rude and common people relent if you use them gently,
and they that are most civill and modest, quickly forget all modesty and
civility if you once provoke them too much, if you continue to displease and
discontent them too long and too often. <hi>Menenius</hi> his opinion was followed.
<hi>Spurius Manlius</hi> intreated them to excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the younger Senators Folli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
They were commended that departed quickly from <hi>Claudius</hi> his opinion;
and <hi>Agrippa</hi> was enjoyn ed to pacifie the people: He therefore followeth
this commandement; calleth the Commonalty together, declareth unto
them the Senators good will towards them; speaketh so gently unto them
that he maketh them all change their resolution and useth this principal
reason to enforce this perswasion. The Senators (saith he) resemble the
Belly, and you the rest of the members of mans body; must the other
parts of mans body complain that all they can gather and scrape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
is little enough for the Belly? Is it not the Belly that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
all the rest or the Body, that maintaineth and sust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part thereof? doth the Belly when it receiveth any kind of victuals
be it never so delicate, never so rare, and exquisite, res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rve all for it self?
Doth it not distribute and disperse the same even to the parts that are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
off from the Belly? even so the Senators, do they challenge that for
their own use and benefit which they exact of you? Do they not imploy
the Tributes and Subsidies which they levy to the behoofe and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the whole State? Do they not all that they do for your good and
safety? Are they not rather Nurces to nourish you, then Lords to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you? Are they not Shepheards to defend you, and not Wolves to
devoure you? And do they not shew themselves to be your Fathers, rather
then your Foes? Why then do you complain of them? Why th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d you? Thus ended <hi>Menenius</hi>
his speech, somewhat abruptly and yet so mildly, that the grave Senators
most highly commended it, and the common people most willingly followed
it. Now to apply these examples to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to tell you
how he, and any other Prince in the wide world, governing as he doth,
might have made some use and profit of them, it will be no lost labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it will make his oversights more manifest then they are unto the view
and
Judgement of the whole world: Had he therefore, at the beginning
of the Alienation of his Subjects hearts and Affections from him, harkened
unto such Counsellors as <hi>Servillus</hi> and not <hi>Appius Claudius;</hi> had he when
some one Subject like unto <hi>Volero</hi> was displeased, satisfied him, and not
provoked him; had he when his Subjects were departing out of their
Country, not sent a <hi>Claudius</hi> to repress them, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

After, Corbulo,</hi> and <hi>Galba,</hi> they never would have harboured a thought to
deprive him (as the others did <hi>Nero</hi>) of the possession of the Low Countries;
Briefly had he considered that when <hi>Nero</hi> began to be a Tyrant, First <hi>France,</hi>
then <hi>Spaine,</hi> and at the last other Provinces fel from their obedience towards
him, he might easily have perceived, that when <hi>Brabant</hi> failed him, <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Holland</hi> and all the rest of his seventeen Provinces would likewise fall
from him. But it pleased him having two notable Examples before his eyes,
the one of Antien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>time, the other of latter years, the first bad, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, to reject the one, and to follow the other.</p>
            <p>The Examples were these; <hi>Reh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>boam</hi> the sonne of wise <hi>Solomon</hi> would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
greater Taxes and Subsidies upon his Subjects then his Father had
done before him. The People hereupon complained unto him, as the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country
Subjects did unto the Spanish King, desired him rather to mitigate
then to increase his Impositions, shewed that they were not able to bear
and support so great charges. He called his Councellors together (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did) and craved their advice: The elder Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
were of opinion that it was good and expedient to yield unto his
Subjects demands (as perhaps the better sort of the Councell were) and by
easing their charges to assure unto himself their hearts and their affections;
But the younger sort (and such undoubtedly were the Spanish Senators,
either in Wit or years) advised him to reject their Petition, and not to suffer
them to prescribe Laws unto him (who were to receive laws from him) but
to let them know that he was their King, and they his Subjects, and that it
belonged unto them to obey. This Counsel what followed: But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in following this Counsel? The greatest part of his People Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against him: <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was chosen King, and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> raised an Army
of 80 Thousand men to constraine his Subjects to return to their former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
but he lost him time and Ten parts of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> a wise and subtile Prince, if ever
there were any in <hi>France,</hi> at his first coming to the Crown, played his
part as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did, until that the chief of his Nobility rebelled against
him.</p>
            <p>This wise King acknowledged his fault, sought all means possible to
pacify and reconcile those Rebells; He yielded to their demands, and was
so far from punishing their disobedience, as that he received them for his
chief Councellors, and was always more directed by them, then by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Counsell. And when he had escaped the danger, whereinto he
was fallen by his Folly, he gave great thanks to Almighty God, that it
had pleased him to give him the Grace not to hazard the losse of so great
and mighty a Kingdome as <hi>France</hi> was, and is, upon the uncertainty of a
Battaile and especially of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts that love their Prince as the head of the Politique body, their
children as the stay and hope of their everlasting Families, and
their Liberty as the most precious Jewell of their worldly wealth:
And therefore when they see their Liberty restrained or impeached, they
forget their duty to their Prince, remember not their love to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and cut off their love and affection to their goods; Nay they are no
longer Masters of themselves, being void of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Judgment; so that to strive with them in these Passions, is to contend
with mad men in their fury; and it is almost as impossible for a Prince to
rule them in this rage, as it is impossible for one man to take and tame a
number of wild Beasts in a wide and great Forrest. It is doubtless that the
Spanish King knew thus much; but it pleased him to beleeve <hi>Appius
Claudius</hi> better then <hi>Servilius;</hi> to persecute and not to pacifie <hi>Volera;</hi> to

thereof. It is hard to say what course he would take, and how he would
governe if he should chance to prevaile against <hi>England;</hi> but I think he
would imitate the example of, others who have made conquest of strange
and forreigne Countries before him; and he will therefore make all things
new, as he himself shall be new; He will appoint a new government and
new Governors; He will establish new Laws, new Orders, new Customes;

Kingdome: But our Country men knowing by certaine report, that he will
doe all this, will rather die then endure all this; or if they endure it for a
time, will undoubtedly both seek and finde means to free themselves from
such servitude in shorttime. The examples of other Nations and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which have killed themselves with their own hands because they would
not fall into their Enemies hands, will both move and encourage them to
imitate and follow their Magnanimity; The rebellions of many Princes

honored and respected then our own countrymen; and good manners
changed into evil conditions: And when you see this, then you may
boldly say, that things are at the worst; that violent courses cannot
long endure; that a time of a change and alteration is not far off;
and lastly, since those things which Philosophers and wise men have
noted to be the Forerunners of the Subversion of States, are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and fallen upon our State, that it will quickly change and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
            <p>All things therefore being well considered, and that especially remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
which was said, when I handled the first oversight of the Spanish
King; I may boldly inferr, that Conquests are chargeable before they
bee gotten, easie to be lost after they be attained, and wholly depending
upon the Government of such Officers as are placed over them; who if
they be good Servants, many times make themselves Masters;
and if they be bad, put in great hazard all that is committed to their
charge; And since there are not many that endeavor to be such as
they should bee, there can be no great good looked for at their hands,
so long as they continue such as they appeare to be.</p>
            <p>Besides, the great ingratitude of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperor to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi>
of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Gonsalvo,</hi> breedeth a Jealousy and
feare in the hearts and heads of as many as are imployed in the like
services, that their Kings and Princes will reward them with the like
recompences; And this Jealousie maketh them to seek meanes how to
be able to match or rather overcharge their Soveraigne in Power and
Authority.</p>
            <p>Was not this Jealousie the sole and onely cause, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had like
to have been deprived of his State by <hi>Sejanus, Commodus</hi> by <hi>Pervicius,
Theodosius</hi> the second by <hi>Eutropius, Iustinian</hi> by <hi>Bellizarie, Xerxes</hi> by
<hi>Artaban,</hi> and the <hi>Merovingians</hi> and <hi>Carolovingians</hi> by the great Masters of
their Pallaces?</p>
            <p>Is not the feare of the like danger the cause that Princes change their
Liuetenants and Deputies often, least that growing in too great Credit
and love with the people, their Credit may breed in them Ambition, their
Ambition a disloyalty, and their disloyalty a plain Rebellion, and their
Rebellion a lamentable overthrow of their Kingdomes?</p>
            <p>Is not this yearly or continuall changing of Officers the cause that they
knowing that their Authority is of no long continuance, study more
to enrich themselves then to benefit the people, to oppress and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Subjects, then to comfort and relieve them? And is not their
study the cause that the people are discontented, and of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to Rebell? Moreover how can it be but all or most part of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
of which I have spoken, must needs fall upon the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> whether he live long or die shortly, since many motives and
causes of Rebellion in Subjects and discontentment in Noblemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
together in him? For hee is old and will leave a very young Infant
or no old Prince to succeed him in all his States, who perhaps
will Governe by Deputies and Liuetenants, as his Father did before
him in those Dominions which are far distant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and will
participate some small portion of Government with his Sister, that hath

Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> will look for part of them; His other Daughters Husband
will look for a proportionable share, and the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> will perhaps
lay in for their part and for their portion. For every Kingdom hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Period, an end and declination; And it is seldome seen that any State
flourisheth many hundred years: And as those bodies die soonest, that
are subject to most diseases; so those Kingdomes perish soonest, whose
Princes are most inclined to many vices. <hi>Saul</hi> reigned but Forty years;
and he and his posterity perished for his Infidelity. <hi>David</hi> ruled other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his Kingdom was divided for his Adultery. <hi>Achan</hi> was King no
longer time, and his Kingdome was destroyed for his Idolatry. And <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
enjoyed his Crown and Scepter not many years, and his race failed
in his Son <hi>Cambyses</hi> for his Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And how can the Spanish Kings declining glory last long, since many
probable and very learned Authors do greatly belye him, if he be not
infected with all or most part of those vices which possessed incredulous
and unbelieving <hi>Saul,</hi> adulterous and leacherous, <hi>David</hi> Idolatrous and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<hi>Achan,</hi> Cruel and incestuous <hi>Cambyses.</hi> I favor and reverence
his Person because he is a King, hate and detest his vices, because they
become not a Prince; have declared and discovered his indiscretion, because
he may be no more thought so wise as common Fame report<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th him to

            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:93045:132"/>
And now, because of a dissembling friend, he is become our professed
Enemy, I may not conceale the means how his courage may be cooled,
his Pride abated, his purposes prevented, his courses crossed, his Ambition
restrained, his hopes frustrated, his strength weakned, his Alliances dissolved,
and Briefly, all or part of his Kingdom rent and dismembred.</p>
            <p>To know how all this may be done, you shall need but to look back
upon the means that he useth to conserve his States, and to crosse his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Intentions in the use of those means. For, doth he continue in
credit by the General reputation and conceit that is had of his wealth?
Let it be shewed that he is poor and needy. Holdeth he his Subjects and
Towns of Conquest in awe, by keeping Garisons in them? Seeke either to
corrupt those Garrisons, or to perswade those Towns to expel them.
Borrows he money in his need and necessity of the <hi>Genowaies</hi> and other
Merchants of <hi>Italie?</hi> Counsel them to call for their old Debts and to lend
him no more money before they be paid. Doth our Nation and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
his Country by resorting thither? Let them repair no more then they
needs must to those Countries. Fetcheth he yearly great wealth from
the <hi>Indies?</hi> Let that be intercepted more then it hath been. Placeth
he wise Governors and Magistrates in his Dominions to Containe his
Subjects in obedience, and his Neighbours in fear? Send Fire-brands
and Authors of Sedition amongst his Subjects as he doth amongst ours,
and think it as lawfull and easie to estrange the affection of his wisest
and most trusty Deputies and Lieutenants, as it was and is for him to
allienate the hearts of some of the Nobility of France from their King.</p>
            <p>Hath he married the now Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> so meanly that he can not be
able to recover his right to <hi>Portugal?</hi> Or hath he so weakned <hi>Don Antonio</hi>
that he shall never be able to returne into his Country? Provoke the one
to be his Enemy in putting him in mind of his Fathers untimely death, and
by remembring the great wrongs that he suffereth, and let many Princes
joyn in heart and in helpe to set up the other against him, and to strengthen
and succor both, rather then the one or the other should not annoy him.
Is <hi>France</hi> unable to hurt him because <hi>France</hi> is divided? Reconcile them
that are dissevered, and revive the quarrels and pretentions that <hi>France</hi>
hath against him? Presumeth he that the <hi>Germans</hi> will rather help then hurt
him, because he is ally'd to some in Conjunction of blood, and to others
in league of amity? dissolve his alliances and debase the mightiest of his
kindred.</p>
            <p>To be short, are the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>
either for feare or affection his friends? encourage the Timerous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and alter and remove the love and affection of them that beare him
best good will.</p>
            <p>But some man will say, This is sooner said then done, and therefore I
have said nothing unless I shew you how all this may bee well and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
done. There is a generall meanes, and there are diverse spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
waies to effect all this. I will acquaint you with both, because you shall
bee ignorant of neither, and I will be as brief as I may, because I take
it high time not to trouble you any longer. It is grown unto a general
use of late yeares, and undoubtedly it was usual in times past, when Princes
undertake any great actions or enterprises that may perhaps seem strange
and somwhat unreasonable unto other Princes whose favor and friendship
they desire, to publish the causes and reasons which induce them to enter
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93045:132"/>
into those actions; and in those Declarations to omit nothing that either
may grace and credit them, or discredit and disgrace their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>The States of the Low Countries when necessity inforced them to renew
Wars against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> published certain Books containing the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which moved them thereunto; and caused those Books to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in seven several Languages, in Latine, in French, in their own
Tongue, in High Dutch, in Italian, in Spanish and in English, to the
end that all the Nations of the World, hearing the Justice and Equity of

neither aid nor hinder them as their Adversaries. The late Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenson,</hi>

that being in some manner allied and a supposed friend unto the Spanish King,
he would accept the Title of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Low Countries against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made it appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent unto the
world, by the like means, that it was not any ambitious mind, or greedy
desire of advancement, but a Princely clemency, and commiseration of
the distressed state of that Country, too much oppressed by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Tyranny, that moved him to receive them into his Protection and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.</p>
            <p>The like did the County <hi>Palatine Cassimer</hi> when as he came into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
with his Forces. And the like have many other Princes done, not in
just causes only, but in matters that had far greater affinity with injustice and
dishonesty, then with justice and integrity. That Duke of <hi>Burgondy</hi> which
more wickedly then justly murthered the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> fearing that
his murther might justly purchase him the Kings heavy displeasure, and
the general harted of all <hi>France,</hi> suborned a learned and famous Divine
named <hi>Iohn Petie,</hi> not onely to excuse, but also to commend and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

that moved him thereunto. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>England,</hi> whom many

to make it known by what Title he took upon him to be King of <hi>England,</hi>
sent divers Ambassadors into <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with such instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

that two notable Murderers had been taken at <hi>Rome,</hi> who voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed

and wicked purpose; why should not men sufficiently seen in matters of

good and worthy Writer (of which sort this Realm had rather some want
then any great store) depinct the Spainard and his tyranny so lively and
so truly, that their reasons, their perswasions, and their admonitions may
may shake the affections, and penetrate even to the hearts of his best friends
and his most assured Allyes? But he is a faint friend that will be won with a
word, and he not worthy the name of an Ally, whom the dash of a pen may
make forsake and abandon his Confederate. How then? what other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

<hi>Quis nisi mentis snops oblatum respuit aurum?</hi> Let greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be proffered to the Spanish Governors; greater preferment to his

to win the hearts and affections of <hi>Scipios</hi> Souldiers, promised them peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and quiet possession of their own goods, and to reward them with the
self same Honor, Offices, and Dignities which he vouchsafed upon his own

friends.</p>

               <hi>Francis Forza</hi> a Captain of great worth, and of better credit, served
the Venetians and the Florentines together many years, against <hi>Philip Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
Duke of <hi>Millan;</hi> and they to retain him to their onely service,
made him great offers, promised him great preferment; but the Duke
hearing hearing thereof, with a faithful promise to give him his onely
Daughter in marriage, and to make him his sole and onely Heir, made
him forsake his old friends, and to become his vowed friend and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
But <hi>Francis Forza</hi> was a mean Captain, and a man of no great
Linage, and therefore easie to be changed with an assured hope of better
advancement; whereas men of good account, of honorable Parentage
and of fufficient Lands and possessions (such as the Spaniards cheifest Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
commonly are) will not falsifie their faith, or forsake their King for
any reward whatsoever. Truly men of great honour, prefer their credit
before their gain; and yet honorable men are men as others be, and suffer
themselves to be won as others are.</p>
            <p>There was a time when the Marquess of <hi>Mantoua</hi> (whose Successors are
now Dukes, and equal to great Princes, and he not inferior unto any of his
Predecessors) having vouchsafed to serve the Venetians as their General
against <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> stood not so much upon his honor, but
that the said <hi>Lewis</hi> with greater offers, and a larger Pention then he had
of the Venetians, was able to withdraw him from their service and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>There was a time when the mighty Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Fift,</hi> being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to alienate the affection of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, from <hi>Francis</hi> the First,
King of <hi>France,</hi> obtained his request and purpose, by promising the Cardinal
<hi>Iulio de Medicis</hi> a yearly Pension of ten thousand Ducats to be paid him out
of the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and by giving to <hi>Alexander de Medicis</hi> a
Pension of the like value in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a time when the said Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi> being jealous
of the great friendship that was betwixt Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh,
and the Duke of <hi>Urbin,</hi> and likewise desirous to distract <hi>Andrew Dorea</hi>
from the service of the said Pope, who then was in League with the
French King, prevailed with the one by giving him the City of <hi>Lova</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:93045:133"/>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and gained the assured friendship of the
other, by making him Duke of <hi>Malfie,</hi> and by encreasing the pay
and Pension which the Pope gave him. To be short, there was time
when as <hi>Philip</hi> sirnamed the Fair, King of <hi>France,</hi> did not onely entreat

It cannot be denied that vertuous men had rather have their names

corruption: Yet it is written, and written by an Author worthy to
be remembred amongst the best Authors of our time, That the Marquess
of <hi>Pescara,</hi> a Prince whose Vertues, Fame, Reputation, Credit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
were nothing inferior unto the most honorable and vertuous Princes
that ever lived on earth, had been won by his friend <hi>Ieremy Morony</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift, if the Cardinal <hi>Acoltera</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> together with those learned Civilians which were sent by
the Pope and the Venetians to perswade him that the Emperor was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that the Pope had power to dispose thereof unto
whom it pleased him, had used pregnant and sufficient Reasons to enforce
their perswasions, and to assure him of the Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>And undoubtedly the brotherly love of <hi>Don Iohn de Austria,</hi> and the
loyal affection of the late Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> might easily have been shaken
by a more sweet then tempestuous wind of the like nature: For since Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses,
Dukes, Emperors and Popes, have been content to be caught
with a golden hook; let no man be afraid to try and sound, or despair to
win and change the affections of meaner personages, especially such as are
either greedy or needy of rewards, and against such Princes as have given
many occasions of discontentment unto such Personages.</p>
            <p>But now to descend from the general means unto those particular ways
which I promised to declare unto you, let me, I pray you, with good leave
and patience run over the short Catalogue of his best friends, and shew
you how even they may be entreated or councelled either to forsake him
utterly, or to stand as Neutrals and idle lookers on, whilst others shall
annoy him. And because of late years, and since his late dishonour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in <hi>England,</hi> he hath used all means possible to induce the Princes
of <hi>Italy</hi> to aid him in a second Enterp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ise which he intendeth against <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
I will as briefly as I can set down divers Reasons which may be used
to disswade them from yeelding him any manner of assistance. It may
therefore be said unto the <hi>Italians</hi> in general, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they live now in peace
and quietness under the wings and protection of divers Princes; but who
knoweth whether the <hi>Spaniard</hi> desireth this aid of them to disturb their
quiet, and to disquiet their general peace? who knoweth whether he
that now favoureth them, will hereafter take occasion to hate them? who
knoweth, since it is the custom of Princes to seek help of others, not for
any great need they have thereof, but either to weaken them, or to bring
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93045:134"/>
them into the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red of others, whether the King of <hi>Spain</hi> desireth their
succour and furtherance to diminish their strength, or the number of their
friends? Briefly, who knoweth when their friends are diminished, and
their forces impared, whether he will not suddenly denounce open Wars
against them? Great is the force of ambition, and unsatiab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e are the desires
of covetous Princes, who having subdued one Country, seek presently
after ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her, and when they have conquered that, labour to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
new Conquests, and never leave to inlarge their over large Territories
until a small peice of ground incloseth their dead and rotten bodies.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is old; but covetousness dieth
not, but increaseth in old age. He is already Master and Lord of many
Kingdoms and so many Countries: But as I have said, the more a man hath,
the more a man wanteth; he being nigh unto deaths door, thinks nothing
of his death. But every Prince before his death, would be glad to make his
name immortal, his Dominions infinite. He is a Catholick Prince, &amp; therfore
will hold his words and promises with Catholicks as he hath done hitherto:
But deceitful men keep touch in small matters, to deceive the better in causes
of great weight and consequence: They may therefore justly fear, that he
who coveteth Kingdoms that are far from him, is not without a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of States that joyn and border upon his Dominions; and they may
well think since he is descended (as you shall hear anon) of such Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
as were ready to take any occasion whatsoever, just or unjust, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or dishonest, commendable or reprehensible, to enlarge their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that he hath learned of them to have the like desires, and use the like
practises.</p>
            <p>But grant they have no just occasion to distrust him? what shall they
gain by his friendship? what profit shall they reap by aiding and assisting
him? He called them to help him: But when forsooth? when his ships
were su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, bruised and broken; some lost and never heard of, and those
which returned into <hi>Spain,</hi> were so shaken and beaten with weather and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
that either they will be altogether unprofitable, or hardly repaired
without great and infinite charges; and when his people were either
drowned, or so terrified, that they will have a small desire, and less courage
to return in <hi>England.</hi> But why implored he not their helps when he went
for <hi>England</hi> with an assured hope and confidence, of an happy Conquest,
of an honourable Victory? He was loath to use their help, because he
thought himself able to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tain his purpose, without making them partakers
of his glory; and now that he hath failed of his purpose, he calleth them
unto a second voyage, intended for a revenge of the dishonour received in his
first journey; and they must go to recover his credit, and to revenge his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
who have not as yet righted many wrongs done unto themselves, nor
wiped away divers foul spots and stains which blemish their own credit. And
how must they revenge his quarrel? Forsooth, by sending their best Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
into a strange Country, by dis-furnishing themselves of Ships and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
and by lending him Munition and Mariners, who might do well to
spare his own people, and to reserve theirs to encounter with the common
enemy of Christendom. Their Ancestors bought peace with unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conditions, and at a great price; and they shall go to Wars where they
have no cause of War. Their Predecessors when any Nation dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
beyond the Alps intended to pass the Alps, endeavoured by all
means possible to hinder their passage, and to keep them at home, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93045:134"/>
they having not felt the forces of such Nations these many years, shall for his
sake now go about to provoke them. Their Forefathers lived quietly at
home with their own; and they shall disquiet themselves and other men, and
endanger their own for his cause and his advantage. Their Parents never
suffered their ships or their Souldiers to depart out of <hi>Italy,</hi> for fear left the
great Turk in their absence should invade their Country and they must
send their provision and their people to fight against the Heavens, against
the Windes, against the Weather and the Sea, for so they sight that fight
against <hi>England.</hi> Their hearts may tremble to think of it; and that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch
hath happened once may happen again. If whilest their Forces shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Spanish kings service, the Turk shall assail them at home, shall
they stay for their strengths until they come out of <hi>England?</hi> Or shall
they yeeld themselves unto his mercy and discretion? For there is no other
way to relieve them, or to repel them. But it may be said that the Spaniards
credit and reputation will be their Buckler; his greatness will restrain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their Adve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iaries. Tell me, you that think so; Is he stronger then h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
Father was? Hath he ever had better success in the Wars then he? And
yet in the prime and flower of his years, and even when he thought himself
free from all danger, from all trouble and vexation of the Turks, the
Turks came to besiege <hi>Vienna,</hi> which is the Emperors chief Seat, and a
City of as great strength as any other City of <hi>Europe.</hi> They may consider
that Armies that go far from home have (as I have said) seldom good success;
that enterprises which are unadvisedly and hastily taken in hand, seldom fall
out well; that men being once deceived of their expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation in any thing
that they undertake, proceed faintly and fearfully in all that belongeth to
that action; that to hang good Souldiers, and to imploy them in a bad
cause and evil quarrel, is but to tempt God; and lastly, that is more grievous
that which a man hath already in possession, then not to attain unto that
which he would fain obtain.</p>
            <p>All these being duly considered, they may justly be afraid when they
call to minde, that their Navy which they shall send into <hi>England</hi> to help
the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> shall pass through many Seas, Rocks, with many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Winds, in great Tempests, and through manifest and dangerous parils;
and that their Souldiers shall be sometimes subject to hunger and thirst,
sometimes be Sea sick, and in great danger of other diseases; for where
many be shut up close together, there few can be in health long.</p>
            <p>All this being duly considered, they may well be dismayed when they
shall remember that the Spanish Fleet, which went out of <hi>Spain</hi> with an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
hope of victory, returned with great loss and ignommy: And they
may be discomforted, when they enter into cogitation that the Spanish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
returning to that place where they were once well beaten, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
what small relief they had when they were in distress, will not onely
lose the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r courage themselves, but also discourage their Italian Souldiers, not
being accustomed to sight so far from home, or on so dangerous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Seas, and with so valiant a Nation as the English Sea and Subjects are.</p>
            <p>They may again be dismayed, when they consider, that although they
should conquer <hi>England,</hi> yet they cannot keep it long, because they have
no just cause to fight against <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, they may be dismayed when it shall come to their mindes
and remembrance, that the small hope and confidence which they have
to prevail in <hi>England,</hi> cannot countervail the great distrust and fear which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93045:135"/>
they have to lose their own possessions and Country, whilst they busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in seeking after strange and difficult conquests; And if to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unsaid that may be said to encourage them, some men will use unto
them all the same perswasions which our Fugitives used to induce the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
King to undertake the Conquest of our Land, that man whatsoever
he be, may well and sufficiently be answered with the same Arguments
which I used long since to confute their Reasons: With these and the like
Reasons uttered by grave men unto the Common people (who hearken wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
unto any thing for their own quiet and security) and used in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time and place, of which wise men in their wisdom and gravity
can take their best advantage, the most discreet and wisest Subjects of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
may quickly be perswaded not to further the Spaniard in his unlawfull
and ambitious attempts and purposes, and the Princes themselves who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
enter into no action, whereof some great commodity is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow, will easily hearken unto any man of credit and experience, that
shall review their memories, and reduce unto their minde the means that
their Predecessors have used to free themselves from Forreign Servitude and
bondage; a commodity, far exceeding all the commodities that heart can
imagine or tongue express. It may therefore be shewed unto them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, and the Spanish Kings great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
(for it were tedious to talk of his former Predecessors, and of the
wrongs that they did unto <hi>Italy</hi>) entered oftentimes into League and Amity
with barbarous Nations against the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> brought them into
their Country, besieged their Cities, cast down their Walls, ransacked
their Houses, changed their mirth into sorrow, and never lest to trouble and
molest them, until that his strength, and not his good will to annoy them
failed him. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his Father (for his Grand-father <hi>Philip</hi> died
in the prime of his years, and therefore could not greatly trouble them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he wanted the means) doth the like; and many of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes
most loving Subjects die, some by the sword, others by famine, some
through grief, and others by infinite labour and travel, neither permitting
them that resisted him to live one hour in rest and quietness, nor suffering
those that yeelded unto him to enjoy any long peace and tranquillity; but
reduced both the one and the other sort unto extream beggery, by grievous
impositions and long and tedious wars. He himself wheresoever he ruleth
in <hi>Italy</hi> (and he ruleth there too much) impose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h new Tributes, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Subsidies, and extraordinary impositions; and where he hath no
Authority to rule, there he borroweth money, and payeth his Debts
with fair words, and sweet promises; and when he useth them best, with
Bonds and Obligations, which shall be paid when every brother payeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
When this is said, and they moved with the grievous remembrance
and lamentable rehearsal hereof, it may be they would be glad to remedy
and revenge these wrongs; but they dare not adventure to contend with
him; they will fear him, because he is wealthy; stand in aw of him, because
he is mighty; and strive amongst themselves, who shall first begin to trouble
him, because they distrust one another. His might and his wealth have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been shown sufficiently, and proved to be far inferiour unto the general
conceit and opinion that is had of them, and their distrust may be removed
by a general League, and perfect imitation of their Predecessors.</p>
            <p>It must therefore first be remembred, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third Pope of
<hi>Rome,</hi> fearing the great wealth of <hi>France,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> the son of <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:93045:135"/>
sirnamed The Godly, used all means possible to abate and diminish the
French Kings power and reputation. And the state of this present time
must be conferred with the condition of that Age, to the end that if
the like causes of fear be now apparent, the like remedies may be applied.
Then was <hi>France</hi> to be feared, because there was no Civil War in <hi>France;</hi>
Now <hi>Spain</hi> must be suspected, because <hi>Spain</hi> is quiet and at peace within it
self; all the Lords and Peers of <hi>France</hi> were then obedient unto their king,
and are they not so in <hi>Spain?</hi> The French king was then in League with
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and is not the Spaniard allied unto many For eign
Princes? The king of <hi>Navar</hi> a Vassal of <hi>France,</hi> ruled all things then in
<hi>Spain,</hi> because he was Tutor unto the young king; and doth not <hi>Spain</hi> now
sway and rule a great part of <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the League betwixt him
and the unnatural Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s thereof? <hi>Siciy</hi> was then subject unto <hi>Charles</hi>
the French kings Uncle; and now both <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> are under the
Spaniard. The same <hi>Charles</hi> was of great authority in <hi>Rome;</hi> he was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General unto the Empire, and under that Title either commanded by
force, or prevailed by authority through all <hi>Italy.</hi> And hath not the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
as great authority there at this present as he had then? The face and
countenance of both times are alike; the Remedies therefore should be such
now as they were then. Then the Pope weakened the credit and authority
that <hi>Charles</hi> had in <hi>Rome;</hi> the Pope must do like to the Spaniard now.
Then was the Title of Lieutenant General taken from <hi>Charles;</hi> Now
should all helping Titles be likewise taken from <hi>Spain.</hi> Then was the Pope
determined to make two kings in <hi>Italy;</hi> the one in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and the
other in <hi>Tuskany,</hi> and both of the House of <hi>Ursim,</hi> of which he was the chief
and principal branch; And if the like device were now practised, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the Great Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and some other Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon
whom the most should agree, would accept the Title of kings, and be
able both for their wealth and their might, to maintain the same with credit
and reputation. Then was <hi>Phaleologo</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> incensed
and encouraged to war upon the Sicilian king; now there would want no
sufficient reasons to move the French king to do the like against the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.
Then upon suddain were all the Frenchmen either slain in <hi>Sicily</hi> or
driven thence; and now might all the Spaniards be either murthered (which
were somewhat too bloody and cruel an action) or removed by main force
from <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which would be a general benefit and comfort unto
all <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Italy</hi> of it self is not able to do all this, what then shall it avail
to intend and purpose this? <hi>Italy</hi> must then be strengthened and holpen, lest
it fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l in doing this. But how shall <hi>Italy</hi> be assisted? Forsooth by an imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Princes which lived in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his time, and envied his
greatness. Forsooth, when they saw that he had by subtilty and corruption
obtained the Empire, and that what with the vigour of his youth, what with
the reputation of his might and strength, he was so puffed up with pride,
that he intended to make himself Monarch of all the world; all the Princes
of <hi>Christendom</hi> fearing his over growing greatness, began to consult and
take advice how they might bridle his ambition, and hinder the proud and
insolent projects of his aspiring and imperious minde. But the Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> who had greatest occasion to fear him most, were the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st that
bended all their thoughts, and all their cogitations to move the rest of the
Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> to joyn with them in League and Amity
against him: Then were there sent Ambassadors unto the King of <hi>England,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93045:136"/>
France</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> Then were there Letters written unto the Swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zers:
Then were Letters dispatched to the Duke and Seigniory of <hi>Venice</hi> to desire
help against the Emperor, and to distract the Venetians from the League of
Amity which they had with him, and to intreat both the Venetians and the
Switzers, not to suffer any Forces to pass by their Dominions which should
be sent out of <hi>Italy</hi> unto <hi>Caesar.</hi> Then did as many Princes as were not in
League with the Emperor, shew themselves forward in this honourable
Action; and those who for their Leagues sake could not openly assist the
Confederates against <hi>Caesar,</hi> exhorted others to joyn with them against him;
and to make them more able and willing to enter into the action, they lent
or paid them great sums of mony which they owed unto them. Then, since it
behoveth Princes in wisdom and policy to keep their next neighbours as
weak as they may; since the Spaniard before the king of <hi>France</hi> changed
his Religion, pretended to war against him for no other cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but to inforce
him thereunto; and now continueth his Wars and ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing his Rebels, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the French king is of himself become a Catholick, which proveth
manifestly, that it was not Religion, but ambition that moved him to aid
and assist those Rebels; since it is apparent to the World, that he onely
disturbeth (as I have said) the peace and quietness of all the world, and
causeth the Turk to insult as he doth upon Christian Princes; since both
<hi>Othon</hi> the Third, and <hi>Conrad</hi> the Emperors Laws injoyn all Princes (as it
hath been shewed upon other occasion) to bend their Forces, and to bandy
themselves with main might against such a Prince, and such a disturber of
common peace as the Spaniard is, I see no reason why the Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
as well Friends as Foes unto him, should not all joyntly, and with
one consent, inforce him to contain himself within his bounds and limits,
and to succour and assist him against the common Adversary of Christian
Religion, who of late hath given the Christians no small overthrow. The
Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were wont, when Christendom stood in no greater danger
of the Turk, then it doth at this present, to send their Ambassadors from
Prince to Prince, to reconcile them if they were at variance, and to exhort
them to imploy the uttermost of their powers against the professed Enemy
of Christendom. It is written that <hi>Paulus Tertius,</hi> a Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the great danger and peril that was likely to fall upon <hi>Christendom,</hi> by

sent his own Nephew the Cardinal <hi>Fernese</hi> unto them to make a friendly
composition and agreement betwixt them. The like Atonement might
the present Pope make betwixt the French king and the Spaniard; who
hath now no other pretence to fight against <hi>France,</hi> but that the king there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
although he is become a Catholick, yet he remains Excommunicate; a
pretence both vain and frivolous, because the kings of <hi>France</hi> and the Peer;
thereof, and also all his Officers, cannot be lawfully excommunicated by
the Pope, as it may appear by the priviledges granted unto divers kings of
<hi>France</hi> by many Popes: as namely, by <hi>Martin</hi> the third and fourth, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

the manifest eminent danger of Christendom, but still continue and follow
his ambitious nature and unchristian course; then will it be a sit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time to implore and imploy the aid and assistance of his near and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>insmen forsake even the next of
their own blood, when they will not yeeld unto reason, and friends many
times fall unto variance when they are put in mind of old quarrels, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
injuries; it will not be amiss to revive the memory of old and new
wrongs and indignities, offered by the house of <hi>Austria</hi> unto their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
their Allies, their Kinsmen, their Friends, and other Princes that now
either fear or favour them; Then would it be shewed, that all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and Princes of that Family have neither regarded consanguinity of
blood, or alliance of Friendship, nor the wealth of their Subjects, nor the
bonds of Equity and Reason; but have always preferred their private
gain before the Commonweal, their own interest before their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and Friends commodity and advantage, their own will and pleasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Law and Justice; briefly, their subtil devices and deceits before plain
dealing and sincerity.</p>
            <p>Then, to begin with the infancy of their Family, it would be made
known, that when they were but poor Counts of <hi>Hapsparge,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched
upon their Neighbours, they wronged and oppressed the simple
and well-meaning Switzers, over whom they tyrannized so long, that
at length by common consent, and by a general Revolt against them,
both they and their Officers were violently driven out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Then would it be declared that <hi>Rodulph</hi> the first Emperor of their
House, obtained the Empire by plain deceit and cunning; and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
himself therein, that he sought his own commodity more then the
wealth of the Empire, and shewed many evident signs and arguments
of loathsom and detestable ingratitude. For, whenas the Empire had been
void almost Twenty years, and divers Compeitors affected the same,
as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Thyringia,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, Alphons</hi> King
of <hi>Castile,</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> Brother unto the King of <hi>England;</hi> and all
those Corrivals had almost wasted themselves and their friends in seeking
for the place, and in maintaining themselves therein: The Electors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-wearied with the length and troubles of this tedio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,

               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d their offer;
and they in disdam of him, presently made choice of this <hi>Rodulph,</hi> who
had been the Master of his Palace, and had learned divers Feats of
Chivalry under him; in regard of which experience, the Electors as
some men write, yeelded him their consent: But others report, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, for his ingratitude and evil demeanor, he was put out of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagarius</hi>
his service, he followed the Arch-bishop of <hi>Ments,</hi> and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so diligently upon him in the Journey which he made unto <hi>Rome,</hi> that
when he returned thence he made him Emperor, although he was then
of a very mean living, as <hi>Albertus Argentinensis, Iohannes Vitudaranus,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93045:137"/>
Rotridano Molespini, Giovani Villani,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Second) with many others do testifie. And it
is written that the same Arch bishop, bragging many times with his
friends in secret conference, what a great deed he had done to make so
mean a man Emperor, would say unto them merrily, that he carried
an Emperor behinde him in his riding Hood when he travelled by the
way.</p>
            <p>You have heard how he came to the Empire; now let me tell you
how he demeaned himself therein. The first thing he did wisely; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own weakness, he insinuated himself into the favour of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Princes; and whether it were to please them, who were somewhat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with <hi>Othagar</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> because they thought he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be Emperor, or to shew himself grateful where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
great favour and courtesie, he presently summoned his Master
<hi>Othagar</hi> to come to do him homage for his Kingdom. <hi>Othagar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
both the Message and the Messenger, and taking him for a proud
servant, who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing unworthily advanced, would begin to shew his pride
against his Master, refused to appear at his summons; <hi>Rodulph</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
in regard of this contempt, invaded the Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> and
forfeited the same unto the Empire. <hi>Othagar</hi> being highly offended
with the confiscation, denounceth Wars against the Emperor. By the
intercession of friends they met at a place appointed; And there <hi>Rodol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ph,</hi>
dissembling cunningly his pride and insolency, goeth first to salute <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagar,</hi>
calleth him his Lord and Master, thanking him for vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
to end their contention by a friendly composition, rather then by
bloody Wars; maketh a marriage between his Daughter and <hi>Venceslaus</hi>
the Son and Heir of <hi>Othagar;</hi> and then with a fair shew of assured
and faithful friendship, prayeth him to vouchsafe, if not openly, because
perhaps he would be ashamed to do it, yet secretly and within his Royal Tent,
to do him Homage for his Kingdom and Principalities. The King won
with fair words, yeeldeth to his demands, offereth up unto him five several
Banners, whereof the Emperor restoreth unto him on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y two, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the other three, one for <hi>Austria,</hi> another for <hi>Corinthia,</hi> and the
third for <hi>Syria;</hi> and pacifieth the King who was greatly offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
by promising faithfully to restore them unto his Son <hi>Venceslaus,</hi>
as soon as the Marriage betwixt him and his Daughter shall be solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized.</p>
            <p>To this deceit and cunning he addeth a worse despight and contumely;
For having intreated to do him Homage secretly, and within a Tent,
he caused a deceitful Tent to be made, the which should fall open as
soon as the cords thereof were unloosed. In this Tent <hi>Othagar</hi> falleth
down on his knees, and suddenly whilst he is doing Homage, the Tent
falleth open; the Germans laugh at his humility; the Bohemians are
grieved with his submission; and he himself is highly displeased with the
Emperors deceit: And his grief is increased because his Wife scorned
and mocked him at his return. To be short, he prepareth all the Forces
that he could possibly make, and reneweth War against the Emperor:
The Emperor that whilst he had been his servant remembred that <hi>Otha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
had given great occasion of discontentment unto the great Captain
of <hi>Moizona,</hi> called <hi>Milota,</hi> him he putteth in mind of an old injury;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93045:137"/>
and so prevailed, what with bribes, and what with perswasions, that in
the very conflict, he forsaketh his Master, and leaveth him to be murthered
of two Brethren, whose third Brother <hi>Othogar</hi> had caused to be executed,
for some offence worthy of death.</p>
            <p>The king being thus slain, he rewardeth both the Traitor and the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and following his victory, burneth a number of Monasteries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
houses that <hi>Othogar</hi> had builded: A rare and strange Pesident; For
it is abominable in a servant to betray his Master; more abominable to cause
him to be murthered; and of all abominable things the most abominable to
reward the Traitors, and recompence the murtherers: But to burn Religious
houses in despight of the Founder, and to spoil Gods Temple in hatred of a
man, is an act the like whereof hath never been found but in such as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
care for God nor regard his service.</p>
            <p>Neither did <hi>Rodolphs</hi> wickedness end in these hainous Actions, but he
wrongfully warred upon <hi>Bemera,</hi> unjustly invaded <hi>Bohemia,</hi> unlawfully
seised upon <hi>Austria,</hi> and most cruelly burnt above threescore very fair and
beaut full Castles in <hi>Turingia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rodolph</hi> having reigned as Emperor nineteen years, and in all this time
never vouchsafed to set one foot towards <hi>Italy,</hi> to be crowned there of
the Pope (which negligence in those dayes was held for a most hainous
offence) departed the World, and leaveth his son <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi>
who in disdain of the French king, within 6 years after is made Emperor, and
imitateth his Father in his bloody cruelty: For he beginneth his Empire
with killing <hi>Adolph</hi> his Predecessor, continueth the same with the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
molestation and usurpation of <hi>Mayeme,</hi> dishonoureth his Reign with
a violent and forcible seisure into his hands, and to his sons use, of the
kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and endeth the same, not by a natural, but by a
violent and unnatural death: For it pleased God, that his own Nephew,
and other Earls of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> should by taking him, revenge
the wicked and detestable murther which he committed on the sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Adolph</hi> the Emperor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> was the third Emperor of this House; if he
may be called an Emperor, who being unlawfully chosen, wrongfully usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Empire. For the Bishop of <hi>Trevers</hi> and <hi>Ments,</hi> and the Marquess
of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> together with <hi>Iohn</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> chose <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Bamera</hi> Emperor, and <hi>Frederick</hi> had the voices and suffrages of the Bishop
of <hi>Colen,</hi> of the County Palatine, and of the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> whose
Elect on was of no force, because when the six principal Electors cannot
agree, but three of them are for one, and three of them are for another,
the king of <hi>Bohemia</hi> as Umpier, determineth the matter, and he casteth
his voice upon the said <hi>Lewis,</hi> and made him lawfull Emperor. But <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
according to the ambitious and violent nature of his proud Family,
pursued his pretensive right by bloody wars, and drew the Pope, the kings
of <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the County Palatine, <hi>Stratsbourgh,</hi> and
other Imperial Cities, to stand stout and obstinate in the defence of his
quarrel, wherein many thousands were slain, and many more had been
murthered, had not the Almighty (who alwayes favoureth just causes)
vouchsafed to give the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> grace to take him prisoner in the
Field; After which disgrace, he and his Family had been for ever been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
had not the good Emperor been so gratious unto him, as after three
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93045:138"/>
years imprisonment to set him at Liberty, and to restore unto him the
Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> the which he might have returned with more
reason unto the Empire, then <hi>Rodolph</hi> had to distract it from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>The fourth Emperor of this Family was <hi>Albert</hi> the second, who married
the daughter and heir of the Emperor <hi>Sigismond,</hi> and had with her in Dower,
the kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary:</hi> This Emperor ruled scant Two
years, and therefore did not any good or bad exploit worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>The fifth Emperor of this Family was <hi>Frederick</hi> the third, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was such, that his own Subjects with the help of his own Brother
<hi>Albert,</hi> besieged him a long time in the Castle of <hi>Vienna;</hi> where they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him prisoner, had not <hi>George</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia</hi> delivered him by deceit
and cunning, rather then by strength and fortitude; For although he came
to <hi>Vienna</hi> with an Army of eight thousand good Souldiers, yet was not
this Force able to succour him, but he was fain to play the Umpier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his Citizens, and so under a colour of conference called him,
his wife and his son forth of the Town, and when he had cunningly set them
at Liberty, he conveyed them secretly unto a place of security.</p>
            <p>This Emperor to prosecute a Bishop which was deposed by the Pope,
raised such troubles in <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Princes thereof were not able to
succour the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> of <hi>Constantinolpe,</hi> whom the great
Turk <hi>Mahomet</hi> drove from his Imperial City, caused him to be slain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the gates thereof, set his head upon a Lance, and commanded it
to be carried about the City; his wife, daughters, and many other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Gentlewomen, were invited to a banquet, after which they
were all deflowred, and then cut into small pieces, as flesh to the pot.
And lastly, in despight of Christ and all Christians, he caused the Picture
of our Saviour to be set up in the Town, with this Inscription, <hi>Behold
the Saviour of the Christians that could not save them!</hi> Immediately after
<hi>Frederick</hi> succeeded <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and after him <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, his
grand-childe; of which two I have already said enough, and might say
much more to make them more hatefull, but I should be too long and
over-tedious; And yet I may not forget three notable Arguments of
of <hi>Charles</hi> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs dissembling, and of his turbulent nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The First sheweth that he pretended to be a zealous Catholick, and
was indeed no better then a dissembling Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>The second proveth, that although he shewed an outward desire of peace,
yet he cared not what occasions he took to make war.</p>
            <p>The third declareth, that albeit he would seem to love <hi>Germany,</hi> as the
Nation from whence all his greatness proceeded, yet he sought the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of <hi>Spain</hi> more then of <hi>Germany,</hi> or of his own Family or
House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first point is proved, because that having obtained of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth
great sums of money, and ten thousand well appointed Souldiers, in regard
of his faithfull promise to subvert and utterly overthrow the Lutherans of
<hi>Germany,</hi> as soon as he had with those men and that money fully revenged
himself upon certain Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th whom he was highly offended,
and whom he had never subdued, had he not had the Popes help, he gave
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93045:138"/>
over his wars, and granted both unto them and all others liberty of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
wherewith not only the Pope had just occasion to be displeased, but his
own Confessor took it so grievously, that the next time he came to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
he denied him Absolution.</p>
            <p>This zealous Christian, when he had troubled <hi>Italy,</hi> with long and
tedious wars, not meaning (as it seemed) to end the same wars without
doing some notable action, worthy of eternal memory, took the Pope
prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> and kept him a long time in the Castle of St. <hi>Angelo.</hi>
And although he would not suffer him to be set at Liberty before he had
paid a great Ransom, yet he dissembled and handled the matter so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
that he caused publick Praises and Supplications to be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God generally throughout all <hi>Spain</hi> for the delivery of this Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and protested openly unto the World, that his unruly Souldiers,
full sore against his will and pleasure, being in great distress of money
and other necessary provision, had sacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and imprisoned the
Popes Holiness.</p>
            <p>The second point shall need no other proof but his great malice,
and continual spight, notwithstanding that the Princes of <hi>France</hi> were
in some manner the onely and special cause of his greatness: For had not
<hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh with great cunning &amp; policy weakned the last Duke of
<hi>Burgondy;</hi> had he not most wisely and providently nourished the wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Switzers; had he not covetously and carelesly set him at
variance with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and lastly, had he not secretly &amp; privily
won <hi>Nicholas Campobasso</hi> to leave the said Duke in the midst of the battel,
which he fought with the Prince of <hi>Lorain</hi> (a practice not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
against the Spaniard) valiant <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had never been
slain in the Field, nor the troublesome <hi>Maximilian</hi> should ever have
inherited his Dukedom by matching with his daughter. How sought he
continually to perturb and disquiet the peace thereof? Which side left
he unassaulted? Which way to enter into <hi>France</hi> untried? And what
cause had he to disquiet <hi>France,</hi> especially after that he had taken the
king thereof prisoner, and made him yeeld unto all unreasonable demands?
It is written that many times entering into a serious cogitation of the
great slaughters that had been committed in <hi>France</hi> by him and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
of the great wrong that he had done to the good and vertuous
Kings thereof; and of the simple and weak causes that moved him
thereunto, he was often and greatly troubled in his Conscience, and
sometimes sought peace of himself; and yet the wicked spirit overcoming
the good inclination that sometimes guided him, he returned presently
and without any just occasion unto wars.</p>
            <p>The last point is proved by a Diet and a general Assembly of the
States of <hi>Germany,</hi> which he held at <hi>Auspurge,</hi> under a colour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and order divers abuses in Religion; unto which Diet many great
Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> would not vouchsafe to come, because they knew
certainly, that the reformation of Religion was but the pretence and
colour of keeping that Diet; but the very end and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rpose thereof
was to reverse the order of the Election of the Emperors, and to tranfer
the Empire from <hi>Germany</hi> unto <hi>Spain:</hi> The which his intention was
afterwards so apparent, that although in regard of his brotherly love,
and during the minority of his son, he had caused <hi>Ferdinando</hi> his brother
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93045:139"/>
to be elected King of the Romans, yet he used all the cunning he
could possibly, to perswade him to relinquish and resign that Title
unto his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> now and then King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and also he sent for
<hi>Maximilian</hi> his Son in Law, and Nephew, King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to pray him
to be content to condescend and yeeld unto his Fathers resignation;
and the Queen of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngary,</hi> and <hi>Gravilla</hi> the Emperors Chancellor made
many Voyages into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to intreat <hi>Ferdinando</hi> to yeeld unto this
motion, unto which neither the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> nor <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Son
would vouchsafe their consents.</p>
            <p>These three points being thus cleared, it resteth to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifths Successors, as <hi>Ferdinando, Maximilion</hi> and
<hi>Rodolph;</hi> but their actions are fresh in memory. And if the Law of
the Emperors Creation (called the Golden Bull) which expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
to chuse above four in one house, to succeed one after another in
the Empire, were (as it should be) in full force and strength, none of
them should be accounted or held lawful Emperors. Now if the breach
of this sacred and inviolable decree (I mean the golden Bull) which
hath been infringed by making not four, but seven or eight at the least
of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> Emperors together, shall nothing at all incense
and instigate the Princes of Christendom against this ambitious and
aspiring generation;</p>
            <p>It shall be needful to revive the loathsom memory of many great
and grievous indignities and ingratitudes unkindly and unjustly shewn
by the late Emperors of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> unto divers great and
mighty Princes of Germany, and unto the Empire it self. It must
therefore be shewed unto them, that <hi>Rodolph</hi> the first Emperor of
this Race, to assure unto himself and his Heirs the Dukedom of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi>
and the States of <hi>Stiria</hi> and <hi>Suevia</hi> (which were united unto
the Empire for fault of Heirs Males) resigned the Exerchat of <hi>Italy</hi>
unto the Pope, and freed as many Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> from the homage
and obedience which they owed unto the Emperors, as would buy their
freedom and liberty of him for ready money. Albeit his Son when he
was Emperor, fought many Battels and got many Towns with the
Forces and Expences of the Empire, but reserved all the profit arising
by those Battels to his proper use; and to have better and more easie
entrance into <hi>Bilencia,</hi> he usurped the State of the Marquess of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
And <hi>Albert</hi> the Second enriched himself greatly, although he
ruled not long by troubles and divisions. Is it not the House of
<hi>Austria</hi> that hath wrongfully deprived many Princes, and divers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of the Empire of their States and Dignities? Is it not this
house that hath unjustly compelled the greatest Princes of Germany to
flie for succour, and to seek the protection of the French King? Is it
not this House that hath unlawfully confiscated the States and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of <hi>Iohn Fredrick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sexony?</hi> Is it not this House that
hath most cruelly razed the Walls and destroyed the Forts of the most
noble and vertuous Prince the Lantsgrave of <hi>Hess?</hi> Is it not this
House that hath violently sacked, destroyed and utterly overthrown the
great and goodly Dukedom of <hi>Wittenberge?</hi> Is it not this House,
that contrary to all humanity hath confiscated the greatest part of the
Duke of <hi>Cleur</hi> his goods, and made him too deer for a Wise that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93045:139"/>
brought him Dowry? Is it not this House that, to make the Princes of
<hi>Germany</hi> their Servants and Slaves, have contrary to the Laws of the
Empire, erected a new Councel in the City of <hi>Spires?</hi> Briefly, Is it
not this House that useth them most unkindly of whom they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
most Curtesie? Have they ever had greater aid, greater helps
of any Princes of the Empire then of the Duke of <hi>Saxony?</hi> Who
sought for <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> against <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
more willingly and valiantly then <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony? Ernest</hi>

who favoured and furthered the Election of the last <hi>Maximilian</hi> so
much as <hi>Frederick</hi> Count Palatine? And yet not long after he gave so
hard a sentence against him at <hi>Auspurghe,</hi> that all the Princes of the
Empire reversed the same in his Presence. Now to speak of the Spanish
Kings abuses towards the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and others, were infinite
labour, and either that which I have already said is sufficient to cause
him to be generally hated, or the late Apologies of the Prince of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> passage into the <hi>Indies,</hi> or intercept his Treasure when
it cometh from thence, the proud and insolent House of <hi>Austria</hi>
should quickly be reduced unto their old and pristine Estate; and the
Princes of Christendome, when they should have no Adversary to
fear, but the common Enemy of Christians, should undoubtedly live
in great security, peace and Amity: For, then are Kingdomes most
safe, when their Neighbours Forces and their own strength are not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93045:140"/>
greatly unequall; And then should our English Island be the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and happiest Kingdom in Christendom.</p>
            <p>But in taking this course it behooveth to be somwhat Circumspect,
least that the overthrow and downfall of one terrible and mighty
Adversary raise up another, who may be in all respects as dangerous and
as well to be feared as he. For, because <hi>France</hi> lieth neerer unto us then
<hi>Spaine</hi> (and <hi>Vis unita</hi> is alwaies held to be <hi>Fortior</hi>) if <hi>France</hi> should
recover <hi>Burgondy</hi> and the Low Countries, should we not have great
and just occasion to fear <hi>France?</hi> For neither may our happy victories
against <hi>France</hi> encourage us not to esteem <hi>France,</hi> since it is no point of
wisedom, not to fear the least Enemy that may be; nor the late benefits
pleasures, and Offices of kindness shewed by us unto the late Kings
thereof, can assure as that <hi>France</hi> will never endammage us.</p>
            <p>I have already shewed the causes of our fortunate success against
<hi>France;</hi> and if those causes should once begin to fail us, the good
fortune which proceeded of them, would soon leave to follow us; and
as well Princes as private men receive favours and courtesies readily,
look upon their Benefactors unwillingly, remember good turns slowly, and
requite received benefits faintly. Then because the fresh memory of new
courtesies cannot extinguish the grievous and unpleasant remembrance
of ancient quarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls, we must (as we have said) still have a very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and watchful eye over <hi>France,</hi> and intreat <hi>France</hi> to be content to
joyn with us in placing and preferring some such Prince unto the quiet
and assured p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssession of the Low Countries, as may be well able with
the help of us and <hi>France</hi> to retain the same, and yet unable to hurt us
or <hi>France.</hi> Neither must the cross dealings of the late Duke of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
discourage us to attempt any such matter; for we saw that they
whom he had handled somewhat unkindly, might easily have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to have received him again for their Duke. And there may
a Prince be found that shall be less suspected, and more acceptable unto
the <hi>Flemings</hi> then any French-man can be.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>Ernestus</hi> who was lately sent to be their Governour, in
my simple opinion se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>meth to be a fit man for that purpose. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Spanish King of late would have bestowed the Infanta his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon him, it may easily be thought now that that hope faileth him,
because he knoweth now where to find a fitter Husband for her then to
match her with him, and to give him the Low Countries for her Dowry.
But common same reporteth, that there is an intent and purpose to marry
her unto the French King, as well because he is now become a Catholick, as
for that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have often matched together; and the Pope may
easily be entreated to dispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se with the French King to take her for his
Wife. Truly it were hard to permit him to marry so near a Kinswoman
as is his now living wives own Neece. But grant that the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sation
may salve this sore, that the French King may forget the
wrongs and indignities offered unto him by <hi>Spain;</hi> that this were a
good and ready way to reconcile these Princes that have lived too long
toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her in contention and variance, and that of this reconciliation
there is likely to follow a great and general benefit unto all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Yet I can hardly think that the Spanish King would ever yeeld
his consent unto such a Match; And though he would ever yeeld
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93045:140"/>
his consent thereunto, yet it behoveth all the Princes of Christendom
to hinder such a marriage. For if his Son should die (whose life is in
Gods hands) should not all the Kingdoms and Dominions of the
Spaniard, because there is no Law Salick in <hi>Spain,</hi> descend unto his
Daughter? And would not the desired addition of all those unto the
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> make the warlike and mighty Prince thereof, not
onely to think upon, but also to attempt the Conquest of all <hi>Europe?</hi>
Should he not grow too mighty? Should he not be able to Tyrannize
over all the world, more then the Spaniard doth now? And then doth it
not greatly import all Christian Princes to withstand this Marriage? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
grant that his son doth live to have many children, were it not a

               </gap>s Daughter in
marriage unto such a one, as what for his old grudge unto <hi>Spain,</hi> what in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Title and Interest that this wife may give him unto the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> will undoubtedly be content to take her for wife, were it for no
other occasion but to have so good, just, and colourable a cause as her right
would give him, to challenge, invade and conquer <hi>Spain?</hi> For the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> by noting the Spanish Kings son of Bastardy in his Apology,
and by animating the French King to defend his Neece, right, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God should call her Father to his mercy, hath set open such a gap
as will give a very easie entrance into the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> unto the
Spanish Daughters ambitious nature, or unto his valiant minde (if there
be any valour in him) who shall have her to wife.</p>
            <p>The surest and safest way then for the Spaniard, is either to match her
lowly, as <hi>Austiages</hi> did his Daughter, with some mean Prince, who
shall not be able to hurt or prejudice his Son; or else to bestow her
upon the said Duke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> who although he be her neer kinsman,
and a Prince of no great living; yet because it is a matter very usual in the
House of <hi>Austria</hi> to match in their own blood, and for that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
hath Kingdoms and Dominions enough to bestow upon her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
neither the propinquity in blood, nor the want of living can be
an obstacle unto the match; But it may be said, what shall it avail if she
be married to the Duke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> be her Dowry? Shall
it not be all one? Will he not be at the devotion of his Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law?
And will it not be a means to make the Emperor more fast and
assured unto <hi>Spain,</hi> and to carry the less love and affection unto us
and our Friends? But I suppose the Empire shall be transferred unto
some other Prince: and although it shall remain still in the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> yet I know he that shall be, or is Emperor, can have no great
means to annoy us. Besides, we may finde many wayes to set a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and separa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion betwixt the Father and the Son, and (when God
shall have wrought his will and pleasure upon the Father) betwixt the
Brother and the Sister. Were there ever more hot and bloody wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and <hi>France,</hi> then when the French Kings Sister was married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our King? Or when our Kings Daughters have matched with <hi>France?</hi>
Did not these marriages breed and bring forth the chiefest causes of our
most deadly contentions? And did not our and their profit and gain make
us forget blood, affinity and Alliance? But if it shall seem dangerous to
hazard our safety upon so weak an hope, it shall not be amiss to use all
policy to procure such a match<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to cause her Dowry to be either
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93045:141"/>
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> or of <hi>Portugal.</hi> For so shall his Sons power be
weakened; his Daughter further off from us, and from <hi>France,</hi> and
her ambition better satisfied with a kingdom then with a Title of
Dutchess; too base a name for so proud a woman, and such an one as
hath lived a long time in equall credit with a Queen. And we finde
that the desire of that <hi>Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> was
made and crowned King of <hi>Naples</hi>) to be a Queen was the chiefe
and special cause her Husband entered into that quarrel; for his wife
(who was descended of a King; and still lived among Queens) would
never suffer him to be at quiet until he had made her Queen. There is
no doubt but that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> could be very well content, that
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> were in some such poor Princes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
rather under the subjection of the sole heir of <hi>Spain,</hi> because
he being a young Prince, and King of so many Dominions, will not
perhaps be keep within his bounds as his old Father is; and they
would easily finde means to hold such a Prince long enough, and to
keep him from all kinde of ability to hurt and damnifie them. For
experience hath taught them, that when <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a proper King, and he alwayes Resident amongst them, they
lived not then in such danger, or in such fear as they have been since
the French or the Spaniards were Masters of those Kingdoms. Duke
<hi>Ernestus</hi> being placed thus far from us, the question would be,
what Government would best content us in <hi>Flanders;</hi> whether it were
best to have a Prince there; and if a Prince, what he should be; or
else such a Government as is now amongst the United Provinces; and
if such a Government, whether it were best to unite the rest of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
unto them that are already united. The questions are full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
and a man of far greater experience and wisdom then my self
can hardly resolve them: And yet because this is my last task, I will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as I have done in the rest, adventure to commit my follies to your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</p>
            <p>The pleasant and sweet Government under the States of the United
Provinces, The consideration of their Subjects quiet and wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are, The
regard of their wealth, The credit whereunto they are grown, The
accompt that their Neighbours make of them, The free Traffique
which they have with Forreign nations, The recourse of Strangers unto
them, The beauty and increase of their Cities, lately enlarged and
beautified, and their strength being (as I have once said already) almost
comparable unto the power of mighty Princes, might easily induce them
to consent to make one Common-wealth of all the seventeen Provinces.
But if they should all joyn in one Form of Government, it were greatly
to be doubted that they would grow so mighty in time, that their might
would make them ambitious, and their ambition desirous to encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Neighbours; who with the same and good of their great ease
and prosperity, would happily be content to shake off their Kings,
and live under their wings and protection. Was it not the common
report of the Romans good Government that made Forreign Nations
desirous to be subject unto them? Was it not the incorporating of
those Nations into their own Cities, and their permitting of them to
enjoy the like Priviledges and Liberties as the Romans enjoyed, that drew
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93045:141"/>
other people to follow the example of those Nations? Was it not
then seen, and may it not be seen again, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Is it not generally said, that two eyes see more then one? And do
not many Councellors consult and resolve upon any thing better then
a few? and is it not true that it is not the Clymate or the Region
that onely maketh men wise? The Spaniard is wiser then the French-man,
the Florentines of a quicker wit and judgment then the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;
and yet when the light-headed French-man beginneth once to be
staid, he is nothing inferior to the wise Spaniard; and the Venetians when
they consult upon matters of weight, resolve them not so soon, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the Flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entines. The reason whereof is given by <hi>Bodin;</hi> because
the first trusting too much to the dexterity of their wits, dwell obstinate in
their first conceived opinions and sometimes will not yeeld unto the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
judgments, because they proceed from them who are either their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or in their opinions not worthy to be reputed wiser then they;
whereas the later, distrusting every man his own judgement, and
examining soundly and with great deliberation all the reasons that may
be alleaged <hi>pro &amp; con</hi> in any matter whatsoever, after long con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and consultation, conclude upon the best and wisest resolution.
Is it not this proved in the States of the United Provinces; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Hollanders, who until of late years were commonly called by
the Flemings <hi>The Blockish and hard-headed Hollanders,</hi> and now they
are grown equal to the wisest Flemings, Italians, French, or Spaniards?
Court they not Princes that were wont onely to live by the transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of commodities of their Island into <hi>England</hi> and other places?
Have they not their Agents in Princes Courts, who in many years
would not presume to look upon a Court, and knew not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves when they came thither? Have they not learned the
means and ways to insinuate themselves into Princes favours, and continue
themselves therein, who not long ago cared for no Princes favour, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or
one Kings good will and countenance? Sent they not their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
unto the Christening of the Scottish Prince? Gave they not
their Present as well as others, and within it a yearly Pension unto the
young Prince, to be paid unto him yearly out of the rents of one of
their Towns? Have they not discovered a shorter way to the <hi>Indies?</hi>
and will they not take and make a benefit by the discovery? Do they
not daily encrease their Revenews? Do not their Subjects that were
wont to guide a Boat, and govern an Oar, now manage a Lance, and
handle a weapon as well as other Nations? Do not the better sort
amongst them, who heretofore never medled with matters of State,
match the wisest Politicians in Counsel, and the best Statesmen of the
world in their writings? And to be brief, is it not likely, that if they
proceed as they have begun, they will in time grow too strong, and
exceed the Seigniory of <hi>Venice,</hi> the which if it be not assisted by
other Princes of Christendom, standeth in great danger to become a
prey unto the Turk? I have once already said it, and cannot say it
too often; <hi>God grant that all the Princes of Christendom, yea the
Child that is unborn, have not just occasion one day to curse the King
of</hi> Spain <hi>for enforcing the States to know and use their strength.</hi>

Let us remember the weakness of the Switzers, and call to minde up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what occasion they began to encanton themselves; how base men
they were that were the first Authors thereof; how <hi>Stansfather Gualter</hi>
first, and <hi>Arnold Melthdiall</hi> detesting the unsupportable Tyranny of the
Governor <hi>Greisleir,</hi> drew first divers Gentlemen, and then the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of a few Towns to conspire the death of their Governour, and the
banishment of all the Officers set over them by the house of <hi>Austria;</hi> how
they beat down to the ground all their Castles; how they perswaded the
Towns of <hi>Sinty, Ury,</hi> and <hi>Underwald</hi> to free and emancipate themselves
from the Thraldom and Bondage wherein they lived under the house of
<hi>Austria;</hi> How after this association others entred into League with them,
and briefly, how after their general confederacy, they lived many years
contented with their own, and scant knew what wealth meant: Was it not
wonderous that after the notable victory which they had at <hi>Grason</hi> against
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> they knew not the worth or value of the
goods that came to their hands? Will any man beleeve that they should
tear into a Thousand pieces the fairest pavilion that ever was seen in the
world? May it be credited that they sold great dishes and platters of
clean Silver, thinking that they had been of Tin, for six pence a piece?
Will it not seem incredible that the fairest Diamond that was in those
dayes in the world, and had a very great and rich pearl hanging thereat,
was sold unto a Priest for a <hi>Florin,</hi> and that he sent it unto their chief
Governor, who gave him but three Franks, which is a French Crown,
for the same? And to what reputation are these people now grown? Are
they not held the best Pikemen of the world? Do not the greatest
Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> seek their Amity and alliance? Strive they not who
shall first entertain them, and continue longest in league with them? Have
they not more liberty in <hi>Italy</hi> then any nation whatsoever? Are not the
Grisons their Confederates, free from the Inquisition, a freedom not
granted unto any Nation but unto them? Was there not a time when a
King of <hi>France,</hi> for calling them base people, was forsaken by them,
and made a prey unto his Enemies? Did they not in revenge of that
disdainfull word, make a Road into his Country? and had they not
come unto the walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> if they had not been intreated and hired
for great Rewards to return into their Country? Who can desire a more
notable and worthy example of valour and fortitude, then they shewed in
<hi>Navar</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they being in a strong Citty, and not needing to
make any sally out, they came forth upon the French that lay before the
Town, went proudly and without fear, upon the fearfull and terrible
mouthes of their greatest Artillery, took the same and bended it upon their
Enemies, whom with the onely help thereof, they put to a most
shamefull flight, and to the edges of their unmercifull swords? When
we remember these men, and enter into cogitation of the premisses, we must
justly fear that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their Adherents may one day have the
like mindes and the like fortune; And if they should chance to grow to
the like greatness, be it of minde or of fortune, let us consider what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they shall have of Princes; Even the same advantage which <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
mentioneth in the comparison which he maketh betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great and the Romans. For they have many <hi>Alexanders,</hi> whereas a
Kingdom should have but one; and with this ones death his whole State
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93045:142"/>
should be endangered; whereas the losse of some of their <hi>Alexanders</hi> shall

            <p>Thus to have all the Low-Countries governed by a few States, or by

de Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King, because he was his Vassal, yet the Common people affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and furthered our Kings claim and quarrel, and would not be drawn
from us by any manner of whatsoever perswasion; why may we not hope to
fined the like affection in them even against their Soveraign, if we should
have the like occasion to use their furtherance? For as then many of their
Towns standing wholy upon the Trade of wooll, with which their Diers,
Fullers, and other such Artificers were maintained, they would not leave
us to lean to their Prince, because if our King should not have sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our woolls, they knew not how to live, and for that <hi>France</hi> was
not able to hurt them so much as <hi>England</hi> could do both by Sea
and by Land; so now if they should want such Commodities any long
time, as we send over unto them; although they be now far stronger
by Sea then they were then; yet either the regard of profit, or the
fear of discommodity and hurt that might arise unto them by the
discord betwixt us and them, would cause them to stand fast and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed
unto us, rather then unto our Enemies; especially if we shall
entertain some such faithfull friends unto us amongst the common
people, as were the before mentioned <hi>Artevild, Boscanus, Agricola,</hi> and
others.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Spain</hi> being weakned, and the Low-Countries, either all, or the
most part thereof well-affected unto us, we shall stand in less danger and
fear of <hi>France,</hi> whose troubles and divisions, although they begin now
somewhat to cease; yet I fear me, that when they are once utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
they will be quickly revived again: For as fire being but covered
over with ashes, and not throughly put out, is soon kindled again; so recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
friends, the causes of their former contentions not being wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93045:143"/>
upon very light occasions fall again to strife and variance. The
experience thereof was seen in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi>
and in the time of <hi>Lewis Menervensis</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> whose Nobility
and Subjects were often reconciled unto them, and yet returned to their
former disobedience and discontentment.</p>
            <p>And <hi>France</hi> in my simple opinion, although the King that now raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and his discontented Subjects were never so well reconciled, would
quickly return again into Civil Dissentions. For the King being most
honest, frank, open-hearted, free-minded, sometimes somewhat hasty, so
earnest of that which is laid before him, that he hath less regard of that
which is passed, and also unto that which he must follow; and lastly, so
much presuming upon his good hap and fortune, that he can neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
nor careth to prevent far fetched practises; these his conditions
will easily renew some occasions of discontentment, even perhaps in his
best and his most loving Subjects; Every man that hath deserved little,
will demand much, when his Kingdom is frank and free; And will it
not be impossible to content all that shall and will beg of him? An open-hearted
man cannot dissemble his grief, nor conceal an injury; and is it
not likely that he shall have many griefs, many injuries offered him? An
hasty man never wanteth wo; and doubtless he shall have many occasions
to shew himself hasty: And then if he shall either neglect that which he
ought to follow, or not be carefull to prevent such practises as may be
devised against him, he that hath but one Eye may see that he cannot long
continue in Peace and Amity with such Subjects as shall be still encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by other Forraign Potentates to rebel against him; And that which
hath been said already maketh it most manifest, that his Subjects shall not
want this encouragement.</p>
            <p>Thus have I satisfied your Request in every point that it pleased you
to give me in Charge. In some things I have been somewhat briefer
then I would, and in other perhaps longer then I should. The length may
be excused, because all things being done for your pleasure, I hope you will
give me leave to please my self in some things wherein I was carried away
with the great delight that I took in handling the same; And the brevity is
excusable, because when I saw that my Treatise was grown to be somewhat
long, I thought it convenient to hasten to an end.</p>
            <p>Excuse both, and tender my credit; and accuse me of unkindness if I

SVPPLEMENT
TO THE
HISTORY
OF THE
State of Christendom.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had thorowly (as I thought) finished my
task, and had discoursed upon every point thereof
in such manner as you see; of some briefly, and
of divers more at large: I hapned upon a Book
called <hi>Podaces de Historia;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pidaces.</note> that is to say, The
Fragments of an History: The which was lately
Imprinted and Written (as it is supposed) by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
Peres,</hi> somtimes Secretary unto the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and now residing in <hi>London;</hi> not as a rebellious Fugitive (as
many of our Countrymen live in <hi>Spain</hi>) but as a Gentleman, that
thought it better to forsake his lands and livings, then to live under the
tyrannie and injustice of a cruel and ungrateful King.</p>
            <p>This Book containing much matter fit to clear and declare some
points lightly handled in my Treatise, in regard whereof, and for that
divers men both speak and think diversly, as well of the maker, as of
the matter thereof, I have thought it meet and convenient with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this book.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please you to understand, that whereas Don <hi>Iohn</hi>
was sent by the Spanish King to Govern the Low-Countries, he had a
Secretary appointed him by the King, called <hi>Iohn de Soto,</hi> a man that
endeavoured himself by all means possible (as wise and worldly servants
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93045:146"/>
most commonly do) first to know, and then to feed his Masters humour,
and by feeding thereof, to seek his own profit and preferment: In which
his endeavours he proceeded so far, that the Spaniard fearing lest that
his Brothers ambitious nature receiving both nourishment and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from his wise and politique Secretary, might in time adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to attempt somthing to the prejudice of his Kingdoms and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
thought it convenient not to suffer so dangerous a servant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any longer upon so ambitious a master: But because he doubted,
that if <hi>Iohn de Soto</hi> were removed from Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi>'s service,
and not preferred to some place better then the Secretaryship was, it
would not only discontent the servant, but also displease the Master: for
the better contentment and satisfaction of both, he advanced him to an
office of greater countenance and commodity; and with advice of his
Council, placed in his room <hi>Iohn Escovedo,</hi> a man of a milder nature,
and in the Kings opinion, not so fit at that time as the other was, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and further his brothers aspiring and audacious enterprises.</p>
            <p>This man advertised the King his master of all Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi>
his doings, and sought rather to please the King, then the young Duke
his Master. But at length he followed the footsteps of his Predecessor,
and yeilded nothing unto him in feeding his Masters humours; he found
quickly that his Master loathed the name of Duke, and longed to be a
King; that the Pope and Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were as desirous as he to make
him King; that the best way to induce the Spanish King to yeild his
consent thereunto, was to entreat the Pope to write unto his Brother in
his behalf; and that <hi>England</hi> was a Kingdom for his purpose, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the conquering.</p>
            <p>A plot is laid how to invade <hi>England,</hi> and conquer it; and the Pope
is entreated to recommend the enterprize to the Spanish King, and Don
<hi>Iohn</hi> for the execution before, and the possession after the conquest.</p>
            <p>The Pope writeth unto the King in the behalf of his Brother; he
fearing that when his brother had obtained <hi>England,</hi> he would not rest
satisfied therewith, but coveted greater matters, and that he should find
many Christian Princes ready to assist him in his endeavours, thanketh
the Pope for his loving and kindly care of his Brothers advancement;
and denieth not his suit, for fear he should offend his Brother; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
time to consult and deliberate of the matter; for the enterprize
(said he) is honourable, but hard and difficult; and my Brother a fit
man to be employed therein, but his credit must be regarded; and his
aiders and abettors cannot chuse but participate of his dishonour, if the
enterprize should not succeed according to his and their desires.</p>
            <p>This answer runneth for currant, until the plot laid for <hi>England</hi> was
prevented, and broken by the wisdom and policy of the Queen, and
Council of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Don <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Secretary, together with the Pope and other
Italian Princes, think upon another Kingdom for him, and altogether
practise how to make him King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> a place that required a man of
his worth, as well to keep it, as to contain the Turk within his limits.</p>
            <p>The Pope therefore writeth again unto the Spanish King, praying him
to bestow the Kingdom upon his Brother: He entertaineth both the
Pope and his Brother as he did for <hi>England;</hi> alwaies forbearing to make
Don <hi>Iohn</hi> greater and might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er then he was himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93045:146"/>
All these practises with the Pope were done secretly, and <hi>Escovedo</hi>
was the man that was still employed in them: The King was never
made privie unto them, until that the Popes Nuntio talking by chance
with <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi> revealed all their secret intelligences with the Pope,
and he presently made report thereof unto the King.</p>
            <p>The Spanish Ambassador also advised the said <hi>Peres,</hi> that Don <hi>Iohn
de Austria</hi> by means of <hi>Escovedo,</hi> had great recourse unto the King, with
whom his Messenger had several privie conferences, and never acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with any; and after they had been with the King, they went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who concluded a great league of amity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
between Don <hi>Iohn</hi> and the said Duke, upon pretence, that the
defence of both Kingdoms, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> was the cause of this
League<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> imparteth the news unto the King, who dissembleth
his knowledge thereof, and entertaineth both his Brother, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Secretary, with all outward shews of kindness and brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iohn</hi> wearied with continual crosses, and untoward proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> resorted on the sudden into <hi>Spain,</hi> without giving the
King any notice of his coming: The King giveth him outwardly a very
kind entertainment, confer together about his preferment, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth
him in all haste for <hi>Flanders,</hi> pretending the troubles there to
be such, as his long absence from thence might greatly endanger his
State. Don <hi>Iohn</hi> departing, leaves <hi>Escovedo</hi> behind him, to solicite
and follow his business in his absence.</p>
            <p>Here endeth <hi>Escovedo</hi>'s prosperity, and beginneth <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> his
downfal from that favour and good fortune which followed him before
that time: For when the Duke Don <hi>Iohn</hi> was gone, the King consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with him how to proceed against <hi>Escovedo:</hi> Then they call to mind
all their former intelligences; they think it dangerous to send him back
again into <hi>Flanders,</hi> because he would still nourish him in his ambitious
humour: Then they hold it likewise to be a matter of no small danger
to proceed against him by Order of Law, because that was to call his
Brother in question, and so to offend his Brother, thereby to give him
an occasion to fall from him unto his most mortal enemies: Then they
resolve that the best and safest course was, to give <hi>Escovedo</hi> a <hi>Baccado,</hi>
that is, a morsel to shorten his days; because that being done secretly,
his Brother would haply think that some of his enemies had secretly
poysoned him.</p>
            <p>This resolution being thus taken, <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> is commanded by the
King to put the same in execution; and he performeth the charge so
cunningly, that no man but he and the King knew by whom <hi>Escovedo</hi>
was poysoned.</p>
            <p>He being dead, his son <hi>Pedr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Escovedo</hi> useth all means possible to come
to the knowledge of them that murthered him; and seeking, findeth
some light occasion of slender presumption against <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi> which
is nourished by <hi>Peres</hi> his enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Escovedo</hi> counselled by <hi>Peres</hi> adversaries, and his Fathers best friends,
presenteth an humble supplication to the King, wherein he accuseth
<hi>Antonio Peres</hi> of his Fathers death, and beseecheth his Majesty to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93045:147"/>
him the benefit of Law and Justice against the Murtherer.</p>
            <p>His Petition is received and read by the King, that he shall have Justice
with all favour and expedition: <hi>Peres</hi> is committed as a prisoner unto
his house, and order is given for his examination: The King wavereth
betwixt hope and fear, as men usually do whose consciences are charged
and burthened with guilt; somtimes he hopeth well, because no man
to his knowledge knowing the matter but he and <hi>Peres,</hi> he thinketh that
the accuser shall never be able to make sufficient proof of the matter:
and somtimes he doubteth that <hi>Peres</hi> may in hope of pardon from him
(by whom he was set on work) confess the murther, and the cause
thereof.</p>
            <p>These perplexities thus troubling the King, <hi>Peres</hi> is likewise perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the same passions; somtimes he liveth in hope, because the King
comforteth him, and his accuser proceedeth faintly in his accusation;
within a while after he beginneth to fear, because he is committed to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
durance, commanded to confess the fact, and conceal the cause;
willed to compound with his accuser, and so eagerly prosecuted, that he
flyeth to <hi>Aragon;</hi> The people there (being grieved with the manner of
proceeding against him, and with the manifest breach of their ancient
priviledge) rise up in Arms, make <hi>Ghilmesa</hi> their Head, and by main
force deliver him out of prison; he being at liberty, flyeth into <hi>France,</hi>
and thence cometh into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have briefly heard the fact, now it remaineth to clear such
questions as may arise from this fact.</p>
            <p>The Questions are these,<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>First,</hi> Whether the King commanding <hi>Escovedo</hi> to be murthered in this
manner, may not worthily be accompted and called a Murtherer?</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Next,</hi> Whether <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> obeying this Commandment, hath not
committed as great an offence as the King?</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Then,</hi> Whether the King being found a Murtherer, deserveth not to be
Deposed or Excommunicated for this Murther, better then the King of
<hi>France</hi> did deserve to be deprived of his Life and Crown, for murthering
the Duke of <hi>Guise?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whether this Excommunication and Deposition may be warranted
by the example of other Princes, who having committed the like offences, have
endured and undergone the like punishment?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To clear the first question, it shall be needful to know whether the
King had just occasion offered him by <hi>Escovedo,</hi> to cause him to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered?
For though Princes have life and death over their subjects, yet
he is to be accompted a Tyrant that causeth any of his Subjects to be
done to death, without having deserved to lose his life; and this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
given them by Law, and common consent of their subjects, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to no other purpose, nor respecteth any other end, then that sin may
be punished, and malefactors not permitted to live, both to the scandal
and detriment of well doers.</p>
            <p>If therefore <hi>Escovedo</hi> committed no offence worthy of death, the
King had no power, no warrant, no authority to take away his life; his
offence therefore must be known, the nature, quality, and circumstances
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93045:147"/>
thereof well examined, and duly considered, and according as his crime
shall fall out, and prove to be great or small, pardonable or capital, so
shall the Kings actions seem punishable or excusable.</p>
            <p>All that <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> his Book chargeth him withal, is, that he had
secret intelligence with the Pope, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> wherein he was set on by his master Don <hi>Iohn de Austria,</hi> who
was the King's Lieutenant General, and by vertue of this office, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Kings own person, and was armed with his authority, if not
in all things, yet in as much as concerned the execution of his charge
and commission.</p>
            <p>The question then must be, whether the Secretary unto such a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
performing that which is commanded by his master, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and condemned for a Traytor?</p>
            <p>Treason hath many branches, and is of divers kinds, and it would
be tedious and troublesome to make a recital of them all: And it shall
suffice to declare, whether any of the actions specified in this accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be within the compass of Treason: He wrote Letters; to whom?
To the Pope: Why? He was no enemy, but a friend to the King of
<hi>Spain:</hi> What was the tenor and contents of this Letter? Nothing else,
but that it might please his Holiness to recommend one Brother unto
another: Why? That was an office of kindness, and not of treason:
And for what purpose desireth he to have him recommended? Forsooth
for the employment in the service and enterprise that was to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>England;</hi> Why, that service liked the King, and proceeded first
from him, it tended to his benefit, it was to be undertaken in revenge of
his supposed wrongs, against his enemy; and all this is no treason:
And for whom wrote he? For Don <hi>Iohn de Austria,</hi> his Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Pope's Darling, and Turks scourge, the Princes of Italies
Favourite, the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> terror, and the whole Worlds won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But he wrote without the King's privity; How shall he know
that? Had he not good cause to think, that all that he did was done with
the King's counsel and consent? Had he not eyes to see, and ears to hear,
and discretion to consider, that whatsoever was done against <hi>England,</hi>
should be both grateful and acceptable unto the King? I, but he might
think that the King would not be content to have his Brother made a
King; Why? He was his Lieutenant already, and so next to a King;
He had done him great service, and was to do him more, and so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no small recompence; he had the Title of a Duke, but no Living
fit for a Duke; the vertues and valour of a King, but no possibility to
be a King but by his Brothers favour and furtherance; briefly, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that honour, and <hi>Escovedo</hi> perhaps thought the King meant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to that honour; the rather, because the King might be led to
advance him to a Kingdom in his life time, by his fathers example, who
prefers his Brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi> to the Empire, before he died himself;
why then, be it that he was either deceived in his cogitation, or beguiled
with the love of his Master, or went further then he had warrant to go,
why, lawful ignorance extenuateth the gravity of; and as to annoy a
Princes enemy, so to pleasure his friend was never punishable, or at any
time accounted treason.</p>
            <p>But when the enterprise against <hi>England</hi> failed, he solicited the Pope
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93045:148"/>
for the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis;</hi> but how? Not to have it without the Kings
good leave and liking: And when made he that motion? Even then,
when the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the wisest Counsellors of <hi>Europe</hi> stood
in fear of the common enemy, doubted that <hi>Tunis</hi> might be recovered
by the Turk, and therefore thought it meet to have so valorous and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
a Prince there, as was Don <hi>Iohn de Austria;</hi> who having the
Kingdom in his own right, would be the more willing and ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it: and was this desire an offence? Or, could this motion be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
treason? He might have remembred that Don <hi>Iohn de Soto</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from serving Don <hi>Iohn de Austria,</hi> because he furthered him
in the like enterprizes: But he saw him preferred to a place of greater
honour and commodity; which gave him just occasion to think, that the
King rather liked then disallowed his actions.</p>
            <p>Thus you see there is no desert of death in practising with the Pope.
Now it remaineth to consider, how this dealing in <hi>France</hi> with the King,
or the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> may be justly esteemed a crime capital.</p>
            <p>It appeareth that the French King was then in League with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
whose Ambassador was then residing in his Court; and Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
are not permitted to remain, but where there is a League of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
betwixt Princes.</p>
            <p>The Guisards affection hath been declared to have been always grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
towards <hi>Spain</hi> then towards <hi>France:</hi> And the enterprize of <hi>England</hi>
might seem unto Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> very difficult, yea impossible,
without some favour, without some help from <hi>France;</hi> if then to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this enterprize, he had some secret intelligence with <hi>France,</hi> is he
therefore blame-worthy? Or hath it ever been counted a fault in a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
or Lieutenant to seek all lawful and honourable ways to bring to
pass his Masters desire and purpose? Do Princes prescribe unto their
Lieutenants or Ministers all that they can do to compass and effect their
designs? Do they not rather give them a few short Instructions, and
leave it to their discretion and wisdom to foresee and use other means to
further their intentions? Is not this the reason why they make choice of
wise and discreet men for such employments? Is not this the cause that
when they send young Noblemen either to Wars, or Ambassadors, or
to forraign Governments, they are ever accompanyed with grave and
wise Counsellors? Briefly, Is it not this that moveth them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that their young Lieutenants, Ambassadors, or Governours, shall
do nothing without their Counsellors?</p>
            <p>I know that it is very dangerous to be employed in Princes affairs;
Danger in conceiving a message, and Danger in delivering the same,
and danger in reporting an answer thereunto: And yet be it that a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
conceiveth not a business rightly; that he delivereth not his will
and pleasure as he should do; and that he faileth in report of his answer
to whom he is sent; yet he committeth not a crime worthy of death,
unless his Princes State be greatly endangered by his fault and folly.</p>
            <p>Let all the ancient and new Histories be perused that handle matters
of State; All the large Volumns of Civilians be read that ever writ of
points of Treason; and all the Negotiations that have passed betwixt
Prince and Prince be well and duly considered; and it will appear, that
never any Princes servant or minister hath lost life for practising with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93045:148"/>
his Masters Friends and Allies, unless it were proved, that through his
fault, of Friends they were made enemies: For the Laws take not any
man to be a traytor, by whom his Princes State is not weakned or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered;
or his Countries adversaries strengthned or assisted, in deed,
or in counsel, by advice, or by action.</p>
            <p>Then since it was not proved that <hi>Escovedo</hi> his practises with the King
of <hi>France,</hi> or with the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> tended to the disadvantage of
his Prince, to the loss of his Realms, the diminution of his Friends,
but rather to the advantage of the Kings Brother, the benefit of the Low
Countries, and the continuance of the League and Amity betwixt
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> For Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> his League with the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> was concluded for the benefit and defence of both Kingdoms;
I see no reason why <hi>Escovedo</hi> should lose his life for contracting with
<hi>France</hi> openly or secretly, with the Kings pleasure, or without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
especially if it were not shewed that he had some express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
not to deal in any matter of what nature soever with <hi>France</hi>
without his privity.</p>
            <p>For although it be a fault in a servant to be over-busie in his masters
affairs, into which divers servants fall, many times either because they
are desirous to be always doing somthing; or for that they think they
cannot be too careful and vigilant in any thing that concerns their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
yet it is an offence pardonable: And the fault that proceedeth
from temerity and rashness, deserveth rather commiseration then cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
pardon then punishment: especially unless it be such a fault that
hath no certain kind of chastisement appointed out by the Law.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Escovedo</hi> was once well affected unto the Kings service, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
changed that affection. But how will this be proved? <hi>Bartell</hi>
in his Book <hi>de Guelphis &amp; Gibellinis,</hi> setteth down four causes, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or signs of a changed affection, and of a mans mind estranged and
departed from that faction which he once liked and followed.</p>
            <p>The first, If he have any sudden occasion of quarrel and contention
with a man that is mightier then himself amongst his own faction.</p>
            <p>The second, If any inheritance or great commodity be fallen unto
him, which he cannot enjoy unless he leave his old friends, and lean unto
their enemies.</p>
            <p>The third, If he be lately joyned in affinity with the contrary faction.</p>
            <p>And the fourth and last, if moved with any of these causes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
from one side unto another.</p>
            <p>Of these four signs, which was found in <hi>Escovedo?</hi> Had he any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with any one about his King that was greater then himself? It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not; and Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> testifieth unto the King, that he
was generally well liked and loved of all men. Had he any league of
kinred or affinity in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>France?</hi> It was never urged against him,
and he never sought any occasion of any such alliance. Left he his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
service to serve the Pope or the French King? There was nothing
further from his heart. Had he any pension of the Pope, any fee of
the French King, any yearly reward of the House of <hi>Guise?</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that was given against him mentioneth no such matter; and
although he had some benefit by all these, yet it maketh him no traytor.
For servants and Kings Counsellors may and do usually receive rewards
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93045:149"/>
of their Princes enemies, much more of their friends, which are given
to the end they should do some good offices about their King; and
what Counsellor can be greatly blamed, if he take a reward of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to effect that which he knoweth his master would have effected?
Or who can justly think evil of that Counsellor, who when an enemy
seeketh a peace that will be both honourable and profitable to his
Prince, receiveth some notable reward to be a mediator of such a peace?
Is it not good to ease an indiscreet enemy of his money? And have you
not heard of <hi>Philip de Commines,</hi> that divers great Officers of <hi>England</hi>
had yearly Fees of the French King, and yet were held and taken (and
that not wrongfully) for good and faithful Counsellors unto their own
King and Country?</p>
            <p>It is noted for indiscretion, and a great over-sight in the Seignory of
<hi>Venice,</hi> that when they send their Generals into the Field against their
enemies, they give them express charge and commandment, not to
fight a Battel without leave of the Senate; because while they are send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that leave, they many times lose very good opportunities to
overthrow their adversaries: For that oft times it falleth out, that the
time, the place, and other circumstances, give him opportunity to do
better service then he should be able to do, if he were precisely fastned
unto his Instructions. And undoubtedly the late Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> might
have benefitted the Spaniard much more then he did in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
had he not been constrained to let slip many good occasions whilst
he attended for advice and resolution out of <hi>Spain.</hi> And it is certain
that Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> after his Victory at <hi>Lepant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> might have done
great service unto all Christendom, had he not refused, when he was
requested by the Venetians to follow the victory, because he had no
warrant out of <hi>Spain</hi> to go further then he did. And the Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina</hi>
might (as common fame reporteth) in the late Spanish enterprize
against <hi>England,</hi> have annoyed our Realm much more then he did, had
he not stood so nicely to his Commission.</p>
            <p>If therefore <hi>Flanders,</hi> which in those days was very tumultuous, and
subject to divers accidents; if <hi>France,</hi> which favoured not <hi>England</hi> at
that time, so much as it doth at this present; if the Pope who wanted
not a number of fugitives to incense him against <hi>England;</hi> if the House
of <hi>Guise</hi> which had their secret friends, and their privie practises in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
if <hi>England</hi> it self, which was the mark whereat the Pope, the
Spaniard, and Don <hi>Iohn de Austria</hi> did shoot; Briefly, if all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
might minister many sudden occasions, speedy resolutions, and
better furtherance from <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> then from <hi>Spain; Escove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s
practises were tolerable, and his secret dealings gave the Spanish
King no just occasion to put him to death.</p>
            <p>It remaineth to see, whether the cause of his death being unjust, the
King had any reasonable excuse to extenuate the murther; He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
escape death but by killing another, shall not be punished by death
if he kill another; because it is lawful to repel force by force. The
husband or father that killeth an adulterer in committing the fact with
his wife or daughter, is not punished with death by Law, because the
greatness of his sorrow excuseth the grievousness of his offence; and a
man that being provoked by another by word or deed, killeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voker,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93045:149"/>
is not subject to extream rigour of justice; because whatsoever
is done in heat of choler, is rather excusable in mercy, then punishable
with extremity.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s life stood in no danger as long as <hi>Escovedo</hi> lived,
he had offered no violence to his wife or daughter, and if he gave him
any occasion to be angry or displeased with him, there was time enough
betwixt the occasion given, and the hour of his death, to allay the heat,
and to asswage his wrath. There is not therefore any one just cause to
excuse this murther, but many to aggravate the same.</p>
            <p>For first, A King commanded it to be committed; and Kings ought
to preserve, not murther their subjects.</p>
            <p>Next, an innocent man was murthered; and it is better to save ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
offenders, then to condemn one innocent.</p>
            <p>Then the murtherer was as it were a father to the murthered; Kings
are called fathers of their subjects.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Escovedo</hi> was no stranger, but the Kings servant; and it is
much more grievous to kill an houshold servan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then a stranger.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Escovedo</hi> was no base person, but of good worth, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
good qualities; and he offendeth more that killeth an adulterer of
good sort, then he that murthereth one of vile and base condition.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Escovedo</hi> had deserved well of the King, and had done him
many good services; and ingratitude is a detestable, vice, a fault punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by Law.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Escovedo</hi> was done to death against Law; and to murther a
man without Law, is a double breach of Law: a breach in the murther,
and a breach in not observance of Law.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Escovedo</hi> was poysoned; and the murther that is done with
poyson (because it is trayterously done) is much more grievous then
that which is performed. Therefore</p>
            <p>Lastly, When poyson took no effect, he was killed with a sword; and
the murther that is iterated, is more hainous, it argueth perseverance in
wickedness, it sheweth that the offender is obdurate in malice, it betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his cruelty, and declareth that nothing but death will satisfie him;
so it is sin in a Prince to think on such a murther, wickedness to command
it to be done, cruelty to thirst after innocent blood, ingratitude to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
evil for good, treason to take away a mans life by poyson, and of all
treasons the greatest, when poyson faileth, to use the sword, and when
God hath miraculously preserved an innocent man, to attempt his death
again, and never to desist until he was massacred.</p>
            <p>For Princes are armed with authority, but they are to use the sword
only against the wicked; they may be cruel, but with a kind of mercy
and compassion; they may censure all mens actions, but with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of mans imbecility, with grief for their fall, with sorrow for
their temptation, with hope of their amendment, and with a desire of
their conversion.</p>
            <p>They must think that ignorance may mislead them, Satan seduce
them, sin get the upper hand of them, Gods good grace abandon them,
and that being destitute of his favour, they are no more able to make
any resistance against the divel's temptations; and when they have
thought upon all this, they must look upon themselves, and in themselves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93045:150"/>
consider, that they be angry, but without fin; they may be moved, but
not so much as to forget to do justice; punish offenders without hatred
to their persons, and not before that reason hath mastered their own
affections, mercy hath mitigated their rigour, and wisdom hath nullified
all the extremity of their inordinate passions.</p>
            <p>This murder being then in thought, in action, in continuance, and
in iteration impious and detestable, it resteth therefore to shew whether
<hi>Antonio Peres</hi> yeilding his consent, and putting his helping hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
be not guilty of <hi>Escovedo</hi> his death as well as the King.</p>
            <p>For the affirmative it may be said, that in cases of felony, murther,
and treason, the principals and accessaries are held to offend in one and
the same measure; because they are most commonly subject to one and
the same manner of punishment: That servants to private men, and
Counsellors to Princes, must obey God rather then their Masters, the
almighty in heaven, rather then the mighty on earth: That <hi>Peres</hi> knew
in conscience that <hi>Escovedo</hi> had not deserved death: That no man should
do any thing against his Conscience; and that Counsellors attend upon
Princes to be disswaders of their follies, and not executioners of their
furies.</p>
            <p>It had therefore been the part of <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi> when he saw his King
resolute to have <hi>Escovedo</hi> murthered, not to have reprehended his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
intention presently, but to have attended some convenient time
when the Kings fury and anger had been past, when he would have
hearkned unto reason, and given an attentive ear unto good counsel, and
then not to have spared his tongue or his pen, his counsel or his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
his wits, or his credit with his master, until he had changed his
mind.</p>
            <p>For wise and discreet officers unto Princes, will not presently obey
their hasty, furious, and unadvised commandments, but give them time
to allay, and pacifie, and to consider with themselves what they have
commanded, and what mischiefs and inconveniencies may follow of
their commandments: And the Prince that hath such, may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
happy; and when of a servant to his passions he returneth happily
to himself, that is to be a right Prince, then will he thank them heartily
for their good counsel.</p>
            <p>It is written of a Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> that when he had taken <hi>Clission</hi> an
high Constable of <hi>France,</hi> who had made the French his mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and caused him to work his Countries great harm and annoyance,
he delivered him into the hands of <hi>Iohn Bavilion</hi> his trusty and faithful
servant, and commanded him to be caused to be drowned secretly:
<hi>Bavilion</hi> considering what danger might follow of his rash and hasty
commandment, preserved the Constable; and within a few days after,
when he saw the Duke his master very pensive and sorrowful, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to demand the cause of his grief: The Duke not being able to
conceal any thing from him, although he thought not to have found
such comfort as he did by him, acquainteth <hi>Bavilion</hi> with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>use of
his heavines, which was, that he had caused the Constable so unadvisedly
to be made away; <hi>Bavilion</hi> seeing the time fit to declare what he had
done, let the Duke understand that <hi>Clisson</hi> lived; and by way of advice
told him, that by restoring his prisoner in safety without a ransome unto
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93045:150"/>
the French King, he should bind the Constable to do him all manner of
good offices about the king of <hi>France,</hi> purchase the Kings assured friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and procure his own Countries safety and quiet: For which good
counsel the Duke thanked him as much as for saving the Constable, and
found that by following the same, he and his subjects lived afterwards
in great peace and tranquility.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> imitated this <hi>Bavilion,</hi> the Spanish Kings honour
had not been blemished as now it is, <hi>Escovedo</hi>'s children had not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him as they did, <hi>Peres</hi> himself and his posterity had not endured
the calamities which he and they suffer, and <hi>Aragon</hi> had not tasted the
miseries and inconveniences which fell upon <hi>Aragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of the negative, I may not altogether excuse <hi>Antonio Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi>
for I know, and so must he, that his reputation should have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
less indignity, his conscience less troubled, and he should undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
have less to answer for hereafter, if he had imitated <hi>Bavilion;</hi> but
because it is hard in these days to find any Prince like unto the Duke of
<hi>Britany,</hi> few Counsellors or Ministers dare adventure to follow the
footsteps of <hi>Bavilion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For they remember that <hi>Hydaspes</hi> or <hi>Harpagus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> as before, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Astyages</hi> to kill <hi>Cyrus,</hi> saved the harmless innocent, but his
son smarted for his fathers offence, and the father could not chuse but
smart and sorrow in his sons death.</p>
            <p>They remember, that <hi>Cambyses</hi> his servant spared <hi>Croesus,</hi> when they
were commanded to kill him, but he lived, and his wife was the cause
of their death; and this remembrance maketh them fear the Princes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and this displeasure putteth them in fear of their lives, and
this fear causeth them willing to obey and execute their hasty and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
commandments, the rather, because they see that although Princes
somtimes chance to return to favour those persons whom they willed to
be destroyed, yet they always hate those ministers that would not destroy
them at their commandment.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Peres</hi> knew, or might learn that a Princes Judges may command
an ordinary or an inferiour Judge to execute his sentence, and he upon
whom he layeth this command, is bound to execute the same, although
he knoweth that his sentence be unjust; and if the ordinary or inferiour
Judge shall refuse to obey his commandment,<note place="margin">Pastoralis</note> the Delegate may inforce
him thereunto by excommunication and ecclesiastical censure.</p>
            <p>And this is so true, that the Popes Legate, who is an ordinary, and
one of the highest dignities that may be, cannot impeach or hinder a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
given by the Popes Delegate; and the Delegate may, if it please
him, both command and compel the Popes Legate to execute his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<note place="margin">De officio Delegati.</note> because that in the cause that is so committed unto him, he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the Popes Legate.</p>
            <p>And if a Popes Legate may be constrained to obey a Judge Delegate,
how much more may an inferiour Judge, or a common or a mean Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
be enforced to yeild him dutiful obedience.</p>
            <p>The reason why this obedience is required, because he unto whom
the execution of sentence is only committed, hath no authority to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the equity or injustice thereof; he must think that all is just that
such a judge doth,<note place="margin">Gloss &amp; Pastoralis</note> he must look upon the commission and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93045:151"/>
given unto him, without making any further enquiry into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he must presume that whatsoever might be said against that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
hath been already said, and duly considered.</p>
            <p>Now if this obedience must be shewed unto a Judge delegate, and for
no other reason but for that he representeth the Princes person, how
much more ought a Kings commandment not to be disobeyed, although
he should will and command any man to hang one of his Subjects,
without acquainting him with the cause,<note place="margin">Felinus in Eccl. n. 6.</note> or examining the same cause
before his commandment; for the pleasure of a Prince is held for a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cause, and he hath no superiour who may presume to examine
his will or his actions. And this is so true, that no manner of proof may
be admitted against this general and infallible conclusion.</p>
            <p>Again, a Judges authority maketh that just which was otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just;
for although whatsoever is done by a false Guardian be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
especially if it be done to his prejudice that is under years;<note place="margin">L. 1. idem Pompon.</note> yet if
the Civil Magistrate shall ratifie such a Guardians action, it shall be of
full force. Shall not a King from whom such authority is derived have
the like power, the like prerogative?</p>
            <p>Again every superiours authority and commandment must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">C. 2</note>
and he that obeyeth not must dye the death, and may be lawfully
called and chastised as a Rebel.</p>
            <p>Now to apply all that hath been said unto <hi>Ant. Peres</hi> his case; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the second question may be briefly this; if he knew, either
because the King had acquainted him therewithal,<note place="margin">Felinus in Eccl. n. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> or that in conscience
he was assured that the King would not command any unjust thing, that
<hi>Escovedo</hi> had deserved death, he might boldly see him executed. Or,
if it were doubtful unto him whether <hi>Escovedo</hi> had given the King just
occasion to command his death, he needed not fear to perform his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
But if his secret conscience could tell him that the King
had not just cause of death against <hi>Escovedo,</hi> then undoubtedly it had been
<hi>Peres</hi> his part not to have obeyed.</p>
            <p>For as the Judge who is bound to judge <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi>
if any thing be falsly proved before him, and he not know that it is so,
shall do better to give over his office, then to pronounce sentence against
his own Conscience. So <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi> although it had been dangerous
for him to refuse to obey, and execute his Princes command, yet if he
knew that the same was repugnant to the Word of God, which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
no man to be slain without just desert, he should have done better to
obey God then his King.</p>
            <p>For although a King be called God's Minister, and his judgements
seem to proceed from God's own mouth, yet when he doth wrong, and
breaks God's commandments,<note place="margin">Qui resistit 11 quest. 3. Bald.</note> he is not then God's minister, but the
divel's and then he is no Judge, no King, because he leaveth God, and
fulfilleth not that charge which the Almighty hath laid upon him; and
he that obeyeth not his King in such commandments, obeyeth God; yea
the subject against whom the King taketh such unlawful course, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself against his violence and oppression.</p>
            <p>Betwixt God therefore and <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> his Conscience be it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he proceeded against <hi>Escovedo</hi> in malice or in justice; and if his
conscience shall accuse him, undoubtedly he shall one day finde, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93045:151"/>
the fear of the Princes displeasure will be no sufficient warrant, or lawful
excuse, and that it had been better for him to have said unto his King,
God commandeth me one thing, and you another; he biddeth me not
to kill, and you command me to murther; he threatneth me if I obey
not him, and you menace me if I disobey you; but you threaten me
with imprisonment, he with hell; you with short pain, and he with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
torment; you with death, and he with damnation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
good King give me leave to lean to him, and leave you.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third question, a matter the proof whereof must
rest upon the Spanish King's Conscience, and <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
confession, which is a slender kind of proof, and especially against
a King, for exceptions may be made and taken against it: As that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
Peres</hi> bewrayeth his own filthiness, and therefore is not to be
heard; That he is but one witness; That he is as <hi>Socius Criminis,</hi> and
therefore his accusation of little force; and many other like, which for
brevity I omit, and will dispute <hi>tanquam ex concessis,</hi> and have two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
reasons to induce me thereunto.</p>
            <p>The first, because I presume that no man will be so impudent as to
accuse a King, and his own Soveraign to his face, and to the view of all
the world, of a horrible murther, unless his accusation were true, and
tended rather to purge himself, then to defame and discredit his Prince.</p>
            <p>The second cause, I find that the Spanish Kings friends and favourers
have not made any conscience or difficulty to calumniate our Princess,
her life and actions, upon far more slender presumptions then we have
of this murther.</p>
            <p>The Author of that seditious Book which was written against the late
King of <hi>France,</hi> delivereth it for his resolute opinion, That the said
King deserved to lose his Crown, because he not only consented, but
also commanded the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Cardinal his Brother to be
murthered.</p>
            <p>He aggravateth his murther by three principal reasons and instances.
The first, Because they were innocent. The second, Because they
were allied unto the King, And the third, Because they were massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
by common murtherers. These reasons have already been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
reproved.</p>
            <p>Their innocency hath been shewed to be horrible treasons, their alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto their King not worthy of pardon or commiseration, and their
death to be warrantable by Law and equity.</p>
            <p>It resteth to make a brief comparison betwixt them and <hi>Escovedo;</hi>
and the comparison may be this: <hi>Escovedo</hi> practised with friends, they
with foes. He for the King's Brother, they against the King, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all his blood. He to the benefit of his Prince and Country,
they to the hurt and ruine of the King and his realm. He with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and command of the King's Lieutenant, they against the will and
pleasure of all the King's loving and faithful Officers. He to reduce the
King's subjects to their obedience, they to alienate their Princes subjects
from their allegiance. He to submit strangers unto his Princes Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and they to subject their Prince and Country unto strangers. He
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyn other Countries with the Spanish Kings, they to dismember and
distract many provinces from the French Crown. He was never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93045:152"/>
to desist, they were oft-times required to depart from their
unlawful League and Confederacy. He was cut off before he came to
any open action, they lived after they had committed many notable and
notorious treasons. He was accused but of presumption, they were
convicted by divers and evident proofs. He perished because it was
thought he would or might have done evil, they were not executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it appeared that they had done too much evil. He living could
not endanger his Kings life, and they (if they had not been slain when
they were) would have shortned their King's days, and utterly have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his Realm and their Country. Briefly, his death did the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
King no good, their punishment had freed the French King and his
Country of many troubles and dangers, had not a factious and wicked
Fryer ended his life before he could see an end of those troubles. If
<hi>ergo</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> deserved to be excommunicated and deposed
for murthering them, much more deserveth the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the like
punishment for massacring him, although they far excelled him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignity: And if great crimes are to be punished with great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
small offences with small correction, and such as the fault is,
such is the chastisement, I shall not need to prove my opinion with more
arguments. And if the common and Ecclesiastical Laws have no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
punishment then degradation and excommunication, and both of
them are equal unto deposition, unto death in the Civil Law; and if for
what faults they may be afflicted by an Ecclesiastical Judge, deposition
and death may be imposed for the same crimes by a Civil Magistrate:
Murther being punished with degradation and excommunication in an
Ecclesiastical Court, Murther must needs be capital before a Temporal
Judge.</p>
            <p>But what need I stand any longer upon the proof of my opinion?
The Author of the before-named seditious Book, easeth me of that
pain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> since the Law saith, Such Judgement as a man giveth against
another, such must he expect and look for himself; and he that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a witnesses honesty and integrity, when he is produced to testifie
in a matter for him, cannot refuse to take exceptions against his person,
if he chance to be brought forth afterwards for a witness in another cause
against him.</p>
            <p>The Leaguers were the Spanish King's friends, who by the mouth of
this author have condemned the French King for a murtherer, and have
thought him worthy to be deprived for those murthers, must needs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the same reasons, the same Law, the same judgement against the
Spaniard. Thus the third question is cleared.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the fourth, in the handling whereof I shall likewise
be eased by the same author; for the same examples which fortifie his
opinion, may serve to confirm my assertion.</p>
            <p>He mentioneth many Princes who were deposed, or excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or censured by the Pope for murther.</p>
            <p>The Princes deposed were <hi>Ptolomeus Phisco</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Tarquinus
superbus</hi> King of <hi>Rome, Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia, Herdanus</hi> King of
<hi>Castile,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> both the second, Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings excommunicated by the Pope, were <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93045:152"/>
whom Pope <hi>Urban</hi> excommunicated, because he killed <hi>Blanch</hi> the
daughter of the Duke of <hi>Barbon,</hi> and divers Peers of his Realm. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus
Nicholas</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was likewise excommunicated
for the murther committed by his sons procurement on the person of
<hi>Canutus</hi> his Nephew. And lastly King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the like punishment for causing his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
without any desert, without any due observance of Law or
Equity.</p>
            <p>The same author aggravateth again the French King's murther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Cardinal was an Ecclesiastical man, and a man of great Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Dignity; and proveth again his opinion by the example of
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> whom the Pope excommunicated,
and absolved his subjects from the oath and duty of obedience which
they owed unto him, because he cause <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> to be
done to death: And by the example of <hi>Bolislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whom
<hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh not only excommunicated, but also deprived him
of his Crown and Dignity, because he had killed holy <hi>Stomlaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be said that the French King killed two, and the Spaniard
but one; that <hi>Escovedo</hi> was a man of no such quality as the Duke and
the Cardinal; that their death alone was not the only crime that was
proved against the French King, but many other matters as hainous as
their murther; Briefly, that in Kings, one fault, be it never so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
may be pardonable, a few somwhat tolerable, but many must
needs be punishable in the highest degree, and with the greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>To this I may answer, that I have already sufficiently cleared the
French King of all that was (more wrongfully then truly) laid to his
charge; and that the Spanish King may be charged with many crimes,
as many as the late King of <hi>France;</hi> but in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Escovedo</hi> his death was an horrible murther, but the proceeding of
<hi>Antonio Peres</hi> and his friends, made it much more horrible; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
did <hi>Peres</hi> offend the King? Was it an offence against his Majesty that
he fulfilled his commandment, in causing him to be murthered whose
death he desired? Was it a treason not to confess this murther, which
could not be revealed without the King's prejudice? Was it a fault to
confess the murther, as he was commanded, and to conceal the cause,
as he was willed? Was it not a crime punishable to compound with the
accuser, and to buy his quiet, as <hi>Peres</hi> did with twenty thousand duckets?
Briefly, Was it a sin unpardonable to blemish his own reputation, and
to impoverish himself, and all to please and content the King? If all
these be no faults, then had the King no just cause to be displeased with
<hi>Peres</hi> as he was, somtimes friendly, other times hardly pleased, to day
favouring him, to morrow persecuting him; one while promising him
great rewards, another while taking from him his own goods, and his
own substance; and if all these be faults, whose faults be these? Are
they not the King's as well as <hi>Peres</hi> his faults? Nay, came they not from
the King, and not from <hi>Peres,</hi> who did nothing but what the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him what he thought fit and convenient to be done, which he
not only required him, but also promised him great rewards to do?
But grant that <hi>Peres</hi> offended the King highly, what offence had <hi>Peres</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93045:153"/>
his wife and children committed, that they should be imprisoned, and
his Son lose his ecclesiastical living? Offended they because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
suitors for his enlargement, for his speedy and just tryal? Had he
been a manifest Traytor, it was lawful for his wife to sue for his pardon.
Had she been guilty, and consenting to his treason, she could have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no more then he did, unless he had been first condemned; and the
Law favoureth women, even in cases of treason; because it presumeth
that by reason of the infirmity of their Sex, they dare not attempt so
much as men: and had his son joyned with his mother for his fathers
liberty, that was no sufficient cause to take away his Living.</p>
            <p>For the Law which enjoyneth a childe to prosecute and revenge his
fathers death, if he chance to be killed, upon pain of loss of his childes
part and portion, cannot but permit him, yea either expresly or secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charge him to do his best and uttermost endeavour to preserve and
keep his father from a wrongful and undeserved death.</p>
            <p>And the Cannons which permit not the Pope, who is a competent and
the highest Judge in any Ecclesiastical cause, to take away a Benefice
from any man at his pleasure, suffer not a Lay Prince, who is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judge in Ecclesiastical causes, according to those Cannons, to
make his pleasure a just and sufficient reason to deprive any man of a
spiritual Living.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>ergo</hi> manifest, that there was and is great wrong done unto <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
Peres,</hi> to his wife and children; and this wrong ceaseth not in them,
but reacheth unto others; and not unto mean men only, nor in the least
kinde of injury: For <hi>Iohn</hi> Don <hi>de la Nuca,</hi> a man of no mean authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a Magistrate, the chief Justice of all <hi>Aragon,</hi> must not be lightly
punished (which had been somwhat tolerable but unjustly beheaded,
which was extream tyrannie; and for what cause? If I may not tell you,
the King's own letter shall tell you.</p>
            <p>This Letter written by the King unto Don <hi>Iohn Alonso,</hi> contained
these short but sharp words.</p>
            <p>Assoon as you receive this Letter, you shall apprehend Don <hi>John de la
Nuca,</hi> chief Iustice of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and let me assoon be certified of his death,
as of his Imprisonment; you shall cause his head straightway to be cut off, and
let the Cryer say thus: This is the Iustice which the King our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to be done unto this Knight, because he is a gatherer together of the
Kingdom, and for that he raised a Banner against his King, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his head to be cut off, his goods to be confiscated, and his House and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to be pluckt down to the ground: Whosoever shall presume so to do, let him
be assured so to die.</p>
            <p>You see the cause, he is a Traytor: How is that proved? The King
said so. He gathered together the Commons: How doth that appear?
By the King's Letter. He raised a Banner against the King: who is his
Accuser? The King; Who the Judge? The King; What Tryal had
he? Assoon as he was taken he was executed; a Judgement goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Arraignment; and Execution before a Judgement; Who was
the Executioner? Don <hi>Alonso de Vargas;</hi> With what solemnity is the
execution done? Whoso is a Traytor shall die; so whoso rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth the
Country shall die; so whoso raiseth a standard in the field against the
King shall die so; all is treason, and all is death, all upon a sudden, and
all without due and lawful proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93045:153"/>
For such a Justice as Don <hi>Iohn de la Nuca</hi> was, could have no other
Judge, no man else to condemn him, but a certain Court called <hi>Contes
Lateras,</hi>
the King, and the States of the Kingdom; such a crime as
was laid to his charge, cannot be heard and determined in <hi>Aragon</hi> by the
King, such a sentence as passed against him, hath no more power or
force against a mans person, his goods, or his honour, then a sentence
given by the complainant against the defendant; such a King as the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> should be in <hi>Aragon,</hi> is no longer a King if he break the
Laws of the Union, and of those Laws there are two especial branches,
the one, That whensoever the King breaketh those Laws, the Subjects
may presently chuse another King: The other, That all the States, and
rich men of the Country may assemble together, and forbid any rents
to be paid unto the King, until the Vassal whom the King doth wrong
be restored unto his right; and the Law which he doth presume to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
be likewise re-established in full force and strength.</p>
            <p>Moreover, because there is no other Law and Obligation wherewith
to binde a King, then with an Oath, an Oath is taken of the King at his
Coronation to keep those Laws, and the Oath is given him with these
words: <hi>We who are able to do as much as you, do make you our Lord and
King, with this condition, that you shall keep our Laws and Liberties, and if
you will not keep them, you are not our King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you see Laws broken, a King forsworn, and subjects authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to depose such a King, or rather, a King <hi>de facto</hi> deposed, and not
only deprivable if he shall break those Laws. And in <hi>Antonio Peres</hi>
his Book, you shall see how often and how violently those Laws were
broken.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth to shew you briefly, whether voluntary perjury,
and wilful breaking of Laws, be punishable with deprivation in a prince,
and whether subjects may lawfully resist such a Prince.</p>
            <p>These questions, if you look upon the rebellion of the Flemmings,
and the deposition of the Scottish Queen, are in some measure lightly
resolved, but not so fully discussed but that they need a more ample and
large declaration.</p>
            <p>Perjury is a most grievous offence, but much more grievous when it
is voluntarily committed; and then a man committeth perjury willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when he doth any thing willingly against an Oath taken, not by
force, but by free will; not unadvisedly, but with great consideration;
not to his hurt, but to his advantage; not to perform a thing impossible
or dishonest, but to binde and tye himself to a condition that is both
possible and honest. For when a man (not being forced thereunto by
just fear or irresistable necessity) breaketh such an Oath, there can be no
colour or pretence to excuse his perjury; it argueth, it convinceth him
of fraud and deceit, and giveth an occasion to think that he regardeth
not an oath.</p>
            <p>The seditious Author thought the late French King worthy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
for his offence, and yet he hath no such proof of his perjury as
may be had against the Spanish King.</p>
            <p>The Civil Laws hold perjured men for infamous persons,<note place="margin">Barroll. Lucias F.</note> and the
Cannons receive no infamous person fit to execute an office of honour
and dignity. A perjured man is alwaies repelled from bearing witness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93045:154"/>
in any cause whatsoever, because that being convicted to have forsworn
himself in one cause,<note place="margin">Bald. de fid. mis.</note> it is not only a presumption, but a sufficient proof
that he will depose falsly in another. And this is so true, that although he
hath amended his life,<note place="margin">Abb. &amp; Fe. ex parte de test.</note> yet he cannot be admitted for a witness, be it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a civil or criminal cause.</p>
            <p>Again a Priest that hath forsworn himself for a Benefice,<note place="margin">Abb. &amp; Fe.</note> is not only
deprived of the Benefice for which he committed perjury, but also of
all other Benefices that he had before;<note place="margin">Fel.</note> and the Bishop that hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, cannot bestow another Benefice upon him; for the collation
that the Bishop maketh unto such a man of such a Benefice, is void by
Law.</p>
            <p>And although a man may say that such a collation made by the Pope
is good and valuable in Law, yet it may be answered, that the Pope
making the like collation, seems to dispense with the inability of the
person, and so the collation is not of force of it self, but by reason of
the Popes dispensation,<note place="margin">Glossa.</note> who hath full power to dispense with men in
such cases.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>ergo</hi> perjury is a sin so detestable and odious, that it not only
excludeth men from preferment and honour, but also removeth them
from their offices and dignities which are advanced; it must needs be
granted that the Spanish King who hath violated his Oath made unto his
subjects at the time of his Coronation, and broken the Laws which he
then swore to observe &amp; keep inviolable, may with more reason and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be deprived of his Crown and Dignity then the French King, who
neither was nor could be justly convicted of the like perjury.</p>
            <p>But many things may be said for the Spaniards purgation, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially these.</p>
            <p>First, That subjects cannot receive an oath of their Prince, without the
authority of some Judge, and that a promise made before no competent,
bindeth not any man.</p>
            <p>Next, That Princes which are above Law, are not bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their contracts, which have their full force and strength
from Law; that Princes may change and alter their own Laws at their
pleasure.</p>
            <p>Then, That although they should be strictly bound to stand to their
Contracts, yet if they were induced to make a contract touching any
thing wherein they were well informed, or if the contract do contain
things too much derogating or diminishing their jurisdiction or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Royal, or if they have made a promise that may be very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
unto them, then in these three cases they may lawfully break and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
their contract.</p>
            <p>And lastly, That an oath containing a promise not being grounded
upon some other good cause, giveth no good action, no good bond
and obligation; and notwithstanding that the bond were good, and the
oath of force, yet Princes who may dispense with others, may give a
sufficient dispensation to themselves, and so revoke their contracts; that
if their own dispensations shall not be available, the Pope may absolve
them of their oath, and from the due observance thereof; or that if the
Pope will not absolve them, they need not care or seek for his absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because considering their might, their power, and their authority,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93045:154"/>
there is no Law, no Judge that can compel them to keep their oath, or to
observe their contract.</p>
            <p>To all these observations I answer briefly; because I mean but to
give light unto others, or to my self, to answer them more fully here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The Law that requireth the authority of a Judge for the validity of a
promise, speaketh of a transaction, and for victuals and sustenance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Magistrates consent and authority, and holdeth the transaction
made for victuals for unlawful, because the composition was too little,
and the Law in these cases is favourable, and the Magistrate charged to
interpose his authority, when favourable persons are overmuch preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced,
especially in favourable cases; and although Princes be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
among favourable persons, yet this Law stretcheth not unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who do usually at their Coronation swear to observe the ancient
Laws and Liberties of their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And this oath is held lawful, and lawfully taken, as well because ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
custom hath the ful force and strength of a Law, for that the States
and Commons of the Country being then present, do stand, and are
taken by general custome, for sufficient Judges to give and receive that
oath.</p>
            <p>And although it may be said that neither all the States, nor all the
Commons, are or can be present at the taking of such an oath, yet the
oath shall avail them that are absent, as much as though they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>But Princes being above Law,<note place="margin">Jason n. 32</note> are not so bound to the Laws, but they
change and alter them at their pleasure. True, unless they be grounded
upon the Laws of God, and the Laws of Nature. The first, They
may interpret, the second they cannot alter or abrogate; the first binde
them as well as their subjects, and so doth the latter. The breach of
the first maketh them odious unto God; and the breach of the latter
maketh them hateful unto men. In breaking the first they offend their
Creator in heaven; in violating the latter, they remember not their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
on earth; for the people and Peers of the Realm are their makers
next unto God.</p>
            <p>Contracts <hi>ergo</hi> of subjects having their ground, their foundation, and
their strength, not from Princes Laws, but from the Laws of Nature,
binde King and Emperour, Prince and Prelate, Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, be it that they are made between a Prince and a private man,
or the Prince and a City, or the Prince and any other.</p>
            <p>The reasons why they are of such force are these.</p>
            <p>First, It is not lawful to falsifie a mans faith.</p>
            <p>Then, The Laws of Nature binde men, and perswade them to keep
their contracts, and to hold their promise, even unto their enemies.</p>
            <p>Next, The Laws of honesty charge their Princes to perform their
contracts; there is nothing becometh them better, nothing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
them more, nothing that men require so much at their hands.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Princes Contracts are as good as Laws, and have the same
force as Laws, in the same strength and vertue against their Successors
which they have against themselves; nay, they are of greater strength
then Princes Laws; for Laws may be repealed, but contracts cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93045:155"/>
be revoked: The reason of the diversity, Laws may alter according
unto the times and the occasions, unto which Laws must be accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by which Laws are occasioned, from which Laws received their
beginning; but contracts are irrevocable, they admit no change, no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
and if they be once perfected, they can neither receive additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or substraction, diminution nor enlargement; they may not be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
but taken according to the true and plain meaning of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hents.</p>
            <p>But why they may they not be changed? Why may not a Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them?</p>
            <p>The reasons are these.</p>
            <p>Before they are made, they are of Free will, and when they are once
perfected, they are of necessity; that the Emperour of the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
add or detract any thing from his contract without his consent to
whom it is made, although he were the meanest man in the world, who
may be benefited, but not deceived by a contract; that is, not defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of that which is agreed upon in the contract, although it be lawful
in bargaining, before the bargain be concluded, to deceive one another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Princes might revoke their contracts at their pleasure,
there should be no good dealing with them, which would be ridiculous;
no trust to their words, which would be dishonest; no benefit would
be gotten by them, which would be illiberal and unbeseeming the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of a Prince.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Princes actions must be free from scandal, far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
and not subject unto malice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Autent de Monarchis in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palibus.</note> Princes are reasonable creatures, and must submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto reason, lest they be reputed as B. <hi>Celestine</hi> was, not a man,
but a beast, because he revoked in the evening the grants which he made
in the morning.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Other men may attend to profit, but Princes must look to
honour, and have an especial regard thereof; and what can be more
dishonourable then to break their word, to falsifie their faith, to violate
their contract, especially if their word, faith, and contract be fortified
and strengthned with a solemn oath, with an oath that being added to a
contract, hath these vertues, these qualities, these operations.</p>
            <p>It maketh their contracts lawful, and of full strength and force, which
without an oath are not of weight before God and man.</p>
            <p>For a young man under yeers, who by reason of his minority can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contract without authority, consent, and counsel of his Guardian,
shall be bound to stand to his contract, if he hath sworn to observe and
keep the same, his oath strengthneth his contract, and depriveth him of
the benefit of restitution to his former and pristine estate, it maketh the
person infamous which breaketh such a contract, it debarreth him of any
action against the other contrahent, it enforceth him to restore that he
hath received, it disableth him to take the forfeiture that is made unto
him, it freeth the observer of the Contract from any penalty whereinto
he is fallen, it benefiteth the absent as the present, it forfeiteth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
whether it be interposed, either before or after the contract, or at
the instant of the making of her, or at any other time, it urgeth and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the contrahents to a strict and due observance, unless it may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93045:155"/>
their souls health, and keep and observe their contracts; Briefly,
it hath many other operations, which shall be more fitly mentioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But what availeth it to have said all this, if all may be refelled in a
few words; The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not well informed when he made
this contract, when he took this oath, he prejudiced himself greatly in
yeilding thereunto,<note place="margin">Fel. in Ep. 1. de prob. n. 6, 7,</note> and he weakned his authority too much in submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself to the observance of the Laws: and all these being proved,
or any one of these three inconveniences falling out to be true, he is not
bound to the performance of this contract, or of this oath.</p>
            <p>But how are all or any of these three inconveniences proved? How
can it be that he should not be well informed when he yeilded to this
contract? Could he be ignorant of that which all the world knew, which
his Predecessors did before him, which strangers unto his Laws and
Country knew many years ago? For <hi>Guicciardine</hi> (who wrote his book
before he was crowned) writeth in the sixth book of his History, That
the Aragonian Kings have no absolute and Kingly authority in all
things, but are subject unto the subjects and constitutions of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which derogate much from the power and authority of a King.
And <hi>Bodin</hi> (who wrote not many years) being a Frenchman, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other knowledge of the Laws of <hi>Aragon</hi> but such as he received
from others, used in his Book the same words of the Kings authority,
which are used by the King at his Coronation.</p>
            <p>We that are able to do as much as you, make you our Lord and King, upon
condition that you shall keep our Laws and Liberties, and if you will not, you
shall not be our King.</p>
            <p>Laws bind the present assoon as they are published in their presence
and hearing, and the absent shortly after that they come to their notice
and knowledge; those Laws therefore being (as by all likelyhood it
seemeth) made and established at the Institution of the Aragonian King,
could not be hidden from his knowledge, nor prejudicial to his Majesty
and Authority Royal.</p>
            <p>For what blemish is it to a King to submit himself unto those Laws
which his Predecessors were contented to acknowledge and observe.
The Emperour that made and authorized almost all the Civil Laws that
are now extant, could set it down as a Law, that it should be well and
worthily done of a Prince, be he never so great and mighty, to be pleased
to subject himself to his own Laws; it delighteth a good Prince, it liketh
his subjects, it honoureth Kings, and it greatly rejoyceth their Vassals.</p>
            <p>The ancient Kings of <hi>France</hi> (who are now grown the most absolute
Kings of the world) were wont to do nothing that was of any weight
or consequence, without the consent of their best and wisest subjects.
The Kings of <hi>Poland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bodin de Repub.</note> cannot make war against
their enemies, which is one of the principal marks of Soveraignty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent and leave of the States of their Country. <hi>Crommus</hi> in
the year 1559. withstood the coronation of their King <hi>Frederick,</hi> until
that he had sworn solemnly that he would not condemn any Nobleman
to death, or confiscate his lands or goods, but suffer him to have his tryal
by the Senate.</p>
            <p>That all Gentlemen should have power of life and death over their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93045:156"/>
subjects, without appeal, or without giving the King any part or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the penalties or forfeitures that shall be raised and levied of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
subjects.</p>
            <p>And lastly, That the King should not give any office whatsoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the counsel and consent of the Senate.</p>
            <p>These are hard conditions, and presumptive arguments that the King
of <hi>Denmark</hi> may hardly be called a Soveraign, and yet <hi>Frederick</hi> yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to these conditions, and his Successors have ever since observed them;
he, because he could not otherwise do, and they, because they thought
it not convenient to deny that which he had granted; knowing that if
they had refused his conditions, they should not be received and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto his succession; and yet sithence the Nobility encroached here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
upon their King, I take it to be lawful for his Successors to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as soon as they shall be able, from that bondage, and scant prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
servitude, if they be not sworn (as the Spaniard is at his Coronation)
to see these conditions inviolably kept and observed; for if they be
sworn,<note place="margin">Specul. l. 2. de actione seu pet. 93. n. 3.</note> I hold it not lawful for him to break his oath; for men may
not voluntarily commit perjury for any temporal commodity; and it is
far better to endure temporal inconveniences and discommodities, then
to offend a mans conscience, and endanger his soul.</p>
            <p>All Histories new and old are full of the like indignities offered unto
Princes by their subjects, as often as the rebellious people have had any
good fortune against their Soveraigns; and all law and reason permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
such Princes to redeem their liberty by any means possible, so it be
not done contrary to their oath, or done within a convenient time: For
though it be true, that <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi;</hi> yet that is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
understood in matters of lands, but jurisdiction may be prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,<note place="margin">Fel. in cap. Pastoralis.</note>
and there is nothing more common and ordinary, then for inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
officers to prescribe their superiours, when they be negligent and
careless of their jurisdiction; and when an inferiour hath fully prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
he hath as good right and interest in his prescribed jurisdiction, as
any prince hath in the authority which his Predecessors have had time
out of mind, or from the institution of their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Be it therefore for that the Nobility of <hi>Aragon</hi> have had the before-named
priviledge from the first beginning of that Royal Monarchy, or
that they have used the same so long a time as serveth to induce a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
or that a general custome hath put them in full and lawful
possession thereof, it is not now lawful for the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> unto
whom the Kingdom of <hi>Aragon</hi> descended, with all charges and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
thereunto belonging, to revoke and disanul the same priviledges;
and since that he is bound to observe them, because his Predecessors did
so, and custome bindeth him so to do, it is not greatly material whether
his oath were well and lawfully taken yea or no; and because he hath
sworn to keep them, he cannot dispense with his Oath, or of himself
remit the conditions whereunto he yeilded at his Coronation.</p>
            <p>For they that swear to do any thing which they are bound to do,<note place="margin">Speculum l. 5. de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus S. 6. n. 29,</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were not sworn thereunto, binde themselves in double
bonds to do the same: the first of honesty, th'other of necessity. As if
a merchant should swear not to falsifie any merchandizes that he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he is bound to observe his promise in honesty, and of necessity; in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93045:156"/>
honesty, because no conscionable man will falsifie his word; and of
necessity, because his oath made that necessary which was before but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
and so forfeited and strengthned the former bond.</p>
            <p>But to come more fitly and properly to our matter, what was the
point for which <hi>Iohn de la Nuca</hi> suffered, <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> suffered, part
of <hi>Aragon</hi> revolted, and many (as well good as bad subjects of the
Spanish King) were slain in <hi>Caragoca?</hi> Was it not the just grief, and
lawful discontentment conceived for the new course, and extraordinary
tryal that Inquisitors would and should have used against <hi>Antonio Peres?</hi>
Did not this Inquisition breed a tumult in <hi>Naples,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where
it brought more to their untimely deaths, then there are living creatures
in all <hi>Aragon?</hi> Did you not know that this Inquisition was first invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for heretiques, and now it is used, or rather abused, against all sort of
offenders; all kinds of offences being unjustly and maliciously drawn
to the notice and cognisance of the unmerciful and rigorous Inquisitors,
that serve the Pope for his executioners, and the Spaniards for their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors?
Did not Don <hi>Iohn de la Nuca,</hi> and many others know, that
Ecclesiastical Judges are not to deal in temporal causes, be they meerly
civil or criminal, against private men, or for the Prince? Did not all
the people know, or at least might they not have heard, that Clergy
men cannot be present at a sentence of death, much less give such a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?
And briefly, Do not all the world know, that it belongeth to
him to judge who examineth a cause, and heareth the merits, proofs,
and circumstances thereof? Why then should Inquisitors judge, and
others examine; especially when the Law prescribeth both the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and the Judges, and where the party accused desireth the benefit
of Law, and the supreme Judge is bound by solemn oath to vouchsafe
and yeild him the benefit and fruition of his desire? But it was the
King's pleasure that <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> should die; and when Temporal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
would not, Ecclesiastical Judges should condemn him.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> his death might have contented and satisfied him,
why sought he not some friend to make an end of him, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that he dispatched <hi>Escovedo</hi> for him? Had it not been less known to
the world, less danger to the State? less prejudice to his Laws? He
might have been secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly murthered with far less trouble then openly
condemned, and his injustice in poysoning him should have been known
but to the murtherers; whereas his iniquity in condemning him could
not be but apparent unto the fight and view of all the world; but his
ingratitude unto <hi>Antonio Peres</hi> for the pleasure done him, by taking
away <hi>Escovedo</hi> his life, made others unwilling and fearful to pleasure
and gratifie him with the like vilany.</p>
            <p>Alas poor King, that could not finde one in the whole Realm to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a private man, and yet of late is waxen so rich and plentiful a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of murtherers as procurers, as <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uel Aridrada, Xpofero de Moco,
Rodorigo</hi> Marquess <hi>Stephano Ibacco,</hi> and the Count <hi>Fuentes,</hi> as many
executioners, as Dr <hi>Lopas, Ferrara, Truoca, Williams,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and
more perswaders, as <hi>Stanley, Holt, Frogmorton, Ower, Gefford, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,
Paget, Tipping, Garret,</hi> and <hi>Naddel;</hi> all of one mind, but of
sundry Nations; of one desire, but of divers conditions; of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
but of contrary vocations; to poison a stranger, a woman, a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93045:157"/>
Virgin, a Princess; one person having in one body four sundry quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
worthy of justice, of pity, favour, and honour: for who doth not
justice to a stranger, as God's word commandeth, pitieth not a woman,
as man's Law willeth, favoureth not a virgin, as humanity requireth,
honoureth not a Princess, as God's word, man's law, and humanity
prescribe?</p>
            <p>This only action of barbarous inhumanity requireth a whole and large
volumn, but I must strive to be short; and if you call to mind what hath
been said already, you shall find matter enough to enlarge and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
this inhumanity; and therefore briefly to the rest of the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>An oath promissory not being grounded upon a just and good cause,
bindeth not a man to any performance; but can there be a better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
then the gift of a Kingdom? Or a greater forfeiture then the
loss of a Crown and Royal Diadem? The gift is contained in these
words, [<hi>We make you our King</hi>] and the forfeiture is expressed in these
words [<hi>You shall not be our King unless you keep our Laws</hi>] The condition
is usual and ordinary, for the Emperour as soon as he is chosen, taketh
the like oath, when he sweareth to conserve and maintain the liberties,
jurisdictions, rights, honours, dignities and priviledges of the Electors
of the sacred Empire, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal; and it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that as the seven Electors in recompence of their good will and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
shewed to the Emperour of the world, received this bounty of him,
so the Nobility of <hi>Aragon,</hi> in regard of the favour which they shewed
unto their King, in making choice of him for their King, received the
like benefit at his hands, and therefore have good occasion to be no less
grieved if he chance to break this oath, then the Nobility of <hi>England</hi>
should have cause to be sorry, if after a number of good and gracious
Princes, who have alwaies duly kept and observed the ancient Laws and
Liberties of our Realm, and especially in the trial and arraignment of
Noblemen, the Almighty should plague them with such a Prince as
would not suffer them to be tryed and arraigned according to the old
and laudable custome of this noble Kingdom, by an honourable Jury
of twelve Peers, but by a beggarly crew of so many base companions.</p>
            <p>The promise then is good and better for the oath, but the oath may
be broken, and a dispensation will salve the sore of the breach. He that
offendeth in hope of a pardon, is not thought worthy to be pardoned,
and although it be a greater commendation in a Prince to be prone to
shew mercy, ready to forgive, and willing to pardon offences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against himself or his Laws, yet it is scant tolerable to forgive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sins and trespasses against God.</p>
            <p>I find that Princes may dispence with Bastardy, restore infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to their good name and fame, make their own children legitimate,
not as their Fathers, but as their Princes; not as their children, but as
their subjects; free and emancipate bondmen; briefly, pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
all crimes committed against their Temporal Laws.</p>
            <p>But the Cannons (of which the Spanish King will seem to have more
regard then any other Prince of that Religion) permit not his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Majesty to dispense with an oath; that is a priviledge and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
which the Pope hath reserved to the fulness and plenitude of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93045:157"/>
own part, and would not take it in good part, that his white son should
challenge or assume unto himself any such authority; and he as a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and loving childe, will be loth to offend so good and loving a father.
But the father in regard of his long and loyal obedience, will absolve
him of his oath. If his Fatherly love should make him forget himself
so much, as to dispense at one time, not with one, but many crimes;
the son and the father should without all doubt highly offend their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
father, and voluntarily break the sacred constitutions of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
predecessors.</p>
            <p>For the Pope cannot dispence with wilful murther, such as was the
violent death of <hi>Escovedo;</hi> nor with any thing done against the Laws
of Nature, such as the breach of this contract should be; nor with an
oath, such as this oath is, without calling and citing all the parties that
should be interssed and damnified by the violation and breach of this
oath.</p>
            <p>But grant that the Pope will dispense with this Oath, what would or
could all avail, when the contract should still remain in full strength and
vertue, and the Aragonian Nobility might notwithstanding this dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
urge their King to the performance thereof? Truly this absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should benefit him no more, then it should avail a creditor to sue
his debtor for one hundred pounds, unto whom he owed so much upon
account; for such a creditor, when he hath with long suit and great
charge recovered his debt, is presently to restore the same back again
upon his accompt: So the Spanish King, when he hath with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and perhaps with some expences, made himself beholding to the
Pope for his dispensation, must notwithstanding the benefit thereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the conditions that was of sufficient strength without the oath, and
was confirm'd with an oath for no other purpose, but that it should be
the great burthen unto his Conscience, if he should violate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
            <p>But how may the Aragonian Noblemen enforce him to perform and
keep his contract? By forfeiting his Kingdom, by taking away his rents,
and by putting the Laws whereunto he was sworn into execution. But
he is too mighty,<note place="margin">Jason in leg. mil. n. 7.</note> and they too weak to compel him thereunto by main
force. What remedy shall you then find against him? The course is
ordinary;<note place="margin">Bald: in anth. sacr, puber. in 3. coll.</note> For every Bishop hath power to compel any man that is
sworn, to keep and observe his oath, which hath alwaies <hi>paratum execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi>
and is so true, that the trial of a contract confirmed with an
oath depending before a Temporal Magistrate, a Bishop, or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judge, may be reason of that oath avocate the same cause unto his
hearing and determination: And this is the reason why many Doctors
are of opinion, and especially <hi>Baldus,</hi> that an oath hath the vertue and
operation to draw a matter from one Court to another.</p>
            <p>But what Prelate in <hi>Spain</hi> dareth be so bold as to call his King into
his Ecclesiastical Court? If the Prelate will not presume to stand in
defence of the Laws, there is another ordinary way. A subject of the
Emperour may without going to any other Judge, convent the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himself before the Pope, if he will not maintain his bargain or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;
and if the Emperour may be immediately convented by his own
subjects before the Pope, with much more reason may the Spanish
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93045:158"/>
King be called in this case to <hi>Rome,</hi> to answer the contempt of his oath,
as well because he is inferiour to the Emperour, by many degrees, as for
that the peers of his Realm, and the whole Nobility of <hi>Aragon,</hi> are of
better consideration, and more regard then any private subject.</p>
            <p>I finde that the Laws and common consent of all Doctors, allow sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
when their princes will not do them right and justice, there prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
remedies against such Princes.</p>
            <p>The first, That subjects may compel their Prince by his Superiour, if
he have a Superiour to whom he oweth homage and duty, to try the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of his cause before that Superiour.</p>
            <p>The second, That a Subject may convent his adversary before the
common Ordinary of the Diocess, if his Lord and Prince chance to be
negligent in the administration of Justice.</p>
            <p>The third, That the Prince denying to do justice to his subjects, may
lawfully be deprived of his power and royal authority over them.</p>
            <p>The first and second perhaps will not seem fit to be practised against
the Spanish King; for that although he be a subject unto the Pope for
many of his Kingdoms, yet he will hardly acknowledge that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>The third is more proper, and therein the question may be, whether
subjects can lawfully expel their Prince out of his Country, and from
his Crown and Dignity, if he do oppress them too much? Some men
hold hardly for the affirmative; and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> holdeth an opinion,
that they may lawfully kill such a Prince, and that it were a work som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
meritorious; And this opinion is condemned by others; and the
Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> determined the contrary against Saint <hi>Thomas;</hi>
and yet all agree in this, That subjects need not obey such a prince.</p>
            <p>In this contrariety I think (<hi>salvo meliori judicio</hi>) that the best course
is, to admonish such a prince of his duty, and to pray him to reform, and
reform all that is amiss. But who shall admonish him? His best subjects,
and other princes; and if after such admonition he shall still remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible,
then may his actions, his cruelties, his tyrannies be made
known unto the world; and after this Declaration duly justified, and
truly certified to all Christian princes, it may be lawful to implore, and
employ their help and assistance for the speedy suppressing such a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and incorrigible oppressor and tyrant.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour is too weak, and the Pope will not be willing to
joyn against the Spanish King.</p>
            <p>The Emperour will be strong enough, if other princes may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to joyn with him in this honourable action; and the means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, and entreat them, hath been declared already.</p>
            <p>It resteth therefore to shew, that the pope may be brought to enter
into this action; it may be doubted that the pope will be hardly induced
to displease and offend so mighty a prince, and so faithful a friend as the
Spaniard.</p>
            <p>You have heard that <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh crossed
his father, who was alwaies mightier then he; and when they saw him
to grow to strength, they sought means to weaken him, by joyning in
league against him with divers French Kings: But to leave his late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor,
and to come to himself; Was there not a pope who in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93045:158"/>
flower of the Spanish King's youth, when he had not one foot in the
grave, as he hath now, did openly oppose himself against him? Did
he not imprison his Ambassador <hi>Garcilase de la Vega,</hi> when he was sent
unto him about matters of great weight, and of greater benefit to all
Christendom? Did he not cast <hi>Iohn Antonio</hi> his postmaster at <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prison? Did he not command that there should be no more any such
officer in <hi>Rome,</hi> which had continued there for a number of years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
How many times did he stay his Ambassadour sent out of <hi>Spain</hi>
to other princes, took away their packets, opened their letters, and read
them? Did he not oftentimes, when he meant to deceive the Spaniard,
send him Ambassadours, to entertain him with vain hopes; and when
they were half way towards <hi>Spain,</hi> revoke them, and command them
to go with the said Letters, and the same conditions, unto other princes?
Did he not in the Decree against <hi>Asconio Caciaco,</hi> declare his Catholique
Majesty to be an open and professed enemy unto the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> What
could he do more then all this unto the Turk, the common enemy of
Christendom? What have the later popes done more then all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the late French King <hi>William,</hi> for the Spaniards sake they made
their professed enemy? And why may not this pope be induced with
the report of all that hath been already said, to as much as all this against
the Spaniard, now that he declineth, that he is going to the grave; or
against his son that shall be coming into the world, and may be of more
terror unto <hi>Italy,</hi> and the rest of Christendom, then his grandfather or
his Father, because he is heir to as many Kingdoms as they were, and is
likely to succeed his father, when he shall be very young and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>I have said enough to make the Spaniard hateful and odious to all the
world, but I may not end without adding somwhat more to all that I
have said.</p>
            <p>The seditious Author inveigheth most bitterly against the French
King for his two murthers; but I have shewed, that the Spaniard hath
committed many more then two; and I must add to these murthers,
the unlawful execution of <hi>Diego de Meneses,</hi> somtimes Vice-roy of the
Indies, and the Governour of <hi>Guscabs,</hi> of <hi>Henry Perera,</hi> Captain of the
same Town, of <hi>Emanuel Seradas,</hi> of the Count <hi>de Terras Vedras,</hi> of
<hi>Peter Alpeene,</hi> and <hi>Sforza Ursino,</hi> whom he caused to be poysoned.</p>
            <p>The same Author aggravateth (as I have said) the French Kings mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de Seignior Vasc. Fign.</note>
because he killed an Ecclesiastical person; and I promised to shew
you that the Spaniard hath killed many more then one; witness Fryer
<hi>Iohn,</hi> who because he stood for the liberty of his Country, was hanged
in the Isles of <hi>Madera;</hi> witness Fryer <hi>Hector Pinto,</hi> who was poysoned
by the Souldiers of <hi>Castile;</hi> witness <hi>Iames de Moronake,</hi> who was beaten
to death with Souldiers, although he was brother to the Earl of <hi>Myra;</hi>
witness many others, who were either thrown into the Seas, or hanged,
or poysoned.</p>
            <p>The same Author burthened the late French King to be an author of
heretiques, because he did not utterly subvert the protestants in his
Realm; but I have cleared him of that accusation at large, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to tell you, that he did more against the protestants in his Realm,
then the Spaniard did in his Dominions; and he had done much more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93045:159"/>
then he did, had the Spaniard not favoured the protestants against him,
and had he not known that it was not Religion, but private quarrels,
that caused a division in his Kingdom; and this division was, as
you have heard, and shall hear, maintained and nourished by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</p>
            <p>For when the troubles began first in <hi>France,</hi> the princes of <hi>Vendosme</hi>
and <hi>Conde</hi> being displeased with the greatness of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi>
drew into their faction and side, the Houses of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
that they might be the better able, with their help, to prevent and
withstand the encrease and advancement of the late Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> his
Father, and Uncle, who had usurped and gotten into their hands, all
the authority, credit, and power of the Kingdom, during the minority
of <hi>Francis</hi> the second their Nephew; afterwards the same Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> and the Constable fall into variance, for no other cause, but for
that the first was jealour of the other, both of them being in great favour
and credit with <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>Four principal causes encreased and nourished the contention between
these two princes.</p>
            <p>The first was the office of great Master of <hi>France,</hi> which the King
gave unto the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he made the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>
Constable of <hi>France,</hi> who was great Master before, and had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the King that the office should have been reserved for his son.</p>
            <p>The second occasion of their discontentment was, the Earldom of
<hi>Dampmartin,</hi> which both of them had bought of sundry persons, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
right thereunto; and when they had sued for the same a long
time in Law, the Constable obtained the suit.</p>
            <p>The third cause of their discontentment was, because the one of
them seeking by all means possible to discredit and disgrace the other,
the Constable procured the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to be sent into <hi>Italy,</hi> that he
might in his absence possess the King wholly and alone, and when he was
there, he could not do any thing worth his labour, or worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation;
because the Constable either fore-slowed or hindred his
business: But the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> being returned out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Constable was taken prisoner at St <hi>Laurence,</hi> to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of the indignities offered whilst he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> procured that the
Constable was held a long time in prison, and used all the policies that
he could devise, to delay and defer his deliverance, the which delays
occasioned his Nephews of <hi>Chastilian</hi> to crave aid and assistance of the
late King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his brother, who had
married his Neece.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last cause of their strife and difference was, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency
between the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Iamvile,</hi> for
the office and charge of Colonel of the light Horsemen of <hi>France.</hi>
This debate and emulation being begun, and having continued a long
time debate and emulation being begun, and having continued a long
time in this manner, it hapned that the first Author thereof being dead,
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> prevailed too much in the French Court, the which
the Lords of <hi>Chastilian</hi> perceiving, to their great sorrow and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
left the Court, and in returning from thence (were it in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or in policy) began to favour the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who at that
time began to preach in cellars, and in houses secretly, and became their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93045:159"/>
friends, more to defend themselves from the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> then to
seek and procure any alteration or change of Religion, until that the
King himself at the instigation and instance of the Duke of <hi>Iamvile,</hi>
took Monsieur <hi>de Andeles</hi> at <hi>Cressy,</hi> and sent him prisoner to <hi>Molin,</hi> and
imprisoned the Videan of <hi>Chatres,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>These imprisonments and years of further mischiefs, caused the
friends and followers of the Constables, to prepare with great silence
and secrecy, a mighty Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> with which he purposed to
make an horrible execution of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> under a colour to
free the King from that bondage, wherein the late Dukes of <hi>Guise</hi> and
<hi>Aumale</hi> held him, of which followed the great execution of <hi>Amboise,</hi>
the rigorous commandment that was given to the King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and
the imprisonment of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> at the assembly of States held
at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and many other accidents, which had continued with far
greater cruelty, then was used against the Houses of the Constable, and
of <hi>Chastilian,</hi> had not the sudden death of the young King prevented
the bloody intentions of the House of <hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The unexpected death of the young King, perplexed and dejected
the House of <hi>Guise</hi> much, and surely they had been reduced unto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
desperation, had not the Spanish King revived their hope, and
put them in great comfort; who until he saw them in great extremity,
stood in doubt which part to favour most; and kindled the fire of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
on both sides, to the end it might at the length burn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<hi>France,</hi> in such manner as it did of late years.</p>
            <p>It was the Spanish King that (when the King of <hi>Navarra</hi> was made
Governour of <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, and the Constable restored to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Honour and Dignity) supported the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and gave
him such counsel, that he both won the King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
to favour him and his enterprises, against their own Brothers and
Nephews, and took the young King and his Mother at <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi>
and carried them to <hi>Melind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen-mother grieved with this captivity of the King and her
self, was sain to entreat the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Chastilian,</hi>
to help to set him and her at liberty: And then the said Prince and
Lords not being able to resist of themselves so mighty enemies as the
Guisards were, especially being aided with the power and authority
Royal, became protestants in good earnest, and declaring themselves
Protectors and Heads of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> craved their assistance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they seized upon many Cities of <hi>France,</hi> not making any mention
of their Religion, but pretending to free the King and his Mother from
that captivity wherein the House of <hi>Guise</hi> held them.</p>
            <p>It was the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who when the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was slain at
<hi>Orleans</hi> by <hi>Poltrot,</hi> practised with the Cardinal his Brother to entertain
and maintain the divisions in <hi>France,</hi> not to subvert the Lutherans, but
to weaken the Kingdom; wherein the Cardinal proceeded so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he drew the Queen-mother from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the
<hi>Chastilians,</hi> by whom she was set at liberty, by perswading that the
Prince of <hi>Burbone,</hi> the <hi>Constable,</hi> and the <hi>Chastilians</hi> sought her utter
ruine and subversion, and would never leave until they had sent her into
<hi>Italy,</hi> unto her friends there; for which she conceived so great displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93045:160"/>
and indignation against them, that she caused the one brother to be
killed at the Battel of <hi>Iarvack,</hi> and the other at the Massacre of <hi>Paris;</hi>
it is thought that if the <hi>Montmorencies</hi> had been there at the same time,
they had drunk of the same cup.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that the troubles of <hi>France</hi> grew not for Religion, but
for competency and emulation that was betwixt the House of <hi>Guise</hi> and
the <hi>Chastilians</hi> and <hi>Montmorency,</hi> then those competencies were nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spaniard for his benefit, and not to subvert the protestants,
and that the King might and would easily have reduced all his subjects
to one Religion, had not the Spaniard hindred his course; for even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his latter days, perceiving that wars were not the right and ready
means to subvert the protestants, he took another way, which was, to
forbid them to resort to the Court, or to enjoy any Offices, Dignities,
Governments or Benefices, whereby he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de the old Hugonots cold
in their Religion, and to suffer their children to become Catholiques,
that they might be admitted as well as others unto Honours, and that
very few or none that were not protestants before; fell to the open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of their Religion; which course if it were taken with both kind
of Recusants in <hi>England,</hi> would sooner call them home, then other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that are taken against them.</p>
            <p>Again, The same Author thought the French King worthy of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
because he was in his opinion disloyal, and not trusty unto his
old and ancient friends, and favoured not the House of <hi>Guise</hi> so
much as they deserved; the which crime may very well be returned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Spanish King; who when he might have pleased one of his best
friends, and one of the mightiest Kinsmen that he had, refused to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the one or the other; when the pleasure done unto them, should
greatly have benefitted all Christendom.</p>
            <p>For when as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, purposing with the aid and
assistance of certain Christian Princes, to have undertaken a sudden
enterprise against the Turk, to the benefit and augmentation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
prayed the Spaniard to have some help and succour, he not
only refused to send him any manner of help, but also would not lend
him any of his Gallies, which the Pope offered to have entertained, and
sent to that enterprize at his own charges.</p>
            <p>But this unkindness was nothing in respect of the discurtesie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
which he shewed unto Don <hi>Sebastian</hi> late King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the
which unnatural and unkinde practise all Christendom hath occasion to
lament; for when as <hi>Sebastian</hi> intending to aid <hi>Muly Mahomet</hi> King of
<hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> against <hi>Muly Malucco</hi> his brother, who had driven him
out of his Kingdom; which intention, by reason of the profitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which <hi>Sebastian</hi> had made with the said <hi>Mahomet,</hi> had greatly
advanced all Christendom, required the Spaniard (his Uncle to give
him help towards this honourable action; he promised to furnish him
with fifty Gallies well appointed, and with four thousand fighting Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
The which when <hi>Malucco</hi> heard, he offered him presently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Maritime Cities if he would not assist his Nephew; the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the covetous Spaniard accepted, and was not ashamed to forsake
his own Kinsman, and a Christian King, and entred into League with
a barbarous Infidel: But he was rewarded accordingly; for when he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93045:160"/>
sent <hi>Vernegas</hi> his Ambassadour to take possession of the City <hi>Zaracha,</hi>
and of other Towns that were promised unto him: The Barbarians
mocking him for his covetousness and disloyalty, made his Ambassador
to dislodge with cannon shot.</p>
            <p>But he forsook his Nephew (as some say) of purpose; knowing, that
for his honour, and the maintenance of his promise, Don <hi>Sebastian</hi>
would adventure himself in that enterprize, although he had not help
from the Spaniard, and so losing his life in defence of so honourable
a quarrel, leave him a great possibility to attain unto the Kingdom of
<hi>Portugal;</hi> which fell out (as you have heard) according to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The same Author concludeth the French King to deserve to
be deprived of his Crown, because he was in his opinion a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>But you shall hear the marks whereby a Tyrant is known, and then
judge whether he or the Spaniard may best be called and reputed a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bartol</hi> in his short Treatise of Tyrannie, setteth ten principal obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
to know and discern a Tyrant from a good and just King, which
he took out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> his book <hi>de Regimine Principum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Such Princes kill the mightiest men in their country, that they
may not rebel against them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They keep their doings hidden and secret from wise men,
that they may not reprehend their actions, and provoke the common
people to rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They suppress Learning, and the Students and Professors
thereof, left they should wax wise, and dislike their unlawful proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They suffer no great meetings, or general assemblies of
their Subjects, lest that they should enter into some conspiracy against
them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They have their spies in every corner and place, to hearken
and observe what men say of them; for knowing that they do not well,
they alwaies fear to be ill spoken of, and therefore they entertain those
spies very willingly.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They maintain their Subjects in Divisions, that the one part
standing in continual fear of the other, both may be afraid to rebel.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, They keep their subjects as low and poor as they can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that being continually occupied and busied in getting their livings,
they may have no time or leisure to conspire against them.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, They nourish wars, and send their souldiers afar off from
home, because that by wars their subjects are impoverished, and they
provided of sufficient souldiers to defend them in their unjust quarrels.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, They have their guards of strangers, and not of their own
subjects, because they stand in great fear of their own.</p>
            <p>Lastly, When their subjects are divided, they favour the one part,
that the other may the more easily be destroyed by their help.</p>
            <p>These be the properties which <hi>Bartol</hi> examineth in this manner; to kil
Noblemen, and not to spare his own brethren, is the action of a tyrant,
unless the murther be grounded upon a just occasion; to suppress wise
men is likewise tyrannical, except they commit some offence worthy of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93045:161"/>
death; to hinder Learning is not a work beseeming a just Prince, unless
he doth forbid the study of such Sciences as are not lawful and fit to be
entertained in a Christian Commonwealth; to permit no assemblies of
subjects, argueth tyrannical inhumanity, if their assemblies tend not to
evil purposes: to entertain spies may be lawful, if it be for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sin, and not for the suppressing or false accusation, of good and
loyal subjects; to nourish divisions can in no wise be commendable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a good Prince should procure his subjects peace, quiet, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility;
to impoverish subjects is simply most unlawful; for that the
wealth of their subjects is the riches of good Princes; and good Kings
will rather labour to enrich them, then to impoverish them; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
then to afflict them; to succour, then to leave them succourless;
to procure forraign wars for any other cause but to avoid wars at home,
is a manifest argument of a notable Tyrant; and especially if his wars
be unjust: to have a guard of strangers may be lawful, if a Princes
subjects may not be trusted, if they have been such as have been lately
subdued, if prone and ready to rebel, and if they shewed themselves
mutinous and disobedient unto good Princes: lastly, to destroy one
faction by another, is of all actions the most inhumane of all inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
because it behoveth a Prince to preserve his subjects at home and
abroad, in time of peace, and in time of wars, against open adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and secret enemies.</p>
            <p>Now if you look back upon all that hath been said, you shall easily
perceive, that all these marks may be found in the Spanish King, who
hath not spared his son, his brother, his kinsman, his nobility and peers,
whose Country hath (by the testimony of their own writers) no great
store of learned men, whose natural subjects are employed in forraign
services, whose forraign Dominions are maintained by domestical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
whose guard consisteth of Flemmings, although his Spaniards
be the most trusty and loyal subjects that he hath, whose spies are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
or else his intelligences could not be so great as they are, whose
subjects cannot be rich, because he fleeceth so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, whose wars are
unlawful, because they are begun without just occasion, continued with
iniquity, and performed with barbarous cruelty; briefly, whose studies,
endeavours, and purposes, tend to no other end, but to weaken all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes, that he may tyrannize without comptrolment, and make
himself or successors monarchs of the whole world without resistance.</p>
            <p>Then to conclude this Treatise, which is added only to give some
light to the precedent matter. If it be perjury to break an oath willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sacriledge to murther, not only one, but many Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
unjustly, hypocrisie to dissemble with friends cunningly, tyrannie
to affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct subjects wrongfully, impiety to betray Christians unto Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
wilfully, and to murther, kill, and massacre subjects unlawfully,
I may more justly conclude then the French seditious author did against
the late French King, that the Spanish monarch may be lawfully excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
and deposed, because all these crimes concur in him together,
and that no wars of what nature soever, can be held unjust and unlawful,
that shall be enterprised and exercised against him, so long as he shall
continue to be as he is, the common and only perturber of Christian
peace and tranquility.</p>
