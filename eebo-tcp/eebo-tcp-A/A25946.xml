            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with much convenience, caſe to the beholder,
and truth of obſervation, things are preſented to our
Eyes in thoſe little Draughts, that the very places
themſelves being viewed with great Trouble and loſs
of Time, cannot yeeld more benefit to the moſt diligent, oftentimes
not ſo much. Wherefore eſpecially, becauſe the Argument cannot be
now unſeaſonable (for the abridgment of the Commentaries of large
Hiſtories, is not unlike Maps of Kingdoms) I have here collected out
of divers Authors, which have ſeverally handled parts of this ſubject,
into one, The chief Conſpiracies and Attempts againſt the Kingdoms
alone, and immediately of great <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elſe mediately
through the ſides of the Princes of theſe Countries, by Traytors at home
or abroad, of the Romiſh Religion, or foraign Enemies, by treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
courſes of thoſe of the ſame bloody ſuperſtition. The beginning I
make the firſt-time of Reformation of Religion here in <hi>England</hi> under
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the extent unto this preſent Year. I begin no
higher than Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> becauſe the Reformation of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight was but in part, and the other of King <hi>Edward,</hi> was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
one, by the ſudden ſucceſſion of his Siſter Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> the
rather, becauſe, for ought we know, there was no great matter plotted
againſt this hopeful young Prince, that was not rather from Ambition,
(if there was any ſuch) than from a deſire of ſubverting Religion. Not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40749:3"/>
but that the Enemies of our Religion and Kingdom, had us then in
their Minds, but other ways there were, before bloody and deſperate Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
were to be taken in hand, to be firſt entred into, of leſs difficulty,
and more hopeful ſucceſs. And theſe are the ſteps the Adverſaries of our
Religion uſe to tread, who thirſting after <hi>England,</hi> labour firſt to bring
us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſtriving to make our ſelves hate our own Religion,
and leave that God which brought us out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
us with glorious Idolatry of the golden Calves of <hi>Rome,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Ignorance and Blindneſs, that we may when our Eyes are out,
patiently grind in the Mill of Slavery. If this courſe fail, the next
is by Poyſon, Murdes, and force of Arms, to draw us to <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reformation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> fall under one time, and
becauſe that of <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo differeth not many years in age, they may
all be brought in one account. With the Plots are jointly handled the
Deliverances, which in ſome reſpect or other may very well be called
great, either in regard of the Miſery we had fallen into, (if God had
not prevented them) of the ſlavery of Soul and Body, and this agreeth
with all: Or elſe for the ſtrangeneſs of the diſcoveries of their miſchiefs,
(ſometime almoſt miraculous) before they have come to their birth, or
diſappointing them of their purpoſes, when the Authors have put them
in practiſe; and theſe two reſpects, the one or the other, which may
well denominate God's goodneſs to us, in diſappointing them to be
great, may be found in all likewiſe. So that for theſe Mercies received,
we ought to aſcribe to our Deliverer that which is due unto him, the
praiſe of his own Work, and continual thanks for his Mercies, which
even to this day, is from thoſe Deliverances of the days of old, extended;
we ſhould have bin then betrayed, but we had now bin Slaves, both we,
our ſelves and ours; one Plot, had it ſucceded, had bin the betraying
of <hi>England</hi> at once to them, who love themſelves too well to have it
loſt eaſily, and are ſo wiſe, that they endure no Traitors, but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor can endure any that loves his Country but a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> We
may learn alſo to truſt in him, even now particularly, <hi>who is the ſame
yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> nor is his hand ſhortned that he cannot
ſave, nor his Ear heavy that he cannot hear thoſe that call upon him, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up pure Hands in ſincerity of Heart: although the Sins of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in general, may juſtly provoke our God to puniſh us by them that
hate us, for that cauſe, that inſtead of extirpating Popery and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
(a thing not hard to be done in human Reaſon, if the Children
of Papiſts were carefully educated under Proteſtant Tutors) we think
their Religion tolerable, and nothing ſo dangerous to Soul or Body as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40749:3"/>
ſome Men ſeem to make it. Should we not deteſt and abhor the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch a Generation, as count they do God good ſervice by killing
us? witneſs the bloody Perſecution under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Plot of the Gun-Powder Treaſon. Yet ſome there are that would
ſeem Proteſtants, and yet deny that their cruelty was ſuch, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Engliſh Martyrology makes the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution to be.
Others of no ſmall eſteem in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<hi>Foxes</hi> Hiſtory a Monument of Martyrs, call it a Book fraught
with Traitors and Hereticks. And for the Gun-Pouder Conſpiracy,
ſome affirm it the deeds of a few Male-Contents, far from the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Catholicks; others as falſly, that there was no ſuch Treaſon
intended, but that it was an invention of him, whom in reverence I
forbear to name. But yet this may incourage us, that God will ſtill
preſerve us, for their ſakes that have now and heretofore ſtoutly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God's true Religion, and that in very many places of this Land, we
have had thoſe that with all their power have oppoſed the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Popery. But wonderful it is, and ſcarcely credible, that any
ſhould ſo much have forgotten the Gun-Powder Treaſon, as to ſay,
that they would rather truſt a Papiſt than a Puritan; as if they believed
not there was any ſuch Treaſon, or had forgotten it; or that they
thought that thoſe whom Men call Puritans, were traiterouſly minded,
and bloody Perſons. In the moſt Reverend and Judicious Aſſembly of
this Kingdom, a Member of that Aſſembly, declared in particulars, how
the beſt Men have bin branded with the name of Puritan, (it was where
any Man might freely have ſpoken) yet no Man contradicted him. If
it be given ſometime to the beſt, without queſtion thoſe ordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by that bie-name, are none of the worſt; becauſe from likeneſs at
leaſt divers Men have one Name. We will acknowledg Hypocrites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, but becauſe one is ſuch, no Man will conclude they muſt
be all ſo. No Man of us almoſt abhorreth the Name of Proteſtant to
be given him, and yet of theſe, ſome will Lie, others will Steal, and a
third ſort will do worſe. Since this Parliament (perhaps I imagine the
time, and reaſon aright) the Jeſuites and Jeſuited have invented a ſtrange
Name for ſuch Men, and let fall the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

by a figurative Name, which is ignorantly ſpoken by moſt, falſly by all;
and as the roundeſt Figure is of the largeſt Capacity, ſo they have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

appear by the inclination of <hi>Sebaſtian Martigius</hi> ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
the counſel of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> (for about thoſe times their alone Counſels
were principally followed) with Horſe and Foot, to aſſiſt in the Civil
War of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who could hardly be reſtrained from invading <hi>England</hi>
preſently, and firſt of all, preſuming (no queſtion) on the aid of Papiſts
in <hi>England,</hi> from intelligence held with them here. For otherwiſe
what could 1000 Horſe, and not very many Foot do in reſpect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
all <hi>England?</hi> Now was the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Regency of <hi>Scotland</hi> was put into the hands of the Marquiſs
of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> yet the power of the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> with her <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
did ſo increaſe, and on the other ſide the authority of the Marquiſs
Regent ſo abate, that after the promiſe from the <hi>French</hi> King of 12000
Crowns by the Year, and Dutchy of <hi>Caſtle-Herald,</hi> to which was added
the preferment of all the Marquiſs's chief kindred, the Marquiſs reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his place into the hands of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Queen <hi>Dowager;</hi> a thing
for a Woman to be Regent in <hi>Scotland</hi> but once before known. She
had made many promiſes unto the <hi>Scots</hi> of the freedom of exerciſing the
Proteſtant Religion, but being now ſetled in the Regency, ſhe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her mind wholly bent to alter Religion. She told her Friends in
plain terms, that though the Miniſters whom ſhe named ſhould preach
more honeſtly, or (as ſhe called it) more ſincerely than they had done;
yet they ſhould all be baniſhed. She expreſſed at the death of a young
Man, whom ſhe ſeemed to bewail, being ſlain, for that his Father had
not rather excuſed him, being a ſtout defender of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſhe was cruelly minded towards the Profeſſors thereof. <hi>Eaſter</hi>
alſo was commanded to be celebrated after the Romiſh Cuſtom. For
theſe and divers other of her overtures, Meſſengers were ſent unto her,
to deſire her to be good to the Proteſtants, and to remember the many
Promiſes ſhe had made unto them to that end. But all in vain. She
told the Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Campbel,</hi> who were ſent unto
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40749:5"/>
her; That performance of Promiſes was to be expected from Princes, no
farther than ſtood with their profit. Upon this they told one another
that they then renounced all Obedience and Duty toward her. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
now with Art was to be uſed for effecting her Purpoſe touching
Religion.</p>
               <p>Hereupon advice was given by <hi>Labroſſe</hi> a French Commander in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to put to death all the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that the People
being bereaved of their Heads, would after be eaſily brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
any Yoak; but that things might appear with a more pleaſing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
there was a ſhew, as if the Queen had laboured, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to convince her Adverſaries in Religion, by no other way, but
by Arguments. Into <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſent three <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors with the
Biſhop of <hi>Amiens.</hi> But with what ſafety might any Man diſpute with
them, when he that did ſo was in the midſt of his armed Enemies, and
there was greateſt fear of violence from the Diſputers themſelves. For
the Biſhop of <hi>Amiens</hi> counſelled the Queen Regent, that if any there
were which ſhould be found to diſpute againſt the Romiſh Decrees, he
ſhould be put to death, yea even thoſe who but ſeemed to be of another
Mind only. We are not informed that the Queen Regent put in practice
the foregoing counſels, perhaps the time was not altogether ſeaſonable,
nor do we take every ſingle action, which might conduce to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of Religion, to be a Conſpiracy: but we may well eſteem by
the Queens Words, the Councellors and Commanders Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
the placing of ſuch a Regent, all this to be a continued Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
to ſtrangle in the birth the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having yet ſcarcely
taken breath in the World. Not long after the Queen Regent dyeth, and
although it will perhaps be ſaid, there was no diſcovery of any Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
which was in acting (as to put to death all the Nobility, or all that
would dare diſpute againſt the Biſhop or Doctors, could be no eaſy task
to go about; the latter, becauſe the death of their laſt Martyr <hi>Walter
Mille</hi> did ſeem ſo grevious unto them, and if any more ſhould ſuffer, how
would ſuch a thing be taken by <hi>French-men,</hi> People of another Nation?)
It may be objected from the above named Arguments, that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no endeavour. After the death of the Mother, the Daughter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was married unto <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> who
being of the ſame Religion with the Queen, and they both a Brothers
and Siſters Children, did ſtrongly maintain Popery, againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion. We cannot imagine here that any thing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
againſt the lives of thoſe Princes by a Popiſh Party to overthrow
Religion. For, to ſubvert Religion, no way could be found better, than
by maintaining in life and honour ſuch Princes as theſe two were, who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40749:5"/>
profeſſed and maintained Popery; as contrarily to ſubvert Religion,
Laws, Liberties and the like, the beſt means are through the ſides of
ſuch Kings and Queens as are Projectors and Maintainers of them. So
the holy Scripture declareth by Word and Example, <hi>I will ſmite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
and the Sheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> For this Queen was ſo far from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the eſtabliſhment of Religion, nay from connivence at thoſe who
ſhould go about any ſuch matter, that ſhe profeſſed ſhe would follow
the example of her Couſin, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was no other
thing than maintaining in her Dominions the Pope and Popery, and
puniſhing the contrary minded as Hereticks. It will not be thought
(I ſuppoſe) that either the Papiſts at home in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or thoſe in
<hi>France,</hi> or elſewhere, would go about to take away the lives of ſuch
Princes, whoſe lives ſecured their Religion. For what was attempted
againſt the Life (and moſt unhappily ſucceeded) of the King, was not
any way to ſubvert Popery; becauſe the deed was committed, and the
Plot chiefly laid by Papiſts. It rather was undertaken againſt the Life
of this Prince, by ſome, to make way for their own Family to inherit
the Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> by others, to get the Kingdom, and admit
any Religion. But thoſe that look farther into Matters, judg this act to
be committed againſt a Profeſſor of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, that he being
taken out of the way, another might ſucceed, which had greater Power
and Friends to bring to paſs, what King <hi>Henry</hi> the Queens Husband,
had a Mind, but not Power enough to do. And that made thoſe who
were no Enemies to the King in point of Religion, not diſlike the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for the Ends ſake. I cannot be of their Minds altogether, who judg
that of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> being now in reſtraint in <hi>England,</hi> not long
before married to Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and preſently to deſire a Devorce from
him, and to require that he ſhould be ſummoned within the ſpace of a
very few days, to return into the Kingdom, to make anſwer and defence
to the Queens Suit of Divorce, to have proceeded from the changing
Fancy of the Queen, not ſo much from Conſcience. For it was as well
known before her departure into <hi>England,</hi> as after, that Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi>
had a Wife living when he married the Queen; inſomuch that at the
publiſhing the banes of their Matrimony, one ſtood up in the Church
and forbad them. It was generally thought that it was, that a way might
be open for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who then made Suit unto her. He
indeed was ſuch a Man, as being of great Wealth, mighty in Friends,
and ſingular Abilities of Mind, could better bring about what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
than a Man of no great riches at any time, but was now in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Poverty and Diſgrace in the Dominions of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and notoriouſly infamous for his Crimes in <hi>Sctoland.</hi>

               <p>AT this time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> wrote unto the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to

               <p>Nevertheleſs, whether by the advice of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſt,</hi> who lay

going in the appearance of a Merchant Factor, or purpoſing of

Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (ſhe being next Heir to the Crown of <hi>England)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Promiſe made unto his Sovereign Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> and the Duke participate of one anothers Mind, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
written in hidden Characters. Neither was this a matter only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
but the Dukes Secretary, one <hi>Higford,</hi> who was commanded by
the Duke to burn ſuch Letters as came from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but did
it not, and hid them under a Mat in his Chamber, and being under
examination, he cauſed them to be produced. This was when the two
Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> had ſecretly complotted to
raiſe Arms, and not long after the Dukes apprehenſion, they fell into
open Rebellion. One of the Letters which was ſhewn at the Dukes
arraignment was to this purpoſe: That the Queen was ſorry that the
ſaid Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> were in Arms, before the
Dukes Forces were ready. This was undertaken after that Pope <hi>Pius
Quintus</hi> had in Bulls from <hi>Rome</hi> printed, and ſent to <hi>Rodolf,</hi> abſolved
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Subjects from their Allegiance. The Pope perſwaded
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to aſſiſt the Conſpirators, that his affairs in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
might proſper the better: and the <hi>French</hi> did the like, that the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> might be leſs able to ſend aid to the Proteſtants in <hi>France.
Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> having thus taken Arms, Supplies and
Moneys failing, withdrew themſelves into <hi>Scotland, Norfolk</hi> was thrown
into Priſon. <hi>Rodulf</hi> being in Cuſtody, for whom the Pope had appointed
150000 Crowns to help the Conſpirators, was for want of clear proof
diſmiſſed. <hi>Rodolf</hi> being got out of Priſon, afterward diſtributeth
the 150000 Crowns to the Partners in the Treaſon. He being with
the Pope, is ſent by him to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to preſs him to give aſſiſtance
to the King of <hi>Protugal</hi> alſo for the ſame purpoſe, He wrote alſo
to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> promiſing to ſend him aid. The Popes Letter
to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was, That he ſhould ſend an Army out of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40749:6"/>
to invade <hi>England.</hi> And this very thing the <hi>Spaniard</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
               <p>There was now a difference betwixt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
about Money ſent by him to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> but was intercepted
by the Queen, and that was one pretence that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had, for his
dealing agianſt our Queen and Kingdom. But the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was
put to death. Nor is this the Relation of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Protenſtant, but of

<hi>Hieronimus Calena.</hi> The Book was printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the priviledg

number of all ſorts of Men (out of common charity, and to ſhew

And what have been their practices from time to time, but to

ſhews openly the fruit of their malice and miſchievous plots of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which they impiouſly and audaciouſly call and count nothing elſe
but advancing of their Catholick Cauſe. Now the <hi>Scots</hi> -Queen (led

<hi>Spaniards,</hi> by <hi>Sir Francis Englefield,</hi> that by all means they would
with ſpeed undertake their intended Buſineſs, namely, the Invaſion of
our Realm. For the advancing whereof, the Pope and <hi>Spanidrd</hi> had
reſolved on theſe points.</p>
               <p>1. That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhould be deprived of her Kingdom.</p>
               <p>2. That the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> a manifeſt favourer of Hereſie, ſhould
utterly be diſ-inherited of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>3. That the <hi>Scots-</hi> Queen ſhould Marry ſome Noble-Man of <hi>England</hi>
that was a Catholick.</p>
               <p>4. That this Man muſt be choſen King of <hi>England</hi> by the Catholicks

               </p>

               <p>All theſe things were confirmed to be true, by the teſtimoney of one

The Parliament was diſſolved the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> which the King

with <hi>Winter</hi> about blowing up the Parliament Houſe. <hi>Winter</hi> told him
that it ſtruck at the root, but what if it ſhould not take effect? <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
won <hi>Winter</hi> to conſent, but firſt (ſaid be) go over and win the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
to obtain more favour for Catholicks; and if you may bring over
ſome confident Gentlemen, as Mr. <hi>Faux. Winter</hi> went, met with
the Conſtable at <hi>Bergen,</hi> and delivered his Meſſage. The Conſtable
anſwered, that his Maſter commanded him to do all good offices for
the Catholicks; but he ſhewed the Conſtable nothing of the matter.
<hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> came both into <hi>England.</hi> This plot of blowing up
the Parliament Houſe, after an Oath of Secreoy, and the Sacrament
received upon it, <hi>Catesby</hi> diſcloſed it to <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Wright</hi>
to <hi>Faux. Percy</hi> hired the Houſe, <hi>Faxn</hi> was pretended to be <hi>Percy's</hi>

<hi>Percy,</hi> to keep the Powder and Wood for the Mine, to which it was
to be conveyed. When the Plot had taken effect, what ſhould they
do? <hi>Percy,</hi> with two or three of them, with a dozen more, would
ſeize on the Duke, and carry him away. The Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was

ſave from the Parliament, firſt Catholicks, then ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
While they wrought in the Mine, they fed on baked Meats,
that they might not go forth. At Candlemas the Powder is brought
over, about which time working in the Mine, they came againſt a
Stone-wall, when hearing a ruſhing noiſe of Coals, they ſeared
they were diſcovered; But it was only the moving of Coals to
be ſold, which Celler <hi>Faux</hi> hired: 20 Barrels of Powder they had
provided, which they hid with Billets and Fagots. <hi>Faux</hi> went into
<hi>Flanders</hi> to acquaint therewith <hi>Stanley</hi> and <hi>Owen; Stanley</hi> was not
there; <hi>Owen</hi> approved it. <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi> met at the <hi>Bath;</hi> and it
was agreed, that <hi>Catesby</hi> ſhould call in whom he thought beſt. The
number being ſmall, He called in Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> and afterward
Mr. <hi>Treſham.</hi> The Parliament was a-new prorogued till the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of

(which was on Thurſday) a Letter in the Street was delivered to the
Lord <hi>Mounteagle's</hi> Man, to put it into his Maſters Hand. It had neither
Date nor Superſcription, and by the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> was that Night

Roaring) out Excommunications againſt any that ſhould refuſo
ſo to joyn with them therein, terming themſelves the Catholick-Army,

and ſo conſequently not the leaſt ſpark or glimpſe of Goſpel and pure

who had all privately conveyed and ſheltered themſelves in ſeveral

they made themſelves in their own conceits, and moſt bold and bloody

Treachery and Rebellion, they added moſt execrable expreſſions of
unheard of hatred and inhumane Barbarity to the Subjects of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Nation;</hi> Baniſhment, or perpetual Slavery were the greateſt favours
that would have been afforded them, their general profeſſion being for
a general Extirpation, even to the laſt and leaſt drop of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-blood

of rage and unpattern'd wrath and malignity, not ſo much as an

Kingdom. And as the Hearts and Tongues of theſe moſt baſe and

in Intention and Profeſſion: So it pleaſed the Lord for the Sins of his

People there, to permit power unto theſe Harbarous Rebels, to act with

to be clothed again; breaking into Churches, burning Pulpits, with
extream hatred to our Religion, and exceedingly triumphing in all

of their Heads through the Streets into the Churches, and there Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and Whipping them, and with moſt cruel and taunting Terms
abuſing them; telling them if they came to Morrow, they ſhould
hear the like Sermon. Yea, ſo exceſſively impious was their hatred
to the Goſpel of Chriſt, that they took the Sacred Books of the holy
Scriptures, and caſt them into Kennels and Puddles of Dirt and Mire,
treading them under foot, and Leaping and Skipping on them, and
(O horrid Impiety!) cauſing a Bagpipe to play all the while, and
bidding a Plague upon them; ſaying, they were the cauſe of all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels;
and Burning ſome, and ſaying it was Hell, fire that was then

Ancient or Modern Relations: Witneſs their ſtripping ſtark naked,
Men, Women, and Children, even Children ſucking their poor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Breſts; whereby multitudes of all ſorts, Ages, and Sexes, in the
extremities of that oold ſeaſon of Froſt and Snow, have moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably

in Child-bed, drawn out thence and caſt into Priſon; one delivered of
a Child, while ſhe was hanging; one ripped up <hi>(horeſco referens)</hi> and
two Children taken out of her, and all caſt and eaten up by Swine.
One ſtabb'd in the Breſt, her Child ſucking. An Infant cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
whom they found ſucking his dead Mother, ſlain by them the
day before. A Child of fourteen years of Age taken from his Mother,
in her ſight caſt into a Bog-pit, and held under-water while he was
drowned. Together with many other yet more horrible, hideous, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40749:18"/>
more than Savage or Beaſt-like Barharities, too terrible for me any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to reliſe, but may be more fully found in that moſt lamentable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
of this <hi>Iriſh Rebellion,</hi> and all there proved by Teſtimonies
on Oath, whereunto I refer the Reader. Which makes me call to

<hi>That no poiſonous Serpent will live on Iriſh ground;</hi> which how true in the
Hiſtorical meaning, I know not; but now I am ſure, 'tis moſt falſe

ſeed, a brood of moſt poiſonous Native Serpents, Adders and Snakes
of Villany and Cruelty do live, yea, and thrive there alſo; but I truſt,
but for a ſeaſon: for certainly, the Lord, the moſt righteous Judg of
all Men, and ſevere Revenger of all Wrongs, will not ſuffer ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Impieties and unpattern'd Cruelties to go unpuniſhed, but will

by a native <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Owen Mack-Connel,</hi> once
Servant to that pious and moſt worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi>
and this alſo by a moſt remarkable way and work of the Lord's ſpecial
Providence, as is more particularly and punctually related in the
Preamble of <hi>Irelands Tears,</hi> to which I refer the Reader. And
ſecondly, By the Lord's moſt Glorious and Victorious over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the out-ragious Power and Petulancy of thoſe barbarous
Miſcreants, now in open Rebellion, by the hands of a very ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

chiefly began to be cruelly acted and executed on God's innocent Lambs,
marked out to the ſlaughter before-hand. And thus it was in brief.</p>
               <p>In the years 1571, and 72, <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th then King of <hi>France;</hi> the
ſaid King, the then Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and others of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction,
bearing a moſt inveterate hatred (which was craſtily concealed) againſt
thoſe of the Religion, and in eſpecial againſt the then moſt renowned
Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Piety, Prudence, and Proweſs was ſuch and
in ſo high eſteem of all, both Friends and Foes alſo, that whilſt he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
and ſurvived, the Popiſh party (maugre their malice) could do
nothing, to any purpoſe, to the prejudice of the Cauſe of Religion. At
laſt a Plot was laid moſt craftily and cruelly, under the pretence of a
Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a Noble and Pious Prince of
the Religion, and the King's Siſter; by which ſnare to bring the ſaid
Prince, the Admiral, and the reſt of the Heads of Religion, to the
Court and City of <hi>Paris,</hi> that ſo theſe Heads being firſt ſmiten off, the
inferiour Members thereof might the more eaſily be deſtroyed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this colour, I ſay, the King invites the Admiral to the Court at
<hi>Paris,</hi> pretends a fair Correſpondence and Agreement of all matters
in Difference betwixt his Majeſty and thoſe of the Religion, eſpecially
himſelf and the Admiral, and a Reconcilement alſo between this noble
Admiral and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> In which interim, one <hi>Lignerolles,</hi>
a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, was openly ſlain in the Court, for diſcovering
ſome ſecrets concerning this Plot againſt thoſe of the Religion, and
the Cardinal of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> (then in <hi>England,</hi> and ready to depart
thence for <hi>France)</hi> Brother to the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> was poiſoned
by one of the Chamberlains, and died thereof, to the great grief of
all his Friends and Servants.</p>
               <p>The moſt Noble and Religious Admiral on the King's Invitation,
comes to <hi>Paris,</hi> was (with extraordinary fair ſhows of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40749:19"/>
reſpect) moſt welcomely entertained, both he and divers others of
the Religion that came with him. The foreſaid Marriage was not long
after Solemnized in <hi>Paris,</hi> with great pretences of joy and content on all
ſides expreſſed, in moſt ſumptuous and liberal Feaſts and Banquets, Masks
and Dances (the ſweet innocent Princes, little dreaming of ſuch a
Dance to be now a leading by the King, Queen-Mother, and Duke of
<hi>Guiſe,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> bloody Faction, as ſtain'd, nay
ſteep'd all their dainties in ſtreams of their Hearts-blood) in ſo much
as 'twas admired to ſee ſuch a ſeeming friendly mixture of thoſe of the
Religion with the <hi>Romiſh Catholicks,</hi> juſt like ſo many Lambs among
ſo many greedy Wolves. Now whilſt every one imployed himſelf in
ſuch like Mirth and Jollity, divers that were ſent for by the King, Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mother,
and Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that ſo they might be ſure to be the
ſtronger party, ſpèedily arrived in <hi>Paris;</hi> the Cataſtrophe of all that
follows having been made not long before among them, the Dukes of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> being the principal Actors openly ſeen in this wicked
Work, who reſolved not to let the Admiral depart out of <hi>Paris,</hi> but
there to diſpatch him, and all ſuch as ſhould endeavour to defend him.
Now it ſo fell out, that one Morning the Admiral coming out of the
<hi>Loutre,</hi> and going to Dine at his Lodging, being on foot, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaſt ſuſpicion of any Villany to be attempted againſt him) as he
was reading a Petition, one ſhot at him with a Harquebuſs, the Bullet
whereof took away the Fore-finger of his Right-hand, and hurt him
in the left Arm; the Villain that ſhot eſcaped by flight, a Horſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to poſt him away after he had done the deed. The noble
Admiral being thereupon brought to his Lodging, ſhewed mòſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Piety, Conſtancy, and Patience, under his Surgeons hands, was
viſited by divers Lords and Gentlemen of the Religion, the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> (now the King of <hi>France</hi> his Brother in-Law) and the Prince
of <hi>Conde.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King alſo, though a main Plotter in the work,
craftily complained to theſe Princes, of the Miſchief thus happened,
proteſting his ſorrow, and ſwearing revenge and ſevere execution of
Juſtice on the Offender, whoſoever he were.</p>
               <p>The King himſelf alſo went to viſit the Admiral, making many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and deep proteſtations of his high eſteem of his loyalty and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to his Perſon and Crown always, and that he held and eſteèmed
him a moſt diſcret and valiant Commander in Arms, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he much reſpected him, with many ſuch like <hi>French</hi> Complements.
Immediately after the King's departure, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> were certainly, but very ſecretly enformed of the
intended Maſſacre on all of the Religion, and adviſed as ſpeedily as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40749:19"/>
they could to get out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to be aſſured that that blow given
to the Admiral, was but the beginning of the Tragedy; but alas, good
Princes, they ſo much confided on the King's Vows and Promiſes, that
they reject this Adviſe and Counſel, and ſtaied there ſtill. About <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>-evening,
being the 23d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1572. certain Proteſtant
Gentlemen, offered themſelves to watch that Night with the good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
but <hi>Teligny</hi> his Son-in-Law would not ſuffer them, but diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them with many thanks, little ſuſpecting (ſtill) any approaching
or precipitating danger on his Father. Night being come on, the Duke
of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Lieutenant in this Action, which now at this preſent was
to be declared to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ſent for all the Captains of the
<hi>Switzers,</hi> and companies of Strangers (which ſtill increaſed) into the
Town; ſhewing them his Commiſſion to kill the Admiral, and all his
partakers; exhorting them to be couragious in ſhedding of Blood,
and making Spoil of them; and appointed their Troops to be placed
where he thought meeteſt. About Midnight it was informed to all the
Popiſh Aſſemblies in the Town, That the like to this Maſſacre ſhould be
done to all of the Religion throughout the whole Realm; and that the
Watch-word of the general Maſſacre ſhould be the great Bell of the
Palace, which ſhould be rung at the break of Day, and the Badg of the
Executioners ſhould be a white Handkerchief tied upon their ſleeves, and
a white Croſs in their Hats. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> with his bloody-minded
Aſſociates, had charge to begin at the Admiral's Lodgings. The mighty
noiſe of Armour, and running up and down with very many lighted
Torches, ſoon after Midnight, made many of thoſe of the Religion,
that were longed near the Admiral, to come out of their Lodgings and
to go into the Street to enquire of their Acquaintances, what this
noiſe meant at ſuch an undue Hour, but being anxiouſly anſwered,
they went on ſtill toward the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his
bloody Comrades were attending the deed, where thoſe innocent Lambs
of the Religion were firſt ſet upon, and aſſaulted by the Duke's guard.
Then preſently they rang St. <hi>Germaines</hi> Bell in the Palace, whereupon
one <hi>Coſſeins,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Fury, perceiving the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> coming with
his Troops, knocks at the Admirals Gate, between two and three of the
Clock in the Morning, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the 24th of <hi>Auguſt, 1572. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
one of the Admiral's attendants, opens the Gate, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſtabb'd by <hi>Coſſeins;</hi> the ſecond Door going up the Stairs, being
ſoon burſt open, they came to the Admiral's Chamber, where his own
Guard of <hi>Switzers</hi> were, one of them was ſlain with an Harquebuſs.
And while <hi>Coſſeins</hi> was jumbling at the Chamber-door, one <hi>Cornatan</hi>
ran up into the Chamber, and being asked by the Admiral (who had
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40749:20"/>
cauſed his Men to life him out of his Bed, and in his Night gown,
having aſſiſted his Miniſters in ſervent Prayer, and moſt humbly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Soul to his Saviour Chriſt Jeſus) what all this hurly burly
meant: <hi>Cornatan,</hi> his Servant, anſwered, My Lord, It is God that
calls for us, the Houſe is entred by force, and there is no means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
The good Admiral, then, replied, <hi>It is not long ſince I diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
my ſelf to Die; ſave you your ſelves, if it be peſſible, for you cannot
ſave my Life, and thorefore I commit my Soul into the Hands and Mercy
of God.</hi> Preſently hereupon his Attendants began to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to flie for their Lives, and ſome of them got up into the
top of the Houſe, and found a Window to iſſue out of the Rooſ and
ſo into Gutters; but moſt of them were ſlain in the next Houſes; but
<hi>Cornatan,</hi> and <hi>Merlin,</hi> a godly Miniſter, eſcaped, and were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
preſerved. The Admiral's Chamber-door being now opened,
ſeven or eight Armed Mem with their Targets entred into it, and one
<hi>Beſmes,</hi> Servant to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with a naked Sword in his
hand, offered him the point: Whereupon the good Admiral, ſaid unto
him, <hi>Young man, thou oughtſt to reſpect my Age and Inſirmity, yet ſhalt
thou not ſhorten my life.</hi> With that, <hi>Beſmes</hi> thruſt his Sword into the
Admiral's Body, and redoubling the blow upon the Admiral's Head,
every one of the reſt alſo gave him a blow, in ſuch ſort, that he ſell
upon the Ground, and ſo lay gaſping. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and others,
ſtaying below in the Court and hearing the blows, asked if they had
done, and commanded the Body to be thrown out of the Window;
which was preſently done by that villain <hi>Beſmes,</hi> and his companions.
Now the blows that he had on his Head, and the Blood covering his
Face, had ſo disfigured him, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> hardly knew him;
whereupon ſtooping down and wiping his Face with his Hankerchief,
he ſaid, Now I know him, it is he indeed; and therewith gave him a
kick with his foot on his Face being dead; whom all the Murtherers of
<hi>France</hi> extreamly feared being alive. Which done, he left the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Houſe, accompanied with his moſt bloody Train, and began
to cry about the Streets: Courage, fellow Souldiers, we have made
a good beginning, let us now to the reſt, for the King commandeth it.
Repearing thoſe words oft, with great majeſty, For the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
it, it is his pleaſure, it is his expreſs commandment. (Juſt
as our Romiſh Clergy in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre in the Year 1641, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the King's Authority for their Rebellion, laying all the <hi>Odium</hi>
of their impious Villanies and Cruelties on the King's Majeſty, ſaying
ſtill, 'twas his pleaſure it ſhould be ſo.) Now preſently thereupon the
Palace Clock ſtruck, and then a Noiſe was heard all about the Streets of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40749:20"/>
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaying that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> (for ſo the Romiſh Catholicks term
the true Proteſtants in <hi>France)</hi> were in Arms (they being all, alas, in
their Beds, far from any ſuch thoughts) and meant to kill the King;
(juſt as our Powder Traitors intended had their Plot taken effect, to
have ſtandered the Puritans in <hi>England,</hi> to have been the
Authors of that helliſh-Treaſon) to whom the Admirals
Head was carried and preſented,<note place="margin">See here the Holineſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and zeal of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi>
                  </note> and to the Queen-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>France,</hi> and then imbalmed and ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to
the Pope and Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Common-people
(like Prieſt, like People) ran to the Admirals Lodging,
where they cut off his Hands and his privy Members, and
drew his Body for the ſpace of three days about the Town; which done,
it was born to the Gibbet of <hi>Monifaucon</hi> and there hanged by the Feet.
The Gentlemen Officers of the Chamber, Governours, Tutors and
houſhold Servants of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the French King's Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Law, lately married to his Siſter, and of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> were
driven out of their Chambers, where they ſlept in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and forced
into the Court, were there maſſacred in the Kings own preſence. The like
was done to the Lords and Gentlemen that lay round about the Admirals
Lodgings, and then throughout the Town in ſuch ſort, that the number
ſlain that Sunday at Night and the two next Days enſuing, within the
City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Suburbs thereof, was eſteemed to be above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Perſons, Lords, Gentlemen, Pages, Servants, Juſtices of all ſorts,
Schollars, Lawyers, Merchants, Artificers, Women, Maids, and Boys,
not ſparing little Children in their Cradles, no nor in their Mothers Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
The Courtiers of the Kings Guard and Strangers that maſſacred
theſe Gentlemen, ſaid, that in one day, by Weapons and diſorder they had
ended thoſe Proceſſes, which Pen, Paper, Sentences of Juſtice nor open
War could not find the means to do or execute in 12 years ſpace. And
thus theſe moſt honourable Proteſtant Lords and Gentlemen, falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
and ſtandered of Conſpiracies and Practices againſt the King, being
ſtark naked, thinking only upon their reſt, ſcarce awakened out of their
Sleep, utterly unarmed, in the hands of infinite, crud, crafty and moſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Enemies not having ſo much leaſure as to breath, were barbarouſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſlain, ſome in their Beds, others on the roofs of Houſes, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
other places, where they might be found. It would be too tedious
to recite at large the Names and Sirnames of all the honourable Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of divers Qualities that were then ſlain and butchered, it ſufficeth
that their Names are written in Heaven and that their Death (though
ſhameful and deſpicable in the ſight and preſence of Men of this World)
is precious in the ſight of the Lords moſt holy Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40749:21"/>
Now let the tender hearted Chriſtian Reader, but conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his Heart, how ſtrange and horrible a thing it might be in a great
Town or City, to ſee at the leaſt 60000 Men with Piſtols, Pikes,
Courtlaſſes, Ponyards, Knives and other ſuch bloody Inſtruments, run
ſwearing and blaſpheming the ſacred Majeſty of God throughout the
Streets, and into Mens Houſes, where moſt cruelly they maſſacred all
whomſoever of the Religion they met, without regard of Eſtate, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Sex or Age, the Streets paved with Bodies cut and hewed in
pieces, the Gates and Entries of Houſes, Palaces and publick places died
with Blood. A horrible Plague of ſhoutings and howlings of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
mixed with continual noiſe of Piſtols and Calivers, together
with the pittiful cries of thoſe that were murthered, the Bodies caſt out
at Windows upon the Stones, drawn through the Dirt with ſtrange
noiſe and Whiſtlings, the breaking open of Doors and Windows with
Bils, Stones and other ſurious Inſtruments, the ſpoiling and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Houſes, Carts carrying away the ſpoils, and dead Bodies which
were thrown into the River of <hi>Soame,</hi> all red with Blood, which ran
in great Streams through the Town, and from the Kings Palace into the
ſaid River.</p>
               <p>As for the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> himſelf, and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they were
called into the King's preſence, who muſt himſelf ſpeak with them, who
with his own Mouth certified them, what had thus paſt all this while, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he had ſaved their Lives only upon Condition, that they ſhould
renounce their Religion, and follow his; otherwiſe that they muſt look
for the like puniſhment that their Adherents had and ſhould receive.
The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> beſought the King to remember his promiſe of
Alliance newly contracted, and not to conſtrain him in his Religion. The
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> alſo more fervently anſwered, that the King had given
his Faith unto him and to all thoſe of the Religion, with
ſo ſolemn a Proteſtation and Vow,<note place="margin">Mark here the Vows of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> that he could not be
perſuaded that his Majeſty would falſify ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Oath, and that thereupon he had thus far yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Majeſties Demands, and faithfully performed
what he had required of him on this Aſſurance: But as
touching the Religion, whereof the King had granted him the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
and God the true knowledg, to whom he was to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
therein, for this his Religion, he ſaid, he was fully reſolved to
remain moſt conſtant therein, and which he would always maintain to
be true, although it were with the loſs of his Life. This anſwer of the
Prince, ſet the King into ſuch a choller, that he began to call him Rebel,
ſeditious, and Son of a ſeditious Perſon, with horrible threatnings to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40749:21"/>
cauſe them to loſe their Heads, if within 3 days they took not better
counſel: and indeed theſe threatnings, and other crafty carriages in this
way, ſo wrought on both theſe Princes at laſt, that they forſook their
Faith and firſt Love, and turned to Romiſh abominations.</p>
               <p>Now the King perceiving that this Maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> would not
quench the Fire, but rather kindle it the more, fearing leſt thoſe of the
Religion in his other Provinces and Towns might aſſemble and unite
themſelves together, and ſo give them new work; he with the ſpeedy
advice of his Counſellors, ſent two Meſſengers with two ſeveral Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the one to the Governours and ſeditious Catholicks of his remoter
Towns, wherein were many of the Religion, with expreſs command to
maſſacre them; the other containing certain Letters to the Governors
of Provinces, by which he pretended this Maſſacre to be perpetated by
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Admiral to be murthered on a particular
and private quarrel betwixt them two, and that the King's honeſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and intention was utterly againſt theſe things, and ſeriouſly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his former Edict of a general Pacification; and therefore that his
care and vigilancy had ceaſed it the ſame day it began; and yet (as my
Author recordeth in his Hiſtory) on the Tueſday following, being the
26 of the ſame <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the King accompanied with his Brethren and the
chiefeſt of his Court, went to the Court of Parliament, and there publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared in expreſs terms, That whatſoever had hapned in <hi>Paris,</hi> was
done, not only by his conſent, but alſo by his Commandment, and of
his own motion. And as for his other former mentioned Meſſage and
Letter to other Towns and Provinces, for the maſſacring of thoſe of the
Religion among them alſo; his bloody command herein was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
put in execution at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and many other places, where the poor
Proteſtants were murthered and maſſacred in moſt hideous and horrible
manner, by thoſe mercileſs and inhumane Butchers of bloody <hi>Rome,</hi> who
knockt down the innocent Chriſtians among them, as ſo many Dogs,
cut their Throats, mangl'd their Bodies, ſlaſh'd off their Hands with
great ſharp Knives, as on their Knees they held them up to the Villains,
praying for the ſparing of their Lives; yea, and were known to rip up
their Bellies and take out their Fat from their Bowels, and to ſell it to
the Apothecaries to make Medicines. Thus alſo in thoſe remoter parts
from <hi>Paris</hi> were very many thouſands of the Religion murdered, without
any difference or diſtinction either of Sex or Age. And ſo deeply enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
was the King and his Adherents, and ſo deſperately reſolved to root
out and extirpate the memory of thoſe of the Religion, eſpecially of any
note or eminency, that the King having at laſt got into his cuſtody one
<hi>Briquemant</hi> a noble French Gentleman, of the age of ſeventy years, one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40749:22"/>
that had valiantly imployed himſelf in the Service of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
having been found in the Houſe of the Ambaſſador of <hi>England,</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in <hi>France,</hi> wherein he had hid himſelf, whilſt the greateſt fury of
the Maſſacre was executed, was by the King's command put in cloſe
Priſon, together with another vertuous Gentleman, <hi>Cavagnes,</hi> Maſter of
the Requeſts, both which Gentlemen bare great affection both unto the
Religion, and alſo unto the renowned Admiral, and were themſelves of
great eſteem and reputation in <hi>France;</hi> but the King having them now
faſt in hold, threatned to tear them in pieces upon the Rack, if they
would not write and ſign with their Hands, that they had conſpired with
the Admiral to kill the King, his Brethren, the Queen, and the King of
<hi>Navarre.</hi> But they having moſt conſtantly and juſtly refuſed to avouch
ſo horrible a lye againſt their own and their godly Friends Innocencies,
were racked and cruelly tormented, and by a moſt unjſt ſentence of the
Court of Parliament in <hi>Paris,</hi> they were both declared guilty of Treaſon,
and condemned to be hanged upon a Gibbet, which was accordingly
executed. The Queen-Mother leading the King, her two Sons, and the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> her Brother-in-Law to ſee the Execution. Her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
thinking that at this laſt exploit, what they had wickedly proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
namely, the falſe transferring of the cauſe of this bloody Maſſacre
on a treaſonable Plot, intended by the Admiral and others of the Religion
againſt the King, (as was fore-mentioned) would now be wrought out
and effected, if <hi>Briquemant</hi> in preſence of all the People, now at the time
of his expected Death would ask pardon of the King, withal (to work
it on the more) ſending one to him to certifie and aſſure him, that ſo he
might eaſily ſave his Life, for the King was merciful, and that he ſhould
have pardon, if he would deſire it, confeſſing this fact wherewith he was
charged. But <hi>Briquemant</hi> anſwered boldly and with a good courage;
that it belonged not unto him, but to the King to ask pardon of God for
ſuch an heinious Offence: That he would never ask pardon for a fault,
wherein he had not offended, but knew himſelf to be moſt innocent,
whereof he called GOD to witneſs, deſiring him to pardon the King's
ſo great Diſloyalty and Cruelty. <hi>Cavagnes</hi> alſo, the other noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
did the like until he died. Inſomuch that this execution (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the King's expectation) ſerved to no other end, but more to
publiſh the iniquity of all thoſe cruel Homicides, and of all their moſt
pernicious Counſels.</p>

Government, whether it was lawful for the Catholicks to
work that Change, for the advancing and ſecuring of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Cauſe in</hi> England, <hi>by making away the King, whom
there was no hope to turn from his Hereſie:
Which was anſwered Affirmatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which the ſame Perſons went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
being propounded and dehated, it was concluded by the Popeland
his Council, that it was both lawful and expedient for the Catholicks
to promote that alteration of State. What followed that Conſultation
and Sentence, all the World knoweth, and how the Jeſuits went to
work, God knoweth; and Time (the bringer forth of Truth) will
lèt us know. But when the horrible Paricide committed on the King's
ſacred Perſon, was ſo univerſally cried down, as the greateſt Villany
that had been committed in many Ages, the Pope commanded all the
Papers about that Queſtion to be gathered and burnt; in obedience to
which Order, a <hi>Roman</hi> Cathollck in <hi>Paris,</hi> was demanded a Copy
which he had of thoſe Papers; But the Gentleman who had had time
to conſider and deteſt the wickedneſs of that Project, refuſed to give
it, and ſhewed them to a Proteſtant Friend of his; and related to him
the whole carriage of this Negotiation, with great abhorrency of the
practices of the Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of that Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the pulling down both
Monarch and the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> many Jeſuits came over,
who took ſeveral Shapes to go about their work, but moſt of them took
party in the Army. About Thirty of them were met by a Proteſtant
Gentleman between <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Diep,</hi> to whom they ſaid (taking him
for one of their Party) that they were going into <hi>England,</hi> and would
take Arms in the Independent Army, and endeavour to be Agitators.</p>
            <p>A Proteſtant Lady living in <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of our late Calamities,
was perſuaded by a Jeſuite going in Scarlet, to turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick:
When the diſmal news of the King's Murther came to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Lady,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40749:23"/>
(as all other good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects) was moſt deeply afflicted with it,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd when this Scarlet Divine came to ſee her, and found her melting
in tears, about that heavy and common diſaſter; he told her with a
ſmiling countenance, that ſhe had no reaſon to lament, but rather to
rejoyet, ſeeing that the Catholicks were rid of their greateſt Enemy,
and that the Catholick Cauſe was much furthered by his Death. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, the Lady in great anger, put the man down Stairs, ſaying,
If that be your Religion, I have done with you for ever. And God
hath given her the Grace to make her word good hitherto.</p>
            <p>Many intelligent Travellers can tell of the great joy among the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Convents and Seminaries, about the King's Death, as having
overcome their Enemy, and done their main work for their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England;</hi> of which they made themſelves ſo ſure, that the
<hi>Benedictines</hi> were in great care that the Jeſuits ſhould not get their
Land, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nuns were contending who ſhould be Abbeſſes
in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An underſtanding Gentleman viſiting the Friars of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> put
them upon the diſcourſe of the King's Death, and to pump out their
ſenſe about it, ſaid that the Jeſuits had laboured very much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
that great work: To which they anſwered, that the Jeſuites
would engroſs to themſelves the glory of all great and good Works,
and of this among other Works; whereas they had laboured as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
and effectually for it, as they. So there was ſtriving for the
glory of that Atchievement, and the Friats ſhewed themſelves as much
Jeſuited as the Jeſuites.</p>
            <p>In the height of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Tyranny, <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Gentleman, a
