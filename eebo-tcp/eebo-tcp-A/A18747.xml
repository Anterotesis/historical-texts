         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whiche is bredd in the bowells of rebellion,
noursed vp in vile and naughtie Nature, and
brought to a full perfection, by the pride or
conceite of hatefull persones, and vnnaturall
practises. And surely no matter more to bee
lamented, then to see one member corrupte
an other, and the foote or inferiour partes
(whose forse is small, and feeblenesse greate)
strine with the hedde, or deuie to dooe their
duetie, and beare that thei are able. For in a

some branches of a tree yelde but bitter ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

The subuersion of kyngdomes, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter

of all Common weales, whiche ruste
and canker once takyng roote, destroyes not

grosse and foule infection, the mother of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef
and disorder, whereby cleane life and
good maners is forgotten, and leaude beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
is moste in mynde, and embrased.</p>
            <p>In the daies of oure Forefathers many
hundreth yeres agoe menne were so noblie
bent and disposed (and honoured their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
so dearely) that no hazarde nor attempte
was refused, that might aduaunce the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
state, or enlarge the boundes and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the same. And some one to ridde their
countrey of Plague, or noysome afflictions,
haue offered their liues, and sought death as
willingly as life and worldely felicitie, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the greatest nomber desired, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of <hi>Marcus Curssius,</hi> and many others
of manly minde beares witnesse to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Yea, some to ridde good and peaceable
people, that wisheth quietnesse, from wicked
warre (and the pride of a tyrant) haue aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to worke wonders: and bryng to passe
thynges, beyonde the common compasse of

yea, a multitude of renowmed persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(their order of life and death reuiued)
brynges recorde enough of their noble dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and vertuous dispositions. But as those
worthies did weare awaie, and the season be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
old (through continuaunce of tyme) so
newe fashions and maners wared ripe in a
little while after, and were so well liked for
their sodaine chaunge, and alteration of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
that the olde fidelitie and value of mens
estimation, beeyng waied in the ballaunce of
newe found fancies, beganne to lose weight,
and wanted many graines of goodnesse (that
our Elders honoured) it hath suttellie been
solde, and finely laied vp, yet vsed ouer often
and tasted to muche, and yet the custome is
not so good, that it maie breede a Lawe in
mannes Nature, nor make men leaue the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of olde vertue, for the cumiyng trade of
finenesse newe vice, that euery daie changeth
condition, and lookes neither to GOD, the
worlde, nor well doyng, but passeth to sonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
practises in some kinde of sorte, againste
heauen and yearth, and so is carred cleane
from all hope of repentaunce, rounyng head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into a heape of hazardes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5295:5"/>
The newe treasons, daungerous deuises,
deuelishe attemptes, and rebellious rages of
diuers wretched people (that for the reuenge
of a little wrong, settes abroche many broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les)
argues a marueilous decaie in the myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of men, that hath been giuen to doe good,
and expresseth plainely that our auncestours
noblenesse is out of memorie, and the worlde
is wonderfully enclined to followe badde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
and curious knackes of crueltie,
murtheryng freendes that neuer offended,
and fauouryng foes that daiely seekes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef.
The bloode of that honeste gentleman
<hi>Harry Dauells,</hi> cries out vppon those filthie
practises, and the murthers without mercie
committed of late, doeth manifestly declare,
the villanous exchaunge of this inconstaunte
worlde, whiche nouseleth bloodie hartes in
tyrannie, and bringes forthe the curssed fruit
of <hi>Caine,</hi> that God did not leaue vnpunished.</p>
            <p>You maie read of some noble warriours,
that after thei were banished their countrey,
through the furie of the people, and mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Fortune: yet thei behaued them selues
so worthely, when thei looked backwarde to
the bodie and bowelles of the natiue soile thei
were borne in, thei refrained their handes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:5295:5"/>
dooyng violence, and kepte their hartes and
their heddes from woorkyng of iniuries, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
towardes their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
whiche modeste and gentilnesse (when
it was well considered of) wan them a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
credite then thei had before, and brought
them home againe, and in a good likyng of
the Commons euer after. But as you maye
read in many good aucthours, the goodnesse
of suche menne that honoured their countrey:
So maie you see the lightnesse of some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ledde so farre beyonde the boundes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and loue of their Prince, that thei
leaue no shamelesse matter vnsought, nor no
mischeef vnministered, where thei ought to
bee profitable members of the state, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatours
of the common weale.</p>
            <p>It is assuredly more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miraculous (and
as wee might properly saie, a thing paste all
reason) to see a manne forsake his Countrie,
and cutte hymself in peeces, by abandonyng
the same, and then to runne a gaddyng after
euery shadowe, and giue hym self ouer to the
leadyng and gouernemente of a straunger,
who can not inwardlie esteeme hym, because
he hath betraied the bodie whereof he was a
member, and deceiued his owneself by sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
<pb facs="tcp:5295:6"/>
dissention, where duetie commaundeth
concorde, and he of duetie ought to bee a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte,
a matter that if menne would wisely
waye (and throughly looke into) might kepe
them from witlesse wanderyng abroad, and
preserue them at home in more quietnesse of
mynde.</p>
            <p>Well, now beholde what brusteth out of
rebellion, and chaunge of good conditions,
and regarde how God prepareth instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
to put them doune that Sathan hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced,
and you shall finde that the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
fighteth the battaile, when the pollicie and
power of man faileth, or waxeth feble. You
maie remember, that markes this worlde,
how <hi>Shaen Oneall</hi> was strong in the feelde,
and yet wanted force and cunnyng, to keepe
his hedde on his shoulders. And an other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Roorioege</hi> who delighted in rebellion,
was lefte headlesse ere he was ware, and all
by the prouidence and iuste Iudgemente of
the Almightie, who holdes the bridle in his
owne hande, and tourneth bothe horse and
man, the verie same waie he hath appoincted
for their destruction. And where one rebell
by sufferaunce escapeth the scourge, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
lighteth in the lashe, and feles the whip
<pb facs="tcp:5295:6"/>
of Gods wrathe and displeasure.</p>
            <p>And maie not this laste example bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed,
for a testimonie of Gods veugaunce
when he listeth to strike: yes vndoubtedlie,
it maie hee recited, because <hi>Fitz Morrice</hi>
was thought wise, valiaunt, strong, learned,
experimented in Marshall affaires, and a
greate trauailer to sturre vp troubles, which
fell vpon his owne hedde, when neither wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
could preuent it, nor his rebellious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
could withstande Gods doyng and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
and who so deepely noteth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his death (and daungerous deastenie
that drewe hym to his ende) shall see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Maiestie of God shine, in the purpose
and determinations of men, especially when
thei goe about good thynges, whereby God
is knowen and glorified, and the worlde in
those purposes is dispatched of troublesome
rebelles.</p>
            <p>I praie you was not this a deuine worke,
when men of his owne nation and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
were moued in courage, either to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
<hi>Fitz Morrice,</hi> or suffer death in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte.
And after this resolution, wente so
manfully aboute their businesse, that all was
brought to suche passe (though with losse of
<pb facs="tcp:5295:7"/>
life to the executioners therof) as better could
not be deuised, nor be brought to effecte. The
acte was noble: the hazard greate: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade
not little. And the matter shall remain
regestered in the booke of Fame, whiles any
Borrowe, Borcke, or Toune, can sett forthe

            <p>Now the maner of his death is looked for,
but first the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of hym self and his whole
companie should be spoken of, whiche was so
simple and so farre paste his hope, as neither
it dooeth merite remembraunce, nor carries
any pece of credite with it, recite it who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
For albeit he made muche adoe, to bring
to passe muche matter, little was performed
to the purpose, in the answeryng of his owne
exspectation, for in deede diuerse thynges
whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> contrary to that he desired: And albeeit
some strength by fortification he sought, yet
weakely and barely he beganne, and foolishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ended his life. Though animated with
worse in condition then hym self, he tooke in
hande a greate aduenture, and dallied a while
on the hazarde of happe, and the aduaunture
of tyme: the one doubtfull, and the other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte
to chaunce, yet neither Fortunes daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
dealyng, nor tymes mutabilitie could
daunte his outragious desire, nor at any sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:5295:7"/>
make hym shunne the daunger he was
in. But busiyng his braines and senses, about
needelesse sleightes, and subtile seditions, he
fell in the handes of his enemies, who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vppon hym moste valliauntly, and with
muche adoe ouercame him (because he stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made defence) and stroke of his hedde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
least he looked for suche a desteuie, and shorte
dispatch of this world. Some reportes there
are bruted abroade (to affirme it for trothe I
can not) that one <hi>Borcke</hi> a gentilman for a
pardon graunted by the Lorde Iustice, for
the losse of a hande made promesse with the
same pardoned hande, to purchace the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fauour, and so to kil <hi>Fitz Morrice,</hi> But
how soeuer the matter went, or the brethren
called <hi>Borcks</hi> agreed in that poinet. Foricer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Fitz Morrice</hi> loste his life, beyng hurt
by the <hi>Borckes,</hi> and shotte into the hedde by
a good and perfite Hargabozier, and had his
hedde striken of, although those that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, were muche lesse in nomber then
hym self: A thyng to bee noted, and a matter
wherein often, right and trothe euer hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and gotten greate glorie, whiche is a
signe that victorie restes not in a multitude,
but dependeth rather in Iustice, and equitie
<pb facs="tcp:5295:8"/>
of the quarrell and cause.</p>
            <p>Thus the worlde maie beholde the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that God woorketh: Good people maie
be ware, how thei offende the prince, and their
countrey. And rebelles are curbed, and made
holde in heddes by this open rebuke. And to
conclude, the opinion of thousandes is suche,
that a rebell liues without loue, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders with
out witte, feightes in feare, dyes without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and lies without graue, as a prey to the
wilde wolffe, and foode to the carren Crow,
lest as a spectacle for many eyes to loke into,
and shall reste as a perpetuall wonder to the
wise, and matter of reproche for euery tonge
to talke vppon. Now if better occasion had
procured me to put penne to paper, you had
not receiued this simple discourse at my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thus farewell good Reader, till my
