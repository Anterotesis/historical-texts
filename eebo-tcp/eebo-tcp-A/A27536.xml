            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS
ENQUIRY
AFTER
WILLIAM BALY,
The only WITNESS againſt him, upon the TRYAL
of the RIOT, at <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILD-HALL,</hi> on <date>the 8th of
<hi>May,</hi> 1683.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. At
a Tryal held at <hi>Guild-Hall London,</hi> Several
perſons were by a Jury found Guilty of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
committed on the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1682.
In not departing from the ſaid Hall, upon the Lord Mayor
his adjourning there by Proclaimation, the Pole, which was
then on Foot, for the choiſe of Sheriffs for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi>
for the year enſuing.</p>
            <p>And Whereas <hi>Slingisby Bethell</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is named
in the Information as guilty of the ſaid Riot, in not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> after the Lord Mayor his ſaid adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Proclaimation; And whereas upon the Oath of
one, by the name of <hi>William Baly,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Bethell</hi> did not
depart according to the Proclaimation, but ſtayed there after
the ſame, he was found guilty by the ſaid Jury. Now the ſaid
<hi>Bethell,</hi> not only knowing himſelf not guilty, but being alſo
able to prove the ſame, and by ſeveral credible Witneſſes,
that he was at the time of the Adjornement in another place,
and from thence went home, without ever coming at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>
or the Yard that Evening, hath endeavoured by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ways to find out the ſaid <hi>William Baly</hi> who ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but cannot learn from whence he came, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is gone; he the ſaid <hi>Bethell,</hi> doth therefore hereby Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the ſaid <hi>William Baly</hi> to appear, and either to make good
<pb facs="tcp:41475:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Oath againſt him in the Face of the World, or confeſs
his miſtake, and clear him thereof; and in order thereunto,
to leave word where he is to be found, either at the Houſe
called <hi>Garraways Coffee-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Exchange-Ally,</hi> or at <hi>Kid</hi>'s
<hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> both near the <hi>Royal-Exchange;</hi> otherwiſe the
ſaid <hi>Bethell</hi> will hope to be reckoned guiltleſs, and the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Baly</hi> to have raſhly ſworn that which he was miſtaken in,
and cannot Juſtifie.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole, it may be obſerved, that
there being at the aforeſaid Adjournment (as is thought)
at leaſt One thouſand perſons in the Hall, whereof ſeveral
Hundreds of them, may well be ſuppoſed to know the
perſon of the ſaid <hi>Bethell,</hi> eſpecially the Lord Mayors
Officers, and Servants, by his having been lately Sheriff of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex:</hi> If he the ſaid <hi>Bethell</hi> had been really in
the Hall or Yard, at, or after the ſaid adjournment, there
could not have wanted a Croud of Witneſſes to prove the
ſame, inſtead of having the Proof thereof, to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Teſtimony of a Single perſon, that is not to be
found.</p>
