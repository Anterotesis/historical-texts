            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſafe and eaſy Method for ſupplying the want of Coin, and raiſing as many Millions as the Occaſions of the Publick may require.

               <q>Ego certè reip. non deero; &amp; quicquid acciderit, a quo mea cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa abſit, animo forti feram.</q>
               <bibl>Cic. Cornificio.</bibl>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT cannot be denied, that the want of good <hi>Coin</hi> gave riſe to the ſeveral <hi>Banks</hi> now on foot, by which many private Perſons have enriched themſelves, and more probably expect it, not without benefit to the Publick: It being evident, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Summ paid by Bill of <hi>Credit</hi> is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for the time the Bills do paſs, ſo much Money added to the <hi>Coin</hi> of the Kingdom. But it is to be preſumed, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> will give a check to that endleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Bills of Credit, which, upon the failure of any of the <hi>Banks</hi> to anſwer in <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> when generally called for, may prove a greater miſchief than that which they would remedy.</p>
            <p>If therefore a way can be found to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of <hi>Coin</hi> by Credit, and that Credit to have ſo true a Foundation, that it ſhall certainly be made good in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and that within few years, which has not been pretended to by any Propoſer of Banks, this may at the leaſt deſerve to be conſidered in <hi>Parliament:</hi> where what is crudely propoſed may be maturely dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and improved, by the collective wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is propoſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Fund of 500000<hi>l. per an.</hi> more or leſs, according to the Summ to be raiſed, be ſettled for eight Years, or if for a longer time, a leſs Fund; and this may be of ſuch a nature, as may give general ſatisfaction: but to name a Fund which may be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, might prejudice a Method applicable to any good Fund.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the <hi>Money</hi> ariſing by the Fund be paid into an Office, to be erected at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or within the Suburbs, to be called the <hi>Crown-Bank,</hi> or <hi>Publick-Bank:</hi> For which Office let there be as many <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> or <hi>Directors,</hi> as the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall think fit; they to be intruſted to appoint <hi>Collectors,</hi> and other Officers, and to aſcertain their Sallaries, and the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At that <hi>Bank</hi> let there be drawn on <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> or thick <hi>Paper,</hi> made there, and imprinted with <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> or ſome other particular <hi>Characters,</hi> in a <hi>Mill</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo many Bills from 5 <hi>l.</hi> to 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 5 <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> or <hi>Directors</hi> at the leaſt, as ſhall make up as many Millions as are wanting: let each of theſe Tickets have its particular <hi>Number,</hi> and the Year expreſſed in which it is to be brought back into the Office, and there diſcharged: Let the pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> or thick <hi>Paper,</hi> be cut in the middle of the Impreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let that part which has the other half of the Impreſſion be kept in the Office, having upon it the ſame <hi>Number</hi> with the other, and a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the Summ contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and be ſigned as the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let all the Bills be current at the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues expreſſed in them, and immediately paſs in all Payments as lawful <hi>Coin,</hi> and be

            <p n="5">5. Let the <hi>Mill</hi> where the <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And let it be <hi>Capital</hi> for the ſame, or any other of that kind, to be found elſewhere at any time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or there unbroken after the whole Number of Bills making up the appointed Summ, together with the <hi>Counter-parts,</hi> have been once imprinted; or for any Perſons to counterfeit any of the Bills, or the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> or <hi>Paper,</hi> or ſo to imprint more pieces of <hi>Parchment,</hi> or <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Paper,</hi> than the appointed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To prevent the confuſion and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of hurrying in all the Bills of each Year at the end of each Year; let the Bills of the Year be brought in at any time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt ſix months; and if the money which ſhould pay the ſame be not come into the Office, let the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,</hi> give Bills of Credit upon <hi>Vellom,</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> or <hi>Paper,</hi> of another Impreſſion, for ſo much money as every Bill carries, payable within ſix months at the fartheſt, with Intereſt at 4<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> till payment. And let it be Actionable, and highly Penal for them to refuſe or neglect payment, if there be Caſh for it, or not to give ſuch Bills if Caſh fail, or to imbezil the money, or to poſtpone Payments, or to employ it to any other uſe or purpoſe, than the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bills in the firſt place, next to the defraying the annual Charges of the Bank, and let the overplus be paid into the Exchequer.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In caſe the Fund ſhall be deficient in any Year, let what is wanting to clear the Bills and the Charges of the Office, be paid out of ſuch money as ſhall be in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; and if it be not paid before the then <hi>next Parliament,</hi> let it be ſupplyed our of the <hi>next publick Tax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Let the <hi>Commiſſioners or Directors</hi> at the end of every Year Account to the <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſioners of the Treaſury</hi> for the time being, who are to tranſmit the Accompt to Parliament.</p>

               <note place="margin">Of the Bank of England.</note> The <hi>Bank of England</hi> has raiſed the King 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> and perhaps has ſaved him 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Remittances of money. This has a Fund of 100000 <hi>l. per An.</hi> for 12 years abſolute, and for ever till redeemed by <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is in effect a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and if employed as above for 100 years, is worth 10 Millions.</p>

He is ſo far from ſuppoſing that theſe Bills will ever be paid in <hi>Specie,</hi> that he makes no manner of proviſion for it, but allows the annuity, which is the fund for the Bills, to be paid in Bills: and ſo the Bills are to carry themſelves from the <hi>Bank</hi> and to the <hi>Bank,</hi> without any Circulation or Profit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Circulation, if any, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the very beginning by one upon ſeven and an half, 400 <hi>l.</hi> being all that is to be paid till the end of the firſt year to circulate the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Bills received by the party, and the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in Bills put to the ſtock of Trade; unleſs what is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal upon the coming in of Moneys lent, which in truth, clogg the Bank with 50 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if any part of the 400 <hi>l.</hi> firſt brought in be employed in Trade, that, before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable returns, leaves the leſs to circulate the Bills, and if half be employed in trade 1 <hi>l.</hi> muſt circulate 15 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Annuities were to be paid in Money, which would be very hard upon them who have the Bills dead by them; yet the diſtance of 100 years makes it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtionable what 150 <hi>l. per annum</hi> ſhall hold out 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> in all Events.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If this were practicable, it would be far from anſwering the great end which the <hi>Doctor</hi> does, or ought to propound, of leſſning the burthen upon Land; for either men with encumbred Eſtates muſt not come

            <p>Suppoſe a man of 150 <hi>l. per annum</hi> owes 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and takes up the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which he muſt advance; or ſuppoſe only the firſt 400 <hi>l.</hi> be in Money, but for the reſt he may bring the Bills he received from the Bank.</p>
            <p>In the firſt caſe, he has occaſion for five times as much money as a man of a clear Eſtate brings to the Bank; if only the 400 <hi>l.</hi> be to be paid in mony, then indeed he will have occaſion for leſs then 4 times as much as the other brings, but by the ſame rule there may never be more than the firſt 400 <hi>l</hi> for every 150 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> ſubſcribed to circulate all the Bills. But if the man owe 1500 <hi>l.</hi> he is excluded from all benefit of this Bank.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Lender will expect better ſecurity than can be found here. Shall he reſort to his own money? That is lent out to ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Land. Shall he go to their Land? that is made over to anſwer the Annuities to the Bank in its <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Money:</hi> If in Bills they are never likely to yield money; if in Money, that muſt be laid out to purchaſe Bills, and they are to be cancelled; If to the Stock in Trade; that is firſt to anſwer the intereſt of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to every ſubſcriber of 150 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and let the Lender catch the reſt where he can.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs here to object the want of ſufficient certainty, that the Bills of <hi>Credit</hi> ſhall come in upon any other account than their lying dead; or that the Governours of this Bank ſhall not miſmanage in ſeveral particulars, which might require parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary proviſions.</p>

            <p>Yet no Man's Land is to continue in longer than he pleaſes, but he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it at any time, paying the money which he has taken up there, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of loſs if any has then happened.

            <p>If the Eſtates are encumbered, it muſt be under 3 4ths of the value, or they cannot be admitted into the <hi>Bank;</hi> but if all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of Land took up the 3 4ths, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Man's profit would be the greater, and ſuch men the <hi>Bank</hi> is ſure of till they can pay their money, and in the mean while it has their Eſtates as a <hi>Fund</hi> of <hi>Credit,</hi> not only for that money, but for the remaining 4th which the <hi>Land-Bank,</hi> ſo called, cannot pretend to, any farther than as a Security for the money borrowed upon the reſpective Eſtates.</p>

               </note> not to be lookt on as vain projects. In this belief I am farther confirmed, by peruſing a Treatiſe now in my hands, wherein a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Judgment and Experience not only holds, That it is neceſſary at this time for the Parliament to appoint Bills of Credit, but that they may be effectual with only Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Security, without any particular preſent Fund.</p>
            <p>And if I am not much miſtaken, it appears by what I have obſerved of other Banks, that the <hi>Crown Bank</hi> which I propoſe, to ſupply the preſent Exigencies, is lyable to no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what will fall upon the beſt of the others: and that all but the National Land Bank labour with Objections which cannot be urged againſt this. For the recommending of which it may be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here is an abſolute certainty that the Credit ſhall never be ſtretched beyond its real and certain Fund, which ſhall yield <hi>in Specie</hi> all the Money for which it gives Credit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Till the Money is paid by the publick, the Bills will be as Money, and paſſing as ſuch from one to an other, are as capable of yielding intereſt: and conſequently there will be no need of the Crowns, paying inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, when it at the very firſt pays Bills, which are current, not only becauſe they ſhall in their time be paid in Money, but in the mean while are as true a Medium of Trade and Profit. This therefore in few years time would ſave the Nation ſome Millions as well as yeild Millions for the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas it will be ſome years before the benefit of the beſt of the other Banks can be diffuſed over the whole Nation; this may be in few weeks, as ſoon as the Bills can be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and delivered out.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there be any apprehenſion that other Banks may be too powerful, or may be a means of ingroſſing Commodities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſing their Prizes; this has its certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and reaches no farther, than the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the publick require.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Forwardneſs to cloſe with invitations to honeſt profit, may lead the Directors of other Banks to paſs bad Titles, or what was fairly adventured may miſcarry: But the <hi>Crown-Bank</hi> propoſed is, in its nature, as firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Foundations of this <hi>Monarchy;</hi> which can never be moved, but by ſuch a Calamity as ſhould leave us no viſible means of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing a proteſtant Nation, or free people.</p>
