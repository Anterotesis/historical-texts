            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Sermon, savouring
of the Countrey, in which
it was conceived, and
brought forth, without the Midwifry
of a Library (my own perishing in the
<pb facs="tcp:105071:3"/>
same Flames with your City, and the
place of my now residence not affording
an assistant) was intended onely for
your religious ears, in them to have
both its birth and buriall; but since it
hath pleased you to reprieve it to a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and more publick life, where should
it be more justly laid than at your doors?
who for your able parts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been fitted for the publick
imployment, and intrusted with the
weightiest affairs of this City; and who
by your Favour and Countenance are
able to cover the rawness, and rudeness,
or what other defects in my weake and
unworthy handling so necessary a subject.
I have in publishing it, regarded more
your Opinion than my own conceipt;
and I hope (because you think so)
that the matter will not be altogether
unprofitable, or unseasonable; although
it be not handled so artificially, and rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically
<pb facs="tcp:105071:3"/>
as it ought, my main study
being to be plain and to apply the things
delivered to the present times: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, (and I wish it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
it is now no more mine but yours;
and if under the beames of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it shall so thrive, as to become
an Instrument for the furthering that
important Work mentioned in it; next
under God your Honour and your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful
assessors are to have the Praise,
and I therein shall receive a sufficient
reward of my labour; accounting it
my greatest happiness on earth, to have
been able to performe any acceptable
service to that Royal City, to which
for many yeares past, and my whole
life for the future, I have dedicated all
my endeavours. I will not detain your
Honour, &amp;c. any longer from your more
publick and serious affaires, but only
beseech the Almighty and All-wise
<pb facs="tcp:105071:4"/>
God, that he would give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and valiant hearts to manage
them Couragiously and Prudently, that
you may be instruments in Gods hand
for the making up the breaches in our
Syon and Jerusalem; which is, and
shall be the dayly Prayer of,</p>

               <q>Ye looked for much, and loe, it came to

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome Geographers have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that there is no Land so
placed in the World, but from
that Land a man may veiw some other
Land: though between Land and Land you
may see Seas enraged with stormes and
tempests, yet land is still within ken. An
observation, perhaps, of more curiosity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105071:5"/>
than verity in the material Sea of this
World: yet most certain if it be applyed
to the mistical Sea of Gods Judgments,
(which the Royal Prophet compares to a
great deep) and the dry land of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
though between mercy,<note place="margin">Psa. 36. 6.</note> and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
God interposeth a raging Ocean of
trouble and calamity, raised by the
storme of his indignation, so that men
seeme to be in the condition of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. When the waters
prevailed exceedingly upon the earth,
and all the high hils that were under the
whole Heaven were covered.</p>
            <p>Omnia pontus erant, deerant quoque littora
Ponto.</p>
            <p>All was a Sea and that Sea had no shores,
yet if they looke but onward they cannot
miss of a prospect of dry land, of Mercy.
The Almighty God hath so interwoven
these two in the dispensation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that the one is never discernable
without the other. When God landeth
his people in the Haven of prosperity,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105071:5"/>
he would have them look back on the
tempestuous Sea from which they are esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and fear his Justice: when he
lancheth them forth into the depth of
misery he carries them not out of sight
of land, that there may be hope of mercy.
Thus doth the most Gracious God in the
midst of Judgment remember Mercy, and
giveth even the vally of <hi>Achor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 2 15.</note> the vally
of trouble for a door of hope, and in
the deepest Ocean of his Judgments, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
a little Island of Mercy to repaire
to. And thus did he of old deal with
his People the Jewes; He caused the
King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to arise like waters
out of the North,<note place="margin">Jer. 47. 2.</note> and to become an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
flood, and to overflow the land
and all that was therein, whereby they
were swept away into Captivity; yet
then when these waters did so overflow
their heads that they said they were cut
off,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 54.</note> the all-merciful God lifted up their
heads, and shewed them a prospect of
mercy, by a faithful promise of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105071:6"/>
after seventy years: at which
harbour they are no sooner arrived, but
their sins provoke God to bring them
back into the Sea of his Judgments, and
he afflicts them with famine, <hi>ye have sown
much and bring in little: ye eat but have
not enough: ye drinke but ye are not filled
with drinke:</hi> &amp;c. vers. 6. of this Chapter;
Yet even here though the Sea roared, and
the Heaven was black with Clouds, that
God which gave to the Sea his decree,
saying, Thus far shalt thou go and no
farther, and there thy proud waves shall
be staied; not only discovers a <hi>Cape of
good Hope,</hi> and makes a path in that mighty
water for his ransomed to pass to it, <hi>Go
up to the Mountain, and bring wood, and
build the House: and I will take pleasure in
it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord,</hi>
vers. 8: but also gives them a faithful
representation of their present state and
condition, with the by-path that brought
them into it, that so they might be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to consider their waies, and leave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105071:6"/>
them and return into the way of peace,
and this he doth in the words of my Text:
<hi>Ye looked for much, and loe it comes to little,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that my Text is made up of the two
parts of <hi>Davids</hi> Song, <hi>Psalm</hi> 101. 1.
<hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which in God
are alwayes twisted together, <hi>Gracious
and righteous is the Lord, Psal.</hi> 25. 8.
<hi>and all his pathes are mercy and truth,</hi>
v. 10, Not one path of mercy, and
another of truth, but every path mercy,
and truth both. The red Cross of his
Justice (as in your City Armes) is born
on the white Field of his mercy: as these
therefore were the burden of <hi>David's</hi>
Ditty, so they must be the support of
my Meditations, and the object of your
Attentions <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> the
former included in the very words of
my Text, the latter in the designe and
scope of those words.</p>
            <p>And first of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> that so I
may end with that, which is not onely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105071:7"/>
the end of all our aimes, and desires, but
of all Gods Judgments too, and that is
Mercy.</p>
            <p>In the Judgment we may consider,
<hi>First,</hi> The Judgment it self, which was
<hi>Famine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Author of it, <hi>the Lord
of Host.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The cause moving God to
it, <hi>the neglect of Gods House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judgment very <hi>dreadfull,</hi> the
inflicter most <hi>powerful,</hi> the cause pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
exceeding <hi>sinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>first</hi> of the Judgment, which
we shall consider, first in it's nature:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In it's severity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of the nature of it, it was Famine,
a generall want of the supports of this
life, because of the failing of the creature,
both in the production and breeding;
<hi>Ye sow much and bring in little:</hi> and in
the vigour, and nourishing power of them;
<hi>ye eat, but are not satisfied.</hi> And this
is a sore, and dreadfull Judgment, <hi>King
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105071:7"/>
David</hi> choseth the Pestilence as the lesser
evil, which yet was so destructive, that
there died of the people in less then
three daies space,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> threescore and ten
thousand men, of whose destructive nature
too, he could not be ignorant, having
an instance in the law of Moses (wherein
he meditated day and night) of three
and twenty thousand slain by it, while
<hi>Aaron</hi> was putting incense into the Censer;
And as he prefers the Pestilence, so the
Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the Sword: <hi>They that
be slain with the sword, are better than they
that be slain with hunger: for these pine
away, stricken through for want of the fruits
of the field.</hi> Lam. 4. 9. and yet the
Sword makes a deplorable desolation;
take it in the words of the prophet Joel:
<hi>A fire devoureth before them, and behind
them a flame burneth: the land is as the
garden of Eden before them, and behind them
a desolate wilderness, yea and nothing shall
escape them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it less dismal in its effects,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105071:8"/>
for necessity is an hard weapon, and
want will make a man part with any thing:
<hi>fourscore pieces of Silver</hi> (ten pound sterling)
<hi>for an Asses head, and five pieces of Silver</hi>
(12 <hi>s.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi>) <hi>for the fourth part of a Kab</hi>
(which is but halfe a pint) <hi>of Doves dung,</hi>

were famous, or rather infamous for their
covetousness, yet can part with all their

makes men forget common humanity,
for the people are ready to stone <hi>Moses,</hi>
who had done so great things for them,
when they are ready to starve, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17:
but it dissolves all the bonds of nature,

tell us of one in <hi>England</hi> about <hi>An.</hi>
700. So violent that not only many dyed
for hunger, but great numbers joyned hand
in hand 40 or 50 in a company, and threw
themselves headlong into the Sea.</p>
            <p>But we shall better understand how
sad, and dreadful this Judgment was, if
we shall consider it in relation to several
circumstances hinted in the Text.</p>
            <p>The first whereof is the country afflicted,
a most plentiful and fruitful land, A land
like not only the Garden of Eden, but the
Garden of God, full of all kind of pleasant
and delightful fruits; which cannot be
described more fully, and signally, than
<hi>Moses</hi> hath done it to our hands: <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 7.
<hi>A good land, a land of brooks of waters,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105071:9"/>
of fountaines and depths that spring out of the
Vallies. A land of Wheat and Barly, and
Vines, and Figtrees, and Pomegranats: a
land of Oyle-olive, and Hony: A land wherein
they might eat bread without scarceness: a land
whose Stones were Iron, and out of whose Hils
they might dig Brass.</hi> And again, <hi>c.</hi> 32. 13.
<hi>A land wherein they might suck Honey out of
the Rocks, and Oyl out of the flinty Rocks; But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Kine, and Milk of Sheep, with Fat of
Lambs, and Rams of the breed of Bashan, and
Goats, with the fat of Kidnies of Wheat, and drink
the pure blood of the Grape.</hi> A Land which
had not only plenty for it self, but bounty
for others: For the Country of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 12. 20.</note> was
nourished by this Country. That this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Land should become barren; that this
Paradise should be turned into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that there should be scarcity in such
a fruitfull Land, is the first aggravating
circumstance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That it was National, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal,
an over-spreading Famine; a
comprehensive Judgment, like a Chain-shot
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105071:9"/>
bearing all before it, reaching to all men,
the great and good, as well the mean and
wicked: <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the Governour, and
<hi>Joshua</hi> the High Priest; for to them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
speaks, verse 1. They are included
in this, <hi>Ye look for much,</hi> &amp;c. Wisedom,
Riches, or Strength may secure from other
annoyances, but Scarcity, and Famine strike
at the Life of every man. The King as
well as the Clown must beg for daily bread;
and the profit of the Earth is for all. That
the King himself is served by the Field, was
wise <hi>Solomons</hi> observation.<note place="margin">Ecc. 5. 9.</note> And King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
may be an evidence of it; who in time
of Dearth could not help himself,<note place="margin">2. King 6. 27.</note> much less
others, out of the Barn-floor, or out of the
Wine-press. Even the Saints have their
share, and portion in it, as being parts, and
members of that people which is to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
and though not actors in those gross
impieties which kindle the fire of Gods
vengeance, yet are guilty of sins, though
of a smaller nature, which add to the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
of Gods wrath. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105071:10"/>
though perhaps not themselves in fault, or
at least not so much, for they were both
very Religious, yet because not so forward,
and putting forth as they should have been,
are lyable to the common Judgment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Character of the Severity of
this Judgment, was the season of it, which
was immediatly after their returne from
the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; They had but
a very little breathing space from the burden
of that Yoake, when God laies on an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyer:
there, to use <hi>Jeroboams</hi> expression,<note place="margin">1 King. 12. 24.</note>
they were Chastised with Whips but here
with Scorpions. There, very probably,
they had meat after their labour, and though
they trod out the Corn, their mouths were
not muzled, their masters sometimes lifted
up the Yoake, and set meat before them.
As in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> although they had hard Taskes,
and cruel Task-masters, yet they had their
Fleshpots, and their Garlicks, and their
Onyons to the full; bnt now they labour,
and have nothing to eat, thus the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of ill newes, as to <hi>Job,</hi> did throng
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105071:10"/>
upon them, one at the heeles of another,
which was none of the smallest aggravations
of this Calamity, that it followed so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
on the neck of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> marke of the Severity of this
Judgment, was the frustration of their
hopes, and expectations: <hi>Ye looked for
much, and loe, it came to little.</hi> If hope
deferred makes the heart sick. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 12.
Hope frustrate, and lost, can do no lesse
then breake it. When men thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sure, as <hi>Esau</hi> did of the blessing,
and it then failes them, this is matter of
bitter weeping. For God to take away
the Corn in the time thereof, and the Wine
in the season thereof, that is just at harvest,
when it is to be inned: when the old store
is spent, and they looke for a new recruit,
then to have the meat cut from their mouths,
and the morsel from between their teeth,
then to have their hopes defeated, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the misery.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> print of the Severity of this
Judgment, was the loss of their labour.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105071:11"/>
It is very frequent, and scarce ever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to see the Sluggards hopes blasted;
he that will not sow in Winter, can never
promise himselfe to reap in Harvest; but
after Plowing, Sowing, nay Reaping too,
and bringing home, to find but little,
that adds to the weight of the want: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much discontents men as labour
in vain; to take paines, and to see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
come of it, is enough to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
complain;<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 4.</note> to labour all night in fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and take nothing may tempt an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to desist. To labour in the fire, and
to weary themselves for vanity, to lose
<hi>oleum &amp; operam,</hi> cost and paines, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to bring men to desperation; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when that little which is coming in,
doth no good; when God blows on it, and
takes away the nourishing virtues, so that
either men dare not eat their fill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for feare
of want another day; or if they do eat, the
Staffe of bread being broken for want of
Gods concurrence, they are not satisfied
A Boulimy, or Canine appetite, being a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105071:11"/>
disease common at such times, when in the
fulness of their sufficiency (as <hi>Zophar</hi> in
<hi>Job</hi> speaks of the wicked) they are in
streights;<note place="margin">Job. 20. 22.</note> that little is so far from abating,
that it encreaseth the Calamity: And so much
for the first Particular, the Judgment with
the Severity of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing is the Author of this
Judgment. <hi>I did blow upon it, Saith the
Lord of Hosts. Shall there be Evil in the
Citty, and I have not done it,</hi> Saith God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>Am.</hi> 3. 6. God Challengeth the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Justice to himselfe; not only at
the Last Day, but in this world, and it
is as agreeable to his nature now, as it will
be hereafter. It is not luck, or fortune
that tosseth or tumbleth things below; but
God sits at the stern, and steers the affairs
of this World. The Genealogy of all the
good creatures is resolved by God into
himself, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. Unless he hear the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the Heavens hear the Earth, no
Corn, or Wine, or Oyle can be expected.
The Earth is a kind Mother, yet it cannot
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105071:12"/>
open her bowels to yield seed to the sower,
or bread to the eater, if it be not watered
from above. The Heavens are the Storehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Gods good treasure, which he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to mans profit and nourishment, yet
they cannot drop down fatness on the earth,
if God close it up, and with-hold the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
showers, which he can do if he
please, and will do, if he be provoked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He can do it easily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will do it justly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He can do it easily. It is but his
blowing upon it, and it is done. As he
made all things, so he can dissolve them by
the breath of his mouth.<note place="margin">Psa. 104. 29. 30.</note> 
               <hi>He hideth his face,
and the creatures are troubled; he taketh away
their breath and they dye. He sendeth forth his
breath and they are created, and reneweth the
face of the Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 90. 3.</note> 
               <hi>He turneth man to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and again he saith, come again ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men.</hi> And this he can do so easily
because he is the <hi>Lord of Hosts;</hi> a title fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used by these three last Prophets,
<hi>Haggai, Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105071:12"/>
after the <hi>Jews</hi> return from the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi>
Captivity, when their state was at
the lowest, scarce ever name God by any
other title; to denote unto them, how easie
it was for him to bring his Judgments upon
them, and to remove them again; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being at his command as <hi>Lord of Hosts;</hi>
and like the Centurions Servants, if he say
to one,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Go, hee goeth, to another, Come, hee
cometh: and to a third, Do this, hee doth it.</hi>
When he will do a thing, who shall hinder
him? Nature may be resisted, and stopped
in her course; Men and Devils, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so potent, may want of their will, and
be crossed in their designes and desires; but
the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> doth whatsoever he will,
both in Heaven and Earth without controul
or contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will do it justly. Gods
Judgments are not alwaies manifest, they
are alwaies just. And he may say as <hi>David</hi>
to his Brethren in another case;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 29.</note> 
               <hi>What have
I now done? is there not a cause?</hi> God never
punisheth a People: but there is a just
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105071:13"/>
cause for it, and could men but see it,
the root of the matter would be found in
themselves.<note place="margin">Job. 19. 28.</note> It is the Plague of their own
hearts, that procures them all their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
and this might have been put among
the aggravations of the Judgment, that it is
from themselves that they are the cause of
their own ruine; that they may thank
themselves, and blame their sin, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their misery, and cause of their
Calamity,<note place="margin">Hos. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>O Israel thou hast destroyed thy
self,</hi> Saith God. So that there is no
ground of complaint:<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 36.</note> 
               <hi>why should a living
man complain: a man for the punishment of
his sin?</hi> Had man never been sinful, he
had never been miserable; had he never
lift up his heart against Heaven to provoke,
God, God had never lift up his hand on
earth to punish man. If these <hi>Jewes</hi> would
but have considered their own waies, as
God himselfe exhorts them twice in a breath,
<hi>vers</hi> 5. and 7. They might have easily
found the Serpent that bit them, to be
lurking in their own bosom; <hi>the contempt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105071:13"/>
and neglect of Gods worship,</hi> which brings
me to</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> particular, The cause of
this Judgment, <hi>why saith the Lord of Hosts?
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein three things offer themselves
to our Consideration:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The sin it's selfe, Gods House
lyes wast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Aggravation of that sin,
Ye run every man to his own house.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Proportion between the
sin, and the punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The sin it selfe, is, that Gods
House is suffered to lie wast. This House,
which God Challengeth to himself, as
his own possession, was that glorious fabrick
of the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> built by King
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and consecrated by him to Gods
immediate worship, and which God was
pleased to accept of, and wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to dwell for ever. <hi>This is my rest
for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 132. 14.</note> 
               <hi>here will I dwell, for I have desired
it,</hi> saith God. Although he be the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105071:14"/>
high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity
whose name is Holy; Although he be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and Comprehended in no place,
and so dwelleth not in Temples made
with hands: yet it was his good pleasure,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> should build him an house,
wherein as to his manifestative presence,
he was resolved to dwell more especialy
among his people the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
whither he would have the Tribes goe up,
<hi>the Tribes of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 4.</note> 
               <hi>unto the Testimony of
Israel to give thanks unto the name of the
Lord.</hi> And this he calls his house. <hi>My
House,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be called the House
of Prayer,</hi> and in my Text, <hi>Because of my
House, which is wast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wast,</hi> the Hebrew word signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>dryed up.</hi> A similitude taken from
a piece of ground, dried up, and parched
by the Sun, so that nothing is able to grow
in it, and is used by the Holy Ghost to
express an extreame desolation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
<hi>His spring shall become dry, and
his foundation dryed up,</hi> saith the Prophet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105071:14"/>
               <hi>Hosea</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when he <hi>would</hi> set forth
their utter ruine:<note place="margin">Hos. 13. 15.</note> so that their <hi>sin</hi> was
the permitting Gods House to lie in it's ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
and not repaire it.</p>
            <p>And it is observable that these <hi>Jews</hi>
had not demolished it themselves, they
had not laid it wast; that was done by
<hi>Necuchadnezzar,</hi> and his Officers, it was
they which set fire to the Temple, these
had no hand at all in it: and yet it is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as a <hi>sin</hi> in them, that it is wast. Not
only pulling down Churches, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing,
when God gives oportunity is a
<hi>sin. Omissions</hi> are sins with God, as well
as <hi>Commissions.</hi> It was the rich mans ruine,
not that he robbed the poor, but that he
did not relieve them. Fasting as well as
fulness may breed diseases, and make work
for the <hi>Sexton</hi> or <hi>Physitian.</hi> Not onely the
commission of evill sinks men to Hell, but the
omission of goodness. The Fig-tree had no
bad fruit on it, and yet was cursed because
it had none at all; the forbearance of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
is not enough to acquit the soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105071:15"/>
there be a performance of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
These <hi>Jews</hi> are condemned, not for
wasting <hi>Gods</hi> House, but letting it lye waste.
That's the <hi>first,</hi> the sin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing is the aggravation of
this, by their self-seeking. <hi>Ye run every man
to his own House,</hi> or, <hi>Ye take pleasure every man
in his own House:</hi> Ye are all self-seekers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate-spirited
persons, all for your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
none for the honour and glory of <hi>God.</hi>
They were like the Tortoyse, <hi>Toti in se,</hi>
wholly drawn up into themselves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of the publike good, or common
danger of Church and Religion: Far from
<hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s temper, who drowned all selfe-respect
in <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and the publick good;
far from true goodness, which will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
spirited, although it be to private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage:
And if nature will venture its
own particular good for the general, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
things will ascend, to keep out a vacuity
and preserve the Universe; much more will
grace make men in all their desires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to study Gods end more then their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105071:15"/>
own, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to build Gods
House first, and afterward their own; and
not like these <hi>Jews,</hi> who so themselves were
warm in their Feathers, in their own houses,
never did regard the ruines of Gods House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This self-seeking is aggravated
in two particulars; <hi>First,</hi> In the persons
guilty; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> In their earnestness in
that guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the persons guilty. The <hi>first</hi>
universally; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Emphatically.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Ye;</hi> universally; every man of you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the best of you, <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi>
too. When all Flesh have corrupted their
way, when all the foundations are out of
course, when as in <hi>Sodom,</hi> all the people from
every quarter, both old and young, are
guilty; no wonder then that God punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
When not onely private men, but
publick run into the same sin, it is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
as to man, those that should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it being themselves guilty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then it is time for God to lay to his
hand; for private men to have private spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105071:16"/>
and to run every man to his own House,
to mind their own particular good, is no
such rare thing, but for publick persons to
have private aims, to have such narrow souls
as to mind themselves only, this is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of the crime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Ye,</hi> emphatically; Ye that are
so much concerned in it, when others not
so much, or not at all concerned in it, have
been so zealous. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi>
a payr of outlandish, and Heathen Kings,
shall not onely give leave to the <hi>Jews</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their Countrey, and build both
their City and Temple, but also restore the
Vessels and Jewels, which had been taken
from it, and allow the expences of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out of their own Revenues; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with Sacrifices, with a check to
all Adversaries; be ye far from thence, and
a peremptory Decree, That whosoever
should alter that sentence, that the Wood
should be pulled down from his House and
he hanged thereon; And lastly, a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
imprecation on all those, whether Kings
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105071:16"/>
or People, that should put their hands to
alter and destroy the House of God which
is in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> the History whereof you
may read at large in the books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and
<hi>Nehemiah;</hi> when these shall thus zealously,
and earnestly promote the work, and the
<hi>Jews</hi> themselves universally, who were most
concerned, be careless and negligent, this is
a first aggravation of the sin.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> is their diligence and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in their own private interest, <hi>Ye run e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man, &amp;c.</hi> When ye do not so much as
creep, crawl, or go to Gods House. They
thought no time, no labour, no cost, too
much for their own House; and every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
portion of either of them too much for
Gods. The least cost is esteemed mispent,
saying with <hi>Judas, To what purpose is this wast;</hi>
the lazyest labour is accounted lost. <hi>It is in
vain to serve the Lord, and what profit is it
that we have kept his Ordinance,</hi> say these
very men, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. The shortest time is
thought cast away; <hi>The time is not come,
The time that the Lords House should be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105071:17"/>
built,</hi> say they, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. They followed the
business of their own Houses earnestly and
industriously, but of Gods very negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
which, if nothing else; were enough to
condemn them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> considerable in the sin, is the
proportion between that and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">

in the Famine to have kept the more for
themselves; and they had less for keeping
from him, that which was his own. A just
hand of God upon all such, who think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing too much for his service, for the
most part they are alwayes in want and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
their wealth melting away like Snow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sun. The Merchant that denyes to
pay his Customs, forfeits all his Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
they forfeit their own portion, who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105071:17"/>
with-hold Gods from him. God tames his
Prodigals, and starves their bodies, who
by neglect of his worship starve their owne
souls; God denies the same external things
to them which they deny to Gods House.</p>
            <p>But might not these <hi>Jews</hi> have pleaded
against this Sentence, and charged God
with too much severity, saying with their
Forefathers, <hi>The way of the Lord is not equal?
What is this Temple more then another place?
Cannot we worship God in any House as well as
this? Is not God a spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh</hi> 4. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and will be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in spirit and truth;</hi> and that we may do
in any Mountain as well as this?</p>
            <p>Whereunto although it might be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
answer to say with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>O man,
who art thou that replyest against God? Shall
the thing formed say to him that formed it,
why hast thou made me thus?</hi> Shall sinful man
plead with his Maker? Yet because this
malapert sauciness is the temper of many in
this age, as well as that; that the most just
God may be justified when he speaketh, and
clear when he judgeth, we may take notice
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105071:18"/>
of the equity of it, by a twofold conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<hi>First,</hi> Of the nature of the place;
and <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the nature of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Gods equity will be cleared from
the nature of the place, which was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A visible sign and token of Gods
more immediate and gracious presence; for
although God dwels not in Temples made
with hands; that is, so as we dwell in our
Houses to be comprehended in them, yet
God is sayed to dwell there where he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
himself; and therefore what was done
before the Temple, was sayed to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; called therefore, <hi>The Throne of
his Glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 21.</note> 
               <hi>The place of his rest;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 132. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The place of
his habitation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa 76. 2.</note> 
               <hi>His dwelling place:</hi> Now we
know that affronts offered to the Kings
Chayre of State although in his absence, are
as much resented as when he is present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That House was the choisest,
and chiefest instrument of Gods worship in
the Jewish administration, they were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
all their worship towards it: It was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105071:18"/>
the King of Heavens Court of Requests, which
he had appointed for the hearing their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and granting their Petitions; and which
had the priviledge of an universally gracious
audience; <hi>In this place will I give peace,</hi> saith
the Lord, c. 2. 9. Now because the honour
done to any part of Gods service reflects on
himself; as those that offered any polluted
bread on Gods Altar are sayed to despise his
name, therefore to punish this offence so
grievously could be no over much severity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That House was a type of <hi>Christ,</hi>
it was a sacred Mystery representing their
<hi>Messiah</hi> to them, who was the true Temple
made without hands; as himself makes the
application, <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Destroy this Temple,
and after three dayes I will raise it up;</hi> which
S. <hi>John</hi> who was his beloved Disciple, and lay
in his bosome, interprets as meant of his own
body, <hi>Vers.</hi> 21. <hi>He spake of the Temple of his
body;</hi> And this the Apostle asserts at large, in
the ninth Chap. of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.
Jesus Christ</hi> was that true Temple in which the
God-head dwelt bodily; that is, <hi>really, fully,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105071:19"/>
substantially;</hi> by the neerest union, and most
intimate conjuction as the soul dwels in the
body; and so the neglect was the neglect of
<hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That place was the spring-head
of all their blessings; God had made that the
staple of all his favours;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24.</note> 
               <hi>In all places where I
record my name, I will come to thee and bless thee.</hi>
From whence it is that in Scripture, Gods
blessings are not said to be given from Heaven
immediatly, but from <hi>Syon</hi> the place of <hi>Gods</hi>
worship; <hi>There the Lord commanded the
blessing, even life for evermore, Psal.</hi> 133. 3.
<hi>And the Lord that made Heaven and Earth, bless
thee out of Syon, Psal.</hi> 134. 3. The Ocean of
blessing is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but the well-head is <hi>Syon,</hi>
and so by neglecting <hi>Gods</hi> House they forsook
their own mercy; so that the nature of the
place acquits the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of over-rigorous proceeding, which
likewise will appear,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the nature of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if we shall consider those veins of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which run through it, which is the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105071:19"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> general part, and is included in
the scope and designe of the words of my
Text.</p>
            <p>And this mercy is visible in four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the Judgment it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the matter of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the measure of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the discovery of the cause,
and consequently the means of removing
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It was mercy that they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at all, correction being a signe of
Gods paternal care; <hi>For every Son, whom he
loveth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>he Chastneth; and Scourgeth every Son
whom he receiveth.</hi> Immunity from Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Correction, is the Bastards, not
the Childs prerogative. Gods forbearances
are his most dreadful Severities; and a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
iniquity is the most unprosperous
condition in the world. It is cruelty, not
mercy, to suffer men to go on in sin unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it being that which hardens men in sin,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105071:20"/>
and consignes them over to ruine and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
It is a deplorable condition when
God shall say; <hi>Why should ye be stricken any
more? ye will revolt more and more. Vis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignantis
Dei terribilem vocem audire?</hi> will you
here the terrible voice of a provoked God?
Hear it saith <hi>Origen</hi> in that of <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>I
will not punish your Daughters when they commit
whoredome.</hi> Never was <hi>Jerusalem's</hi> case so des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
as when God sayd to her; <hi>I will
make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy
shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and
will be no more angry. Ezek.</hi> 16. 42. That's
the first beame of mercy; that they are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second,</hi> is that their Punishment is in
external temporal things, and not in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Spiritual, which as they are most
necessary, so the loss is most dangerous: Man
may be happy without the one, he cannot be
so without the other. The <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> might
instead of a famine of bread have sent a famine
of the word of God, which is the Souls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
food, and without which it cannot live,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105071:20"/>
which he threatens in another Prophet as the
most dreadful Famine.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Am.</hi> 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the day is come,
saith the Lord, that I will send a Famine in the
Land, not a Famine for Bread, nor a thirst for
Water, but of hearing the Word of the Lord.</hi> We
never fear a dearth if we have Bread-Corne,
though we want Apples and Plums. Let God
deny us the worldly toyes of earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if he continue his spiritual blessings,
we cannot be esteemed miserable.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> Island of mercy appearing in this
Sea of misery, is the measure of it. <hi>They had
a little, though not much;</hi> God did not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all, but left them a pittance, as we say,
enough to keep life and soul together. <hi>I will
correct thee in measure,</hi> saith God to his people,
<hi>and not leave thee altogether unpunished.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 30. 11.</note> If he
should have been extreame to have marked
what had been done amiss, he might have
utterly destroyd them as he did <hi>Sodome</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and set them forth as perpetuall
examples of divine vengeance, but it was of
the Lords mercies that they were not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 22.</note>
because his mercies fail not. There is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105071:21"/>
yet a <hi>fourth</hi> ray of mercy shining in this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that is the discovery of the cause,
which he doth not onely in respect of himself,
for the vindication of his justice, but also in
respect to them, that they might provide for
deliverance. God by reason of that indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
dominion, which he hath over all his
creatures, which in their very being depend
upon him, hath no obligation lying on him,
to give any other reason of his acting, than
his <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo;</hi> and therefore it must
be an act of great mercy, to come to debate
and reason with his creature, to be content
to bring himself as it were before mans tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
and to plead his cause, and make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
sinners his judges, yet so he doth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>Come now,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and let us reason together.</hi> And
now,<note place="margin">Esa. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>O Inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of
Judah, judge I pray you between me and my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</hi>
Should he have made short worke with
them, and dispatcht them in a moment, yet
he would have continued just and holy, and
he might have justified his proceedings; but
to stoop so low as to give an account of his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105071:21"/>
doings, and to render a reason of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
is a condescention of mercy that can be
never expressed, and never enough admired,
or praised.</p>
            <p>And thus having run through the two
Stages of my Text, <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> I
cannot dismiss you without making you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of some observations, which you may
improve to your advantage, As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That all the industry and labour of
man in his calling, is in vain, if God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his blessing; he may sow, and reap, and
bring in too, he may export, nay import
too, and little come of it, if God do but
blow upon it. Not but that men may, nay
must take paines in their vocations. <hi>Adam</hi>
even in his innocency and integrity, before
his fall, had his employment set out to him
to dress and keep the Garden; much more
since the fall, when all the Creatures are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curse for the sin of man; and the
earth is so farre from yeelding fruit without
our labour, that it is often fruitless, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
with it. So that now it is not so much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105071:22"/>
our curse as our duty, that in the sweat of our
brows we should eat our bread, and he that
will not labour, as he doth not deserve, so
he hath no promise that he shall eat: Labour
then they must, but in that they must depend
upon God for the success, whose blessing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can make rich.<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Moses,</hi> saith, <hi>It is not bread
that man liveth by only, but by the word of God,</hi>
that is his blessing; and therefore, <hi>except the
Lord build the House and watch the City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 127. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>mans
labour and watching is to no purpose;</hi> It is but
lost labour that ye rise early, and so late take
rest, and eat the bread of Carefulness if God
doth not give sleep. Joyne then to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
labour, trust in God, and fear not a good
success; you have King <hi>Davids</hi> warrant for
it. <hi>Trust in the Lord and do good, and verily
thou shalt be sed. Psa.</hi> 37. 3.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note> Let your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as well as the Creatures for which you
labour, be Sanctified by the word of God,
and Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The use or abuse, the care or
neglect of the Instruments of Gods worship,
is no indifferent thing, no matter of slight
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105071:22"/>
consequence it procures a blessing or brings
down a curse. These Jewes neglect to build
Gods House, and God neglects to provide
for their Families. They no sooner go up to
the Mountain and bring Wood,<note place="margin">c. 2. 8.</note> and begin to
build, but from that very day, <hi>God</hi> begins
to bless them. Take one instance more; The
Arke, which before the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was the dwelling place of <hi>Gods</hi> name,<note place="margin">Psa. 74. 7.</note>
was among the <hi>Philistins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam 5.</note> who profanely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
and triumph over it, and are smitten
with sore diseases, and the hand of <hi>God</hi> is
heavy upon them;<note place="margin">c. 6. 19.</note> Afterwards it comes to the
<hi>Bethshemites,</hi> who are bold with it and pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its secrets,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 9. 9.</note> and fifty thousand of them are
slain for it. After this <hi>Vzzah</hi> toucheth it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently,
and is struck dead before it;
whereas <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> entertains it reverently,
and cheerfully,<note place="margin">vers. 6.</note> and is blessed in all that he
hath. When <hi>God</hi> sends the instruments and
means of Religion among a people, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
them deeply to look about them; <hi>God</hi>
intends something towards them, either of
judgment or mercy, and counts it an high
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105071:23"/>
indignity, if men think he will do neither
good or evil.<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 12.</note> The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> compares
<hi>Gods</hi> Word to Rain,<note place="margin">Esa 55. 10.</note> which returns not voyd,
but accomplisheth what he pleaseth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers
in the thing whereunto he sends it; it
either brings up wholsome Herbs, or noysom
Weeds, it either furthers our Salvation, or
hastens our Destruction. The Gospel of
<hi>Christ</hi> is savour either of life unto life,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> or of
death unto death. <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances are all
of the same nature, with the Lords Supper,
they are either for the better,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 17.</note> or for the worse.
<hi>Christs</hi> coming to a Nation,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 23.</note> as to <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
is fatal, it either lifts neerer to Heaven, or
throws lower into Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The neglect of <hi>Gods</hi> worship for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
all our temporal estate; as Tenants that
refuse to do their homage, to perform Suit
and Service, and to pay their Land-lords rent,
do make their Estates lyable to a seizure.
These outward blessings are the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Gods</hi> worship; And it is piety onely
which hath the promises both of this life and
that which is to come. These provisions are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105071:23"/>
properly for Gods Household, and those
that wait in the House of the Lord; If a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
person that regards not Gods worship
hath them, it is but at adventures, and they
are so farre from beeing a blessing to him that
they become a Snare, making him fall into
many foolish and hurtful lusts,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 9.</note> which drowne
men in destruction and perdition: search
the Chronicles and Annals of the Kings of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
and you shall still find those times wherein
Religion was advanced, as under <hi>David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
Asa, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah,</hi> to be
prosperous times, whereas under Idolatrous
Kings all things went contrary. So that the
best way to secure what men have, is to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
part of it in <hi>Gods</hi> service: Honour <hi>God</hi>
with all thy encrease, and thy Estate shall be
increased. <hi>Gods</hi> Storehouse is the best Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance-Office;
pay thy dues to that, and the
rest will be secured to thee. As <hi>Samson's</hi>
strength and glory lay in his Haire, so doth
the honour and prosperity of your City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the true Religion, and sincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>God,</hi> which if it be once deprived of,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105071:24"/>
it may say with <hi>Phinees</hi> Wife <hi>Ichabod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>The glory
of London is departed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, God</hi> expects that our first care
should be for his service, that his glory and
worship should have the precedency in our
thoughts. These <hi>Jews</hi> upon their return home
from <hi>Babylon,</hi> set up their own Houses, fell
to husbandry, plowed and sowed their lands,
they thought it not time to undertake so costly
a work as building the Temple; and flesh
and blood might have thought that delay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
if not reasonable, but <hi>God</hi> counts it
matter of just exception, and sends them two
Prophets to reprove them for it; what an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
excuse had they? That that <hi>God</hi> who
had dwelt so long of old in a Tabernacle, and
was now worshipped at his new created Altar,
would bear with them if they first built their
own Houses, intending afterwards to build his
with greater care and cost; but what saith
<hi>God</hi> to them, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to
dwell in your Ceiled Houses</hi> (not covered only,
but Ceiled with Cedar, as the Chaldee renders
it, arched and garnished as the Greek) <hi>and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105071:24"/>
my House to lye waste.</hi> The man after Gods own
heart was of another mind, he would not
come into his House, nor go up unto his bed,
nor give sleep to his eyes, or slumber to his
eye-lids,<note place="margin">Psa. 132. 3. 5.</note> until he had found out a place for
the Lord,an habitation for the mighty God
of <hi>Jacob. Noah's</hi> first care after he came out
of the Arke, was, not to build an House for
himselfe, but an Altar for Gods worship;
he pleads not necessity of preserving store,
nor stays till the creatures are multiplyed,
but takes of every clean creature that came
out of the Arke, and offers them to God.
True Faith teacheth to prefer God before our
selves; the World as it is inferiour in worth
to Religion, so it must be in our repute and
respects; <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and
the righteousness thereof,</hi> was the councel of our
<hi>Saviour.</hi> God will crown such early piety
with encrease of store, <hi>for all these things shall
be added unto you:</hi> If the Widow make a little
Cake for the Prophet first,<note place="margin">2 K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs. 17. 14.</note> and bring it to

her Cruise of Oyl fail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105071:25"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the not repairing the House of
God be so severely punished, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of those that demolish his Houses:<note place="margin">Pet. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If
the Innocent be scarcely saved, where shall the
wicked and sinner appear?</hi> is S. <hi>Peter's</hi> way of
arguing. If the labours and hopes of these
<hi>Jewes,</hi> who onely suffered the Temple to lye
in its ruines, come to little, certainly theirs
shall come to nothing, or at least worse than
nothing, eternal destruction, that are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of ruining it. If God shall destroy
him that defileth the Temple of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3 17.</note> what
shall he do to them that destroy it? If <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> withholding that which was
their own, were accounted Church-robbers,
and punished with sudden death; what a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
revenger will God be against those that
rob the Temple of that which hath been dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to it by others; <hi>Christ</hi> would not suffer
Gods House, which was to be called an House
of prayer to all Nations, to be made a den of
thieves, by prophane usage of it, much less
will he endure to have it destroyed after he
hath reformed it; this is sacriledge, and that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105071:25"/>
the Apostle ranks with Idolatry, as being
full out as evil, if not worse than it; for what
Idolatry but pollutes, sacriledge quite pulls
down; and easier it is to new hallow a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
polluted, than to build a new one out of
an heap of stones.</p>
            <p>Once more, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If the flood of Gods
indignation ariseth so high against those that
suffer the material Temple dedicated to his
service to be waste, how shall it rage against
them that do not repair his spiritual Temples,
their own souls and bodies which have been
consecrated to him in Baptism; for so saith
the Apostle, <hi>Ye are the Temples of the living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note>
as God hath sayd, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk
in them:</hi> And God takes more delight in these,
than in the other. For, <hi>thus saith the high and
lofty one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 57. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is
holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him
also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.</hi> And
he refuseth all the services that are done him
in his external Temple, as an abomination; if
the spiritual Temple be defiled with sin and
demolished by inquity. Sin not onely defiles
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105071:26"/>
but destroyes these Houses of God, let us
therefore build them againe by our sincere
Repentance and Reformation, let us cleanse
them from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit:
we cry, shame! to see a Church turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Barn, or Stable; to see a Christian all for the
world is no better sight; Let us take heed
that we do not make this House of God a Den
of Theeves, a Brothel House for uncleaness,
a Cage for unclean Birds, but let us adorne
it with all the grace of Gods Spirit, for
Holiness becometh the Lords House for ever.
Especially since the ruines of this Spiritual
House will draw with it the ruines of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
as God threatens the <hi>Jewes</hi> to do to their
Temple,<note place="margin">Jer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 12, 14</note> as he did unto <hi>Shiloh</hi> for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of his people <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to close up all. If any man
shall think this concernes him not; because
God sends no Prophets now to tell us that
for such and such sins, God sends such and
such Judgments. Let him know, that <hi>all
these things</hi> that are recorded in the Prophets,
<hi>happened unto them for examples, and are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105071:26"/>
written for our admonition upon whom the ends
of the world are come.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. when
therefore we may see a paralel of sins and
punishments with those registred in sacred
writ: we may without presumption conclude
that those sins were the provoking cause of
those Judgments. And here the Paralel is
so visible, that he that runneth may read;
and I make no question but your owne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
have run Paralel with my discourse
so that most of my labour that way is already
saved.</p>
            <p>For is it not the general complaint, and
out-cry of this City, that there is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
decay of Trade? Do not the Merchants
complain? <hi>we looke for much,</hi> and that upon
good ground; for we have sent forth our Ships
richly laden and ventured them on long
and dangerous Voyages; <hi>but lce it comes to
little,</hi> our Ships return not, or if they do,
the income doth not answer the expence,
our Commodities hardly yeeld what they
cost. Doth not the Shop-keeper complain?
<hi>we look for much,</hi> having taken Houses at great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105071:27"/>
Prices and Furnished our shops with rich
wares, <hi>but loe it comes to little,</hi> there are few
Buyers, and but small gaines, we can scarce
pay our rents. Doth not the Handicrafts man
complain <hi>we look for much,</hi> for we labour hard
and work good and sufficient wares; <hi>but loe
it comes to little;</hi> The Shop-keeper will not buy
but at his own rates; so that we have little
more than our labour for our Paines. And that
which adds to the unhappiness of all this is,
that every one of these is apt to impute this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
to any thing, rather than the right cause
and so hinder themselves of the true remedy,
because they will not understand the true
cause of the distemper: Either a Forreigne
Nations ingrossing Trade abroad, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
neglect of Trade at home must bear
the blame; who is it that considers that <hi>Gods
House lyes wast, while every man runs to his owne
House?</hi> Gods House said I, nay Gods Houses,
how many of them lie in their ruines, in their
rubbish? for we must not fancy that God
hath no Houses now, and that because that
Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> together with it's Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105071:27"/>
worship is abolished that God hath
not adopted any other places, which he will
own for his; for before the foundations of
that Temple were laid, and since they have
been razed, and one stone not left on another
which was not thrown downe, God always
had a place appropriated to his worship,
and where he was pleased to afford a more
gracious Presence than elsewhere. Even in
Paradise, <hi>Adam</hi> had a place to present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before God. Which was called <hi>Gods
Presence or Face. Gen.</hi> 3. 8. From which he
hid himselfe, for from Gods general presence
nothing can be hid, but all things are naked
and open. And his Sons out of Paradise
had their places where to bring their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3. From which when <hi>Cain</hi>
stood excommunicate for the Murther
of his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he is said <hi>to be cast out
from the presence of the Lord. Vers.</hi> 16. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
besides Altars in several places, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a grove, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 23. To be a fixt place
for Gods worship, for there he called on the
name of the Lord. And so it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105071:28"/>
by one that was no great friend to our
Churches.<note place="margin">Ainsworth in l c.</note> And afterwards when he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to offer his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> the very Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is prescribed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 1. and Gods
title to it ceased not with that one act, for there
<hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was afterwards built, which
God in my Text calls his House; nor did it
then begin, if we may believe the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Jewish Rabbins,<note place="margin">Maimony in misnoth l. 8. and in Treatise of the Temple, c. 2. s. 2.</note> who assert that to
be the place where <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> nay <hi>Adam</hi>
himself offered: When <hi>Jacob</hi> consecrated that
place where he saw the Vision of the Ladder
reaching to Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. he called
it <hi>Beth-el, Gods House,</hi> the ground of which
both consecration and name is rendred, <hi>Vers.</hi>
16, 17. <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place and I
knew it not, how dreadful is this place? This is
none other, but the House of God, the gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
So that Gods Houses began not with the
Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> no nor that ambulatory
Temple of <hi>Moses</hi> the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Psa. 66. 13.</note> which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
by <hi>David</hi> called <hi>Gods House;</hi> nor while
they were in being, did they ingross that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to themselves, for there were both in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105071:28"/>
and in other places of the Land no
small number of Synagogues for the People to
resort unto for their Devotions, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Synagogues of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 74. 8. Psa. 83. 12.</note> and <hi>Houses of God,</hi> in the
Plural Number: and these were Frequented
by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles as well as the
Temple. And since the Destruction of that
Temple, God was never destitute of Houses
for his Worship. True it is that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times of Christianity, when they had
not the Publick allowance and Countenance
of authority, they could exercise their
Religion only in Private, yet then they had
places for the Saints to meet in for Divine
Worship, such were the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the upper-roomes
mentioned so frequently in the Acts
of the Apostles, and distinguished by St. <hi>Paul</hi>
from Private Houses. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>Have
ye not Houses to Eat and Drink, or despise ye the
Church of God?</hi> understood by most Interpreters
both ancient and modern of the publick place
of Gods Worship; those perhaps not so sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptous
and stately as afterwards, the Churches
mean Condition and the worlds envy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105071:29"/>
would not permit that, but such as their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
would allow they had. But when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to raise up Kings and Emperours to
favour sincerely the Christian Faith, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
were then erected in all places, and no cost
spared, nothing thought to deere which that
way was spent and these were called <gap reason="foreign">

the Lords from whence the <hi>Scots Kirke</hi> and our
<hi>English Church</hi> doth proceed, and is the same
title which is given to his day <hi>Rev</hi> 1. 10;
And not improperly since we find the place
and time of Gods Worship Joyned together
by the Holy Ghost in Scripture,<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 30. 8, 26. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ye shall keep
my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary;</hi> and
then what the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith of one may
be applied to the other, and we may say
<hi>why doth one place excel another?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclesasticus 33. 7.</note> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Lord they are distinguished, and
some of them he hath made high places and
hallowed them, and some of them he hath made
ordinary places. As the one is the Day of rest,
and when we hallow it, it is called <hi>Gods rest,</hi>
so the other when Consecrated to his name is
called <hi>Gods rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 132. 14.</note> 
               <hi>This is my rest for ever.</hi> And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105071:29"/>
such were those Houses in this City, which
are now wast, for they were Dedicated and
Consecrated to Gods service, in them the Saints
were assembled, the Gospel of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was
Preached, The Lords Holy Name was Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and the Sacraments of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
duly administred, to all which <hi>Christ</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel hath Promised a gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
<hi>Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the midst of them. Mat.</hi>
18. 20. And to this promise he hath set to his
seale by Converting to, and Confirming many
a Soule in the doctrine of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> from
these places. Now, that these are wast, is as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
as if writ in Text; but where to lay the
blame is not perhaps so easily discovered. To
impute it to the Magistracy of this City, this
Honorable Bench would be no less then <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum
Magnatum.</hi> Their Zeale in general is
Sufficiently evidenced by this place wherein
we are now Assembled; and in particular
many of them either by actual contribution,
or subscription, have testified abundantly their
respects to these Houses: And of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105071:30"/>
I have reason to have as good an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if their abilities were consonant to their
desires, when I consider their ancient zeal
while the City was Flourishing to these <hi>Houses
of God,</hi> how they opened their hands, and
filled with Blessings many Churches both at
home and abroad, both in their own and
forreign Countries; yet even the best Saylers
may be becalmed and want the gale of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to encourage them, to go up to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and bring wood, &amp;c. Your hearts I am
confident are good, it is but setting to your
hands, and the worke will be done. Do but
begin, and never feare the reproach of not
having wherewithal to finish; Do but lay
the first stone, and never distrust the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of that God who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi>
the Beginner and Finisher of every good
worke. When <hi>Moses</hi> was about Building the
Tabernacle, his charge was no more but this,
every one that is of a willing heart,<note place="margin">Exod. 35. 5.</note> let him
bring into the offering of the Lord, and they
brought in so fast both men and women, that
there was too much; and a proclamation was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105071:30"/>
made in the Camp that they should bring in
no more. When stuffe was to be provided for
the Temple,<note place="margin">1. Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is willing to consecrate his Service to the Lord.</hi>
and both Kings, Princes and People offered
abundantly and willingly, insomuch that he
for himselfe and them giveth thanks to the
Lord in this forme; <hi>Who am I,</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers 14.</note> 
               <hi>and what is my
People; that wee should offer so willingly?</hi> Do
but lead the way, and I doubt not but God
will stir up the hearts of others to follow;
there is not a Soul, that feareth God but the
Zeal of Gods House will eat it up, there will
be many a true hearted <hi>Araunah</hi> who will
offer not his land but his Timber for the
House of the Lord; The Rich out of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
will give more, and the poore Widdow
out of her Penury will give a mite. Even the
labourer out of his hire, the servant out of
his wages, and the souldiers out of their
pay, will dedicate somthing, as the two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> armies did.<note place="margin">2. Chr. 26. 28.</note> The
Living will lay up in store for themselves a
good foundation against the time to come,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105071:31"/>
that they may lay hold on Eternal life, and
the dying, (I perswade my selfe) will not
make a will, but <hi>Gods House</hi> shall have a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in it. Even, the covetous usurer will out of
compliance with the times, if not out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of conscience throw down some of his
Silver with <hi>Judas</hi> into the Temple: Do but
propose the meanes, and you have a great and
gracious King, the Churches nursing Father,
and faiths defender, who will promote the
worke, and rather than it shall not go on,
will with his Countryman <hi>Constantine</hi> the no
less religious than Magnificent Emperour, be
content to carry stones on his own shoulders
towards it. You have a Loyal and Religious
Parliament the Churches Nursing Mother;
ready to enact whatsoever shall be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them for the advancement of so great
and glorious a worke; nay do but set earnestly
about it, and God himselfe will go before
you to make the crooked places streight, and
to break in pieces the Gates of Brass,<note place="margin">Esa. 45. 2.</note> and to
cut in sunder the bars of Iron, that is, to
remove all rubs and impediments, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105071:31"/>
would hinder the foundation of the Temple
to be laid: and he also will lay the head-stone
thereof with shouting, saying, Grace, Grace
unto it. I cannot conclude better then with
the exhortation of this Prophet. <hi>c</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4.
<hi>Be now strong O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord,
and be strong O Josuah Son of Josedech the high
Priest and be strong all ye People of the Land,
saith the Lord, and worke for I am with you, saith
the Lord of Host;</hi> With you by my helpe,
and assistance; with you by my care and
acceptance; with you by my reward, and
recompence:<note place="margin">c. 2. 7.</note> for then will I fill these Houses
with Glory, dwelling and having a delight
in them, and in them will I give peace,<note place="margin">v. 9. vers. 19.</note> and
in them will I furnish you with plenty too:
and then happy would be the People that
are in such a Case yea blessed will this City
be, which hath this <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> to be
their God. Now to this <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

all Praise Honour and Thanksgiving now
