         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his promise
made to his people, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3151:3"/>
if they should <hi>turne unto
him, and keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
and do them: though
they were cast out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts of Heaven, yet he
would gather them thence,
&amp;c.</hi> I will touch a little on
them two verses, and then
come to that I meane to
dwell on, from the words
read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you turne unto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of mercy, but to those that re.+turne.</note> 
                  <hi>and
keepe my Commandements.</hi>
There is no promise of
mercy, but to those that
turne, the Scripture is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie
in deniall of
mercy to such as goe on in
their sins: Heaven could
not brooke the Angels
themselves having sinned,
and <hi>neither</hi> such, nor such
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3151:3"/>
                  <hi>shall enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven.</hi> Yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are there that blesse
themselves, that it shall
go well with them, though
they cast off all Gods
yoakes, and Divine bonds,
that might bow them to
better courses, as if words
were but wind; when we
see here God made his
word good against his
owne deare people, <hi>If yee
sinne I will scatter you to the
farthest parts of the world,</hi>
wee see in the former
verse.</p>
               <p>A proud, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sinful disposition, may
slight God, &amp; the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the word and all;
now when wee come to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3151:4"/>
threaten: but when God
comes to execute, will he
shake it off then? will
swearers, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and filthy persons
shake off the execution as
they can the threatnings?
God sayth none that are
such shal enter into heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>but his wrath shall smoake
against them, and shall
be as a fire that shall burne
to hell,</hi> against such persons
as <hi>blesse themselves</hi> in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
courses; and when
God comes to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they desire <hi>the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to fall upon them.</hi>
There are none more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
against the
threatnings, &amp; none more
base and fearefull when it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3151:4"/>
comes to execution. As
wee see in presumptuous,
prophane <hi>Belteshazer,</hi> that
was quaffing in <hi>the boules
of the Temple,</hi> and scorning
Religion, and God; when
there comes a hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the wall, <hi>his knees
knocke together, and his
joynts tremble:</hi> so let there
be any evidence of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and wee see all the
Tyrants in the booke of
God, and that have beene
in the world that have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
at religion, of all men
they are most disconsolate
and fearefull, as wee see in
<hi>Belteshazer</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>I beseech you therfore
take heede: God will
seale all his threatnings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3151:5"/>
with executions in due
time, as he did to his owne
people, what is the reason
wee should promise our
selves more immunitie
then they had?</p>
               <p>If yee turne and keepe my
Commandements, and doe
them. <hi>Here are three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
Though you were
were cast to the utmost parts
of the world, I will gather
you thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you turne.</hi> The holy
man <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> puts God
in mind of his promise, and
his argument is from the
like, and indeed from the
lesse to the greater: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
God would rather
of both performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
then his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3151:5"/>
because mercy is
his owne proper worke.
Now, as he had beene just
in punishing his people, so
he would be mercifull in
restoring of them againe;
therefore he saith, <hi>Returne
and keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and doe them, and
though yee were scattered to
the utmost parts of the earth,
yet I will gather you thence.</hi>
And hee did gather them
thence upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
he did performe his
promise at length.</p>
               <p>Beloved, the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of this yet
remaines; for this people
to this day, since the
death of Christ, since they
drew the guilt of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3151:6"/>
blood on them, they
are scattered about the
earth to every Nation, and
have not a foot of land of
their owne, but are the
scorne and hissing of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
notwithstanding this
promise will bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
God will bring
them againe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
calls it a kind of a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the conversion of the
Jewes. So it is true of us
all, though we were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
as dust, as wee shall
be, in the grave ere long
turned to dust, God will
gather the ashes, hee will
gather all those parts of
ours: even as his power
gathered his people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3151:6"/>
so his power at length
will gather us all; we have
his promise for the one, as
well as the other.</p>
               <p>Therfore let us comfort
our selves with the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this promise, for
the performance of the
grand promise of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
Indeede the
grand promise of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
is the ground
of the performance of all
other promises. As you
have it in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the dry bones: saith
God, <hi>I will cloathe these
dead bones with flesh and
skin, &amp;c. therefore I will
restore you againe.</hi> God
that will restore our dust,
and bring our bodies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3151:7"/>
that were scattered
here and there, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
us out of sicknes and
trouble, if it stand with
his glory and our good.</p>
               <p>Now, after the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he useth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
God from his word
of threatning and promise,
he comes to the argument
from their relation.</p>

to go to him for new
favours upon former; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee hath an infinite

much from men, as they
have not afterwards to
make good, but wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
honour God more,
then to goe to him with a
large faith, to fetch large
favours from him: the
more hee gives, the more
he can give, and the more
he is willing to give, <hi>To

more, then to goe to him

take this argument in our

hast redeemed us,</hi> not out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> the land
of the North, but with
the blood of thy Sonne,
from hell and damnation;
and therefore thou canst
redeeme us from this pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
misery, from these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
we may allege that
grand favour to all other
petty redemptions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they are. <hi>Hee that
hath given us Christ, that

all, how shall he not with him
give us all things else?

so large and bountifull as
to give us his own Sonne,
that gift to admiration, <hi>So,

cannot we plead with him
for all other favours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

things I will not presse fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh verse he
comes to presse it still, and
repeates that which hee
had said before, <hi>Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, let thine eare bee

It is a prayer, and thou art
<hi>a God hearing prayer.</hi> They
be thy servants, and thou
regardest thy servants.
Here are but a few petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in this large request:
<hi>remember,</hi> be <hi>attentive, and

of the prayer is spent in a
preparative considering
the Attributes of God,

reasons from the Word, of
promises and threatnings,

(if they come from

their force that GOD
should regard them) and

when men joyne together,
they offer a holy kind of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3151:13"/>
violence to God: prayer
is a kinde of wrastling, and
contending with God, a
striving with him. <hi>Let me
alone</hi> saith God to <hi>Moses.</hi>
It is a binding of him with
arguments, and promises
of his owne; and it is so
forcible that he desires (as
it were) to bee let alone:
Now if the prayer of one,
be a wrestling, and striving
and forcing of him, as it
were against his will, (that
he said, <hi>Let me alone;</hi> as if
he could doe nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he gave over pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
What are the prayers
of many, when there is a
multitude of them?</p>
               <p>Therfore we may looke
for a comfortable issue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3151:13"/>
of our prayers, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
that is performed
at this time. The desires
of so many Christian
soules touched with the
spirit of God, and with
the case of the Church
(which God doth tender)
cannot bee unefectuall, it
must needs draw plenty of
blessings from heaven. I
will not enter into the
common place of prayer,
having spoken of it upon
another occasion: but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you see the holy man
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> stood so much
upon it, that hee hoped to
speede, because hee, and
others prayed; (holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
and others with him)
It was such a gracious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3151:14"/>
messenger to send to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for helpe and for all
good, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> though
it cost him his life, that he
should be cast into the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
den, hee would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it for his life. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
prayer, and take away
the life and breath of the
soule; Take away breath,
and the man dies: as soone
as the soule of a Christian
beginnes to live he prayes.
As soone as <hi>Saul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<hi>behold hee prayeth.</hi>
A child as soone as hee is
borne, hee cryes; and a
Christian will not loose
his prayer for his life, as
we see in holy <hi>Daniell.</hi> For
what is all the comfort
that he hath, but that that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3151:14"/>
is derived from God? and
God will be sued unto for
all the favours hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes:
Whatsoever is
from his favour it comes
as a fruit of prayer (for the
most part) though he goe
beyond our desires many
times: yet ordinarily what
we have if we bee his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
we have it as a fruit
of prayer. Therefore I
beseech you let us be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to this dutie, as we
see <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here, <hi>remom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the prayer of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,

               </p>
               <p>And when wee pray to
God, let us presse him, as
we see here, <hi>bee attentive,</hi>
verse 6. and here againe,
<hi>be attentive,</hi> he presseth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

God. It is no sinfull

and againe. God loves
to heare the same song a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe; this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
is nottedious, but
pleasing to him. And this
pressing is for us to warme
our hearts, perhaps one
petition will not warme
them, and when they are
warmed by a second, let
us labour to warme them
more and more, and never
give over till we have tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly

When one comes with a

without a desire for the

all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he comes as Gods
enemie: hee comes as it
were with his dagge to
shoote at God, hee comes
with his weapon. Who
will regard the petition

wound him at the same
time? Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a man comes
to God with a purpose to
sinne, he comes to wound
God at the same time as an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3151:19"/>
enemie, and is hee like to
speede? For what are our
sinnes, but that that makes
us enemies to God? they
are oposite to him as can
be, they make us hateful to
God. Therfore we must be
able to say with good <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
when we come to
God to make it good that
wee are servants indeede,
<hi>We desire to feare thy name.</hi>
As <hi>Ieremias</hi> tells them,
<hi>Ier. 7. Will you steale and
oppresse and commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet stand before me?</hi>
will you doe this and this
villany, and stand before
me? <hi>What hast thou to doe</hi>
(saith God) <hi>Psalme 50. to
take my name into thy mouth
and hatest to be reformed?</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:3151:19"/>
If we hate to be reformed,
and do not desire to serve
God for the time to come,
what have wee to doe to
take his name into our
mouthes, especially in the
holy exercise of prayer?
<hi>Psalme 66. If I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
in my heart, the Lord
will not heare my prayer.</hi> If
a man doe but regard to
live in iniquitie for the
time to come, the Lord
will not heare his prayer.
Therefore if wee will bee
able to prevaile with God
in our petitions, we must
say with holy <hi>Nehemiah,
Wee desire for the time to
come to feare thy name.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:3151:20"/>
And then (to omit other
things) <hi>Wee desire to feare
thy name,</hi> we see that</p>
               <p>REligion,<note place="margin">Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</note> especially is
in holy desires.</p>
               <p>The greatest part
of Christianity is to desire
to bee a sound Christian
with all his heart. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is more in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the soule, then in
the effects and operations:
It is more in the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and purpose of the
soule, then in any effects
wee can yeeld to God.
There is much desire in al
our performances: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3151:20"/>
saith the holy man
here, <hi>We desire to feare thy
holy name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why are desires, such
trialls of the truth of
Grace?</p>
               <p>Because they are the
immediate issues of the
soule:<note place="margin">Holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the imediate issues of the soule.</note> desires, &amp; thoughts
and such like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

help of the body, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any outward manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
they shew the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and frame of the soule.
Thereupon God judgeth
a man by his desires; and
that which he desires, if it
bee a true desire, hee shall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3151:21"/>
have and be partakers of.
The godly man desires to
serve God all the dayes of
his life; and for ever hee
shall doe it: a wicked man
desires to offend God if
he might live everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
God lookes upon him
as his desire is, he shall not
alway sinne here: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee hath an infinite
desire of sin, he shall bee
punished, in hell eternally;
God lookes upon him as
he desires, God values
men by their desires.</p>
               <p>But how are the truth
of these desires knowne?</p>
               <p>I will name a few signes.<note place="margin">Tryall of desires whether true.</note>
The truth of those desires
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3151:21"/>
may be tryed thus,<note place="margin">If constant</note> 
                  <hi>if they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
be constant desires, and not
flashes:</hi> for then they come
from a new nature. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is strong and firme:
Art is for a turne, to serve
a turne: when men perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a thing they doe it not
long; creatures that are
forced to doe so and so,
they returne to their own
nature quickly: but when
a man doth a thing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
he doth it constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
So constant desires
argue a sanctified frame
of soule and a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
they argue that
the image of God is stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
upon the soule. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
wee may know that
they are holy desires, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3151:22"/>
that they spring from a
holy soule, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
if they be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
desires, and not as a
torrent that is vented for
the present on a sudden,
and then comes to nothing
after: they are constant.</p>

and not onely strong
but <hi>growing desires;</hi> desire

<hi>Strong and growing desires
argue the truth of desires:</hi> as
indeede a childe of God

never faith enough, never
love enough, or comfort
enough, till he come to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3151:22"/>

desires more &amp; more:
the Spirit of God that is
the spring in him, springs
up still further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till it spring to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life, till it end in
heaven, where all desires
shall be accomplished, and
all promises performed,
and all imperfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
till then they are
growing desires still. <hi>Wee
desire to feare thy Name,</hi>
and to please thee in all
things.</p>
               <p>Againe, true desires,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>they are not onely of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
                  <note place="margin">If for grace as well as mercy.</note>
                  <hi>of God, but of graces
for the altring of our nature:</hi>
as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
not the favor of God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3151:23"/>
so much, as he desires to
feare Gods Name. Now
when desire is of graces, it
is a holy desire. You have
not the worst men, but
would desire with <hi>Balaam,</hi>
to dye the death of the
righteous, &amp;c. that they
might injoy the portion
of Gods people: but to
desire grace, that is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to corrupt nature, as
fire and water, this is an
argument of a holy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of grace in us, whence
this desire springs, when
we desire that, that is a
counter poyson to corrupt
nature, that hath an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
to corruption.
Therefore, when a man
from the bottome of his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3151:23"/>
heart can desire, oh! that
I could serve God better,
that I had more liberty to
serve him, that I had a
heart more inlarged, more
mortified, more weaned
from the world; Oh! that
I could feare God more.
And of all graces, if it be
a true desire, it is of such
graces as may curbe us of
our sinfull delights, and
restraine us of our carnall
liberty, and knit us neere
to God, and make us more
heavenly minded: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of these graces shew a
true temper of soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>True desire <hi>is carried to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
grace as well as glory,</hi>

Therefore wee pray <hi>Thy

and let <hi>thy Kingdome

a sweet prayer now ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the first petition,
<hi>the hallowing of Gods name,</hi>
when we desire more to
honour God, and to that
purpose that he may rule
in us more, and make us
better: these desires argue
an excellent frame of soul,
as we see in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> our
desire is to feare thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

a man hath holy desires of

because there goes the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie
of the Spirit with
it, to worke the graces he

               <p>Therefore a man may
know by his tast of divine

You cannot still a childe

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3151:26"/>
the Spirit of God is
effectuall by them, to

               <p>The comfortable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation

they may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by their desire to

God, and to serve
him: if their desires bee
true. Therefore in <hi>Isaiah

it to God, <hi>in the way of thy

thee, &amp;c. The desire of our

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:3151:26"/>
they bring it as a prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

when we come to God,
<hi>The desire of our soules is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thy Name.</hi> Lord our
indeavours are weake and

soules is to thy name,</hi> and
<hi>thou wilt not quench the

wee come to thee with
these weake and poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
that we have: <hi>The

of them that feare him, Psal.</hi>
145.<note place="margin">Psal. 145.</note> If they be but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
if they be true, and
growing, and constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and desires of grace
as well as of happinesse, as
I shewed before.</p>
               <p>The reason why God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3151:27"/>
accepts them, is partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they spring from his
owne spirit: <hi>these desires
they are the breathings of
the spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why God accepts of desires. Because they are the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of his Spirit.</note> For even as it
is in places where foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and springs are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they are knowne
and discovered by vapors,
the vapors shew that there
is some water there, some
spring, if it were digged
up: so these desires, these
breathings to God for
grace and comfort, these
spirituall breathings, they
shew that there is a spring
within, and spirit within,
whence these vapors and
desires come; therefore
they are accepted of God,
because they spring from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3151:27"/>
his owne Spirit.</p>
               <p>And because they are
pointed to heaven-ward,<note place="margin">Because they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the change of the soule.</note>
to shew that a man is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
for it is put here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of turning, <hi>Turne yee
to me, saith the Lord;</hi> and
he answereth here instead
of turning, <hi>My desire is to
feare thy name.</hi> Because,
when the desire is altered,
then the frame of the soule
is altered, a man is turned
another way; the desire
is the weight of the soule.
What carries the soule,
but desire? Now when
the soule is carried ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3151:29"/>
no. I said something of

I will adde a little

there be a good stamp on

them, to please <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:3151:30"/>
as a service to him: this
makes it good that we are
servants indeed, that the
relation is good. When
we goe about the service
of the Church or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or place we live in, to
thinke I doe God service
here, and doe it as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God, who will be
honoured and served in
our service to others:
herein I am a good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
though the matter of

yet it hath a stamp upon

of it bee an ordinarie
thing. I know it may
helpe the good of the
Church: it hath reference
to the will of God, and the
good of the Church. Thus
if wee doe what wee doe
with an eye to God in the

vs, that wee doe it as to
him, we are Gods servants
whatsoever the worke

               <p>And let us remember

(say they when they

<hi>dost thou not care that

when we can put God in
minde of our relation, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we are thy children,
Lord, we are thy servants;
it will strengthen our faith
and hope of all good. Will
a Master suffer his servant
to miscarrie in his service?
surely God will never
turne away true hearted
servants, that have served
him a long time. It puts
us in minde of our duty,
and serves to strengthen
our faith: for as it is a
word of fervice on our
part, so it is a promising
word of all good from
God. Doth he expect,
that Masters should bee
good to their servants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a Master

we have not power

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3151:33"/>
of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
to be in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to

to depend upon
him, to cast our selves on
him: to bring our soules
to close with the strong
and wise, and gracious
God, that God and our

And then commend all by
prayer <hi>to cast our selves and
our affaires, and to roll our

and then wee shall doe as

for successe, alas a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

from it; for successe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the application
of all things to a fit issue;
and foreseeing all things
that may hinder, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of them; now
who can do this but God?</p>
               <p>One maine circumstance
that besiegeth and besets a

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3151:34"/>
that stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a businesse? who can
see all circumstances of
time, and place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that are hindrances,
or furtherances? it must
bee an infinite wisedome
that must foresee them,
man cannot see them. And
when men doe see them,
are there not sudden passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that come up in men
that robbe them of the
use of their knowlege?
that though they know
them before: yet some
sudden passion of feare or
anger may hinder the
knowledge of a man, that
he is in a mist, when hee
comes to particulars: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee comes to apply the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3151:35"/>
knowledge that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he knowes not what
to doe. So that unlesse <hi>God</hi>
in a particular busines give
successe, (who is infinitely
wise and powerfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
al hindrances) there
will be no successe.</p>
               <p>As it is in the frame of
the body,<note place="margin">Simile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> it stands upon
many joynts, and if any be
out of tune, the whole

in a clocke, all the wheels
must be kept cleane and in
order: so it is in the frame
of a businesse, there must
all the wheeles be set a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if one be hindred
there is a stop in all. It is
so with us in the affaires
of this world, when wee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3151:35"/>
deale with Kings and
States, if all the wheeles
be not kept as they should
there will be no successe
or prosperity. <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
knew this well enough,
<hi>prosper</hi> thou therefore.</p>
               <p>He meant not to be idle
when he said this,<note place="margin">With our prayer for successe, wee must use the meanes.</note> 
                  <hi>prosper

his owne diligence, and
waited. Therefore joyne
that, if we would have our
prayers to God, and our
dependance upon him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
for prosperity and
successe, be carefully to use
the meanes, as he did, he
stands before the King,
and observed how he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
himselfe to see what
words would come from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3151:36"/>
the King; and then hee
meant after to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
whatsoever God
should discover.</p>
               <p>It should teach us (to
make this use of it) when
we deale in any matter,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to
goe to God to prosper it,
and give successe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and assistance, and
a blessed issue. For God,
that we may alway depend
upon him, he keepes one
part in heaven still: when
he gives us al likelihood of
things upon earth, yet he
reserves still the blessing,
till the thing be done, till
there be a consummation
of the businesse, he keepes
some part in heaven: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would have us
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3151:36"/>
sue to him, and be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him, he will have
us go up to heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we have daily
bread, we must pray for
daily bread; because the
blessing comes from him.
Our bread may choake us
else, we may dye with it
in our mouthes, as the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
did: but when we
have things, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on him for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
all is to no purpose
else.</p>
               <p>Let us learne by this a
direction to piety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walking with God: in
all things to pray to God
for a blessing. And to that
purpose we must be in
such a condition of spirit,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3151:37"/>
as we may desire God to
prosper us: that is,<note place="margin">In what condition of soule wee may expect prosperity from <hi>God</hi>
                  </note> we
must not be under the
guilt of sin when we come
to God to prosper us.
And we must be humble,
God will not prosper a
businesse till we be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
As in the case of the
<hi>Benjamites,</hi> when they
came, they were denyed,
the first, second, and third
time, till they prayed and
fasted, and were thorowly
humbled, they had their
suit denyed: If the cause
be never so good, till wee
be humbled, God will not
prosper it: because we are
not in frame for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
if we had it we would
be proud. God, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3151:37"/>
mercy and care
will grant nothing till we
be humbled. Therefore
let us see that we be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and see that the
matter be good that wee
beg God to blesse and
prosper us in, or else we
make a horrible idoll of
<hi>God,</hi> we make (with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be it spoken) a divell
of <hi>God.</hi> Doe wee thinke
that <hi>God</hi> will give strength
to an ill businesse? This
is to make him a factor for

worke: Wee must not
come with such strange

<hi>God,</hi> to the contrary
to that he is: but come
with humble affections,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3151:38"/>
with repentant soules for
our former sinnes. And
let the thing it selfe be
good, that we may come
without tempting of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
let the cause be such that
we may desire Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
without tempting
of him, as we do when
it is good and when we
come disposed. Then
com with a purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
all to his service.
Lord, if thou wilt blesse
me in this businesse, the
strength and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I have by it, I will
referre it to thy further
service. Let me have this
token of love from thee,
that I have a good ayme

               <p>IT is an excellent
poynt, if I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ime to
stand on it. I beseech
you let it have some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon your hearts.</p>
               <p>What is the reason that
God blasts, and brings to
nothing many excellent
endeavours, and projects?
men set upon the busines
of God, and of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in confidence of
their wit and pride of
their owne parts, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things in the pride, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3151:39"/>
strength of their parts.
Men come as Gods to a
businesse, as if they had no
dependance upon him for
wisedome or direction, or
strength; they carry things
in a carnall manner, in a
humane manner with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
spirits: therefore
they never find either suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
or not good successe.
Let us therfore commend
all to God, <hi>prosper thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
Before hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the businesse, holy
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he sowed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in Gods bosome, and
watered the seede with
mourning; as it is in this
chapter hee mourned and
prayed: when this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was sowne with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3151:39"/>
prayers, and watered with
teares, how could hee but
hope for good successe,
he mourned and prayed
to God, <hi>heare thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when wee deale
with things in a holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
wee may without
tempting God trust him.
That which is set upon in
carnall confidence and
pride, it ends in shame:
when men thinke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
things in witt, I, and
in faction, and humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
God will not be
glorified this way, God
will bee glorified by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dependant creatures,
that when they have done
the businesse will ascribe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3151:40"/>
all to him; <hi>Not unto us,
but to thy name give the
prayse.</hi> The direction and
assistance and blessing was
thine. Sayth God in <hi>Isay
50.</hi> towards the end, <hi>Goe
too now ye that kindle a fire,
walke in the light of your
owne fire: but bee sure you
shall end in sorrow.</hi> You
will kindle a fire of your
owne devises, and walke
in the light of your fire,
you will have projects
of your owne, and be
your owne caruers, but be
sure you shall lie downe in
darkenes and discomfort;
you shall lie downe in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>A proud unbroken
heart accounts these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3151:40"/>
poore courses: it is but
a course of weak and poore
spirits to pray and fast, and
humble themselves to
God, and to feare God:
alasse what are these?
these are weake courses: I
hope wee have stronger
parts, and meanes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things. So they have
a Kingdom in their braine.
What is the issue of these
vaine men, when God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
all their courses to
be vaine at length, to be
winde, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Prosper now thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
saith he.</p>
               <p>Let us learne this lesson
likewise. If wee come to
God in a particular busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that wee are not so
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3151:41"/>
confident in, to be pleasing
to God: yet in generall to
submit our selves, Lord
prosper thy servant, goe
before thy servant, let me
deale in nothing against
thy will, direct mee what
is for thy glory; and not
to prescribe or limit God.
<hi>Prosper thy servant this

               <head>And grant him mercy in

               <p>HEE comes more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
<hi>Grant me mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the sight of this man.</hi>
We see that</p>
               <p>A King is a great organ
or instrument to convay good
things from God (the King
of Kings) to men.<note place="margin">The King a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to convey good things fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God to to men.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore hee prayes
that God would give him
favour in the sight of the
King. For a King is the
first wheele that mooves
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3151:42"/>
all other wheeles, and as it
were the sunne of the
common wealth; or the
first moover that mooves
all inferiour orbes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in heavenly wisedome
he desires God to give him
favour with him. For if
he had that, the King
could turne all the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
orbes to his pleasure.
Indeede it were a point
worthy enlarging; but that
it is not so seasonable for
this time, the time being
already spent. You see
what great good God
conveyes by Kings and
Princes. And when God
meanes to doe good to a
Church or state, hee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
up <hi>nursing fathers and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3151:42"/>
nursing mothers,</hi> he wil raise
up both Kings, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<hi>Nehemiah's,</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, when hee hath
excellent things to doe.</p>
               <p>But the maine thing
here intended, which I
will but touch, is, That
considering they stand in
such a subordination to
God, as to be instruments
to convey so much good,
or so much ill, as they may
as it is said of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi>
they either cause others
to sinne, or to worshippe
God. Therfore we should
doe as good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> hee
prayes that he might finde
favour in his sight.</p>
               <p>A wise and holy prayer,
hee begins at the head, he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3151:43"/>
goes to the spring of all
good. <hi>Prayer is the</hi> mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
or <hi>ambassador of the
soule;</hi> beeing the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the soule, it goes
to the highest, to the <hi>King
of Kings</hi> first, to the <hi>Lord
of Lords</hi> first; it goes to
the highest moover of all:<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
and then desires him to
moove the next immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
subordinate moover,<note place="margin">In busines with great men looke first to God.</note>
that is, the King, that hee
may moove other orbes
under him, that things
may bee carried by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
sweet course to a
blessed issue. Therefore
the observation hence is
this. That <hi>when we have to
do any thing with great men,</hi>
with Kings, &amp;c. how ever
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3151:43"/>
                  <hi>beginne with the King of
Kings,</hi> and doe all in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
before wee doe it in
earth: for heaven makes
the lawes, that earth is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by. Let earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what it will, there
will be conclusions in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that will overthrow
al their conclusions. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in our prayers wee
should beginne with God,
and desire him with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and fervent intreaties,
that hee would set al a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that hee would set in
frame these inferiour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And when wee have
gotten what wee would
in heaven, it is easie to get
in earth. Let us win what
wee desire in heaven at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3151:44"/>
Gods hands, and then
what an easie thing is it to
worke with Princes, and
other governours in state,
when we have gotten God
once? hath not hee <hi>the
hearts of Kings in his hand
as the rivers of waters:</hi> to
turne this way or that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
way? As a skilfull man
derives water by this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
or by that, as he opens
a vent for the water. So
God opens a way to vent
the deliberations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of Kings and
Princes to runne this way
or that to this good or
to that, as hee pleaseth
Therfore considering that
there is an absolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all inferiour
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3151:44"/>
things from God, when
we have to do with Kings
or great men, let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
beginne with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Iacob</hi> when hee was
to deale with <hi>Esau,</hi> hee
falls down and prayes first,
and when hee had gotten
of God by prayer, God,
that <hi>makes even of enemies
friends,</hi> hee turned <hi>Esaus</hi>
heart, of an enemie to bee
a friend. And God put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Iacobs</hi> heart a wise
course to effect this, as to
offer a present, and to give
him titles, <hi>My Lord
Esau, &amp;c.</hi> God, when he
will effect a thing amongst
men, &amp; heare the prayers
that are made to him for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3151:45"/>
the favour of men, he will
put into their hearts such
waies whereby they shall
prevaile with men, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
did with <hi>Esau.</hi> So
<hi>Hester,</hi> before she goes to
<hi>Ahasueros,</hi> she gate in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
first by prayer, when
shee had obtained of God
by prayer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, how placable
and sweet was <hi>Ahasueros</hi>
to her? So we see in other
places of Scripture; when
holy men have beene to
deale with men, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with God.</p>
               <p>I beseech you therefore
learne this point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
wisedome; if you
would speede well (as we
all desire to speede well in
our businesse) especially
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3151:45"/>
those that have publike
imployments, that they
would pray to God, that
hath the hearts of Kings
and Princes in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and guidance, that he
would make them favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And not to thinke
to carry things in a violent
course; for then God doth
not usually give that good
successe: but to carry
things in a Religious
course to the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and then to know in
what termes to stand in all
inferiour things, as may
stand with the will of God
in heaven.</p>
               <p>If so be there bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
of all inferiours
to God; then we must not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3151:46"/>
offend God, and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
conscience for any:
because hee is <hi>King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
He doth not set up autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
against himselfe, to
disarme and disable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
he never went to set
up Gods under him, to
make him a Cypher, that
hee should make them
Gods, and God a man, or
no bodie; to alter all the
frame of things. He never
meant to set up any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to nullifie and make
himselfe nobodie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say wee ought to
pray to God for Kings,
that so in our obedience
we may be sure to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against conscience
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3151:46"/>
for any creature; we must
do all things that possible
can be, that may procure
the favour and ingraciate
us, because it is in vaine
to pray, unlesse wee use all
possible meanes to winne
their favour: but if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good tearmes,
Then <hi>whether to obey God or
man judge ye.</hi> And as the
three young men, <hi>wee take
no thought to answer in this
matter; our God can def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd
us if he will.</hi> And as <hi>Hester</hi>
said, <hi>If I perish, I perish.</hi>
When things are cleare,
we are to be resolute. Yet
reserving due respect to
Gods ordinance, and to his
lieftenant upon earth, I
say alwaies reserving due
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3151:47"/>
respect, and using meanes
to win favour, and also to
use prayer.</p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> hee
prayes here, and together
with that he attends upon
the King; as good <hi>Iacob</hi>
observed <hi>Esau:</hi> so all good
meanes must bee used, or
else God will not blesse
our proceedings.</p>
               <p>Remember, that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
gouernours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
they are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
and dependant,
and therefore they must
bee regulated by a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.
They are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
they are derivative:
they are dependant upon
God, they are derived
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3151:47"/>
from him. Therfore as the
Apostle saith that <hi>servants
must obey their masters in
the Lord.</hi> So wee must
obey, &amp; do all in the Lord;
that limitation must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
added: but reserving
that, it is a good thing to
pray that there may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from the King: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is of much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to bring businesse
to a good issue. And with
prayer there must be a
using meanes to get fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
alwaies with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to doe it so farre as
we can with preserving a
good conscience.</p>
               <p>As they have a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
among civilians,
there is a parting with a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3151:48"/>
thing <hi>Cumulativé</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vativé.
Cumulativé,</hi> that
is, when wee part with a
thing so, as that we reserve
the proprietie: <hi>privativé,</hi>
when wee give away the
proprietie and all. Now
so GOD parts with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
below, as to strip
himselfe, but <hi>cumulativé,</hi>
hee derives authority to
others, but reserves the
propriety to himselfe.
Therefore we must obey
them in him, and with this
limitation as it may stand
with his favour.</p>
               <p>To draw to a conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">A good Christian, is a good Statesman</note>
in a word. You see
here that any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be a good states<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in one good sence;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3151:48"/>
what is that? A good
Christian hath credit in
Heaven, and he hath a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of prayer, and his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can set God on worke,
and God can set the King
on worke, and hee can set
his subjects on worke.
Now he that can prevaile
with God, to prevaile
with the Gods upon earth
here: surely such a man
is a profitable man in the
state. And you know
God, he can alter all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and mould all things:
it is but a word of his
mouth. And what God can
doe, prayer can doe; for
prayer bindes God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the prayer of
faith: and faith (as it were)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3151:49"/>
overcomes God. Now
prayer is the flame of
faith; the vent of faith,
&amp; faith is a victorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
grace with God
himselfe. If it bee any,
it is Christians that can
prevaile with God for a
blessing upon a State; then
certainely there is no good
Christian but is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
service in the state,
though in particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he hath not pollicie,
and wisedom and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yet hee hath Gods
eare to heare him, and
hee can pray to God,
that God would make the
King, and other subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Magistrates, favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:3151:49"/>
You see what great
good, a good man may
doe in a State. <hi>The Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man delivers the Iland,</hi>
as it is in <hi>Iob.</hi> And the
<hi>poor wise man delivers the
citie,</hi> as it is in <hi>Eclesiastes.</hi> A
few holy gracious men,
that have grace and credit
in Heaven above, they
may moove God to set all
things in a blessed frame
below. And surely if this
holy meanes were used,
things would bee better
then they are: and till this
be used, we can never look
for the good successe and
issue of things that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we may hope for.</p>
               <p>Diverse things might
be spoken of the doctrinal
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3151:50"/>
part, I will give you but a
word of it. That God
hath our hearts in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
more then we
our selves.<note place="margin">God hath our hearts in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment more then wee our selves.</note> I speake it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our judgement in
a point of doctrine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God foresee and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of things below
upon foresight which
way they shall goe; or
whether hee foreordaine,
that they shall goe this
way, because hee directs
them thus; that is to make
God, God indeede: Hee
determines that these
things shall be, because he
determines in the series,
and order of causes to
bring things to passe, and
to guide Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3151:50"/>
and Magistrates, and all
this way. Againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God hath set all men
at liberty (in matters of
Grace especially) that they
may apply grace at their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which way they wil,
and in fore-sight which
way they will apply their
liberty to determine thus,
or thus of them. This
is to make every mans will
a God, and to divest God
of his honour, as if God
could foresee the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
foresight that hee
meant to incline it this
way, or that way.</p>
               <p>Can God foresee any
entitie, and thing that hath
a beeing in nature, or grace
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3151:51"/>
without foresight to direct
it this way or that way?
he cannot, this is to make
him no God. Wee see
God hath the hearts of
Kings in his power, and
that is the ground of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for grace to them. Why
should we pray for them,
if they could apply their
own will which way they
would? Why should wee
give thankes for that wee
have liberty to doe this
way, or that way? It
stopps devotion, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and thankesgiving, to
say that the creature hath
libertie to apply it selfe,
and God seeing it would
applie it selfe thus, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
so. Oh, no; wee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3151:51"/>
must goe to God, he hath
set down an order &amp; course
of meanes, and in the use
of those meanes desire
him to guide us by his
good spirit, to enlighten
our understandings, to
guide our wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by his holy spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our hearts are in his
governement more then
our owne. If it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to prove it, I could
prove it at large: if there
had beene such aliberty,
good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have made this prayer.
But God doth strangely
put thoughts and guide
all, even of himselfe: as
we may see excellently in
the storie of <hi>Hester)</hi> I will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3151:52"/>
give you but that example
and instance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) what a
strange thing was it that
<hi>Ahasueros</hi> could not sleep,
and when hee could not
sleepe to call for the book,
and then that hee should
reade of <hi>Mordecay;</hi> and
therupon to advance <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay:</hi>
all this tended to
the good of the Church;
it was a strange thing. And
so in other things. It is a
strange thing that God
should put little thoughts
and desires into great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and then follow it
with this circumstance,
and that, &amp; so bring things
to passe: all this is from
God Except we hold this,
that God rules al without,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3151:52"/>
and especially the hearts
of men, where it is his
especiall prerogative to set
up his throne: we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pray heartily, or give
thankes. And if wee doe
pray and give thankes, he
will put thoughts into go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
mindes, strange
thoughts and resolutions
for the good of the
Church, that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have thought off: nor
could come otherwise but
from the great God of
heaven and earth. We shall
see a strange providence
concurre to the good of
al. But I must leave the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of these things
to your own thoughts and
meditations.</p>
