         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

nationall Assembly, indicted
by his Majestie to be holden
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in Novem. 1638.
The some-time pretended Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Arch-bishops of
this Kirk were cited publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
throughout the Kirk of
this Kingdome, to compeare
before the said Assembly, for answering to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
given in against them to severall Presbyteries,
and by the presbyteries, according to the order of the
Kirk, referred to the generall Assembly. When the
Assembly was conveened some of these sometime
pretended Prelats, to wit, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Io. <hi>Spotswod,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pa.
Lyndsay,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Da. Lyndsay,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Io. <hi>Maxwell,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Wal. Whitefurd,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tho. Sydserfe;</hi> in stead of their
compearance, gave in a Declinatour and Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which was presented by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Hammiltoun</hi>
Minister at <hi>Glasfurde;</hi> and was urged to be read in
face of the Assembly. This their Declinatour and
Protestation was made in name of all the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Bishops within this Kingdome: as if it had
been done with the knowledge and consent of all the
rest: which is known to be false, and in name of others
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17507:3"/>
their adherents, whom yet we have found to be very
few; and these either corrupted with bribes, terrified
by threatnings, or circumveened with false informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as diverse of them with teares have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
and therefore have passed from their Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour.
They appoint it to be given in to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Commissioner, whom they do not decline; and
crave it to be read in presence of the Assembly; whom
they do decline as Iudges, not directing their speach
to the Assembly it self, with respect and reverence,
as legall formes require: <hi>Coram vobis excipiendo &amp;
opponendo, cum debita reverentia,</hi> or the like. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
not personally, but appoint a Procurator. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
some of them were in the town where the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
conveened; or within few miles, when their
Declinatour and Protestation was given in. They
might have presented themselves to sustaine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their Declinatour, or to cleare themselves
some way of the offences laide to their charge in the
libell, with Protestation that they adhered to their
Declinatour, notwithstanding of their compearance.
<hi>Protestantes in principio, medio, &amp; fine praesentis compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritionis
&amp; oppositionis: quod per praesentem actum vel
comparitionem, seu aliquem alium vel aliam quem vel
quam facere contigerit in futurum, non intendimus nec
volumus in vos tanquam in judicem competentem aliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
consentiri. Practica Papiensis per Petrum de Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis
in forma declinationis alicujus judicis.</hi> But he that
doeth evil hateth the light.</p>
            <p>The Assembly, having considered the Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Protestation, found themselves Iudges, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any thing was aleadged: which was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17507:3"/>
then briefly answered; and now more amply for the
justification of their proceedings.</p>
            <p>They acknowledged that a generall Assembly,
lawfully called, is a most necessare and effectuall
meane, for removing distractions, and setling peace
in the Kirk; and yet have they been the chief instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to bereave the Kirk of this liberty: first by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations
from time to time, at last by prorogation
to no certaine time; that so the impediment of their
advancement might be removed out of the way.</p>
            <p>They acknowledge that his Majestie hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by his prerogative royall to call Assemblies: as is
acknowledged by the Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi>
1610. and Parliament 1612. But withall they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that it is not lawfull to conveen, without his
Royall consent and approbation, unlesse we will put
ourselves in question to be called for sedition. Here,
they flatter for their own private ends, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the cause of CHRIST. We acknowledge that
the Prince, when he seeth cause, may convocat a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly; but we deny, that it is sedition to
hold Assembly without his consent. The Christians
for the space of 300. years held their Councels and
Assemblies under the persecuting Emperours; and
yet were not in so doing guilty of sedition. But it
will be aledged, that the case is different, where
there is a Christian Magistrate professing the same
Religion. It is true, his consent should be sought ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly:
but if he be negligent or wilfully refuse, the
Kirk may hold her Assemblies, if they finde necessity.
For in this case he differeth not from the unbeleever.
<hi>Paria sunt non apparere &amp; non esse.</hi> The Papists, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17507:4"/>
for the Pops right to call generall Councels, yet
mantaine, that if he doth not, nor will not convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
they may conveen without him, or although he
should oppose. See that professor of both the laws
<hi>Antonius de Rosellis</hi> in his <hi>Monarchiae</hi> Part. 2. cap. 30.
And in the third Part cap. 3. when the Pops Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or Heresie is notorious, any faithfull man or sound
Christian may convocate the Councell <hi>per vìamre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitionis,
vel monitionis; non per viam citationis, vel
authorizationis:</hi> by way of warning and requisition,
not by way of citation or authorizing. But when they
are conveened, <hi>quicun<expan>

                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  </expan> ipsos vocasset, talem vocationem
authoriz are possunt:</hi> whosoever called them together,
they may authorize that calling. For it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the substance, that a superiour should call them
together. This Professor lived under the Emperour
<hi>Frederik</hi> the third, and ended his dayes in the year
1467. The Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> in his second book <hi>de
Repub. Ecclesi. cap. 7. Num.</hi> 18. aledgeth to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a passage out of <hi>Iacobus Almaynus;</hi> where he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the eye seeing the bodie in danger may give
warning to the rest of the members, that the bodie
may defend and preserve it self. So any particulare
Kirk, seeing the necessity of convocating a Councell
may make manifest the necessity to other Kirks; <hi>&amp; sic
denunciative congregare, non autem praeceptive;</hi> and so
convocate, not by precept or command, but by way
of denunciation or warning. As after a Physician
hath shewed to a man, what is necessarie for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
he is bound to do it, not by vertue of the
Physicians precept, but of the precept of the divine
and naturall law. This <hi>Iacobus Almain</hi> was a <hi>Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:17507:4"/>
Professor, about the year 1510. The ground of
the Kirks right is laid down by the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Concilium generale potestatem a Christo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
habet.</hi> The generall Councell hath power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
from Christ. See <hi>Antonius de Rosellis</hi> in the
part above-cited. What we have aledged for generall
Councels holdeth more firmly for nationall and
provinciall: seeing they are more necessary then the
generall. In former times, Primats convocated natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and Metropolitans provinciall Councels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seeking a particular grant from Princes to every
meeting. For the Canons of Councels appointed
such meetings to be kept. A tacit consent of Princes
was sufficient. And this tacit consent was collected
by their grant of liberty to professe Religion, and
submitting their scepters to the scepter of CHRIST.
In granting liberty of Religion they granted libertie
to hold Synods, no lesse then weekly meetings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
to divine service. That French Catholick
who wrot that treatise <hi>delibertate ecclesiastica</hi> in defence
of the <hi>Venetians</hi> writeth to the same sense. <hi>Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
cum libertatem Religionis edictis suis Ecclesiae conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serunt,
simul jus libere cogendi synodos illis attribuisse.
Nam cultus Christiani haec pars est prorsus necessaria &amp;</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So it was answered in the Assembly holden in
<hi>December anno</hi> 1561. to some Courteours. <hi>Take
from us the freedome of Assemblies, and take from us the
Evangel. For without Assemblies how shall good order and
unitie in doctrine be keeped.</hi> Seeing then Assemblies are
so necessare, and CHRIST hath provided for all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
to his Kirk, and promised his presence where
but few are conveened in his name, the Christian
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17507:5"/>
Prince cannot deprive the Kirk of this liberty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this Kirk deprived of liberty to hold her As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
by any law or act of Parliament, incase the
Prince will not indict time and place. Our Kirk had
liberty to hold Assemblies, and to appoint time and
place till the year 1592. and yet were not the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
called in question for sedition. The Assemblies
were frequented by men of credite in Court about
the King and his Regents. Some were authorized
with commission from them from time to time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to the same. Commissioners have been directed
from the Parliament to confer with the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
appointed by the Assembly, concerning Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
affairs. Appellations of laick patrons were
ordained by act of Parliament to end and take decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the generall Assembly. Superintendents and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulars
of prelacies were ordained by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be called before the generall Assembly, and
to be deprived, incase they were found Hereticall in
doctrine. The acts ratifying the jurisdiction of the
Kirk, namely the act <hi>Iames</hi> 6. Par. 6. cap. 69. Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
consequently the generall Assemblies, where all
jurisdiction is ordered, and censures sometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erced.
The Parliament holden <hi>anno</hi> 1592. did not
grant liberty to hold Assemblies, as if the Kirk had
not had such liberty before, but ratified her former
liberty to hold Assemblies yearly, or oftner <hi>pro re na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and to appoint time and place for the next Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by themselves, incase his Majestie or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
were not present in the town. But if any of
them were present, it was provided, that they should
appoint time and place. This provision gave not a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17507:5"/>
privative power to his Majestie to refuse a generall
Assembly, so long as he pleased, (for then the liberty
of holding generall Assemblies could not be said to
have been ratified) but only a priviledge or preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to appoint time and place for the yearly Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
The act of Parliament 1612. which they aledge
in their Declinatour, acknowledgeth the indiction of
time and place to appertaine to his Majestie, but doth
not give a privative power to frustrate the Kirk of her
yearly Assemblies if he please; which were ratified
before, but that being presupposed, bindeth him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
time and place. If they will infer, that it is sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to conveen an Assembly a any time, if the Prince
will not indict time and place, in respect of that act of
Parliament, they must remember that the act 1612.
was only a ratification of the act of their pretended
and null Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
whereof hath been made evident at the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:
and so they bewray their treacherie against
CHRIST and his Kirk, and for consenting to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of such a Declaration in Parliament ought
to be severly punished, suppose there were no other
offence to be laid to their charge. The yearly Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
were a great impediment to their course: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that liberty must not endure any longer. But for
reverence of the honourable Estates, we make the
best construction we can. Howsoever, the Kirk may
lawfully hold her Assemblies, howbeit there were
no act of Parliament, and the Prince (we speak in the
general) refusing to indict time and place, the necessity
of the Kirk being urgent is to be suspected of disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

finde more to our purpose in the reasons alreadie

            <p>Howbeit the Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
1638. was indicted by his Majestie, and they
acknowledge that it was indicted by lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite,
yet they hold the Assembly it self most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
and unorderly, in sundrie respects, and their
proceedings void and null in law, for the causes and
reasons following: which wee trust shall prove fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous.</p>
            <p>Their first exception is taken from the time of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the Commissioners to the Assembly. That
they were chosen by the Presbyteries before the
Presbyteries were authorized to make election, in
respect his Majesties warrant, to indict the Assembly
was not published, till the 22. of <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The election of Commissioners is ever in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of the Presbyteries, when there is apparant oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of an Assembly, as at this time they were put
in full expectation both of a Parliament and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
And there was need of timous election, that the
Commissioners might have the longer time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves for the matters of importance, which
were to bee treated. The Barrons and free-holders
make choise of their Commissioners to voice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
yearly, howbeit no Parliament bee indicted.
They themselves procured Commissioners to bee
chosen in sundrie parts <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. before the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17507:6"/>
was indicted upon the fourth of <hi>November</hi> to be
holden at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews</hi> the 25 of that infant; upon a
report that his Majesty would have a generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and the five articles considered: but would
not appoint the time or place, till the Commissioners
were chosen. Their drift was to hold or not hold
Assembly, as they should finde the Commissioners
which were chosen, would for the most part serve
their turn. But what need wee to insist upon this
point, seeing there was no Commissions produced
at the last Assembly, which were of date before the
22. of <hi>September</hi> the time of indiction. <hi>The Table,</hi> say
they, by their usurped authority did give order, and
direction for all Presbyteries to elect Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and to keep a fast upon the 16 of <hi>September.</hi>
These whom they miscall, <hi>the Table</hi> did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or charge the presbyteries to elect or fast; but
because of the expectation we had of an Assembly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
them to seek Gods blessing with fasting, both
to the election of Commissioners, and proceedings
of the Assembly: and because we had been out of use
these many years of Assemblies rightly constitute,
sent to them their best informations and caveats.</p>
            <p>They except next against the Commissioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for if the Assembly be not constitute of such
members as are requisite to make up such a bodie, it
cannot be acknowledged for a lawfull and free As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
But how prove they Commissioners ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be members of this Assembly, not to bee
such as are requisit to make up such a bodie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, they alledge that the most part, at least of the
Clergie, conveened at this Assembly, are</hi> ipso facto <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:17507:7"/>
and their places voide, as if they were naturally
dead; because they have never in presence of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
Bishop, Superintendent,</hi> or <hi>Commissioner</hi>
of the Province or Dyocie, subscribed the articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion
extant in the acts of Parliament, nor given their
oath for acknowledging our Soveraigne Lords Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
nor have read their testimoniall thereupon, and
the confession in their parosh Kirks after their returne;
as they are bound by act of Parliament, Anno 1572.
that whereas they bee bound by act of Parliament, Anno
1606. to maintaine the Kings honour, dignitie, and
prerogative Royall, to with stand all persons, power, or
estates, that shall impugne or impaire the same, and at
their admission were obliged to performe this duetie
of their alleageance, and to testifie in their conscience
that the King is suppreme governour as well in matters
spirituall, and ecclesiasticall, as temporall, according to
the act of Parliament 1612. Yet notwithstanding his
Majestie having ordained by act of Councell and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
following thereupon, that all the Liedges should
swear and subscribe the said Confession, together with
a generall Band for defending his Majesties Person and
Authoritie, against all enemies within or without the
Realme, they have not only refused to subscribe the said
Band and Confession, but in their Sermons and other
speeches disswaded, deterred, and hindered, others to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the same; and have publickly protested against the
subscription thereof.</p>
            <p>The answer is easie: The act of Parliament 1572.
was never put in practise conforme to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of it, and order there set down: or if put in
practise, the practise, could not endure long: For
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17507:7"/>
               <hi>Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Superindentents</hi> continued not
long after. If there were any force in this reason, all
the Assemblies of our Kirk since the abolition of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and <hi>Superintendents</hi> might be called in question;
and wee have had no lawfull ministers. Yea, their
own pretended Assemblies did consist of many,
who could not produce a testimoniall of their oath
and confession conforme to the tenour of that act.
Lastly, the substance of that act hath been keeped
conforme to the later acts made thereanent, and none
of the Ministers conveened at the last Assembly, but
have subscribed both the confession of Faith, and
Band for maintenance of the Kings authority, either
of late, when the Covenant was subscribed, or before
when they past their degrees in Schooles, or upon
some other occasion. But what suppose that act were
yet in force that they had neglected to take their oath,
and were therefore deprived <hi>ipso facto</hi> of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and ecclesiasticall living, yet it followeth not
that they are deprived of their office, or can be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they wilfully refuse to subscribe, and take their
oath to acknowledge the Kings authoritie. It is to
be observed, that that act was made when some stood
for the Kings Mother, and would not acknowledge
the King for Soveraigne during her life. As for the
promise made in Parliament by the Estates, <hi>Anno</hi>
1606. have they failed in performance, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
whom they represented? Have they not in the
last Parliament ratified that act. As to the act for the
oath of supremacie <hi>An.</hi> 1612. it concerneth only such
as were to be presented to any benefice, and not every
Minister. That act was a ratification of the act of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17507:8"/>
are altered in the act of Parliament, and in place of
these words, <hi>Conservation and purgation of Religion,</hi>
are put in, <hi>Supreme governour as well in matters spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and ecclesiasticall as temporall,</hi> which words were
avoided in the same oath, when the conclusions were
agreed upon at <hi>Leeth, Anno</hi> 1572. Howbeit they then
drew up a plate-forme of policie near to the English,
and put in the words, <hi>Conservation and purgation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which are used in the confession of Faith extant
in the acts of parliament. So they have abused their
own pretended Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow.</hi> But what
have the Commissioners done contrare to these acts,
oathes, or promises? They have refused to subscribe
the confession of Faith, and band enjoyned by the King
and Councel, hindered others, and protested against
the Proclamation. Might they not doe that, and not
violate these acts? Doth the acts of the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
binde them to subscribe any confession or
band in whatsoever sense it shall please his Majestie
to make? Or is it the meaning of the oath of supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie?
The Estates, I am sure, never intended such
a meaning. Both must be interpreted by the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, the act for the Kings oath at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
the declaration made in Parliament 1592.
and second book of discipline Notwithstanding of
the ratification of the former act concerning the
Kings prerogative, and the act for the oath of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supremacie,
his Majestie behoved to have a grant of
posing habits upon Kirk-men at the last Parliament
which needed not, if he might have done it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of these acts of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1606 and 1612.
and yet that is a matter of lesse importance then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17507:8"/>
subscription to a confession in another sense,
then was received at the first, and second universall
subscription. For now in the interpretation of the
authoritie enjoyning subscription, the confession is
made to consist with <hi>Episcopacie</hi> and other novations
introduced since the fame was first received. Was
there not reason then to refuse, to diswade others, and
to protest against it? Moe reasons are to be found in
the protestation it felf. Some Ministers were urged
with subscription, and of those, some yeelded, who
notwithstanding had place in the last Assembly. But
what suppose all had protested and refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
as they were enjoyned by the Councel; that
could not have disabled them to fit and voice in the
Assembly, unlesse they had been legally convict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of offence in so doing, and remained obstinate.
But let the Reader here observe the decliners legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine:
They would seeme to be foreward for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of that confession which was enjoyned by
the King and Councel, but challenge men for not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the said Confession, that is the Confession
extant in the acts of parliament: for of no other have
they made mention before in their declinatour. They
have vilipended the later confession and covenant in
former times, and we doubt, notwithstanding of this
taxing of others, that they will subscribe this confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
themselves, without their own limitations and
acceptions; as the Doctours of <hi>Aberdene</hi> have done:
but that perfidious men will subscribe any thing. And
yet so impudent are they, that they will have other
troubled for not subscribing contrar to the true sense,
and meaning of the confession to make a partie, and
new rent in this Kirk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:17507:9"/>
They alledge, that the Commissioners directed to this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly

this Assembly and the libertie to be members thereof,
and were in the same estate and condition they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

at other times, so at this to hold Assembly, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any impediment or prorogation in the contrare, they
continue their meetings and tables discharged by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
refuse to subscribe the Band according to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
and Councels command, for maintaining the Kings
Person and authoritie, and protested against it, and insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Liedges to subscribe the Band of mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against all persons whatsoever, that in their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
they declared Bishops and Arch-bishops to have no
warrand for their office, to have no place or voice in
Assembly, notwithstanding his Majestie had declared
by proclamation, that they had voice in the Assembly to
that effect, as they have constantly beene in use in all
Assemblies where they were present, and therefore that
it is a fearfull thing to conveen with these at this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
in respect of sundrie acts of Parliment, ordaining
that none impugne the authority and diganitie of any of
the three Estates, or procure innovation, or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their power and authoritie, under the paine of
treason: and they arrogat to their meetings a Soveraigne
authoritie to determine all questions and doubts that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
contrare to the freedome of the Assembly, whither in
the constitution and members thereof, or in the maters to
be treated or manner of proceeding.</p>
            <p>We answer first in generall, They forfaulted not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17507:9"/>
his Majesties favour in granting an Assembly, for his
Majestie did not recall the indiction of the time and
place, for holding the Assembly, notwithstanding of
all that is here alledged, and therefore they might
still conveen to the place at the time appointed. As
for the particular points alledged, we answer: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
was offered upon condition of acquiescing in the
Kings declaration and offers. But pardon importeth
offence, which is denyed: Therefore the condition
of acquiescing could not bee admitted, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in the declaration were not satisfactorie to their
former protestations, complaints, supplications.
The Assembly was granted absolutely without any
condition, least his Majestie should leave in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
minds the least scruple, and for setling a certain
peace. They protested that it should be lawfull for
them, being authorized with lawfull commission,
as at other times, when the urgent necessitie of the
Kirk requireth, so in this exigence to assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the dyet appointed for the Assembly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of any impediment or prorogation in
the contrary. Of the lawfulnesse to conveen in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
when there is urgent necessitie, we have
set down some reasons already, and moe are extant
in print, concerning that purpose. They had need to
fear the danger of prorogation, both because the
present case could not suffer delay, and doolefull
experience have taught us, that prorogations from
dyet to dyet ended at last in no dyet, whereby the
Kirk was bereft of her libertie to hold yearly Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
which they would now recover by this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
taking it for a re-entrie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:17507:10"/>
Their meetings or tables, as the adversaries call them,
continued, because the cause continued, preferring
supplications, giving in complaints, attendance upon
gracious and satisfactory answers, and performance
of the same, making Protestations when there was
need; and yet in peaceable manner not in great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
as at the beginning, for giving satisfaction to
the Lords of Councel. They have offered to cleare
the necessity of their meeting, and their carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament to whom they have appealed.
They have refused to subscribe the confession of faith
again at the King and Councels command, after their
late subscription, for the reasons already mentioned;
and the band for mantainance of the Kings person
and authority; because it is not the same in tennor
with the old generall band subscribed <hi>anno</hi> 1590. The
narrative is changed, some lines, designing the Papists
and their adherents to be the partie threatning danger
to Religion and the Kings person, are omitted, and
no other partie designed in particular. So that the
band may be used against the Covenanters themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
who have been taxed for disorders, disturbers
of the peace of this Kirk and Kingdome, to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Religion, and prejudice of his Majesties autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as they have complained in their Protestation.
They continued in seeking subscriptions to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
till the holding of the Assembly, because of
references to the Assembly. His Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner
acquiesced in their explanation of the clause of
mutuall defence, where they declared their mutuall
defence of each of other was not for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
quarrels, but only in defence of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17507:10"/>
of the laws and liberties of this Kingdome, and
of his Majesties person and authority in preservation
of the same. What further can bee justly craved of
them? Such as were pretended Bishops had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
for voice in the generall Assembly, unlesse they
be authorized with lawfull commission. The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
and Bishops presence of old was required
more for their triall, then any need of their voice.
But the Assemblies were wearied with complaints
made upon them, and after many conferences and
much disputation found their office unlawfull: which
was never since approved by any pretended, let be
lawfull Assembly. So the custome of old doth not
serve such as only pretend or usurpe the same office.
Nor are they capable, as Ministers, of any commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from any Presbyterie, because they have deserted
their flocks, and have no particular charge. For <hi>lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen</hi>
Ministers, and usurping Prelats should have no
place in the generall Assembly. The act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
discharging the impugning of any of the three
Estates, or procuring the innovation or diminution
of their power, was made in a troublesome time in
the year 1584. was protested against when it was
proclaimed, with other acts. That third Estate of
Prelats, suffered innovation and diminution of their
Estat within three years after by the act of annexation
<hi>anno 1587. and in consideration of the great decay of the
Ecclesiasticall Estate,</hi> these are the words of the 113.
act following, the Commissioners of small Barrons
and free-holders were declared to be members of the
Parliament to sit upon the articles, and vote in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to supplie that decay. So there may be three
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17507:11"/>
Estates without the Ecclesiasticall, or Bishops. And
the acts of Parliament following, were made by the
Estates howbeit there were then no Bishops. Yea acts
were made against Bishops as <hi>anno</hi> 1592. Howbeit
Ministers were not Prelats, yet others who had the
Prelacies voted as the third Estate. For it is in respect
of their Barronies that such as have Prelacies, vote in
Parliament, whither they be Ministers or not. By the
act of Parliament 1597. Ministers provided to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
Abbacies, Priories, were declared to have
vote in Parliament, but without the knowledge of
the Kirk. When it came to their knowledge, much
opposition was made, none consented but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which should have been insert in the act of
Parliament: which was to be made for Ministers vote
in Parliament. It is true that <hi>anno</hi> 1606. there was an
act for restitution of the state of Bishops, but the Kirk
repining: because the conditions were not insert in the
act. And many Ministers subscribed a Protestation
against the said act; yet was not the act 1584. renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor Bishops restored to their spirituall estate, nor
were there then any Bishops having any spirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
whereunto they could be restored, nor was the
whole third estate restored which before was empair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For that third Estate consisteth of Abbots and
Pryours, as well as Bishops. But how doth it follow,
that because such as were provided to Bishopricks
were restored to vote in Parliament, they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
restored to vote in the generall Assembly; who
were not then, nor yet to this houre restored to the
spirituall office of a Bishop. Or how is the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
impugned by calling them to censure or triall,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17507:11"/>
seeing they consented to the act of their own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> whereby they are
made lyable to the triall of the generall Assembly in
their life and conversation, office, and benefice; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the tennour of the Kings Proclamation, and
his Majesties Commissioners Declaration given in
to the last Assembly; bearing expresly that all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of the Bishops and their successours shall be
answerable to, and from time to time censurable by
the generall Assembly. Their consenting to that same
act of restitution is censurable, and a point of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
given in against them. Can they not distinguish
betwixt the state and the persons? Yea may not the
generall Assembly or any particulare Minister im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
an Estate erected or restored in name of the
Kirk without her consent, and to the prejudice of her
liberties? It is a calumnie, that the meetings in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
which they call the tables, arrogat to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
soveraigne authority to determine all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and doubts, that can arise contraire to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Assembly: for they give only their best
advice and opinion when it is asked, and call instantly
for a rightly constitute and free Assembly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
doubts, and settle this Kirk in peace.</p>
            <p>They alledge, <hi>the Presbyteries have losed their right,
if they had any, to direct Commissioners to the generall
Assemblie in so far, as they have deposed their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
appointed by their Bishops in their Synods to governe
them, and elected others in their place contraire to the act
of</hi> Glasgow 1610<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and act of Parliament</hi> 1612. It is the
hight of impudencie to call in question the right of
Presbyteries to choose their own Commissioners,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17507:12"/>
which they have ever had since their erection. The
Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow</hi> was a pretended Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and therefore any Presbyterie might from the
beginning suspended obedience to the acts thereof,
till it were declared null in a free generall Assembly,
as it was at this last. The act of Parliament was only
an act ratifying the act of that same pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and by their own procurement, or rather
another act, adding, omitting, altering the words and
clauses of that act, and that with their knowledge and
consent, if not by their device and procurement. And
therefore are censured in this last Assembly for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
the caveats in this point as in many other. Put
case no just exception might bee taken against the
constitutions and proceedings of that Assembly: they
fore-falted their right of appointing Moderators to
Presbyteries at their Synods, because whatsoever
power was granted to them was upon assurance, that
we should have yearly, or at set times generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
and that they should be lyable to their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
which was not performed. And therefore Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
have rather failled in that they returned not
sooner to their former liberty. Beside this, the some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
pretended Prelats deserted the Synods, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
substituts, who had not the same power to
appoint Moderators. Many Moderators dimitted
their office of their own accord, and then the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
according to the act of <hi>Glasgow</hi> it self, had
power to choose their own Moderator. Many Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
remained still unchanged till the last Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
But put the case the Presbyteries had faulted in
displaceing their Moderators, the Bishops substituts,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17507:12"/>
doth it follow that they have fore-faulted their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of choosing Commissioners to the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
Every transgression deserveth censure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
but not deprivation from liberties.</p>
            <p>They alledge <hi>next that the Ministers choosen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missoners
to this Assembly had not a lawfull commission
because the Ministers did associat to themselves a ruling
Elder out of every Pariosh, who being ordinarly the Lord
of the pariosh or man of greatest authority in the bounds,
doth over-rule them both by their authority and number,
being moe then the Ministers: of whom some being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
absent, and five or six, or so many of them
put on the leit and removed, there remaine but a few
Ministers to voice to the election, the Presbyteries former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
never associating to themselves lay-elders in election of
Commissioners to the generall Assembly, but only for their
assistance in discipline and correction of manners, calling
for them at such occasions as they stood in need of their
Godly concurrence; whereas it was expresly provided by
act of Assembly 1582. that they should be fewer in number
then the Pastors. Likeas these 40. years and upwards they
have not been called at all to Presbyteries, and by the act
at</hi> Dundie 1597. <hi>whereby it is pretended, that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have authority to send these lay-Commissioners, the
only act authorizing Presbyteries to send Commissioners to
the generall Assembly, it doth no way appeare that lay-el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
had any hand in choosing of Commissioners.</hi> It is no
new thing that Noblemen and Barrons have been
choosen Elders. We finde that they have been Elders
in the Elderships of particular congregations soon
after the reformation. It were absurd to see the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and gentrie best skilled for government set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17507:13"/>
and the meaner sort not so well educat and able,
to rule over them. The like may be said for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
It is a needlesse feare, that they will over-rule
the Presbyterie by their authority, Ministers mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the meeting, and going before them in reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and voicing. Nor can any such thing be laide to
their charge in electing of Commissioners to this last
Assembly. They can not overswey their Ministers
by their number, if they will not be deficient to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
If some Ministers be ordinarly absent, so may
some Elders, and it hath fallen forth so usually, and
doth so at the same time. That five or six Ministers
being put on the leat and removed few will remaine,
so five or six Elders being removed there will be
moe Ministers to choose the elder. But what hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
either the one or the other to voice to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others (howbeit they be put on the leits) either
before, or after their removell. The number of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
is to be considered according to the number of
the Pariosh's, not according to their absence or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
which is casuall, and for the most part there are
moe Ministers in a Presbyterie, then can be of elders,
taking but one out of a Pariosh. For in some burghes
there are two or three, or foure, or eight Ministers.
As for the answer to the doubt proponed in the
Assembly holden in <hi>April</hi> 1583. In the booke of
Policie agreed upon after reasoning and deliberation
in many Assemblies: It was concluded there shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
some Elders out of every parosh to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
which importeth that moe then one out of a
Parosh may resort. Ministers were ordained to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the book by acts of the Assembly <hi>Anno</hi> 1590.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17507:13"/>
and 1591. And consequently after 1582. Next that
act provideth that the proportion bee keeped in the
fewer number; but there was never such a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
determined, and till it be determined, it is as good,
as no act. For otherwise it should be left to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of ever Presbyterie, to appoint what number
they please. Thirdly, there is more reason for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the book of Policie made before, and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after that act: that as there is one Minister sent from
every particular Kirk, so there should be likewise one
ruling Elder at the least; for one Kirk hath no more
priviledge than another. It was ordained in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly holden at <hi>Middleburgh Anno</hi> 1581. that
every Eldership of the particular Kirkes send to the
<hi>Classes</hi> (which wee call the Presbyterie) a Minister
and an Elder, and from every <hi>Classes</hi> to the Synod,
two Ministers and two Elders; So that the number
was made equall, not only in presbyteries, but in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
also. And <hi>Bucerus</hi> in his book <hi>De gubernatione
ecclesiae page</hi> 101. saith likewise, That there is a like
number of Pastours and Elders sent to their provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Synods. It is false, that the ruling Elders were
called to the Presbyteries only at such occasions as
the Ministers stood in need of their godly concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
For it was ordained by the book of Policy, that
the common Eldership, that is the Presbytery, should
consist of Pastours, Doctours, and ruling Elders,
and so they were constitute at their first erection. By
act of that same Assembly. <hi>April</hi> 1582. the Ministers are
bound to exhort them to resort to the Presbyteries
at all times, but for matters of weight to urge them
strictly. And who doubteth but the election of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17507:14"/>
Commissioners to the generall Assembly entrusted
with the common affairs of the whole Kirk, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of weight. That the act made at <hi>Dundie Anno</hi>
1597. is the only act authorizing Presbyteries to
send Commissioners to the generall Assembly, is as
false. It hath been the continuall practise of our Kirk
since the erection of Presbyteries, that Presbyteries
direct Commissioners to the generall Assembly. In
<hi>April</hi> 1582. We have this direction. <hi>It is not thought
expedient that the Presbyterie be astricted to direct their
Moderatour to the Assembly, but that they have libertie
to choose such as they shall think meetest for the comfort of
the Kirke.</hi> Whereby appeareth that order was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
before, that Presbyteries direct their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.
The act 1597. then, did not first, or
only authorize Presbyteries with this power, but
only circumscribed the number: Meetest it was
that Presbyteries should have this power, because
they were ordinare Assemblies, had their power of
ordinarie jurisdiction, admitting, deposing, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating,
and therefore had their meetings weekly,
and were upon all occasions readie to direct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.
Neither is that act 1597. the only act au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
Presbyteries to direct ruling Elders, or as
they call them Lay-commissioners to the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:
For seeing Presbyteries directed Ministers in
Commission, the ruling Elders could be directed by
none other after the erection of Presbyteries. It was
ordained in <hi>Iune</hi> 1563. that every <hi>Superintendent</hi> cause
warne the Shyres, Townes, and Parosh-kirks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his jurisdiction, to send their Commissioners to
the generall Assembly. In <hi>Iuly</hi> 1568. it was ordained
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17507:14"/>
that Ministers and Commissioners of Shyres should
be chosen by the Ministers and Gentle-men at the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
After the erection of Presbyteries, wee finde
them in the register books of the Assemblies to have
been directed from Presbyteries, and specially <hi>Anno</hi>
1592. When the act of Parliament was made for rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the liberties of Assemblies, Synods, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
&amp;c. And <hi>Iuly 1595. March</hi> 1595. And
<hi>Anno</hi> 1596. For proofe likewise see in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
books of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> gentle-men directed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
with Ministers <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. and 1596. That
the ruling Elders had hand in the election of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
when they sate in the Presbyteries appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
evidently: For in the Assembly holden in <hi>Iuly</hi>
1568. Where order was set down for choosing of
Commissioners to the generall Assembly with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to vote, it was ordained, that Ministers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Shyrs bee chosen at the Synodall
convention with consent of the rest of the Ministers
and Gentle-men, meaning ruling Elders. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Presbyteries were created, and had
the power to direct Commissioners, Ministers, and
Elders, could not bee chosen, but in like manner by
Ministers and Elders common consent. Such like
when the act 1597. ordained that every Presbyterie
direct no moe Ministers than three, and but one in
name of the Barons: It is presupposed, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
directed them before, but only defineth the
number. It cannot bee meant that Ministers shall
choose Ministers, and the Gentle-men Elders one in
name of the Barons, or that Ministers shall choose
both Ministers and Barons, nor were it reasonble.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17507:15"/>
But it is said of both alike, that they shall bee directed
from the Presbyterie. By the booke of Policie the
ruling Elders office and power, is to hold all sorts of
Assemblies, Presbyterial, Synodall, nationall, with the
Pastours and Doctours, for establishing good order
and execution of discipline, to treat of things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Kirk, to choose a Moderatour with common
consent, to send forth visitours for the bounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their jurisdiction, in the Presbyteriall meetings,
to make constitutions for decent order in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Kirks without prejudice of the rules set down
by provinciall or generall Assemblies, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat,
to elect and depose ecclesiasticall office-bearers:
For these are granted to Pastours, Doctours, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
conjunctly; and as <hi>Ambrose</hi> writeth upon 1. <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. of the Elders in the primitive times, nothing was
done without them. <hi>Vnde &amp; Synagoga &amp; postea eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,
seniores habuit sine quorum consilio nihil agebatur in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia.</hi>
If they may have an hand in excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
election and deposition of office-bearers choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Moderatour, making constitutions, establish
good order, and generally to treat of all things which
concerne the Kirke, ought they not to have an hand
in election of Commissioners to the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly?
Nay, rather in this than in any thing else. For
Commissioners to the generall Assembly are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the common affairs of the whole Kirk, as
hath been already said. They are called ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and governours, not halfe or in part, but whole,
and doth not the choosing of Commissioners belong
to ruling and government: Ministers themselves doe
not direct Commissioners, but as rulers. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17507:15"/>
that ruling Elders sate not in Presbyteries these
fourtie years and upwards: But the aspirers to prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
began the rent in our Kirke fourtie yeares since
and upwards. No wonder then suppose that, with
many other things went out of frame; so long as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and integrity continued, they continued. The
times of division cannot prescribe against the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
established, and yet even after the act 1597. which
was made in the yeare after division entered, wee
finde in the Presbyterie books of <hi>Edinburgh February</hi>
1600. Commission given to some Ministers and
gentle-men to the Assembly. And in the Catalogue
of the Commissioners to the Assembly holden <hi>Anno</hi>
1601. Barons directed from Presbyteries. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
complaineth in the place above-cited, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
government of Elders, which was first in the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish
Kirk, and after in the Christian, was worne out
of use, whither through sloughtfulnesse, or pride
of the teachers, he cannot tell. <hi>Quod qua negligentia
absoleverit, nescio; nisi forte doctorum desidia aut magis
superbia, dum soli aliquid videri volunt.</hi> The causes of
our Elders forebearing to resort to the Presbyteries
may be diverse; partly, the pride of some Ministers,
who would not encourage and countenance them,
as they ought, and were directed by the Assembly;
that governing by themselves alone, they might seeme
some-what: partly, the unwillingnesse of others,
loath that gentle-men should be made privie to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of their offences, as we have heard there by some
of both sort, and fear there be some at this present of
the same disposition; and partly the division and rent,
which have vexed this Kirk these many yeares. But
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17507:16"/>
seeing there was never an ordinance to exclud them,
and there can be no prescription against the word of
God, whereunto this order is declared to bee conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by act of Assembly holden in <hi>October</hi> 1582. And
the book of policie, the imminent danger to Religion,
constrained them to take their owne place againe:
By the way I would demand these ministers, who are
content they sit with them in the lowest and suppreme
judicatorie, the Session and generall Assembly, why
they repine at their association in Presbyteries and
Synods: there can be no sufficient reason rendered; It
was the order set down at the concluding the constant
policie, and is the order observed in other Kirks. The
elders exercise not their office fully but in the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
where ordinare jurisdiction is exercised, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of excommunication, deposition, admission, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They except yet against the Ecclesiasticall persons,
meaning, Ministers directed Commissioners to this
Assembly, <hi>that they may be justly thought unworthie and
uncapable of commission to a free and lawfull Assembly for
their behaviour in times by-past. First, for that by their
sedicious and railing Sermons and Pamphlets, they have
wounded the Kings honour, and Soveraigne authoritie,
and animate his Lieges to rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is imputed to all, but not verified of any of
the number, nor have they designed any person in
particulare. It is sufficient that neither the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
sending, nor the Assembly admitting, doth
know any such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next, they alledge they are knowne to bee such as
have been either schismatically refractarie, and opposit
to good order setled in Kirke or State, or having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17507:16"/>
subscribed, and sworne obedience to theìr ordìnar,
have never made conscience of their oath, or contrar
to promise and practise, have resieled to the contempt of
Authoritie, and disturbance of the Kirke, or such as are
under the censure of the Kirke of</hi> Ireland, <hi>for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to order, or under censures of this Kirk or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened,
at least deserving to bee conveened before their
ordinar, or a lawfull generall Assembly: for transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
deserving deprivation.</hi> We know none schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
opposit to good order, unlesse they meane
such as have opposed to their encroaching upon the
liberties of the Kirk; and their shamelesse usurpation.
An oath should not binde a man to iniquitie or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie.
The intrants did not understand what was the
established order, from which wee have declined,
nor foresee the intent of the Prelates, to bring in so
many novations in Religion. The oath to the ordinar
was exacted by vertue of an act of a null and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Assembly, and that ordinare was no lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare,
but an usurper. These ordinaries have exacted
also oath and subscription to articles of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising,
and maintenance of their usurped authoritie,
which is a point laid to their charge in their lybell.
The censures inflicted (if there were any) upon
three or foure Ministers, Scots-men, returning from
<hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> were infflicted for adhering to
our confession of Faith, which manifesteth them to
be faithfull and constant members of this Kirke, and
therefore fit to voice in her Assemblies. They gave
satisfaction to the Assembly by their answers to the
interrogatories proponed to them. Some of them
were thrust out by themselves, before they went
to <hi>Ireland.</hi> As for such as were under censure in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17507:17"/>
this Kirk, wee know none, but such as were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the then pretended Bishops in the court
of high Commission, a judicatorie erected without
consent of our Kirke, or of the Estates in Parliament,
and discharged by Proclamation before they were
chosen Commissioners. This is also a point of
their lybell, the holding of such courts, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
domination in the same. Nor do we know any
conveened before the pretended ordinare, for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
which might make them uncapable of commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
If any deserved to be conveened before them,
or a lawfull generall Assembly, they should have
been processed before, or warned to compeare before
this Assembly: seeing a full and free Assembly was
indicted. But we know none that hath deserved to be
conveened for any transgression deserving reproofe,
far lesse deprivation. The transgressions imputed are
either falsly imputed to them, as the uttering of rash
and unreverent speeches in their sermons against his
Majesties Councel and their proceedings, reproving
his Majesties laws and ordinances, using application
in their sermons; not tending to edification, intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in other mens charges and pulpits
without calling and authoritie, pressing the people to
subscribe their Covenant, or are no transgressions, as
to proceed against Ministers to the censure of suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or deprivation in their Presbyteries, opponing
to the subscribing of a Covenant offered by his
Majestie, and allowed by the Councel, or holding
of conventions, without his Majesties knowledge
and consent; seeing the end was for supplications
to his Majestie, complaints, and informations, and
to prevent the great alterations in Religion, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17507:17"/>
were intended. They pretend that in charitie they
forebeare to expresse the personall faults, of which
too many of these who were directed Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to this Assembly are guilty. They have
learned to calumniate boldly, upon hope that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
will stick in mens mindes. This generall impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is more uncharitable, then if they had designed
the persons and expressed the faults in particular.
But they cannot otherwise ease their own vindictive
spirits. In the meane time the Commissions are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,
suppose afterward they should prove them to be
such as they alledge: and we will not be too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
namely when men declared infamous do calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate.
They except next against laymens decisive
voices. <hi>It standeth not with reason, Scripture nor antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
say they, <hi>that laymen should be authorized by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to have decisive voices in a generall Assemblie.
That in the act of Dundie 1597. whereby those Elders
pretend to have this place, there is no warrant expressed
for them to deliberat and determine.</hi> So by laymen,
they meane our ruling Elders, who are not meer lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
but office bearers in the Kirk, and are called in
the book of Policie Ecclesiasticall persons. Next, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that they except not only against the Assembly
holden last at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> but also against all the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
holden since the reformation. For the Elders
have had power to voice in Assemblies from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
And the order of choosing Commissioners
with power to voice was set down first <hi>anno</hi> 1568.
among which are the Gentlemen Commissioners
from shyres. There was no need therefore to expresse
the act 1597. which was concluded before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17507:18"/>
               <hi>anno</hi> 1568. the 7. chap. of the book of Policie, and
continually practised since the reformation. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly is called in the book of Policie, the
generall Eldership of the Kirk. If their reason were
good, Ministers have no warrand by that act 1597.
to voice in the generall Assembly. For there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
mention in that act of Ministers power to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
and determine. The truth is, that act doth not
touch but presupposeth the power of both, and only
defineth the number both of the Ministers and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
to be directed Commissioners from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
to the Assembly. So you see, they professe
plainly, they do not acknowledge any of our former
Assemblies in the purest times, nor any other in time
to come constitute after the like manner, nor the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Councels in other reformed Kirks, for lawfull
Assemblies. It is sufficient for answer that this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
was constitute according to the acts of our Kirk,
to which they ought to be subject: if there were no
more, this one passage in their Declinatour deserveth
condigne punishment to be inflicted upon them, that
they dare so malapertly impunge the established or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our Kirk, because they are not able to answer
to an Assembly rightly constitute. Yet howbeit they
will not grant decisive voice to lay-men, they allow
them presence and assistance. So will the Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
they will have them to be allowed and authorized by
the prince, which condition is not required by the
Papists. They allow that his Majestie in person or by
his delegats, may see good order keeped, have a cheef
hand in all deliberations and determinations, and may
delegat by his soveraigne authority such lay-men as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17507:18"/>
hee pleaseth to have definitive and decisive voice,
without which delegation it is presumptuous intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Pastorall charge. By the act 1597. which
was made by their owne procurement to restraine the
great number of Ministers directed from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to oppose to their corrupted courses, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that Barons or gentlemen should bee nominat
by the Presbyterie, and not by his Majestie, and have
had after that decisive voice in Assemblies. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noblemen and Barons, only called for by the kings
letter and not delegat as Commissioners, have voiced
at their owne pretended Assemblies, and helped to
carie maters by pluralitie of voices? But now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that after they had served their turne with
them to set them up they were to bide them a due
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Ite for as Laici, non est vobis Locus Icy.</p>
            <p>Yea, they intreat the kings commissioners in the words
uttered by the fathers at the councel of <hi>Chalcedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mitte
for as superfluos.</hi> Send forth the superflous. That which
was spoken to Clerks, and Monks, who came to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Councel, because they had imbraced the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> they apply to the ruling Elders, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
and gentlemen, chosen lawfully Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to this Assembly. For such insolent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
speeches, they ought to be severly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
howbeit there had been no libell given in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. To the same purpose they alledge the
direction given by <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> the Empresse to <hi>Strate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
Commander or Captaine of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> to drive by
force out of the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> such Monks,
Clerks, and Ley-men, as did but pester the Councel,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17507:19"/>
and suffer none but such as the Bishops brought
with them. This also was for avoyding of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
In the meane time you see that Lay-men not
appointed by the Prince, but brought by the Bishops
were allowed to be present at the Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi>
But how agreeth that saying of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the
younger, that it is unlawfull for him, that is not in
the ranke of the most holy Bishops to meddle with
Ecclesiasticall treaties and affaires? It seemeth to
crosse that, which they granted before to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and his delegats. For how can he or they, if
this be true, have a chief hand in all deliberations and
determinations, or a decisive voice. Yea by this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ministers, or preaching Presbyters ought not
to meddle with Ecclesiasticall affaires, for they are
not set in the rank of Bishops. This saying of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
is alledged by the Papists against the definitive
voices of Emperours and Princes themselves. And
therefore we may conjecture whereunto their course
doth tend, notwithstanding of the faire shew they
made a little before. But as for that saying of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
extant in the Councell of <hi>Ephesus, Whittaker de
conciliis</hi> proveth it to be forged, <hi>quia non habetur in
antiquis exemplaribus,</hi> It is not extant in the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
and it is false in it self. For he did meddle.
And howbeit <hi>Theodosius</hi> was not present himself at
the Councell, yet he sent <hi>Candidianus,</hi> who informed
him of their proceedings. Thirdly, the words are
not rightly translated, for the words are not, <hi>the
order or rank of Bishops,</hi> but, <hi>the catalogue of Bishops:</hi>
meaning that none should meddle with the affaires
and questions to bee treated in the Councell, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17507:19"/>
such as were sent from their Kirks, and were written
up in the catalogue which their Bishops brought
with them. This is observed by <hi>Iunius.</hi> For the
same respect which <hi>Theodosius</hi> had, <hi>Martinus</hi> was
moved, say they, to say at the Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
non esse suumsed Episcoporum tantum subscribere,</hi>
that it was not his part, but the Bishops only to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.
How could they urge him to subscribe, if it
belonged only to Bishops? This famous man
<hi>Martine</hi> was an Abbot, or the father of many
Monks. He refused to subscribe, because he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the cause, but the errour of <hi>Eutyches</hi> another
Monkish father. Alwayes we see what Assemblies
they intended to have had, even just like the Popish;
Bishops only having decisive voices, and no other
Assembly shall wee have, if they can attaine to their
intent. But to returne to the point. We let them
understand our Assemblies are not to be ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the patterne of these Monkish times. The
question is, whither they will acknowledge this
Assembly to bee constitute according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
and practise of our owne Kirke. But
lest the Reader should conceive an errour to bee
in this, that Lay-men should have decisive voice
in Assemblies, wee will by the way stay a little
upon this point. Their argument brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it is <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> but it is naught. For if it
bee intrusion upon the pastorall charge, the Prince
can not authorize Lay-men to give decisive voice
in Assemblies, which they granted before: for
that were to intrude them into the pastorall
charge. And by the same reason neither he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17507:20"/>
nor his delegats can have decisive voice: but the
truth is, it is no intrusion into that pastorall
charge, which is proper to the Pastor, which is to
preach the word publickly and minister the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But this is not the end of meeting in Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
but to root out Heresies, redresse abuses, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
upon the common affaires, which is not the
proper charge of Pastors, but common also to others
endued with knowledge of the Scriptures; or as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Willets</hi> saith, this office to be performed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels;
is common to the whole Kirk. If to feed be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more largely, and to open up the true sense of the
Scripture, or to refute Heresies, or mend abuses be
to feed, then others then Pastors may be said to feed
in that large sense. Ministers in Assemblies do not
feed as Pastours, but as delegat from their Kirks they
take heed that no corruption in doctrine, nor abuse in
manners creep in. But that meer lay-men, howbeit
not ruling Elders or office-bearers in the Kirk, may
have decisive voice in Councels, providing they be
endued with gifts sufficient and be freely choosen by
the Kirks of the bounds, where they are resident, is
made evident by Scripture, reason and antiquity. In
the Councell holden at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> act 15. not only the
Apostles and elders, but also other brethren had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive
voice. There was much disputing v. 7. and the
whole multitude keeped silence v. 12. whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that in the time of the disputation many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Apostles and Elders spake. The Apostles,
Elders and Brethren sent choosen men with <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Antioch</hi> to make known to them what
was concluded and agreed upon in the Councell
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17507:20"/>
23. and 25. And in common, the Apostles, Elders,
and Brethren, say, <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost, and
to us,</hi> which importeth a decisive voice. Whereupon
the Cardinall <hi>Arelatensis</hi> at the councell of <hi>Basile,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
that others then Bishops should have decisive
voices in Councells, <hi>unde apparet alios quam Episcopos
in conciliis habuisse vocem decidentem. A Eneas Sylvius
lib. 1. de concilio Basileensi.</hi> But the text beareth that
others beside the Apostles and Elders wrote in their
epistle, <hi>It seemeth good to the holy Ghost and to us.</hi> It
seemeth these brethren were such as disputed and
reasoned <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> upon the matter in hand' <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <hi>placet</hi> were the words used in giving definitive
sentence in Councels. Next, there is reason for it.
The nationall Councell or generall Assembly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
the whole Kirk of the nation in a most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
manner. Therefore it should consist of men of
all ranks, and not of Clergie men only. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
compareth generall Councels to a Parliament. But
persons of all sorts and ranks, by the persons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
their Estate, have voice in the Parliament.
Naturall equity requireth the like to be observed in
nationall Councels. <hi>Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctari
&amp; approbari debet,</hi> That which concerneth all
should be handled and approved by all. But matters
of Faith and manners the subject, whereupon natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Assemblies do treat are common and concerne
all, the Laitie as well as the Clergie. It is against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that Ministers should lay a yock upon the people
without their own consent and approbation. The
Scripture is the only supreme judge of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in religion: the Councell doth only interpret
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17507:21"/>
and point out the sense and meaning of the Scripture,
which gift Lay-men may have. Yea the judgement
of one Lay-man agreeing with the Scripture is to be
preferred before the judgement of a whole Councell
contradicting the Scripture. And <hi>Gerson examinat.
Doctr. Par.</hi> 1. sayeth, any learned man ought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to a whole Councell, if he perceive them to erre
through malice or ignorance. Pastors are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen to sit in Councels, because it is presumed
that they have the greatest skill in Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But it may fall out otherwise: for the gifts of
knowledge and spirituall wisedome are not precisely
tied to them. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> detested the Synods where
rude and ignorant Bishops, whereof there were many
in his time, did vote. <hi>Merito illas Synodos detestabatur,
in quibus Episcopi suffragia ferentes essent rustici, idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otae,
illiterati, nulla sacrarum literarum scientia praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
nec in rebus sacris exercitati, qui utique aequum judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ferre non possunt. Spalatensis. Lib. 7. cap. 3. Num.
29. Marsilius Patavinus</hi> in his <hi>Defensor pacis part.</hi> 2.
<hi>cap.</hi> 20. taketh GOD to witnesse, that he knew many
Priests and some Prelats who could not speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
latine: and because the most part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Priests had small skill in the Scriptures, he
wisheth or adviseth a generall Councell to be filled
up with others who were not Priests: <hi>generale Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium
etiam per non Sacerdotes integrari. Sic enim fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
Apostolicum senioribus.</hi> Before <hi>Luthers</hi> time scarce
one Bishop of a thousand could reade latine. <hi>Sibran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

Pastors and often times ungodly to a Councell,
and exclude learned Godly and wise-men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:17507:21"/>
The Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> saith, <hi>That it is not the title of
a Bishop should give him the right of suffrage,</hi> and if he
be unfit, his <hi>placet</hi> is ridiculous. <hi>l. 7. c. 3. num.</hi> 29. In
his 7. book <hi>c. 3 num.</hi> 5. he proveth that Lay-men may
vote in councel, for this reason because they may have
the gift to expound or open up the meaning of the
Scripture. <hi>Paulus etiam Laicos fideles agnovit posse
&amp; solere sacram Scripturam ex dono spiritus expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
prophetae duo aut tres, &amp;c: 1. Cor.</hi> 4. 29. As for
practise in ancient times, notwithstanding of the pride
of the Clergie and superstition prevailing, wee have
proofe sufficient. <hi>Theodoretus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cyrus, epist.</hi>
81. Required a Councel, consisting not only of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
but also Magistrats, and others in dignitie, that
are learned in divine things, and to declare plainly
what is their judgement. <hi>Isidorus Mercator,</hi> in his order
of celebrating Councels, saith, <hi>Deinde ingrediantur &amp;
laici qui electione Concilij interesse meruerunt.</hi> Let lay-men
enter, who by the choice of the Councel, merite
to be present. <hi>Marcilius Patavinus,</hi> in the chapter
above-cited, alledged this place for our purpose; and
addeth, <hi>multo magis igitur literati &amp; in lege divina peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
quanquam non sacerdotes existant.</hi> The decrees of
the second Councel of <hi>Orenge</hi> were subscribed by
Lay-men of great dignitie, <hi>Laici etiam illustres &amp;
magnifici viri subscripserunt, Magd. Cent. 5. cap.</hi> 9.
And in the Synod holden at <hi>Cullen. Anno</hi> 887. There
were present religious Lay-men, with whose consent
the decrees of that Councel were promulgat. At the
Councel of <hi>Metz</hi> holden under <hi>Arnulphus</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
many Earles, and other nobles, with other Lay-men,
fearing God. In the beginning of the first chap.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17507:22"/>
we have these words, <hi>Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri &amp; fideles
Laici qui ante nos fuerunt juxta sacram Canonum authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
saepius in Christi nomine convenientes, justiciam Dei
statuerunt, &amp; idcirco suis diebus pacem habuerunt.</hi>
They tell us that therefore Fathers had peace in their
dayes, when Lay-men conveened in Chists Name
with the Clergie, and made righteous decrees. These
Councels are alledged for our purpose by the Bishop
of <hi>Spalato</hi> in the chapter above-mentioned. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the review of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> a <hi>French</hi>
Catholick, <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 8. Maintaineth that from all
antiquity Lay-men have had their place in Councels,
not only to deliberat, but to determin also, &amp; alledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for his purpose not only act. 15. 23. But also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
specially of councels holden in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Synod holden <hi>An.</hi> 742. hath these
words, <hi>By the advice of the Churchmen and Princes of the
Realme, We have ordained, decreed, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Carloman,</hi>
Duke and Prince of the <hi>French Pepin,</hi> a French Duke
and Prince called another Synod at <hi>Soissons</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Church-men and some chief Lay-men of the
Realme, with whom hee enacted some ecclesiasticall
lawes, <hi>An.</hi> 744. The councel of <hi>Meaux,</hi> holden under
<hi>Charles</hi> the second, <hi>An.</hi> 845. maketh mention of some
other councels that consisted of clergie and lay-men,
so were Earles &amp; other godly laym-en, at the councel
holden at <hi>Pistis,</hi> a town upon the river of <hi>Seyn, Anno</hi>
963. Both Clergie &amp; lay-men flocked in great troups
to the councel at <hi>Tribur</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and at the end of
that councel, we have these words, <hi>This holy subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was confirmed and fairly approved by the reverend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and worthie answers of the Priests, Deacons, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17507:22"/>
Lay-nobilitie.</hi> At the famous councel of <hi>Constance</hi>
were present 24. Dukes, 140. Earles, divers delegat
from cities and corporations, divers learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
divers Burgesses of Universities. At the first
councel of <hi>Pisa</hi> there were the delegats of Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Proctours of cities, and some Doctours in
law, to the number of 400. <hi>All of whom</hi> (saith the
apologie of that councel) <hi>treating of points in divinity,
when they had deposed the two Antipopes that contended
for the Popedome, and elected</hi> Alexander <hi>the fifth, made
many good ordinances in the Kirk of God.</hi> So at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
councel of <hi>Pisa,</hi> there were also the delegats of
Universities `with sundrie Doctors in law, and other
men in great aboundance, well skilled in maters both
divine and humane. Many other Synods or councels
are cited in that eight chapter, whereunto we refer the
Reader. As for the Popish distinction of consenting
and defining, or determining; that Lay-men consented
but did not define or determine: the reader may finde
expressions in the contrare in the examples above-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Whittaker</hi> proveth that the <hi>Bishops</hi> themselves
subscribed as consenting: How ridiculous it is to
grant them power to debate upon or discusse any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and consent or dissent to the determination, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the one side, or other, &amp; not to determin what
is that lesse? For if the Clergie men have determined,
and the Laymen consent not, their determination is
frustrat. Right judgement cannot be given, but after
the discussing of the cause, saith the Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi>
in the chapter above-cited. Neither doth he admit
some of the councel to bee judges, and others to bee
disputers only. Now seeing meere Lay-men orderly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17507:23"/>
elected have had, and ought to have decisive voice in
councels, much more ruling Elders, seeing they are
chosen out of the laity as fittest to governe: And if
the fittest bee not chosen, it is an abuse or neglect
which should be amended. The Elders at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were not only preachers, but rulers;
for the name was common to both, and both are
comprehended, where the sense distinguisheth not.
If <hi>Bilson Pag.</hi> 180. comprehend Deacons under the
name of Elders; with greater reason may we the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders: and so doe our Divines, <hi>Iunius, Alste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and others disputing upon this subject. Yea,
<hi>Zwinglius</hi> in his Epistles, taketh here Elders only for
the ruling Elders. Alwayes seeing the constitutions
of the Eldership was directed from the <hi>Iewish</hi> kirk, the
Kirk of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was in this, as in many other things,
a paterne to the rest. This digression was necessarie,
howbeit their acception toucheth not the point in
question to wit, Whither this last Assembly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
according to the acts, and established order of
our Kirk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They alledge,</hi> That if the pretended Commissioners,
both Lay and Ecclesiastick, were for none other cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable,
yet ought they to bee declined, because the most
part, if not all the Commissioners directed to this meeting,
have precondemned episcopall government, have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
at least suspended obedience to the acts of the generall
Assembly and Parliament: concerning the five articles of
<hi>Perth,</hi> have approved their Covenant, as most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to bee imbraced of all in this Kingdome, and not only
have given judgement of these things before hand, but by
most solemne oathes bound themselves to defend and stand
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17507:23"/>
to the same, as doth appear by their Covenant, petitions,
potestations, pamphlets, lybels, and sermons; for a judge
probably suspect, may be declined: and of all probabilities
the most pregnant, is, when the judge before he come to
judgement, doth give sentence of the things judged. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theretill
they have declined the Commissioners as
incompetent judges, now they decline them as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
which is</hi> recusatio judicis suspecti.</p>
            <p>Suppose it were true, what is here alledged of all or
the most part, yet can they not bee set, for as it was
answered at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> to the <hi>Arminians,</hi> us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like exception, that by this reason <hi>Arrius, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius,
Eutyches,</hi> and other like Hereticks, could not
have been condemned justly in the councels of <hi>Nice,
Ephesus, Chalcedon:</hi> because the <hi>orthodox</hi> teachers
who had impungned their doctrine before, sate as
judges upon their doctrine, <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exandria</hi>
impugned the hereticall opinion of <hi>Arrius</hi>
before the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> was convocat, and yet
sate as judge at the councel of <hi>Nice</hi> upon <hi>Arrius.</hi> Did
not <hi>Cyrillus</hi> sit in the Councel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> upon the
<hi>Nestorians?</hi> howbeit he had impugned their doctrine
before. In <hi>Hassia</hi> when some defended the <hi>Vbiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
errour, they were condemned in a generall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
by such as had impugned their errours before,
notwithstanding of the same exception. It is no
new thing, but accustomed in the Kirke of God
at all times, that when any errour did spring up,
faithfull Pastours did timeously oppose both by
word and writ: least it should spread, and infect the
whole body: and yet did not therefore forefault their
right in giving their voices in the Synods where
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17507:24"/>
these errours were condemned. The Divins of <hi>Hassa</hi>
defyed the <hi>Ariminians</hi> to give one example of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Synod that ever did the like. Next, suppose they
had all precondemned episcopall government and the
five articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> they had condemned, but that
which was condemned before by our Kirk, and never
retreated by any lawfull Synod. Thirdly, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of episcopall government and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the five articles were not absolutely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Covenant. But the acknowledgement of
the one, and practise of the other, was suspended till
the tryall of a free and lawfull generall Assembly,
whither they were contrar to the confession of Faith
and abjured by it, for the satisfaction of some, who
in other respects did not allow of them; and being
found to be abjured by the confession of Faith, as
they are found and cleared to be at the last Assembly,
they are bound by oath to stand to the confession of
Faith in all the points of it. Fourthly, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
conveened, did not judicially condemne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but according to their severall places and stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they gave warning of the novations entered, in,
which hindered them not to alter their minde, if they
had heard any thing to convince them of the contrar
at meeting with others in the Assembly. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
alledged are to small purpose. Our reformers
protested against the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth had precondemned <hi>Luthers</hi>
doctrine by his Bull dated the eight of <hi>Iune</hi> 1520. and
<hi>Paul</hi> the third his successor, likewise by his Bull dated
in <hi>August</hi> 1535. but also declared the intention of their
appointing to convocat that councel was to root out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17507:24"/>
that new sprung up heresie. And as it was answered to
the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that councel was not a free councel.
The Prelats and other members of that councel were
sworne slaves to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and had power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
nothing but what pleased him to approve by his
<hi>Nuncioe.</hi> Our first reformers would not be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for Doctours of the popish Kirk, and had
made separation from them before. <hi>Maximus</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> refused to goe to the councel
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> because he foresaw he would be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the deposition of <hi>Athanasius, Hosius</hi> of <hi>Corduba</hi>
feared likewise their determinations: but it is one thing
to refuse presence, where they feare ungodly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations:
another thing to decline the authoritie of
a lawfull councel, when they are cited to answere a
foule libell. It becommeth them to side with perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours
rather then <hi>Hosius,</hi> with <hi>Pope, Leo</hi> rather then
<hi>Luther</hi> and other reformers, of whom some of them
have spoken disdainfully. Next, there is difference
between an inferiour Synod and the supreme. The
councel of <hi>Antioch</hi> was not an oecumenicall councel,
which was the supreme. The generall Assembly
whereunto our Prelates were cited, is with us the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme:
of which more in the answere to the next
section.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next they alledge,</hi> That all, if not the greatest part
of the pretended Commissioners, have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
partie to the Arch-bishops and Bishops of this Kirk:
for in that they declined the Bishops to be their judges as
their partie, as their declinatours, petitions, declarations,
and protestations doe beare, have they not <hi>simul &amp; semel
&amp; ipso facto,</hi> declared themselves to be their parties par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17507:25"/>
that is the Bishops? And have not only declined, but
persecuted them, by calumnies and reproaches, invaded
their persons, opposed and oppressed them by unlawfull
combination: for the subscribing and swearing wherof they
have by their own authoritie indicted fasts, have by the aid
of the multitude entered in the Kirks of worthy men, usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
upon their charges, caused read the unlawfull Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
threatned or compelled some, otherwise unwilling to
set their hand to it; processed, suspended, removed, obedient
and worthie Ministers by the usurped authorite of their
Table &amp; Presbyteries, notwithstanding the defence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinator
&amp; appellation was used by not a few in their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
intending by this means to disable them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commissioners, and directly or indirectly caused their
stipends to be keeped back, by which means not the least part
of the subscribing Ministers hands hath been obtained to
their Covenant. Seeing they have declared themselves
partie, it can subsist with no law or reason that the same
persons shall be both parties and Iudges.</p>
            <p>We answer, they declined them as party, when
they supplicated and complained upon them before
the Lords of secret Councel. Was it reason that they
should judge upon the complainers, or complaints
made upon themselves? When they covenanted,
they suspended only acknowledgement of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
till the tryall of a free generall Assembly:
Calumnies and unjust reproaches we deny. None of
the Commissioners have hithertils invaded their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
nor have any of them been invaded by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so farre as we know; But Master <hi>David Lynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
by Boyes and servant women, when hee was
come from his new Mattins and evensong, and as we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17507:25"/>
use to say <hi>flagranti crimine.</hi> Their conbination against
them was with reservation to triall. What fault was
there in fasting and seeking Gods blessing to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were in hands, all tending to reformation? where
fore should people be hindred from striking Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God and amongst themselves for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Religion by the refusall of a perverse Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
These worthie Ministers processed, suspended,
or removed were worthily censured by their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
for their Arminian, and Popish doctrine, vented
both in privat and publick, to the endangering of
many souls, or for their scandalous lives. Were these
men fit to be Commissioners to the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
To decline the Presbyterie as competent judges
could not be admitted, nor to appeall to any but to a
free generall Assembly. These men who declined the
Presbyteries have declined the Assembly, whereby
we may see upon what intent they did decline. That
not the least part of the subscribing Ministers put to
their hand to the Covenant for feare of keeping back
their stipends, is a meer calumnie. Others were postpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
not for not subscribing, but for neglecting their
charge and wandering from their flocks. For all then
that is here aledged, the Commissioners to this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
might lawfully sit as judges to the complaint,
or lybell given in against them; seeing they were
chosen and authorized by their Presbyteries, with
commission to deliberate and voice in this Assembly.
Next, they were not judges in any particular or
proper cause of their owne, but in a cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the whole Kirk.</p>
            <p>Therefore in making the Commissioners their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17507:26"/>
they make the whole Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> their party.
For they had a free commission from all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
according to the order of our Kirk, to make
up the representative of the whole body. How shall
discipline be exerced, if such as are guilty shall reject
Sessions, Presbyteries and Synods as party? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be some time partiality in inferior
judicatories, they may be appealed from, but the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
judicatory of the Kirk, the generall Assembly
can not be declined in a cause Ecclesiasticall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
as party, without making the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>
party. The <hi>Arminians</hi> excepted against the Synod
of <hi>Dort,</hi> that they were both judge and party, and
therefore would not submit to their tryall. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners
have borrowed this buckler from them. But
the answer made to them by the Divines at <hi>Dort</hi> may
serve for answer to our decliners; to wit, that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
did not consist of persons lying under any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
censure, that they cannot be called a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
unlesse all the <hi>Belgick</hi> Kirks from whom the
Commissioners were directed be taken for party.
<hi>Repraesentant enim illis Ecclesias, quarum credentialibus
instructi in hac Synodo comparuerunt.</hi> And if the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
Kirks be their party, they can not be reputed
members of their Kirk, but must confesse they have
made separation from them, say the Divines of <hi>Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
There can be no lawfull exception taken against a
Synod by the members of these Kirks which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
the Synod. <hi>Pars minor pars nova, debent stare
judicio corporis repraesentati per Synodum, loquentem
mandato, ore, &amp; ex sensutotius corporis,</hi> say the Divines
of <hi>Geneve.</hi> Consideration is to be had of times to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17507:26"/>
come, least that such as are guilty shift the ordinary
judicatories of Presbyteries and Synods, and a doore
be opened to the entry of sects and heresies, say the
Divines of <hi>Breme.</hi> In their own proper and peculiar
cause no man can be both party and judge, but in a
common and publick cause it may be say the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of <hi>Emden.</hi> In a word all the Divines at the
Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> agreed upon these answers. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in the same manner. And the decliners know
very well that the body of this Kirk which directed
the Commissioners was sensible of their usurpation
and oppression.</p>
            <p>They make a tragicall outcry, <hi>that under pretence
of summonds, the like whereof was never used, nor in the
like manner, against the most haynous malefactor in the
kingdome, they have devised, forged, invented and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a most infamous and scurrill libell, full of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
lies and malicious calumnies, against the Archbishops
and Bishops of this Kirk.</hi> Truely we hold them the
greatest malefactors among us. As for the lybell, the
most part may be gathered out of their own declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and is as evidently known to all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
within the countrey, as that they are Bishops. So
that it was questioned at the last Assembly, whither
it was needfull to lead witnesses in points notorious
and as well known as that the Sun shineth at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide.
Some personall offences were so well proven,
that Commissioners of all ranks were ashamed of
their prophanity and lewdnesse. Time served not to
stay upon the triall of the rest, but if they be not silent,
more will bee verified to their greater shame. If they
had been innocent, no doubt they had compeared
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17507:27"/>
and adhearing to their declinatour insulted: but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
none more impudent, they durst not face the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
They complaine that the table prescribed
in certaine articles the order to be keeped in the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and publick reading of the lybell, according to
which directions the lybell was read in sundry Kirks,
and in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in all the Kirks, notwithstanding
of my Lord Commissioners command given to the
Provest and Bailies to the contraire. None took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to prescribe, but only to advise and informe
what course should be keeped for citation in the
surest and most legall manner. Seeing we have been
these many years out of use of ordinar Assemblies,
the course to be keeped could not be found out by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one till they were informed. Neither were there
informations sent from the meetings at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to
any man, to the knowledge of the Assembly, but
were private directions sent from hand to hand. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
reading of the lybell was needfull, not to make
their enormities known to the people, for they were
too well known before, but for the surest way of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
seeing my Lord Commissioner refused to take
any sure course for citing them: which if he had done,
they had not been cited in so publick a manner. Not
but that they deserved citation <hi>per proclama<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to
be summoned by Proclamation, yet that manner
was not resolved upon till other means were thought
more difficile and not so sure. As for my Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
discharge to read the summonds in the
Kirk of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they were read in sundry Kirks
before the discharge was presented to the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
And what reason was there to stay citation of so
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17507:27"/>
haynous offenders to compeare before their ordinary
judge? His Majesty had declared before, that no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
should be exeemed from censure. But how shall
they be censured if they be not cited? Nor did the
Commissioner offer to take another course. So it was
evidently seen, their intent was to frustrat all citation.</p>
            <p>They challenge them for their proceedings in the
citation. First, <hi>because they proceeded against all chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which delighteth not in the discovery of mens naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
backbiteth not with the tongue, much lesse writeth a
book against a brother.</hi> Iustice requireth that publick
sins be rebuked publickly; they themselves laboured
to frustrat all other manner of citation. Should usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
oppressors, prophane and lewd men passe uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
through want of citation. The welfare of the
Kirk should be dearer to us then the reputation of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
and undermyners. Sould not the house of God
be purged of filth and dirt? Next, <hi>for breaking of order,
in breaking the Apostles rule and act of Parliament.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
it is true directeth young <hi>Timothy</hi> not to rebuke
sharply an Elder, but to intreat him as a Father, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
an elder in years, as appeareth by the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of young men. The direction is for privat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
but these that sin publickly or scandalously
should be rebuked openly, whether they be elder or
younger. The dregs of prophannesse are more sowre
and stinking in old men then in young. But they have
both elder &amp; younger among them. So are there of the
complainers, some younger, some elder. Their third
estate is not impugned in all the lybell, howbeit their
persons be made lyabell to publick citation and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and so the act of Parliament not violated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17507:28"/>
But of that act we have spoken sufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Thirdly, <hi>for not proceeding according to any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
forme, but specially against the order prescribed by
acts of the generall Assemblies. March 1596. and April</hi>
1592. For the first it is not transgressed. For the lybell
containeth speciall crimes sufficiently instructed and
notorious, <hi>ut nulla tergi versatione celari possunt.</hi> Other
crimes are subjoyned wherewith they were slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which were to be verified by informations from
the parts where the slander did first arise: of which
some were proven, the rest lay over for lake of time,
wherein if they please, an other Assembly will insist.
It seemeth rather they think the lybell too speciall.
<hi>Hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> That Assembly was a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Assembly and began the rent of our
Kirk. Yet their act beareth no more, but that
all summonds containe a speciall cause and crime, and
that none be summond <hi>super inquirendis.</hi> The lybell
contained speciall causes, and none of them were
summonded <hi>super inquirendis.</hi> As for the act 1582.
ordaining that in processe of deprivation of Ministers
there be a lybelled precept upon fourty dayes warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if they be within the Realme, sixty, if without,
to be directed by the Kirk, and such Commissioners
as elect and admit the persons complained upon,
summoning them to compeare and answer upon the
complaint, and incase of their absence at the first sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
the second to be directed upon the like warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with certification if he faile, the lybell shall be
admitted to probation, and he shall be holden <hi>pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso.</hi>
That forme of proceeding was ordained for
inferiour judicatories which sit at frequent diets. For
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17507:28"/>
it is ordained, that if he compeare not at the first cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he shall be summoned <hi>de novo</hi> with certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the generall Assembly sitting but once in the
year could not begin and end such a proceeding for
the space of three year, if this order were to be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them. Next, because that direction is for them
who admit, but the generall Assembly doth not admit
Ministers. Yea the persons summoned were never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their great benefices according to the order
set down by the Assembly. Thirdly, that forme of
proceeding presumeth that the person complained
upon may be out of the Realme or within, but in the
remotest part, and that they can not be cited by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Proclamation to compeare before inferior
judges. But the decliners were summoned by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
in the most eminent Kirks within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to compeare before the generall Assembly, so
that these who were within the countrey, or neer the
borders, could not be ignorant of the citation.
Fourthly, that forme was for faults in the office or
lives of Ministers deserving deprivation, this for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of such as usurped jurisdiction and tyrannized
over the whole Kirk, and were banded together in
one common course against the established order and
policie of our Kirk. Fifthly, the act it self permitteth
appellation to the generall Assembly, if after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creit
he finde himself wronged thereby. It is cleare
then, the act concerneth only citation before inferior
judicatories. Sixthly, diligence was used to publish
the summonds, as soon as might be after the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Assembly, and had been execute sooner
if the Commissioner had taken another course. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17507:29"/>
there was time sufficient; as appeared, in
that the citation come to their knowledge, both
those who were within, and those who were
without the countrey. <hi>Citatio contumaciam judu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
potest, si scientia citationis apprehenderit cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
atque ita comperiatur malitiose aut dolose latitare.</hi>
That the citation come to their knowledge, as well
of these without as at home, is cleare by subscriving
the declinatour, and compearance of their procurator
before the Assembly, whereupon instruments were
taken that their compearance did justifie the citation.
The fourth challenge is, <hi>of proceeding against common
equity, which admitteth summonds only by the authority of
that judge before whom the delinquent is to compeare. But
so it is that the summonds were directed by the authority
of pretended Presbyteries for compearance before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly.</hi> See their malapertnesse in calling the
weekly meetings of Ministers pretended Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
slighting the order established with so great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
by our Kirk, with consent and concurrence
of the civill authority. But for answer to the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.
They know it hath been the continuall practise
of our Kirk, that inferiour judicatories have cited
delinquents to compeare before the superior, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessare
it is so to do, because the generall Assembly
sitteth not frequently, nor may not sit oftner accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the act of Parliament then once in the year, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>prore nata.</hi> If every citation began at the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for compearance at the next, delinquents might
persist in their offences and perhaps escape all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And as for the present case, there was danger
in delaying to the citation of the Assembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:17507:29"/>
They complaine, <hi>That reference of the complaint
was made by the Presbyteries to the generall Assembly,
the parties never being summoned to compeare before the
Presbyterie, whereby either in presence of the partie, or
in case of contumacie, the complaint might bee referred to
the generall Assembly.</hi> The complaint was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
breach of the cautions for the most part, and
could not be well tryed without the tryall of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Assemblies, whereupon the parties complained
upon, would build most of their defences. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Presbyteries referred the tryall of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the generall Assembly, as the most able and
undoubtedly competent Iudge, without citation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
themselves: and as matters stood for the present,
they could doe none otherwise, without great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and interruption to bee made by their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and assistance of civill power. It was fit the
complaint presented to the Presbyteries should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat
in their books, seeing it was the ground of
their citation. Suppose there had been no complaint
made to the Presbyteries, not only some, but all the
Presbyteries in the Kingdome might have cited them
to compeare before the generall Assembly: because
they pretended they were Pastours of all the Kirks
within their pretended Dyocies, and Moderatours of
every Presbyterie within the Dyocie, and beside did
many things in common to the prejudice of all the
Kirks of the Realme by their voting in Parliament,
sitting and tyrannizing in the high Commission, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
Assemblies, keeping conventions of their own,
and directing articles to Court, to the prejudice of the
Kirk. What suppose then they had been cited not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17507:30"/>
every one in their own pretended Dyocie, but all
of them in all the Kirks in the Kingdome? seeing
there was a common cause, and the persons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
upon, were a faction combined to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the whole Kirk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fifth is,</hi> That the proceeding was against all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
and respect due to men in their place, the said Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
being persons in dignitie, and some of them of his
Majesties most honourable privie Councel, known to be of
blamelesse conversation, to have deserved well: that to be
thus reviled and traduced, redoundeth to the reproach of
the Church and Estate, and Gospel, whereof they are prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
            <p>So will notorious thieves standing in the pannell
alledge boldly they are honest men. Their dignities
are abominations. They are a reproach to the Kirk
and Estate: they are ashamed of the Gospel, and the
Gospell ashamed of them. If tyrants and oppressours
may brag of their deserts, then may they also, that
they have deserved well. And yet howbeit the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
citation hath tended to their disgrace, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
was not intended by the citation, but tryall:
howbeit disgrace followed upon the manner of the
citation, because none other sufficient meane could
be had: nay disgrace and contempt preceeded the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> they charge the Commissioners to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly their consciences, in the sight of God, as
they must answer before his great and fearfull tribunall, if
they suspect, or know not certainly according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charitie, these whom they thus accuse to be free
of these crimes, where with they were charged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:17507:30"/>
A bold and shamelesse out-cry: for the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
are so farre from suspecting them to be free,
that they rather beleeve them to be guiltie of the
crimes layed to their charge <hi>respectivè,</hi> some of moe,
some of fewer, and some of the most odious. Their
cariage is so prophane, men of credit and account are
reporters, &amp; sometime their own familiars, &amp; some of
the offences laid to their charge, are committed in the
very sight of the people. They ground the charge of
their conscience upon this, <hi>That having lybelled the
generall, they had to seek the specification theirof, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by their articles, and instructions sent abroad.</hi>
The most and great offences were notorious and
common to them all. For other personall faults there
was loud slander, and <hi>fama clamosa.</hi> For these in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of legall proceeding, witnesses behoved to bee
cited, and inquisition to be made, which the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
since hath found sufficiently proven in sundrie,
and would have found more, if time had served: for
there was as loud slander for other crimes not yet
brought in judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ask,</hi> If any man will think that the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at this Assembly, can be judge in their own cause:
They alledge a reason out of the Canon law, that if the Pope
be at variance with any man, he ought not to be judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but choose arbitratours; and some examples, to wit
of <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> and all the estates of <hi>Germanie</hi>
with him, pleading this nullitie against the sentence, and
proceeding of <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. and his Councel; and of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Cullen,</hi> who in the year 1546. did plead the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third his Bull of excommunication,
because he protested so soone as a lawfull Councel was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17507:31"/>
he would emplead the Pope as partie, being guiltie of
many things censurable in the Councel.</p>
            <p>Would not any man think our decliners to be
great Readers, and well versed in histories? And yet
they have borrowed all this stuffe out of the review
of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> concealing the book and
chapter from whence. Wee know, that inferiour
judges cannot be judges in their own cause. And
therefore <hi>Gregorie</hi> upon this ground reproved justly
<hi>Ianuarius</hi> Bishop, because hee excommunicated a
nobleman <hi>Isidorus,</hi> for some injurie done to him,
23. <hi>quest. 4. inter querelas.</hi> And yet <hi>cap. Guilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius.
Silverius</hi> anathematized <hi>Guilisarius,</hi> because
hee desired him to come peaceably to his Palace,
to deal with him <hi>pro ecclesiasticis quibusdam dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitionibus,</hi>
for things disponed to the Kirk, but
took him captive, and banished him. And 2. <hi>quest.</hi>
7. <hi>Si quis erga.</hi> If any was to complaine upon a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
he is ordained to deal friendly with himself
before he complaine to the Primat or any other
judge, or else to bee excommunicat. The glosse
upon this last chapter distinguisheth thus. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
concerne the Prelate only or specially, he may
not excommunicat for that injurie: but if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Kirk hee may. And the glosse upon <hi>dist.</hi>
63. <hi>cap. Salonitanae,</hi> maketh this cleare: If inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
concerne principally the Prelate, then he must
forbear. But the generall Assembly is the supreme
judge in causes ecclesiasticall: neither doth the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
judge in their own cause, but Christ and his
Churches, and concerning themselves, as members
and persons representing the collective bodie. But
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17507:31"/>
of this wee have treated sufficiently before. It
maketh nothing for them then, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> bee at
variance with any man he must not be judge himself.
Is there no more but variance betwixt them, and the
Assembly? and they a party, some difference standing
betwixt them and our Kirk, which must be taken up
by arbitrators? intolerable presumption. Are the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of Christs Kingdome, but the subject of some
variance betwixt us and these usurpers? The glosse
meaneth, that the Pope himself may not take mens
possessions or goods upon a light opinion, that they
belong to the Kirk, till the matter be decided. <hi>Non
debet ipse esse judex &amp; rem occupare. Glosse in Can. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudo.</hi>
16. <hi>q.</hi> 6. Neither are their examples to the
purpose. For the Emperour <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that nullity against the sentence and proceeding
of <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. and of his Councel, upon this ground; that
the said <hi>Iohn</hi> pretended to have a plenitude of power
over him and his Empyre, even in temporall matters,
and did actually conspire against him and the lawes of
the Empyre, and caused him to be pursued as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
as the Reader may see in the review of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Trent. Hermannus</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> being
excommunicat by pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, because he was
upon the work of reformation of his Kirks, appealed
from his sentence by writ, wherein he setteth down
his reasons why hee did not acknowledge him as
judge, because he had been a long time accused of
heresie and idolatrie. Hee appealed from his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to a lawfull Councel of <hi>Germanie,</hi> wherein he
would prosecute his plea against him as partie. Our
decliners make our nationall Councel their partie.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17507:32"/>
               <hi>Non credo quod à sententia Concilij appelletur: quia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium
est loco senatus. 16. quest. 1. c. eccles. habet Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
A quorum Senatorum sententia non appellatur ita nec a
sententia Concilii,</hi> saith <hi>Antonius de Rosellis par. 3. cap.</hi>
21. The nationall Councel is the supreme Senat of
the Kirk, from which as we may not appeal in a cause
competent, so we may not cast or refuse the same.</p>
            <p>They complaine, <hi>that the Authours of the late Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
were injurious to their place and authoritie in the
Assembly, because they will grant neither Primat, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
nor Bishop voice deliberative, nor decisive in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly, unlesse they be elected by the Presbyteries.</hi>
The act above-mentioned made <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. by their
own procurement, ordained that Ministers &amp; Barrons
should be directed with commission from presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
We have had no other act since for the choise of
Commissioners to the generall Assembly. In the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
holden at <hi>Montrose anno</hi> 1600, when the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were concluded, <hi>It was statute and ordained, that
none of them that shall have vote in Parliament, shall
come as Commissioners to the Generall Assembly, or have
vote in the same in any time coming, unlesse he be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
with commission from his own Presbyterie to that
effect.</hi> This act was not annulled by their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow;</hi> nor if it had,
should it have been of any force: seeing it was a null
and pretended Assembly. As for Councels of old,
where Primats, Archbishops, and Bishops had place
and voice, they are not the right paterne to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by us, as we have already answered. Nor yet
do they make any thing for them. For these of old
were Primats, Archbishops, and Bishops in office
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17507:32"/>
after mans invention allowed for the time. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
none such in our Kirk. Their consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the office was without the knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of our Kirk, and is laid to their charge in the
complaint given in against them. A knavish prat.
And yet, forsooth, they talk as if they were Primats,
Archbishops and Bishops in office, like those of old.
<hi>Risum teneatis amici?</hi> But what suppose they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be such in office? should they disdaine
commission from Presbyteries? <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
were sent from the brethren at <hi>Antioch</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
which was holden at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> act. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5.</p>
            <p>They alledge, <hi>that this doth enforce the nullity of an
Assembly, if the Moderator and Praesident for matters of
doctrine and discipline shall be neither the Primat, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
nor Bishop, but who by plurality of Presbyters and
Lay-mens voices shall be elected, which happily may be one
of the inferior clergie, or a lay-person.</hi> For this their
Presidentship, they alledge canons of ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
and custome of old, both in other nations and
our own not yet restrained by any municipall law.
Acts of parliament either of late or of old have not set
down any order for moderation of generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
or nationall Councels. Nor do we alledge the
act of Parliament 1592. ratifying the liberty of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assemblies, provinciall Synods, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
for free election of their Moderators. Yet there
is nothing in that act against free election, or for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentship
of Bishops. We had no Ministers primats,
or Bishops, either in stile or in office at that time. Yea
the power granted before to Bishops in that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
year 1584. and soon after quite abolished, was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17507:33"/>
then granted by that act to Presbyters, as the right
spirituall office-bearers in the Kirk. And as for acts
of ancient Councels, we passe them as no paterns to
us, nor pertinent for them. For we have no such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
primats or Metropolitans, as were of old, as
hath been already answered. And as impertinent it is,
to alledge that this presidentship is so intrinsecally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in them as they are Bishops, that <hi>hoc ipso</hi> that
they are Bishops, they are Presidents of all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of the clergie: As the Chancelour of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath place in Councell and Session not by any
act or statute, but <hi>hoc ipso</hi> that he is Chancelour.
For we know no difference betwixt the office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and a Presbyter to be made by the word of
God. Neither do we acknowledge our fourteen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppen
Ministers for Bishops in office, so much as by
the constitutions of our Kirk. Yea when we had Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents
and Bishops, yet the Moderator of the
generall Assembly was freely chosen, and never a
Bishop chosen but once. It was ordained in the
book of policie chap. 7. <hi>that in all Assemblies a
Moderator shall bee chosen by common consent of
the whole brethren conveened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This freedome our Assemblies ever had since the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
till <hi>Spotswod</hi> sometime pretended primat
began to usurp the place of the Moderator in their
pretended Assembly holden <hi>anno 1616. Suppose the
act of Parliament 1592 did restraine their authority, yet
say they, the restraint is restored by act of Parliament</hi>
1606. <hi>and 1609. and all acts prejudiciall to their juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
abrogat.</hi> But that act of Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 1606.
concerning the restitution of the state of Bishops can
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17507:33"/>
not be understood to concerne the spirituall office,
but only their temporall state, jurisdiction, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and preheminences belonging thereto. For by
the act of Parliament 1597. when vote in Parliament
was granted to Ministers provided to Prelacies, their
office in the spirituall policy and government of the
Kirk was remitted to the Kings Majestie to be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
consulted, and agreed upon by his Majestie with
the generall Assembly, at such times as his Majestie
should think expedient to treat with them thereupon.
But there past no agreement before the act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
1606. but rather cautions to restraine them
from all preheminence or power in the spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
and government. And in the act of Parliament
1612. which ratified the act of <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the estats in the Parliament 1597. was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and it was declared, that all doubtfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
points concerning the jurisdiction, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and policie foresaid, was not determined till
that Assembly holden 1610. How then could the act
of restitution <hi>anno</hi> 1606. be understood of restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their old papall preheminence and jurisdiction
in the policie and government of the Kirk? Next,
if they were restored to all their old preeminences in
the spirituall jurisdiction and policie by the act 1606.
what needed they any Assembly afterward to grant
them some preheminence in ordination and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Why stepped not the pretended Primat to the
place of Moderatorship at their own pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
holden <hi>anno</hi> 1606. 1608. 1610. without
election? Thirdly, how could the Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
them to any spirituall jurisdiction or prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17507:34"/>
who never had it at any time before? For they
had not been Bishops in office at any time before, that
they needed restitution. Will they say, because they
had the titles of the benefice or Bishoprick, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
might put them in possession of the spirituall
jurisdiction, and enter them into the office; then the
Papists may be moved more justly to call them Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentarie
Bishops, then the English in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, who because of
some rites and customes omitted at their inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
sought the ratification of the Parliament for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as <hi>Sanderus de schismate Anglicano lib.</hi> 3. report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and therefore were called parliamentary Bishops.
<hi>Hinc nomen illis impositum, ut parliamentarij episcopi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerentur.</hi>
In their printed Declinatour they alledge a
little after in the same section, that they <hi>have received
their authority not from the Parliament, but from
Christ, from whom they have received the spirituall
oversight of the clergie under their charge.</hi> This clause
is not to be found in the Declinatour presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Assembly in writ, but insteed thereof two
lines bloted out. Now it seemeth they are somewhat
bolder after they have consulted with their brethren
in <hi>England,</hi> who now mantaine that their authority is
not derived from the Prince. But suppose the episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
authority were institute by Christ, which is false;
what calling had they to exerce that authority? They
had none from the Kirk. And if not from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then none at all. And yet before they said
their authority was restored to them by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
1606. which seemeth to import a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
And suppose, from the Parliament, as good as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17507:34"/>
not at all. As for the act of Parliament 1609. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Commissariats, it reacheth no further
then the former. Their consent to both these acts
in Parliament and sundry other, is one of the points
of the complaint given in against them. Nay they
procured them, and yet are not ashamed to alledge
them, howbeit to small purpose. Being destitute of
acts of Parliament or Assembly, they argue from
their presidentship in Synods, that one of them in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Metropolitan should preside in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly, rather then one of the inferiour cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.
It is true, by an act of Assembly holden at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow
anno</hi> 1610. those who were stiled Bishops in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their benefices, were constitute Moderators
of the diocesan Synods, and that act was ratified in
Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 1612. But that ratification was upon
supposition, that the Assembly was free and lawfull,
and was desirous of that ratification: none of which
are they able to make good. Next when we had Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Superintendents Moderators of Synods,
the generall Assembly choosed others then Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents
or Bishops to moderat. By the cautions at
<hi>Montrose</hi> it was provided, that the Minister voter in
Parliament should not arrogat to himself any further
preheminence or jurisdiction then any of the rest of
their brethren, under the paine of deprivation. Where
it was alledged falsly in the falsified act of that null
and pretended Assembly holden in <hi>December anno</hi>
1606. that they should be Moderators of Synods,
yet to make men beleeve that they were moderat and
sought no further, it was provided in that same falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
act, <hi>That the Moderator of the generall Assembly be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17507:35"/>
chosen by the voices of the said Assembly, certaine leets
beeing first nominated and propounded freely, as use hath
been in times by-past.</hi> So, by their own grant, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not that one of the Bishops moderating the
diocesan Synod should preside in the generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
in absence of the Metropolitan himself,
whose name was not so much as heard of in their
own pretended Assemblies.</p>
            <p>They answer to that which is alledged against the
office of a Bishop out of the act of Assembly holden
<hi>anno</hi> 1580. where it was declared, that it had no
ground or warrand out of the Scriptures: First, <hi>that
if the corruption of the time shall be regarded, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Assembly might be no lesse regarded then that
of</hi> Glasgow 1610. This is transcendent impudencie.
Were the times corrupt? Were not all the heads of
the book of discipline concluded after free reasoning
in many Assemblies preceeding? Was not the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Commissioners free? Was not liberty granted
to any man that was willing to oppone? Was there
any rent or division in our Kirk in those times? Was
not the same act ratified in the Assembly following?
Was not the confession of Faith subscrived by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all ranks soon after, and Presbyteries erected?
did not our kirk adhear to that act still after? So, if that
time was corrupt, the purest and best times following
were corrupt. Was ever that act contradicted by any
other act since that time to this houre? But observe,
whiles without all shame they would empaire the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that Assembly, they suffer of their own
accord their own pretended Assembly holden at
<hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. to fall to the ground. Next, they say,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17507:35"/>
               <hi>it is ordinare for prior acts of Assemblies and Parliaments
to give place to posterior.</hi> But we mantaine there was
no act followed to repeale the former. If they will
alledge the act of <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610. First, that Assembly
is not to be numbred among the Assemblies of our
Kirk, and was declared null at this last Assembly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grounds unanswerable. Next, that same corrupt
Assembly did not determine or declare the office of a
Bishop to have any warrand out of the word, nor did
they restore that office as it was brought in by mans
invention, and used of old, but only made Synods
and Presbyteries obnoxious in ordination, depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
excommunication, and some other points, to
these who were then stiled Bishops in respect of their
benefice, and not Bishops in office, yet not without
limitations and upon assurance, that they should be
lyable to the tryall and censure of the generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
But they alledge <hi>the Assembly holden anno</hi> 1586,
<hi>where it was found that the name of a Bishop hath a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
function annexed to it by the word of God, that it was
lawfull to the generall Assembly to admit a Bishop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to a benefice by the King with power to visite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and deprive Ministers, to be Moderators of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and to be subject only to the censure of the generall
Assembly.</hi> Neither was the office of a diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
declared by this Assembly to have any ground
or warrand in the word, or that any might be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat
thereafter to such an office invented by man. Yea
that Assembly declared in the sixth Session, that there
are foure ordinare office-bearers set down to us in the
Scriptures, to wit, Pastors, Doctors, Elders and
Deacons, and that the name of Bishop ought not to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17507:36"/>
be taken as it hath been in time of Papistrie, but is
common to all Pastors. In the tenth and eleuenth
Session, they declare that by the name of Bishop
they meane only such a Bishop, as is described by the
Apostle. They declare that the name of Bishop hath
a speciall charge and function annexed to it by the
word of God, the same that the Pastor hath. They
declared then that Bishop and Pastor are all one, and
that a divine or apostolicall Bishop is the Pastor of a
particulare flock, and hath not a generall charge over
a whole diocie. It is true, they assented at that time
that it was lawfull to admit a Pastor, Bishop or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
presented to a benefice by the Kings Majestie,
with power to visite admit &amp;c. as said is. But then
consider, this Assembly was the first which was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
after the desolation made <hi>anno</hi> 1584. and 1585.
and consisted not only of none subscribing Ministers,
but also of many who had subscribed in that houre of
darknesse as <hi>Bishop Adamson</hi> afterward called these
two years of desolation preceeding: And yet did not
allow more to him who was admitted to the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
then to any other Minister to whom they gave
the like power, and with the same restrictions which
were prescribed to others, and only till further order
were taken: as that in visitation of the bounds limited
to him, he proceed by advise of the Synod, and
such as they shall appoint to him; that in receiving
presentations and giving collations he shall proceed
by the advice and voice of the Presbyterie, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Assessors to be joyned with him, at the least the
most part of the Presbyterie and Assessors, till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order may be taken; that if he admit or deprive
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17507:36"/>
without consent of the most part of the Presbyterie
it shall be a sufficient cause of deprivation, and the
deed shall be null. So this power and preheminence
was not in respect of any Episcopall office, but by
commission from the Assembly, as was granted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ministers, and during the time prescribed by the
Assembly, and only till further order were taken. And
indeed this shadow of preheminence granted first at a
conference in <hi>Haly-rude-house</hi> not long before, by
some courting and chief subscribing Ministers, &amp; now
again at this Assembly, endured not long. For in the
Assembly holden in <hi>Iune</hi> 1587. the admission of one
to the Bishop-rick of <hi>Glasgow</hi> by the brethren of the
west, was declared unlawfull, neither agreeing with
the word of God nor custome of the Kirk, howbeit
it was only to the temporality, and these brethren
were enjoyned with all possible diligence to see that
admission annulled, that slander may be removed
from the Kirk, as they would answer upon their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
At the same Assembly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> related
to the Assembly, that a presentation to the Bishoprick
of <hi>Cathnesse</hi> was offered to him, for some losse he had
sustained; and desired the judgement of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
if he might enjoy the rent with a safe conscience,
seeing he was willing to serve at the Kirk of <hi>Dornoch,</hi>
and to take the charge of visitation at the pleasure and
direction of the Assembly. But in the letter sent to
his Majestie the Assembly declared that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert
Pont</hi> was already a Bishop according to the doctrine
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> and worthy of a competent living in that
regarde. But as for that corrupt estate or office of
those who were called Bishops in former times, they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17507:37"/>
finde it not agreable with the word of God, and that
it hath been damned in diverse Assemblies; neither is
the said M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert</hi> willing to accept the Bishop-rick
in that manner. In the same Assembly it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all Pastors of whatsoever sort shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the try all and censure of their Presbyteries and
Synods for their life and doctrine, as well as of the
generall Assemblies; That such as passe degrees in
schools subscribe the confession of Faith. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
for the Commissioners appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the King and Parliament, they were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to admit nothing prejudiciall to the discipline of
the Kirk, as it was concluded according to the word
of God by the generall Assemblies preceeding the
1584. year, so far as lay in their power. In the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
holden the moneth of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, the
temporality of benefices was annexed to the crown,
and it was thought meet and expedient that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall have recourse to his own patrimonie, that
is the proper rent of the crown disponed of old to the
Clergie and Monasteries. All and sundry lands,
Lordships, Barronies, Castles, Towres, &amp;c. Pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Pryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses
or whatsoever other Prelat were annexed and
united to the crown. In the Assembly holden <hi>anno</hi>
1588. Ministers were enjoyned to deale with Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gentlemen for subscribing the confession of
Faith. In a word the servants of God never rested
till the wound, which the Kirk had received <hi>anno</hi>
1584. and 1585. was perfectly cured, and not so
much remained as the skar thereof. Yea that any
Minister should be appointed a visitour at any time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17507:37"/>
where Presbyteries were constitute, was not thought
expedient, as was declared by the Assembly 1590.</p>
            <p>As for that act of <hi>Montrose,</hi> let them answer to it,
say they, that have their calling by that Commission. We
professe that we have a lawfull calling, by the election of
the Clergie, who are of the chapter of our Cathedrals, and
consecration of Bishops, with his Majesties consent and
approbation, according to the lowable laws and ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of this Kingdome and Kirk in ancient times.</p>
            <p>Because they see they are not able to answer for the
breach of the cautions; concluded with consent of
his Majestie, and the Ministers aspiring to Prelacies,
they professe plainly they regard not these cautions,
and that they have not their calling by that commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>Montrose.</hi> The Minister commissioner to vote
in Parliament, was tyed by the act at <hi>Montrose,</hi> not
to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the Kirk, but to
behave himself as other Ministers not voters in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The plotters for Episcopacie consented and
seemed willing he should be so bounded and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
glade of any beginning. Now when they arrogat
to themselves the power and office of a diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and are catched in the snare, they refuse to stand
to that act. So they bewrey that they had even then
a purpose to deceive and betray the Kirk of GOD.
and because they are not able to answer, <hi>let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
say they, <hi>that have their calling by that commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
They said in the former section, <hi>that posterior
act derogat from the prior,</hi> now they make <hi>prior</hi> acts to
<hi>derogat</hi> from the <hi>posterior.</hi> For they professe that they
have their calling by election of the chapter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of Bishpos according to the lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17507:38"/>
of ancient times. They can not deny, but
chapters of Cathedrals and election of Bishops by
chapters were condemned by our Kirk as Popish, and
the office of a diocesan Bishop or consecration to the
office to have been damned and detested by our Kirk.
They can not so much as alledge a warrand of any of
their own pretended Assemblies for their election by
chapters, or this their consecration. Three of their
own number went to <hi>England</hi> after their own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and without their
knowledge or consent, were consecrated Bishops by
their brethren the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, returned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
the rest of their fellows. But for the breach
of these cautions, manner of election, and the usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of that office by consecration, that is, for their
treacherous dealing, they are cited to answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Assembly, and are worthy of condigne cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and punishment, deprivation, note of infamie,
and excommunication, the three punishments to be
inflicted <hi>respectivè</hi> for transgressing of the cautions.
Have they not by their own profession in this section
confessed they are guilty of the most haynous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
laide to their charge in the lybell? We passe that
which they adde concerning their homage for their
temporalities, and acknowledging of the Kings su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie,
as not pertinent to the present purpose,
and the complaint taken out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to usurpers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, they conclude,</hi> that it is manifest by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
how absurde it is, and contrarie to all reason and
practise of the Christian Kirk, that Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
shall be judged by Presbyters, much more by a mixed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17507:38"/>
meeting of Presbyters and Laikes conveening without
lawfull authority from the Kirk.</p>
            <p>By the Kirk it seemeth they meane the Bishops.
They cite some old Councels, declaring and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
how and by whom Archbishops and Bishops
are to be judged. But it is manifest by our refutation
of the premisses, that this Assembly consisted of
Commissioners both Ministers and ruling Elders,
whom they call <hi>Lay-men,</hi> chosen according to the
order of our Kirk, and that meetings of Clergie and
Lay-men have been not only in the Apostles times,
but also in times of Popery, and that we are not to be
directed by the Canons of these Councels which
they cite, but by the established order and Canons
of our own reformed Kirk, which are agreeable with
the practise of the Apostolicall and best reformed
Kirks in our time. <hi>Semper petunt principium.</hi> They
take that for granted which is denyed. That they are
Archbishops and Bishops, It is not only denyed but
they are summoned to answer for usurping such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They pretend,</hi> that none of them will decline the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tryall of any competent judicatory in the kingdome, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of a generall Assembly lawfully constitute, or his
Majesties Commissioner, or Laicks having authority and
commission from soveraigne authority.</p>
            <p>They will be sure to have such a judge as shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
them or none at all; An Assembly like to their
own pretended Assemblies. Seeing the whole pack
of them are complained upon, and for crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them all, where shall we finde other Bishops
and Metropolitans to sit in judgement upon them?
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17507:39"/>
What needeth any further answere, but that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by sundry passages of this their Declinator that
they will not, and because guilty, dare not, stand to
the judgement of a generall Assembly constitut as
the last was according to the established order and
practise of our Kirks and therefore are justly cut off
as rotten members from the body.</p>
            <p>After the reasons of their Declinator and refusall
of the judgement of the Assembly, they come to their
protests.</p>
            <p>First, for the reasons foresaid, and for discharge of
their duty to God, to his Kirk, and to our sacred Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
least by their silence they betray the Kirks right,
and their own consciences, that they in their own names, and
in behalf of the kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are forced to protest that
this Assembly be repute, and holden null in law, and that
no Kirk-man be holden to apeare, assist, aprove it. And
therefore that no letter, petition, subscription, interloqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
certification, admonition, or other act whatsoever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the said Assembly, or any member thereof,
shall be any way prejudiciall to the Religion and confession
of Faith by act of Parliament established, nor to the Kirk,
or any member thereof, nor to the jurisdiction, liberties,
priviledges rents, benefices, possessions of the same, acts
of generall Assembly, Councell or Parliament in favours
thereof, nor to the three Estates of the kingdome, or to any
of them, nor to themselves or any of them in their persons
or Estats, authority, jurisdiction, dignity, rents, benefices;
reputation and good name, But that all such acts and deeds
are, and shall be repute unjust, illegall and null in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with all that hath followed or may follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:17507:39"/>
If their reasons alledged be found frivolous, as
they were by the Assembly, and are cleared so to be
by this answer, their protest is not worth a fig. They
protest in name of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when as they
will not acknowledge her Commissioners freely
chosen, nor her Assembly constitute according to the
established order, nor any other Assembly constitute
according to the said order, but will have this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and consequently this Kirk, to be their party,
and yet will protest, profest as they are, in name and
behalf of this Kirk. Affrayed are they that some thing
should be done prejudiciall to Religion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith established by Parliament, meaning
that which is extant in the acts of Parliament, but
passe by the confession sworn to, and subscribed by
Subjects of all ranks throughout the whole Realme,
and by themselves. We acknowledge not acts of
null and pretended Assemblies. We interpret not
every act of Councell or Parliament procured, or
assented to by them, or made in their favours, to be
made in favours of the Kirk. The Kirk her self must
be judge of the fauours bestowed on her. If their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
jurisdiction, dignity, rents, benefices, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
good name &amp;c. Be prejudiciall to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
jurisdiction, liberties, and the spirituall welfaire
of the Kirk, good reason the estate of the Kirk be
preferred to the estate of some few factious men.
There may be three estates without the bastard estate
of Bishops, Abbots, Pryors erected in time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
darknesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They protest next,</hi> if the Assembly call in question,
discusse, and condemne things, not only in themselves
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17507:40"/>
lawfull and warrandable, but also defined and determined
by acts of generall Assemblies and Parliaments, and in
practise accordingly, to the disgrace and prejudice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, authority of the laws and liberties of the
Kirk and kingdome, weakning his Majesties authority,
disgraceing the profession and practise he holdeth in the
communion of the Kirk where he liveth, and branding of
reformed Kirks with the foule aspersion of Idolatry and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition:
that what shall be done in this kinde, may not
redound to the disgrace or disadvantage of the reformed
Religion, nor be repute a deed of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Assembly hath condemned nothing lawfull
and warrandably defined and determined before in
Assembly or Parliament and practised accordingly,
they intended not to weaken his Majesties authority,
disgrace his practise and profession, or brand any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Kirks with soule aspersions, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the abuses and corruptions entred in their own
Kirk, and to oppose to what more was likely to have
entred with the receiving the Service book and book
of Canons, without relation to any other Kirk. If any
disgrace redound to others, it is but <hi>per accidens,</hi> and
it may be retorted, that their Canons, and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are intended for the disgrace of our Kirk, which
we do not affirme. Next, they must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a free Kirkand a Kirk lying in thraldome. But
the decliners would have us to refuse nothing which
is received in any other reformed Kirk, if the same
be imposed, lest they be disgraced by our refusall:
which were to make up a fine hotch-potch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They protest,</hi> that they embrace and hold the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
presently professed according to the confession of Faith
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17507:40"/>
ratified in Parliament anno 1567. as the true Religion,
and detest all contrary errours.</p>
            <p>But they make no account nor mention of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
where contrary errous are specified or desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and it appeareth for no other cause, but that they
perceive the episcopall government and other inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which they were to introduce to be abjured
by that confession, which is a tacite yeelding to the
true meaning and sense delivered by the last Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in their Declaration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They protest, that</hi> the Episcopall government is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary, and that the same is not opposed for any
defect or fault in the government or governours, but by
the malice and craft of the devill envying the successe of
that government these many yeares bypast.</p>
            <p>It hath been condemned by our Kirk as unlawfull
and hurtfull, yet they dare contradict and protest it
to be lawfull and necessary. That government which
is not warranded by the word, and overthroweth
the joynt government of Pastors and Elders,
which is warranded by the word can not but be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
If the government be faulty, the governours
can not but be faulty in governing. The devill could
not envy the successe of so faulty a government as
hath brought in the Antichrist to sit in the temple of
God. Suppose there were no fault in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but that it were lawfull and necessary, but what
meanes have they come by it? Or what moderation
have they keeped after their usurping of it? <hi>Intrarunt
ut vulpes, regnarunt ut Leanes.</hi> But how prove they
the successe of their government to have been such as
the devill could not but envy it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17507:41"/>
By the planting of Kirks with able and learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
recovering of the Kirk rents, helping of Ministers
stipends, preventing jarres betwixt the King and the Kirk
which in former time did dangerously infest the same, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people in peace and obedience, and suppresing of
Poprie, which was never at so low an ebbe as before the
sturres.</p>
            <p>They have planted many Kirks with unsufficient
or scandalous Ministers, or corrupters of Religion
and perverters of the people. They have recovered
great rents to themselves, and would recover the
rents of the rest of the Prelacies to build up the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests
again. They have procured by the moyen they
had, augmentation of stipends to tie Ministers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon them, or to tie them to their fat sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
that no alteration in Religion should loose
their grip: and yet no Kirks worse provided then such
as belong to their own benefices they have hindered
the augmentation of stipends to such Ministers as
would not dance to their pyping. They have raised
jarres betwixt the King and the Kirk, and in the Kirk
it self, that they might obtaine the more easily their
intent. But how they keeped peace betwixt the King
and the people may be seen by their instructions sent
up to court <hi>anno</hi> 1609. the many threatning letters
sent down from court, and proclamations from time
to time, and most of all by their dealing at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
If there were no other to keep the people in
peace and obedience, there would be little peace or
obedience in the countrey. Their favour borne to
Papists processed or to be processed, their familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with them more then common, and employment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17507:41"/>
of them may let us see, that if Poprie be suppressed,
it is not suppressed by them, but by other meanes,
as the powerfull preaching of the word, or the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of controversies wherewith our Kirk was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or by the authority of men in place and credite in
the country. But we doubt that Popry is at so low
an ebbe, nor will it be seen till the light of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
reformation discover them. Sure we are, to bring
in Popry peice and peice, was not the meane to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Poprie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They protest,</hi> that seeing these who for scrouple of
conscience did mislike the service book, Canons or high
Commission which were apprehended or given forth to be
the cause of the trouble of this Kirk, have now received
satisfaction, and his Majestie is graciously pleased to
forget and forgive all offences by past in these sturres, that
all the Subjects may live in peace and love; laying aside en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
hatred and bitternesse: and if any refuse so to doe,
that they bear the blame, and be thought the cause of the
troubles may ensue, and that the same be not imputed to
them or any of them, who desire nothing more nor to live
in peace and concord with all men, under his Majesties
obedience, who have committed nothing against the laws
of the Kingdome and Kirk, which may give anie just
cause of offence, and who are so farre from wishing anie
harme to anie man in his person or estate, notwithstanding
all the injuries and indignities they have suffered, that
for quenching this present combustion; they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
after clearing their innocencie, not only to lay down
their bishoprick at this Majesties feet, but also, if it so
pleased God to lay down their lives, and become a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for this attonement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:17507:42"/>
We answer, Others for scrouple of conscience
mislike the service book, canons, or high Commission.
But they are not in the number of these who make
any scrouple: How can we who mislike, like them to
be Ministers, far lesse governours in our Kirk, who do
not mislike them: what satisfaction can we receive by
the discharge of these books, seeing other books more
corrupt may be imposed afterwards, seeing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not condemned, but avouched to be a mean to
beat out idolatrie and superstition, seeing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were not taken order with for their corrupt
disposition, and intend to obtrud them, and to raise
persecution for them. They may doe in and by the
Councel, as much as may trouble Ministers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
howbeit they sit not in the Court of high
Commission. The books were but the instrumentall
cause of the troubles and sturres, but they were the
principall cause, authours and procurers of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
The five articles, which have wrought much
disquietnesse these twentie years by-past, were not
quit, but the practise left free whereby division could
not but bee intertained. Can Religion be setled in
peace, or religion be preserved in puritie their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
continuing? they would be loath to lay
down their Bishopricks at his Majesties feet, if they
were not confident to take them up again. Yet they
will not doe it, till their innocencie be cleared, that
is, they will never doe it: for their innocencie will
never be cleared. If you will beleeve them, they
could be content like <hi>Ionas</hi> to be cast in the sea to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a calme. They have lived like <hi>Salamanders</hi>
in the fire of combustion, and now on a sudden would
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17507:42"/>
quench the fire with their bloud. Will they lay down
but their Bishopricks at the feet of the Kirke, as they
ought to doe, and that will quench the combustion:
But they will lay them down only where they are
sure to receive them againe.</p>
            <p>They protest deeply, <hi>that they use not this declinatour
and protestation out of fear of any guiltinesse, whereof any
of them is conscious to himself, but of conscience of their
duetie to God and his Church, being most willing everie
one of them to undergo the most lawfull and exact triall of
any competent judicatorie in the Kingdome, or of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Commissioner foresaid.</hi> But the generall Assembly
cannot be denyed to be the most competent judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the Kingdome. <hi>They beseech my Lord Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
to interceed with his Majestie, for appointing a free &amp;
lawfull generall Assembly, such as Gods word, the practise
of the primitive Kirk, and laws of the Kingdome doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
with all convenient speed, that they or any other of
the Clergie may be heard to answer all accusations, abide
tryall for clearing of their innocencie, or receiving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
punishment.</hi> But it is made evident alreadie, that
they meane by the primitive Kirk, not the primitive
that is Apostolicall, as appeareth by the Canons of
some ancient councels, which are no rule to us. Nor
can we have any other Bishops to judge upon them,
seeing we have none but such as are complained upon
and summoned. The laws of the Kingdome have not
prescribed the order and constitution of our generall
Assemblies, nor is it pertinent to them. All the while
they request not an Assembly to be appointed, as the
Kirk within this Kingdome hath prescribed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from time to time: are these men to be suffered
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17507:43"/>
in this Kirk, that will not submit themselves to the
tryall of the supreme judicatorie constitute accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the acts and constitutions of our Kirk? So it is
not only this, but all other Assemblies constitute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prescribed order of the Kirk that they
shun.</p>
            <p>They protest, <hi>That this protestation in respect of their
lawfull absence, may be received in their own name, and
in name of the Kirk of</hi> Scotland, <hi>that shall adhere to the
said protestation, at the hands of Doctour</hi> Robert Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltoun
<hi>Minister at</hi> Glasfurde, <hi>to whom they gave
power and mandat to present the same in or at the said
Assembly &amp;c.</hi> They say not to the said Assembly,
or with reverence to the said Assembly. The vanity
of their protesting in name of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and their adherents we have laide open before. What
cause can they pretend for lawfull absence. Some of
them were in <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Hammiltoun,</hi> and might
have presented their Declinatour and Protestation
themselves, if their hauty spirits would have suffered
them to compeare before Presbyters, to whom they
were terrible in former times.</p>
            <p>Least their deep Protestations should make men
beleeve that they are the most innocent men that may
be, you shall have here subjoyned good Reader the
crimes and offences which were laide to their charge,
and were either so notorious that they could not be
denyed, or clearly proven before the Assembly.</p>
            <p>After that, such as were aspired to Prelacies had
obtained in the generall Assembly by the Kings assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and not without great opposition of the better
and most judicious sort of the Ministerie, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17507:43"/>
might vote in Parliament, it was agreed unto by
themselves, that they should be nominate and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Kirk to his Majestie, who should have
vote in Parliament, and whom his Majestie should
choose, they should be admitted by their Synods,
where they were resident. But they regarded neither
the recommendation of the general Assembly nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
by their Synods. As for cautions to keep him
that shall have vote in Parliament from corruption,
howbeeit they agreed unto them for the present, yet
afterward their actions bewrayed, they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to keep them. They voted in Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lawfull entry or admission, the Kirk disassenting
and repining, or without inserting of the cautions,
which were agreed upon to keep the Ministers voters
in Parliament from corruption. Whereas it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by the cautions that he shall not presume at any
time to propone in Parliament, Councell or conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any thing in name of the Kirk, without expresse
warrand and direction of the Kirk, but such as he shall
answer to be for the well of the Kirk, under the paine
of deposition from his office, nor keep silence, or
consent to any thing that may bee prejudiciall to
the liberty and well of the Kirk, under the same
paine. And yet have they voted and given assent
to many acts in Parliament prejudiciall to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Kirk, almost in every Parliament
which hath been holden since they began to take the
place to vote in Parliament. Whereas the Minister
voter was bound at every generall Assembly to give
an account anent the discharge of his commission
since the Assembly preceeding, and to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17507:44"/>
to their censure, and stand to their determination
without any appellation, and to seek and obtaine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of his doings at the said Assembly under
the paine of infamie and excommunication, yet since
they began to vote in Parliament, the liberty of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generall Assemblies yearly was taken from us,
and when we had any of their own framing, yet made
they no account of their proceedings in Parliament,
nor sought ratification of their proceedings in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
Councell or convention. Whereas he was
bound to content himself with so much of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which shall be given him by his Majestie as might
not prejudge any other Minister within his benefice
or without, yet they bestow waste the emoluments
of the Kirk to mantaine their riotousesse and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which might sustaine many Pastors. Whereas he
was bound not to delapidat his benefice set or make
any disposition thereof without speciall consent of
his Majestie and the generall Assembly, yet it is found
that they had delapidared their benefices. Whereas he
was bound by the cautions to attend faithfully upon
his own particular flock, and there anent to be subject
to the tryall and censure of his own Presbyterie and
Provinciall Assembly, as any other Minister nor bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
commission to vote in Parliament, they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
all Ministeriall duty in any particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and deserted their particular flock. Whereas
it was provided that in administration of discipline,
collation of benefices, visitation and other points of
Ecclesiasticall government, he shall not usurp nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
to himself any power or jurisdiction farther
then any of the rest of the brethren, They notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17507:44"/>
have usurped power and jurisdiction over
their brethren of the Ministrie, &amp; the people in or out
of the high Commission, to admit, suspend, deprive,
fine, confine, Pastors or Professors at their pleasure.
Whereas it was provided that in Presbyteries Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
and generall Assemblies, he shall behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all things, and be subject to their censure as any
other brother of the Ministery, they notwithstanding
over rule Synods and Presbyteries and generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
when they are convocat. Whereas it was
ordained that none of these that shall have vote in
Parliament shall come as Commissioners to any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assembly, or have vote in the same in any time
comming, except he be authorized with commission
from his own Presbyterie to that effect, they have
notwithstanding taken place in their late pretended
Assemblies, without commission from any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
and have moderated and over ruled as they
pleased. Whereas there are certaine constitutions
and acts of our Kirk for the right constitution of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Assemblies, yet have they holden these few
Assemblies not constitute according to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Kirk, but after their own device, and for
acts to be made for the advancement of their course,
which Assemblies are found and declared to be null
in this last Assembly for such reasons as are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the acts of the last Assembly now extant in
print. Whereas the office of adiocesan Bishop hath
been condemned by our Kirk as having no warrand
in the word of God, and never since hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to this houre, no not in their own pretended
Assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow:</hi> Three of their number
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17507:45"/>
notwithstanding went to <hi>England</hi> without the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
knowledge or consent of any Assembly, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or pretended, received consecration to the office
of a Bishop, returned and consecrated the rest of their
fellows to that office damned by the acts of our Kirk.
Whereas the court of high Commission was not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by consent of the estates or good liking of any
Assembly, yet they accepted the power of that court,
and thereby have tyrrannized over Ministers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Subjects. They have also undertaken civill and
temporall jurisdictions, titles, and dignities, as to
beare offices of estate, to sit in Councell, Excequer,
Session contrare to the acts of our Kirk. They relaxe
excommunicate Papists when they please. They have
interdyted morning and evening prayers, when they
thought they were injured by the people. They
have falsified the acts of their own pretended Synods
They have vitiated interlyned or deleted acts and
sentences of Presbyteries, Synods and Assemblies.
Incest and Adultery hath fallen forth by their licence
for privat marriages. They have refused to admit
Ministers unlesse they first take on the order of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
They exacted unlawfull oathes of intrants, and
thereupon debarred the most qualified and obtruded
the most scandalous upon congregations. They have
taught Popery and Arminianisme, and advanced
such to the Ministerie as were infected with the same
Hereticall and erroneous doctrine. They brought in
novations in the worship of God by a pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and now at last intends to alter the whole
frame of Religion, of doctrine with errour, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with superstition, or discipline with tyrannie by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17507:45"/>
the service book, book of canons, book of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without so much as the colour of any pretended
Assembly. Beside they have detained or interverted
sowms of money dedicat to pious uses as colledges &amp;
relief of captives. Beside all these offences, notorious
of themselves, or proven before the Assemblie, the
lousenesse and prophanity of their lives was made
known, how they have been given to excessive drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
filthy dancing, prophane speaches, open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation,
of the Sabbath by their journeys abroad,
or drinking carding or diceing at home, usuall play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at cards and dice, excessive gaining, contempt of
all publick ordinances and family exercises, briberie,
simonie, unhonest dealing, abusing of their vassals,
sclandering of the Kirk, and stirring up authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the subjects with their lies and calumnies. They
are slandered also for other grosser crimes, but time
served not for sufficient triall. Because they were not
able to abide the triall: they have declined, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the last Assembly. For which offence
only they deserve excommunication, according to
the act of the generall Assembly holden in <hi>April</hi>
1582.</p>
            <p>Because they complaine in their declinator, that
obedient and worthy Ministers have been removed
from their places by the usurped authority of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Presbyteries, notwithstanding they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
and appealed from their judgement, you shall

it were more lawfull to pray for such as had lyen

mantenance allowed unto them, received bribes for
saving scandalous persons from publick censure, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized

that some of them went so drunke to the Pulpet,
that they forgote their Text: That some of them
swore, they would rather renounce God, than
