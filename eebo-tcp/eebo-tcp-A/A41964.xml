            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whither considered as <hi>Medica,</hi> or <hi>Georgica,</hi> or

onely by such weights of the Antients as are still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
that is, either by the <hi>denarius</hi> of the Romanes,
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Grecians, or by the <hi>congius</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian,</hi>
or by the <hi>librae,</hi> and <hi>unciae Romanae,</hi> and the
like, that have been preserved by Antiquaries.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the <hi>denarius</hi> is of as great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the discovery of weights, as the Romane
foot for the knowledge of measures, I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
these two, as two irrefragable principles, from
whence the rest used by the Ancients may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
And because the <hi>denarius</hi> may be considered
in a double respect, either as <hi>nummus,</hi> or as <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi>
the first acception conducing to the valuation
of coins, the second to the certainty of weights: it
was therefore necessary that both the weight, and
valuation of the <hi>denarius,</hi> should be exactly known.
To which purpose, in <hi>Italy</hi> I examined with a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
(the scale of which the eightieth part of a grain
would sensibly turn) many hundred fair <hi>denarii,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65445:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both <hi>Consulares,</hi> and <hi>Caesarei,</hi> as also <hi>quinarii,</hi> or
<hi>victoriati</hi> in silver: severall <hi>aurei</hi> of the former, and
later Emperours: besides the originall standard of
the <hi>congius,</hi> placed by <hi>Vespasian</hi> in the Capitol:
and many <hi>unciae,</hi> and <hi>librae,</hi> in brasse. From whence
I collected the weight of the <hi>denarius Consularis,</hi>
and <hi>Caesareus:</hi> that to be the seventh part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

            <p>By which comparison I first discovered, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Romanes, as <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>A. Gellius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly;
<hi>Valerius,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> by way of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

though the Greeks, as <hi>Strabo, Cleopatra, Plutarch,

to the <hi>denarius,</hi> speaking in a popular estimation,
and as they vulgarly passed in way of commerce; yet

we may evidently discern in the scale, the <hi>drachma
Attica</hi> to be heavier then the <hi>denarius.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all such writers of the Ancients, as equall
them, if we speak strictly of weight, and not of esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
have been deceived: and consequently, all
modern writers, following their traditions, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<hi>de ponderibus, &amp; de re nummariâ,</hi> have
erred.</p>
            <p>But because it is not probable, that the Ancients,
both Greeks, and Romanes, should be deceived in
their own coins, and in their own times: it occasioned
me by observing the practise abroad of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
in exchanges, with whom the same specificall
coins, in different States, passe with different estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to think of some means how I might reconcile
the traditions of the Greeks, and Romanes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the weight, and valuation of the <hi>drachma At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi>
and <hi>denarius;</hi> notwithstanding the difference
in the balance, of such as are now found at <hi>Athens,</hi>
and at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this drew from me that discourse, which I
have inserted at the end of this booke, <hi>Of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to be observed in comparing the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of coins:</hi> which may serve, not onely to
reconcile the Greek, and Romane writers, but
especially, the traditions of <hi>Philo, Josephus, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Hesychius:</hi> who make

whereas in the scale, which is the best
judge of this controversie, I finde them manifestly
unequall: the Hebrew, or Samaritane shekel, being

But this invention however at the first it
may seem somewhat subtile (for we are come

be approved. For though the supposition were
true that all hairs are of a like bignesse in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
whereas they are different in one and the

seeing hairs are not perfectly round, though the
the sense judges them so, but angular, and that
with some inequality, as magnifying glasses
plainly demonstrate, it will be very difficult so
to size them together, that they shall always
take up the same breadth: and if they do not,
little errors committed in such small bodies,
though at the first insensible, will infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,

               <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> who adviseth such
as will examine measures and weights, to begin

that there is reason for his assertion, may be
made evident, especially in weights, to such as
shall make an experiment. For admit there
were a Standard of ten thousand grains, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of one grain, it will be easie, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
subdivision of the former, with a good ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,

some little errour had been committed,
which after many divisions will vanish, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

the most curious man alive, with the exactest
scale that the industry of the most skilfull arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan

standard of one grain, to produce a weight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to the weight of ten thousand grains, but
that there shall be a sensible, and apparent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
yea, though he had that excellent scale

a grain. The like difference as we find in weights,
we may conceive by analogy to be in measures,
when they shall be made out of such litle parts,
as hairs, barly corns, digits, and the like. And
therefore I cannot but disapprove the ordinary
course of most Geographers, whither Greeks,
Latines, or Arabians, that from such nice begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
measure out a degree upon earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently

shall have occasion to speak hereafter. And
therefore to return to the businesse in hand.</p>
            <p>Since the Romane foot cannot be recovered
by hairs, grains, digits, palms, and such like phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall

ought to be precisely limited, and determined:
some relinquishing the former way as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
have endeavoured, with much ingenious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

there is the same analogy between measures and

demonstrate, or rather illustrate the affections of

by weights, measuring some physicall bodies,

by reason of the different gravity, which

            <p>After these experiments of so many able, and

               </gap>ange, that we should
not be able as yet to define the true quantity
of the Romane foot. For this I can assigne no
other reasons then these. First, that those which
have described it, have either not exactly, and
with such diligence, as was requisite, performed
it; or else, if they have been circumspect in this
kind, they have omitted to compare it with
the Standards for measures of other Nations.
On the contrary, those which have compared it
with the present Standards, never took it from
the ancient Monuments, and Originals, which
are at <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely from some draughts, or
schemes, delineated in books. Now how uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a way this is, doth appear by<note n="r" place="margin">Villalpand. de apparatu Vrbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

different. Which last must arise, either
by the diverse extention of the paper in the

of it, when it grows dry, or by some
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65445:14"/>
other accident, in the beating, and binding. So
that though it were granted, that so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men had found out, what we inquire after,
the Romane foot; yet it is impossible out of those
schemes, and draughts, delivered in their books,
for the reasons before specified, to attain an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
certainty. But<note n="f" place="margin">Pars sexagesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma typorum &amp; sormarum loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudini excusis decedit, quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis typogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis sciscitando edoctus sum.

               <hi>Snellius</hi> shews us a remedy
of this difficulty, which in my opinion is as
vain as his Romane foot, (seeing by his supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all paper must shrink alike, be it thick or
thinne) and that is, to allow one part in sixty for
the shrinking of the paper. <hi>For so much,</hi> saith he,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore having received small satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the writings of the Ancients, and not
much better from the imperfect designations of
the Romane foot by modern Authors, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to my self in my travails abroad, these
waies, which no reasonable man but must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of. And those were first, to examine
as many ancient measures, and monuments, in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and other parts, as it was possible. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to compare these with as many Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
and Originals, as I could procure the
sight of. And last of all, to transmit both
these, and them, to posterity, I exactly measured
some of the most lasting monuments of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.
To this purpose, in the year 1639 I went
into <hi>Italy,</hi> to view, as the other Antiquities o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65445:14"/>
Where my first inquiry was after that monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of <hi>T. Statilius Vol. Aper,</hi> in the Vatican gardens,
from whence<note n="t" place="margin">Philander in l. 3. c. 3. Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vii.</note> 
               <hi>Philander</hi> took the dimensions of
the Romane foot, as others have since borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it from him. In the copying out of this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an English foot in brasse, divided into
2000 parts, I spent at the least two houres
(which I mention to shew with what diligence
I proceeded in this, and the rest) so often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the severall divisions, and digits of it
respectively one with another, that I think
more circumspection could not have been used;
by which I plainly discovered the rudenesse, and
insufficiency of that foot. For besides that the
length of it is somewhat too much, (whatsoever

               <hi>Latinius</hi> out of an observation made by <hi>Ant. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus,

there is never a digit, that is precisely

privately retracted his error, which he vvas
not willing to publish to the vvorld. Now this of
<hi>Cossutius</hi> is 1934. such parts, as the English foot
contains 2000.</p>
            <p>Next I sought after that Porphyry Columne
mentioned by<note n="*" place="margin">Marlianus de antiquit. Vrbis</note> 
               <hi>Marlianus,</hi> as also by<note n="y" place="margin">Philander in lib. 3. c. 3. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvii.</note> 
               <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
and others, with this iuscription <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
. For if the length of that Columne were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
according to the proportion of the
Greek foot, then would the Romane foot be
thence deduced: this (as I shall elsewhere shew)
containing 24. such parts, as that contained 25:
Or if it were made according to the Romane
foot, as the Grecians after their subjection to
the Romane Empire, often used the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that the Romanes did, then had I my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
But the Column being defaced, or lost,
my labour was in vain: And it seems<note n="z" place="margin">Luc Paetus l. 1 de antiq Rom. &amp; Graec. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. mensuris.</note> 
               <hi>Paetus</hi>
about LXX. years before, made the same inquiry,
with as litle satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I should be too tedious in describing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
feet, which I have perused in brasse,
found amongst the <hi>rudera</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preserved by Antiquaries: of most of
which <hi>Peircskius</hi> hath given a good character,
in some letters of his, which I have seen in the
hands of <hi>Bucharaus,</hi> a learned man, not yet
printed.<note n="a" place="margin">Ex Epistolis Peircskii MSS.</note> Who thus writes: <hi>I cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
wonder at the inequality which I have found
in the divisions by digits, and inches, of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65445:15"/>
Romane feet; which seem to me to have
been made for fashion sake,</hi> &amp; dicis causâ (<hi>as lamps
that are found in tombes incapable of oile) more to
expresse the mystery, and profession of those that
were to use them, then for to regulate the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of any thing besides them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these, I examined the ancient stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the Romanes, hoping by collating
one with another, to deduce the dimension of
their foot. For I presumed that those excellent
Architects, before they began their work, must
necessarily propose some models to themselves,
according to the proportions of which, they
meant to raise their fabricks: which propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
could not be assigned, but in the parts of
some common, and received quantity; and this
in probability was the Romane foot; being a
measure generally used, and by publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
prescribed. Upon which grounds, I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<hi>the stones in the foundation of the Capitoll,
Domitians', or rather Vespasians' amphitheater,
the triumphall arcs of Titus, and Severus, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with that of Constantine the great, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that exquisite temple of the Pantheon,</hi>

because measuring there, in severall places,

which <hi>Tarracina</hi> is placed but <abbr>XVIII.</abbr> miles distant from <hi>Appii forum.</hi> And
from hence likewise we may certainly know how farre the Christians went
to meet Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that was XXXIV. miles. For so much was <hi>Appii
forum</hi> distant from <hi>Rome,</hi> if we subduct <abbr>XVIIII.</abbr> out of <abbr>LIII.</abbr> whereas the
Itineraries of <hi>Bertius</hi> Edition make it more.</p>
            <p>If therefore two such columnes were found
intire, (as I am informed there are four, or five,
in the <hi>Decennovium,</hi> standing in a continued or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
the distance between two such being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
measured, vvould much conduce to the
discovery of the Romane foot. Upon vvhich
supposition, I had almost resolved to have gone
thither, as I did to other places, vvith no other
intention, but only to have been a spectator of
those Columnes, and to have trusted to mine
own hands, in taking their distances. But upon
a more deliberate examination of the businesse,
I perceived that this inquiry did depend upon a
very nice supposition. For if the <hi>Decempedato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
or <hi>Curatores viarum,</hi> proceeded not with
extreme caution, and aimed almost at a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
point, in designing the just space of
each particular mile (which in a work of that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65445:19"/>
length is not probable; vvhere the inequality of
many feet could not be discerned by the eye, and
might be admitted without any blemish. For in
<note n="*" place="margin">Varrode L. L. lib. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Varro</hi>'s judgement, <hi>Sensus nullus quod abest mille
passus sentire potest)</hi> it could not be, but the same
differences, or somewhat like, must have crept in
with them, which have been observed amongst
us, in our measured, and statute miles; out of
vvhich it vvould be a vain attempt exactly to
demonstrate the English foot. The neglect of
which circumspection, amongst some other
reasons, that may be assigned, I take to be one,
of the diversity, which Astronomers found
in that memorable observation, made in the
planes of Singiar, or Sinar, by the command of
<hi>Almamon,</hi> the renowned Calife of Babylon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eight hundred years since, in proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the magnitude of a degree upon earth. For
having taken the altitude of the pole at two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
stations, differing a degree in the heavens,
they measured the distance between these stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on earth, going on in the same Meridian;
where<note n="h" place="margin">

               <hi>some of them,</hi> saies Abulfeda, <hi>found it to
be fifty sixe miles, and two thirds, others fifty six,
without any fraction.</hi> If therefore the Romane
<hi>decempedatores,</hi> or <hi>geodaetae,</hi> used not more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
then the Babylonian Astronomers
(which is not likely), there can be no trust gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

and exactnesse, as any, it will be necessary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65445:20"/>
after all to shew amongst so many feet, as are
taken to be Romane, vvhich I conceive to be
the most genuine, and true. And though in
such an incertainty, and scarcity of ancient
monuments, and in such a diversity of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
amongst modern Writers, it may seem too
great presumption, positively to define the
magnitude of the Romane foot; yet having
had the opportunity, to have perus'd in this
kind, more antiquities, then any that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded,
I may with the more confidence conclude,
that the <hi>Pes Colotianus,</hi> in my judgment, is the
true Romane foot; and that for these reasons.</p>
            <p>For first, it most exactly agrees with some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient, and perfect Romane feet in brasse,
found long since amongst the <hi>rudera</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi>
especially with that excellent one (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
of <hi>F. Vrsinus,</hi> a learned Antiquary.
Though I cannot deny but that I have seen
two ancient feet in brasse, different from this;
the one of <hi>Gualdus,</hi> a very fair one, wanting
two parts and an half, of such as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a 1000. a small, and inconsiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
The second of <hi>Gottifridus,</hi> a Gentleman
of honourable quality, (to vvhom I stand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
for the free donation of severall anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities)
which exceeds it by eight parts; but this
last hath been made by a very rude, and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hand.</p>
            <p>Next, the proportions of almost all the white
marble stones, as also of those lesser in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,
in the pavement of that admirable
temple of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> are either completely
three of these feet, or one and an half; which,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65445:20"/>
it is not probable, in a structure of so much art,
should have been the vvork of chance. Add to
this the dimensions of severall stones, in the
foundation of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> in <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
triumphal arc's, corresponding either to the
whole foot, or conjointly to the whole, and some
<hi>unciae,</hi> or digits of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the inscription on the same monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vvhere this foot is found, of the <hi>circi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
the <hi>libella,</hi> the <hi>norma,</hi> and the like, plainly
shew that these were intended to expresse <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutius'</hi>

               <hi>Paetus</hi> imagines

I see no reason why the Romane foot should
have been cut in so fair a relevy, either too
short, or too long; when the same hand, and
the same pains, might have made it exact. It is
true, that the foot upon <hi>Statilius'</hi> tombe, is

               <hi>Villalpandus</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
with more judgement, and ingenuity, hath
published his observation, concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

he infers of the Romane foot, (from the side of
a <hi>quadrantal</hi> containing eight of these <hi>congii</hi>)
relying upon the authorities of <hi>Festus,</hi> and
<hi>Fannius,</hi> against so many evidences, produced
to the contrary. Wherefore as he is singular in
his opinion (for there is not one author of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

as singular, there being not one, of at least ten
ancient ones, in the hands of severall Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

We might elevate their authorities by saying,
these are only the testimonies of two Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65445:22"/>
better versed in disputes of vvords, then
criticall in measures, which more properly are
the speculation of Mathematicians: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if <hi>Vitruvius</hi> had affirmed it, much
more credit might have been given. But we
shall rather say, they wrote vvhat was vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and commonly, upon tradition beleeved,
that the length of one of the sides of the <hi>ampho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
was equall to the Romane foot: not that
it was precisely, and exactly equall, but that of
any known measure vvhatsoever then extant,
this came the neerest to it, as indeed it doth;
yea, so neer, that if at this day the <hi>amphora,</hi>
and Romane foot, were in use amongst us, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a writer that had never been so curious, as
diligently to compare them, would not be scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
to affirm as much. Which may appear
by the practise of <hi>Ant. Augustinus, Pacatus,
Maffaeus, Statius, Vrsinus,</hi> and of severall other
learned men, not long before our times: Who
though they purposely made it their inquiry, to
discover the true Romane vveights, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and therefore made speciall use of this
<hi>Congius</hi> of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> yet have no lesse erred, as
we shewed before, in the dimension of the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora,</hi>
then both <hi>Festus,</hi> and <hi>Fannius</hi> have done.
Neither will this answer seem improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
measures, if we shall examine a place,
or two, concerning coins, in which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and those too of the better sort of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,

            <head>OF THE DENARIVS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I have made for measures the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
foot, the foundation of my
inquiry, and therefore have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it in the precedent Treatise: so
for finding out of weights, I
shal take the <hi>denarius</hi> as an undeniable principle,
from whence those of the ancients by a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
consequence may be inferred. For as the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is in respect of numbers, or the <hi>sestertius</hi>
in discourses <hi>de re nummariâ:</hi> so is the <hi>denarius</hi>
for weights, a fit rise, or beginning, from
whence the rest may be deduced. Not but that
it were better (as I gave the caution before)
if we absolutely consider the exactest waies of
discovering weights, to begin vvith the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and by them to find out the lesse, then by
the lesse, to produce the greater; but if we
look upon the condition of times, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the means that are left after so many revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and changes of the Romane Empire, it
will be safer to alter our method. For to this day
there are many thousand <hi>denarii</hi> left, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these some so perfect, and intire, as if
they had been but newly brought from the mint,
whereas of the Romane <hi>librae,</hi> and ounces, there
are but few extant, if compared vvith these. <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and <hi>Gruterus</hi> in their inscriptions mention
some, and <hi>Paetus</hi> some others, besides such as I
have seen in the hands of Antiquaries, and
many of mine own: most of which differ from
one another, either as having been consumed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65445:25"/>
by rust, and time, or it may be also by the men
that then lived, for their advantage lessened: a
thing too often practised amongst us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think it more convenient by the <hi>denarius</hi>
to deduce the proof, and evidence of these, then
by the diversity, and uncertainty of these to
conclude the <hi>denarius:</hi> And yet if some of the
best, and fairest of them, shall agree with this, I
shall think my self so much the more assured.</p>
            <p>Now seeing the <hi>denarius</hi> may be considered in
a double respect, either as <hi>nummus,</hi> or as <hi>pondus:</hi>
in the first acception, the valuation of it in civill
affairs is remarkable, in the later, the gravity,
and ponderousnesse: I shall speak no farther of
the former, then as it may conduce in some sort
to illustrate the later. The <hi>denarius</hi> was a silver
coin in use amongst the Romanes, passing at
the first institution for <hi>dena aera,</hi> or ten <hi>asses.</hi>

be any excuse of that errour, unlesse this, that

<hi>Silver,</hi> saies he, <hi>came to be coined in the 585<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
year of the City, Q. Fabius being Consul, five
years before the first Punick war, and then the
denarius passed for</hi> 
               <abbr>X.</abbr> 
               <hi>pounds of brasse, the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius
for five, the sestertius for two pounds and
an half. The weight of the assis in brasse was
diminished in the first Punick war, the Common-wealth
not being able to support the expenses, and
then it was decreed that the asses should be coined
sextantario pondere;</hi> that is, with the weight
of the sixth part of a pound, or two ounces,
whereas before they were <hi>librales.</hi> Though
<hi>Alciatus</hi> here upon a very grosse mistake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
that they were then coined <hi>dextantario
pondere,</hi> and not <hi>sextantario,</hi> but yet that they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65445:27"/>
were called <hi>asses sextantarii,</hi> because the <hi>sextans</hi>
or sixth part of an ounce was wanting: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<note n="h" place="margin">Sext. Pompei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Fest. de verb. signif.</note> 
               <hi>Festus</hi> expresly writes. <hi>Grave aes dictum à

which immediately follow those before recited,
put it out of controversie.<note n="i" place="margin">Plin. l. 33 c. 3. Ita quinque partes factae lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri dissolutum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que aes alienum.</note> 
               <hi>Whereby,</hi> saies he,
<hi>five parts were gained, &amp; the debts (of the Common-wealth)
discharged.</hi> I would gladly see by what
Arithmetick <hi>Alciatus</hi> can demonstrate, that the
Common-wealth shall gain five parts, making
the <hi>asses sextantarii</hi> in his sense; whereas on
the contrary, taking them in this interpretation
(as both<note n="k" place="margin">Agricola lib. 2 de pondere &amp; temperat mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum.</note>

               <hi>Villalpandus</hi> doe) it is
a thing most evident. For the whole pound, or
<hi>assis,</hi> before consisting of XII. ounces, being
now reduced to two ounces, and these two
passing at as high a rate in the valuation of
things vendible, as the vvhole <hi>libra</hi> did, it is
plain that the Common-wealth by this dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of weight, keeping the same constant

parts in twelve, that is, five in sixe; and not one

puts it out of controversie. And this
valuation of the <hi>denarius,</hi> as it is more then
probable, continued from the first institution of
it in the second Punick war, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
to <hi>Justinians'</hi> time, and it is likely lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
since there is no proof out of any ancient
Author, nor any character on any ancient <hi>dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
found to the contrary. As for those autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which are alleaged, and pressed by <hi>Budae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and <hi>Alciatus,</hi> of <hi>Varro, Apuleius, Arruntius;</hi>
and <hi>Pompeius,</hi> affirming, that after the second
Punick war, the <hi>denarius</hi> contained ten <hi>asses,</hi> the
<hi>Quinarius,</hi> or <hi>Victoriatus</hi> five, the <hi>sestertius</hi> two
and an half: we may give a true, and easie soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that these Writers expressed the valuation
of them, as they were in their first originall, and
beginning, with reflection to their primitive
denomination: in which respect the <hi>Treviri mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netales,</hi>
or officers of the mint, usually imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the <hi>denarius</hi> the character X, rather
then XVI. the former being the impresse of its
first institution, and the latter of its after valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And so in like manner may those citations
be answered of <hi>Plutarch, Dionysius,</hi> and others,
produced by some learned men to strengthen
their assertion, that the <hi>denarius</hi> after the second
Punick warre returned to its first estimation.
Which thing could not have been effected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extreme losse, and prejudice to particular
men, in their private fortunes, and estates; which
the justice, and wisdome of the Romane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
under the Consuls, was not likely to have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65445:28"/>
introduced, or the people to have admitted.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the <hi>denarius,</hi> as it is evident by
many irrefragable authorities before alleaged,
in the highest valuation passed for sixteen <hi>asses,</hi>
and according to that proportion the <hi>quina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
or <hi>Victoriatus</hi> for eight, the <hi>sesteritius</hi> for
four: but in the lowest valuation, or first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
it passed for ten <hi>asses:</hi> and then the
proportion of the <hi>quinarius</hi> was five, of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stertiu</hi>

            <p>These two thus passing the one for the other,
being also at the first institution much of the same
finenesse in respect of silver, it must necessarily
be admitted, either that they were exactly the
same for weight, vvhich is our next inquiry, or
else that they vvere not much different. For in
comparing of forain coins, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or

the same course, which our most knowing ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65445:31"/>
doe practise now. First, to respect the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and finenesse of the coins, whither they
be alike <hi>for the intrinseck;</hi> and next, whither
they have the same weight; and if they differ
in either, or both of these, according to those
differences to proportion their exchanges. Those
other accidentall causes of the rising, and falling,
of exchanges of monies, since they are meerly
contingent, depending upon the necessities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of times, or places, or persons, I purposely
pretermit, as not so proper, and essentiall to
our inquiry. As <hi>for the extrinseck of coins,</hi> by
which I mean the outward form, or character,
and inscription of the Prince, or State, though
this may raise the valuation of them in those
Countries, which are subject to the Prince, or
State, and lessen them in those which are out
of their dominions; yet this can produce no
remarkable difference, more then what is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>We shall indevour by both these to inquire
out the truth, and first by the Attick tetradrach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in silver: because of these I have seen, and
weighed many, some of them very fair, and
perfect, and found at many severall places, as
<hi>Athens, Constantinople, Tenedos,</hi> and other parts:
where the art of counterfaiting coins is not as
yet crept in, and where it is to litle purpose
to practise it: seeing in those places there are
few so curious as to buy them, or that will
give a greater valuation, then what they are
worth in the <hi>intrinseck.</hi> Wherefore having in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and elsewhere, perused many 100 <hi>dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii
Consulares,</hi> I finde by a frequent, and exact
triall, the best of them to amount to <abbr>LXII.</abbr>
grains English, such as I have carefully taken
from the Standards of the Troy, or silver
weights, kept in the Tower in <hi>London,</hi> and in

on the other side weighing many Attick <hi>tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drachmes,</hi>
with the image of <hi>Pallas</hi> on the fore

            <p>And that no man may doubt whither these

that the Ancients used severall impresses

for so all the later Physicians are wont to call it,
neither will the nature of the thing suffer us to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat in

the Romanes name the Denarius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>denarius</hi> also, as we proved before out
of <hi>Philo, Iosephus,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Hesychius,</hi>
may be inferred by the Hebrew, or Samaritane
shekel: the shekel, by the joint testimony of all
of them, being equall in valuation to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>stater argenteus,</hi> or <hi>tetradrachme,</hi> and the
Attick tetradrachme, as we have shewed, to
4 <hi>denarii Consulares:</hi> if therefore an Hebrew,
or Samaritane shekel in silver, fair, and not
impaired, were found, we might by this as well
discover the <hi>denarius,</hi> as by the <hi>tetradrachme,</hi> or
the <hi>aureus.</hi> And here I must confesse I have not
seen so many perfect, and entire, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane
characters, vvhich certainly are the
best, and truest, (For those with the later cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
invented, as some suppose, by <hi>Esdras,</hi>
are most of them counterfait) as to give my
self satisfaction. For though I have perused that
of <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> now in the University of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> which he describes in his tract <hi>de Siclo,</hi>
and from whence he deduces the proportion of
the Hebrew shekel, yet to speak the truth, there
is no trust to be given to it: Not but that the
coin is very ancient, and the inscription upon
it in Samaritane characters well made; but the
sides of it have been so filed away, that it hath
very much lost of the true weight. For I finde
it to be scarce the weight of twenty pence of
our English Standard. Whereas <hi>Montanus,</hi> if
he made his observation exactly, equals it to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
four Spanish rials, or to four Romane <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios':</hi>

So that till such time as I may procure out

            <p>And this may easily be granted; but if it be,
how vvill 4 <hi>denarii Consulares,</hi> 4 Attick drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,

Attick drachme <abbr>LXVII.</abbr> And the fourth part of
the shekel to be but <abbr>LIV.</abbr> grains ¾ if we admit
of <hi>Gerundensis,</hi> and <hi>Villalpandus'</hi> observations.
Which notwithstanding according to <hi>Philo, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi>
Saint <hi>Hierome, Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Hesychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
should be equall to the Attick drachme, and
the Attick drachme by the testimonies of the
ancients should be likewise equall to the <hi>dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
For the solution of this objection I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
First, that the <hi>denarius,</hi> and <hi>Attick drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
being distinct coins of different States, and
not much unequall in the true vveight, it is no
wonder, especially in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Romane
dominions, that they should passe one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
no more then that the <hi>Spanish rials</hi> in our
Sea Towns in <hi>England,</hi> should passe for <hi>testars,</hi>
or the quarters of the dolar be exchanged for
our shillings: whereas the riall in the intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
valuation is better then our testar by four
grains, and somewhat more, and the quarter
of the dolar is better then our shilling by
more then 8 grains, or a penny; but because
they want the valuation, character, and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Princes, vvhich I call the <hi>extrinseck
of coins,</hi> therefore doth the <hi>Spanish</hi> mony fall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65445:43"/>
from its true value with us, and so would ours
doe in <hi>Spain.</hi> By the same analogy must vve
conceive the <hi>Attick drachmes,</hi> though in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck
they were somewhat better worth
then the <hi>denarius,</hi> yet for want of the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seck,
to have lost in <hi>Italy,</hi> and thereby to have
become equall in valuation to the <hi>denarius.</hi>
And this seems to be implied by<note n="o" place="margin">Vol. Metia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de assis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributione. <hi>These words of</hi> Metianus <hi>I finde in a</hi> MS. <hi>of Temporarius thus corrected.</hi> Victoriatus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim nunc tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem valet, quantum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius Olim ut peregrinus nummus loco mercis, ut nunc tetradrachmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; drachma ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebatur. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by conjecture, or that he found it in some ancient</hi> MS. <hi>I know not, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation I cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</hi>

a double paralogisme, in standing too nicely
upon the bare words of the Ancients, without
carefully examining the things themselves. First,
in making the <hi>denarius,</hi> and <hi>Attick drachme</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
equall, because all ancient Authors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
expresse the Attick <hi>drachme</hi> by the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius,</hi>
or the <hi>denarius</hi> by the <hi>drachme;</hi> either
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65445:44"/>
because in ordinary commerce, and in vulgar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
they passed one for another, in the
Romane state; or else if any were so curious
to observe their difference, as surely the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
were, yet by reason of their neernesse, and
to avoid fractions, and having no other names
of coins that were precisely equall, whereby to
render them, therefore all Greek, and Latine
Authours, mutually used one for the other. And
secondly, because some Writers, as <hi>Dioscorides</hi>
and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> affirm, that the Romane ounce
contained eight drachmes, therefore modern
Authors infer, that the <hi>denarius</hi> being equall to
the drachme, and eight drachmes being in the
Romane ounce (as so many were in the Attick)
that therefore there are eight <hi>denarii</hi> in the
Romane, and consequently that the Romane,
and Attick ounces are equall. Whereas <hi>Celsus,
Scribonius Largus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> as we shewed
before, expresly write, that the Romane ounce
contained in their time, which was after <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorides,</hi>
seven <hi>denarii.</hi> And being naturall Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
and purposely mentioning the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>denarius</hi> to the ounce, thereby the
better to regulate their <hi>doses</hi> in physick, it is not
probable, but they must better have known it
then the Grecians. Besides, vvho with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
can collect out of these imperfect frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (for those
tracts of theirs <hi>de ponderibus</hi> are no better)
whither at the first they wrote in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as they are now printed? Or if they did,
why might not they indevour to introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Romane ounce, in imitation of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65445:44"/>
that manner of division, which is now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
received in our times, of making the
ounce, of vvhat kinde soever it be, to contain
eight drachmes. And surely this of eight being
<hi>a compound number,</hi> as Arithmeticians use to
speak, was much fitter then seven, used by the
Romanes, which being <hi>a prime number,</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
incapable of any other division. And then
for to conclude, that because the Attick ounce
had eight drachmes, and the Romane as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that therefore their ounces are equall: is
all one as to conclude, that the Paris, and
English ounces are equall, because the French
as well as we (and so doe all Physicians of all
Countries that I know) divide their ounce by
eight drachmes. And thus, I suppose, I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:
that if we respect the vulgar and popular
estimation, in which sense classicall Authours
understood them (For they could not wel other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
render them, then as they were currant) so
were they equall; but if we respect the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall
valuation, which depends upon the
weight, especially when coins are of a like
finenesse, so were they unequall: the Attick
drachme being of our mony eight pence far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

The not observing this difference of
weight, arising from the different gravity of

eighty four in the Romane pound, we finde by

            <p>And thus much of the <hi>aurei</hi> under the former,
and sater Emperours, as they serve to illustrate,
and prove the weight of the <hi>denarii Caesarei,</hi>
which is our next, and principall inquiry.</p>
            <p>The <hi>denarii</hi> under the <hi>Caesars</hi> were almost as
various, and unconstant, as the <hi>aurei,</hi> sometimes
more, sometimes lesse; and if they had not been
so, they could not have kept that proportion
to the <hi>aurei</hi> of the former Emperours, which
we assigned. From <hi>Augustus</hi> time to <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
as I finde by examining many of them, they
continually almost decreased, till from being the
seventh part of the Roman ounce, they came now
to be the eighth part: and therefore ninety sixe
were coined out of the Romane <hi>libra,</hi> whereas
before under the Consuls eighty four. From <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi>
to <hi>Alex: Severus,</hi> as far as I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65445:59"/>
the silver continued at a kinde of stay in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of weight, excepting onely such coins, as
upon some extraordinary occasion, both then,
and in the first Emperours time, were stamped,
either in honour of the Prince, or of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
and <hi>Augusta familia,</hi> or else in memory
of some eminent action. These last, most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
were equall to the <hi>denarii Consulares,</hi> and
many of them had these characters EX. S. C or
else S. P. Q. R Under <hi>Severus,</hi> and <hi>Gordianus,</hi> the
<hi>denarii</hi> began to recover their primitive weight,
and came to be equall to the <hi>denarii Consulares,</hi>
the half of which also were exactly the <hi>Quina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii:</hi>
and so continued during the succeeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
till <hi>Iustinian,</hi> with litle diminution, but
most commonly with a notable abasement, and
mixture of allay. After <hi>Justinian,</hi> there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
such a deluge of barbarous Nations, which
overflowed the greatest part of <hi>Europe,</hi> that
not only the coins, but even the liberall arts, and

more fully be discussed, when we shall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
their measures, and weights, and to goe on
with our discourse of the Romane <hi>denarius.</hi>
After the breaking in of so many barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as of a torrent, into the Romane Empire,
the <hi>denarius</hi> began generally to be disused, every
one almost of these, as an argument of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
and conquests, making new coins of
their own: or else such as continued the former,
either by allaies so abased the finenesse, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
of the coins, or by severall diminution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
so impaired the weight, that the <hi>denarius</hi> totally
fell, and at last almost vanished into nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Neither will this seem strange, if we shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the like alteration, in respect of weight
hath happened, by the revolution of a lesse time,
in our own coins. I shall instance in our <hi>denari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
or <hi>penny,</hi> which in <hi>Ethelreds</hi> time, that is, a

sixty two: which proportion is observed in
these times. So that it is evident that <hi>Ethelreds'</hi>
penny was bigger then three of ours. And after
times may see this of ours, as well as the Romane
<hi>Denarius,</hi> to be quite diminished, and brought
to nothing. For if either our own exigencies, or
the exigencies of forain States, with whom we
have commerce, cause us, or them (as occasions
will never be wanting) to alter the proportions
of the gold, and silver coins, either in respect
of weight, or in respect of purity, or lastly, in
respect of the valuation, the gold bears to sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
by all, or some of these causes, there will
inevitably happen such a diminution of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(and proportionably of our other coins) that
at length it will not be worth the coining. But
I leave this speculation to such, whom it doth
more neerly concern. And certainly it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
not of the least importance; mony
being as the sinews, and strength of a State, so
the life, and soul of commerce: and if those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which one Country may make upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
in the mystery of exchanges, and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of coins, be not throughly discovered, and

            <p>The measures being fixed, we may likewise

of any one of these feet, or palms, or
braces, which are described in the Table at the
end of the first Treatise. This cubicall vessell
being filled with c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eer fountain water, we are
to weigh it with an exact balance, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
the weight of it by some one of those
weights, which we have placed in a Table at the
end of the second Treatise. The side of this
cube being known, and the weight of it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
defined, the rest of the weights in the second
Table, by way of consequence by those propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which we have assigned, may be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65445:66"/>
Thus for example: the Romane foot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>Villalpandus</hi> is nine hundred eighty
sixe parts, such as the English foot contains a
thousand: this being cubed (saith he) weighs
of fountain water eighty Romane pounds. If
therefore there be given nine hundred eighty
sixe parts of a thousand of the English foot, the
cube of this will give us eighty Romane pounds
in fountain water: and consequently the other
weights will be discovered by those proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we have assigned to them, in respect of the
Romane pound. Again, eighty Romane pounds
of water being given, if we reduce this into a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicall
body, the side of it will give the Romane
foot described by <hi>Villalpandus:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the other measures may be deduced, by those
proportions we have given them in a peculiar
Table. Whereby it appears, that as <hi>by measures</hi>
weights may be preserved, so on the contrary <hi>by
weights</hi> measures may be restored.</p>

            <head>Some directions to be observed in
comparing the valuations of
coins.</head>
            <p>IN comparing the valuations, either of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
coins with modern, or of modern one
with another, we are to consider: first, the
<hi>intrinseck</hi> of them, and then the <hi>extrinseck.</hi> The
intrinseck is either the <hi>finenesse</hi> of the coin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of metall, or the <hi>gravity</hi> in respect of
weight. The extrinseck I term first, the <hi>character</hi>
imprinted on the coin: and secondly, the <hi>valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
injoined by the Prince, or State: by
which character, and valuation, what <hi>originally,</hi>
and <hi>materially,</hi> was but common metall, or
plate, comes now <hi>legally,</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
mony. With these limitations, if we shall
compare ancient coins with modern, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
one with another, it will be no difficult
matter to proportion out their severall respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
valuations; and withall to reconcile the
seeming repugnancies, either of ancient coins,
now found, differing from the traditions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authors: or the traditions of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
differing amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>I shall first give an instance of modern coins
compared with modern, in our English mony
compared with that of <hi>Spain,</hi> as being most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65445:67"/>
to us: the application of which will by
analogy serve for all other distinct States, and
times, using distinct coins.</p>
            <p>In comparing therefore <hi>English mony with
Spanish</hi> mony in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Spanish mony with
English</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> we are thus to proceed: First,
we are to examine whither they be of a like fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for the <hi>intrinseck;</hi> if they be, then an
ounce of <hi>English</hi> mony, and an ounce of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
(supposing the weight of the ounce to
be alike) will bee of like value in any other
Country out of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> where
neither are currant, but onely considered as so
much metall, or plate. Secondly, we are to
consider the <hi>extrinseck,</hi> that is, the form, and
stamp of the coin, with the valuation of it by
the injunction of the Prince of either State; and
here that which before was <hi>equall,</hi> comes now to
be <hi>unequall.</hi> For an ounce of <hi>English</hi> mony in
<hi>England</hi> comes to be more worth, then an
ounce of <hi>Spanish</hi> mony in <hi>England:</hi> because
this wants the character, stamp, and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Princes, whereby it is currant
and for the same reason will an ounce of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
mony be lesse in valuation, then an ounce
of <hi>Spanish</hi> mony in <hi>Spain,</hi> supposing (as I said)
the ounce in both Countries to be exactly one
and the same.</p>
            <p>The same analogy will be, if we compare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
coins, as those of the <hi>Hebrews, Greeks,</hi> and
<hi>Romanes,</hi> with our <hi>modern coins.</hi> We are first,
to consider the <hi>intrinseck</hi> of them, whither
they be of a like weight, and finenesse for the
metall, with ours: and this is the <hi>naturall, or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65445:67"/>
physicall consideration.</hi> From whence we may
conclude, that if, for example, so many <hi>Attick
tetradrachmes</hi> doe equall in purenesse, and
weight, so many of our <hi>English</hi> shillings, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought from the mint, or so many of our
<hi>Troy, or silver ounces,</hi> taken from the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
then are they to be balanced with these in
the acception of them as plate; and a silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,
abstracting from the <hi>extrinseck,</hi> that
were to melt them both, would give a like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for them both. But if we secondly, look
upon them with the image, and character of the
State, and in the notion of mony, which is
<hi>the politick consideration,</hi> then that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the <hi>trutinâ,</hi> and scale, was equall, in
the <hi>foro,</hi> and in commerce, comes to be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:
and an ounce of <hi>English</hi> mony shall
passe for more, then an ounce in <hi>Attick tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drachmes,</hi>
with reference to the expenses of the
mint, and to the civill valuation, depending
upon a mandate, or law, inacted by the Prince.</p>
            <p>In like manner will it be, if we compare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
coins with ancient, made in different
States, as it is in comparing ancient with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.</p>
            <p>Upon these grounds of reason it will follow,
that whereas the Romane Authours make the
<hi>denarius Consularis</hi> to be equall to the <hi>drachma
Attica,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> equall the <hi>drachma At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi>
to the <hi>denarius Consularis,</hi> that both say
true; and yet both of them, if we speak strictly,
and exactly, may be deceived. For the <hi>denari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Consularis</hi> examined by <hi>the balance, which
is the best judge of the intrinseck.</hi> (I speak of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65445:68"/>
               <hi>intrinseck in respect of weight,</hi> and not of the
<hi>intrinseck in respect of finenesse,</hi> that being best
discovered by the <hi>scale,</hi> and this by the <hi>test</hi>:
which last for the more cleernesse of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I suppose in all these coins to be alike).
I say the <hi>Denarius Consularis</hi> is found by me,
contrary to the opinion of all modern vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to be lighter, then the <hi>drachma Attica:</hi>
and therefore, to speak strictly, and precisely
cannot be equall to it in the <hi>intrinseck.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if we look upon the <hi>extrinseck</hi> of the
<hi>drachma Attica,</hi> and <hi>denarius Consularis,</hi> that
having the stamp of <hi>Athens,</hi> and this of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

weight falling short of the <hi>drachma,</hi> it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65445:68"/>
be much lesse in valuation at <hi>Athens,</hi>
then the <hi>drachma:</hi> and I think no advised A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian,
writing in <hi>Attica,</hi> would make them
equall, I am certain no <hi>nummularius</hi> would.</p>
            <p>The same may be said of the <hi>Hebrew shekel,</hi>
and <hi>Attick tetradrachme,</hi> and of all other coins,
of distinct States, mentioned in classicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Thus <hi>Philo,</hi> and <hi>Josephus,</hi> in <hi>Judaea,</hi> both
truly equall the <hi>shekel</hi> to the <hi>Attick tetradrach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
that is, in way of commerce; though the <hi>shekel</hi>
be unequall, and lesse then the <hi>tetradrachme</hi> (as
I have found by examining many of them) in a
just notion of weight. The reason is evident by
vvhat hath been expressed before. For in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi>
the <hi>extrinseck</hi> makes amends, for what the
<hi>shekel</hi> wants in the <hi>intrinseck;</hi> and on the
contrary, what the <hi>tetradrachme</hi> exceeds in the
<hi>intrinseck,</hi> is diminished for want of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck,</hi>
till at length in a popular estimation
they come to be equall. But the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
would happen, in the transportation of she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel
from <hi>Jerusalem to Athens.</hi> Here the <hi>she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel</hi>
would necessarily fall from its primitive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation,
and the <hi>tetradrachme,</hi> being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
now no longer as a forainer, would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what it lost in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and consequently rise
above the <hi>Hebrew shekel:</hi> as having a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
advantage in the <hi>extrinseck,</hi> from the
<hi>State,</hi> and in the <hi>intrinseck</hi> from its weight.</p>
            <p>But what need we to goe so far for examples,
when as we instanced before, wee have them
neerer home? The <hi>Spanish</hi> quarters of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or <hi>double rials,</hi> passe ordinarily in our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65445:69"/>
Sea towns but for <hi>shillings,</hi> (whereas they are
worth in the <hi>intrinseck</hi> thirteen pence farthing)
and our <hi>shillings</hi> passe in <hi>Spain</hi> scarce for a <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
and an half. For theirs wanting in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
our <hi>extrinseck,</hi> and ours in <hi>Spain</hi> wanting
their <hi>extrinseck,</hi> must respectively rise, and fall
in their valuation.</p>
