         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

need you be so precise (will some man
say)? meane you so to proceed in all

many of quick iudgement, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                  <p>The Meteors are divided after three
manner of wayes: First, into bodies
perfectly and imperfectly mixed: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
into moist impressions and drie:
Thirdly, into fiery, airy, watry, and
earthly. According to this last division<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we shall speake of them in foure bookes
following: but first we must be occupied
a little in the generall description of
the same, that afterward shall be
particularly treated of.</p>

                     <p>THey are called imperfectly mixed,
because they are very soon changed
into another thing, and resolved into
their proper elements of which they
do most consist, as do all impressions,
fierie, airie, watry: as snow into water,
clouds into waters &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>According to the qualitie of the
matter, they are divided into moist

of Vapors or Exhalations. Vapors are

                     <head>Of the general causes of all Meteors;
and first of the material cause.</head>
                     <p>THe matter whereof the most part
of Meteors doth consist,<note place="margin">The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cause.</note> is either
water or earth: for out of the water,
proceed vapors, and out of the earth
come exhalations.</p>
                     <p>Vapor, as the Philosopher saith, is a
certain watry thing,<note place="margin">What be vapors, and what exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and yet is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
so Exhalation hath a certain earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nature in it, but yet it is not earth.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding of
Vapors, understand that they be as
it were fumes or smokes warme and
moist, which will easily bee resolved
into water, much like to the breath
that proceedeth out of a mans mouth,
or out of a pot of water standing on the
fire. These vapours are drawn up from
the waters and watery places by the
heat of the Sun,<note place="margin">What the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, shall bee told after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</note> even unto the middle
region of the aire, and there after
divers manner of meeting with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
many kind of moist <hi>Meteors</hi> are
generated, as sometimes clouds and
raine, sometime snow and hail; and
that such <hi>Vapours</hi> are so drawn up by the
Sunne, it is plaine by experience: for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45121:7"/>
if there be a plash of water on a smooth
and hard stone, standing in the heat of
the Sun, it will soon be drie; which is
none otherwise but that the Sun draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up the water in thinne Vapors: for
no man is so fond to say, that it can sink
into stone or mettal; and it is as great
folly to think it is consumed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
for it is a general rule,<note place="margin">A generall rule.</note> That
that which is once a thing, cannot by
changing become nothing: wherefore
it followeth, that the water on the stone,
as also on the earth, is for the most part
drawn up, when the stone or earth is
dryed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exhalations</hi> are as smokes that be hot
and dry,<note place="margin">What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations be.</note> which because they be thinne,
and lighter then <hi>Vapors,</hi> passe the lowest
and middle Region of the aire, and are
carryed up even to the highest Region,
where for the excessive heat, by neerness
of the fire, they are kindled, and cause
many kind of impressions. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sometimes <hi>viscose,</hi> that is to say, clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by reason whereof, they cleaving
together and not being dispersed, are
after divers sorts set on fire, and appear
sometimes like Dragons, sometimes like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45121:8"/>
Goats, sometimes like candles, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like spears.</p>
                     <p>By that which is spoken of <hi>Vapours</hi>
and <hi>Exhalations,</hi> it is evident, that out
of the fire and aire, no matter whereof
<hi>Meteors</hi> should consist, can be drawn,
because of their subtilty and thinnesse.
For all <hi>Exhalation</hi> is by making a gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
body more thinne: but the fire (we
mean the elemental fire, and not the fire
of the Kitchin chimney) is so subtil and
thinne, that it cannot be made thinner;
likewise the aire is so thinne, that if it
be made thinner, it is changed into fire;
and as the fire, if it were made thicker,
would become aire; so the aire being
made grosser, would be turned into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Wherefore to conclude this part,
the great quantity of matter, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
these Meteors, is taken out of the
earth and the water. As for the aire and
the fire, they are mixed with this matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
as with all other things, but not so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
that they may be said th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
without them none can be generated.
The efficient cause of all Meteors,<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause.</note> is tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
caus which maketh them; even as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45121:8"/>
is the efficient cause of an house.
This cause is either first or second.</p>
                     <p>The first and efficient cause is God
the worker of all wonders, according to
that testimonie of the Psalmist, which
saith, Fire, haile snow, ice, wind and
storme, doe his will and commandment;
he sendeth snow like wooll, &amp;c. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God therefore being the first,
principall and universall cause efficient
of all natural works and effects, is also
the first cause of these effects, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is great, and operation marvellous.</p>
                     <p>The second cause efficient, is double,
either remote, that is to say, farre off
or next of all. The farther cause of them
as of all other naturall effects, is the
same; the Sun with the other Planets
and Stars, and the very heaven it self in
which they are moved; But chiefly the
Sunne, by whose heat all or at least wise
the most part of the vapors and Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are drawn up.</p>
                     <p>The next cause efficient as the first
qualities, are heat and cold, which cause
divers effects in Vapors &amp; Exhalations.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the heat of the Sun,
which is a very neere cause, it is for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45121:9"/>
this purpose two wayes considered.</p>
                     <p>One way, as it is meane and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
Otherwise, as it is vehement and
burning. The meane, is by which he dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
vapors out of the water, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
out of the earth, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draweth them out, but also lifteth
them up very high from the earth into
the aire, where they are turned into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds of <hi>Meteors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The burning heat of the Sunne is, by
which he burneth, dissipateth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
the vapors and exhalations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he draweth them up, so that of them
no <hi>Meteors</hi> can be generated.</p>
                     <p>These two heats proceed from the Sun,
either in respect of the place, or the time;
but most properly according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of his beames either directly or
undirectly.</p>
                     <p>In place where the Sunnes beames
strike directly against the earth and the
water, the heat is so great, that it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
up the <hi>Exhalations</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> so
that there are no fiery <hi>Meteors,</hi> much
lesse watery: as it is in the South parts
of the world, under and neere to the
Equinoctiall line.</p>
                     <p>But in places where the beames are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45121:9"/>
cast indirectly and obliquely, and that
where they are not too nigh to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
beams, nor too far off from them;
there is a moderate heat, drawing out
great abundance of matter, so that in
those Countries, many <hi>Meteors</hi> of
many sorts are generated, as in the far
North parts are few but watry impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Also in <hi>Autumn</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Meteors</hi> seene, then in Summer and
Winter, except it be in such places
where the Summer and Winter are of
the temper of the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumne.</hi>
Let this be sufficient for the Efficient
causes of impressions, as well first and
principall, as second and particular.
Concerning the formal and finall
cause, we have little to say, because the
one is so secret, that it is known of no
man: the other so evident, that it is
plaine, to all men. The essentiall Form
of all substances, Gods wisedome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth;
the universall chiefe and
last End of all things, is the glory of
God. Middle Ends (if they may be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
of these impressions are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
profits to Gods creatures, to make
the earth fruitfull, to purge the aire, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45121:10"/>
set forth his power, to threaten his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
to punish the world, to move
to repentance; all which are referred
to one end of Gods eternall glory, ever
to be prased, Amen.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of the places, in which they
are generated.</head>
                     <p>THe places in which <hi>Meteors</hi> are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
be either the aire or the earth:
in the air be generated rain, hail, snow,
dew, blazing stars, thunder, lightning,
&amp;c. In the earth be welles, springs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
earthquakes, metals, minerals, &amp;c. made,
and as it were, in their mothers belly
begotten and fashioned. But for the
better understanding hereof, such as have
not tasted the principles of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
must consider that there be foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Earth, Water, Aire, and Fire, one
compassing another round about, saving
that the waters by Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are gathered into one place, that
the land might appear. The highest is
the spheare of the Fire, which toucheth
the hollownesse of the moons heaven:
the next is the aire, which is in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse
of the fire: the aire within his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45121:10"/>
hollownesse comprehendeth the water
and the earth, which both make but one
spheare or Globe, or as the common
sort may understand it, one ball. So each
element is within another, as scales of
a perch are one above anothes: or (to
use a grosse similitude) as the peeles of
an Onion are one within another: after
the same sort from the highest heaven
to the earth that is lowest,<note place="margin">What the regions of the aire be</note> one part that
is greater compasseth round about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is lesser. But for this present
purpose it is to be knowne, that the aire
is divided into three regions, the highest
the middle and the lowest. The highest
because it is next to the region of the
fire, is exceeding hot: the lowest being
next the earth and waters, is temperate,
and by repercussion or striking backe of
the Sunne beames waxeth hot, and by
absence of them is made cold, being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to winter and summer. The middle
region of the aire, is alwaies exceeding
cold, partly because the sunne beames
cannot be cast back so high, and partly
because the cold that is there, betweene
the heat above, and the heat beneath it,
is so kept in, that it can not get out, so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45121:11"/>
that it must needs be excessively cold: for
the water and the earth, being both
cold Elements, after the Sunne setting
in the night season, doe coole the aire,
even to the middle region. But in the
morning the Sunne rising warmeth the
aire, so farre as his beames which are
beaten backe from the earth and the
water, can extend and reach; which is
not so high as the middle region, and
by heat on both sides is inclosed and
kept, saving that a little thereof falleth
downe in the night, which the next day
with much more is driven back againe.
Wherefore this region being so cold, is
dark and cloudy, in so much that some
doting Divines have imagined purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to be there in the middle region of
the aire. In the highest region be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Comets or blazing stars and such
like of divers sorts. In the middle region
clouds, rain, stormes, winds &amp;c. In the
lowest region, dew, frost, hoar-frost,
mists, bright rods, candles, burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
graves, and gallowses, where there
is store of clamy, fattie or oily substance,
also lights and flaming fires seen in
fields, &amp;c. And thus much for the general
causes of all Meteors.</p>

by the fashion of them, by their place, by

by the want of their matter. Their

it cannot be carried so far as the middle
region of the ayre, and therefore is set

impressions doe most appeare, is the

as it were on a round heape, and yet

it is generated after another sort;
for there is an exhalation long and

burneth swiftly, the fire running from

so much set on fire, as that it is direct

as they are very grosse in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the chiefe goodness: so they are
very fond in assigning the cause of this
Meteor. For they say, that the stars fall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45121:13"/>
out of the firmament, &amp; that by the fall
of them, both thunder and lightning
are caused: for the lightning (say they)
is nothing else but the shining of that
Starre that falleth, which falling into
a waterie cloud, and being quenched
in it, causeth that great thunder, even
as hot Iron maketh a noise if it be cast
into cold water. But it is evident, that
the starres of the firmament cannot
fall,<note place="margin">Ps. 148</note> for GOD hath set them fast for
ever; he hath given them a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they shall not passe. And
though they should fall into the clouds,
yet could they not rest there,<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Starres</note> but with

                     <p>For the least starre that is seen in the

Here will step forth some merrie fellow
which of his conscience thinketh them
not to be above three yards about,<note place="margin">A proofe of the Starres greatness</note> and
say it is a loud lie; for he can see within

many thousand miles distant from the

                     <p>THere is also a kind of light that is
seen in the night season &amp; seemeth
to goe before men,<note place="margin">Light that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in the night</note> or to follow them,
leading them out of their way into
waters, and other dangerous places. It
is also very often seene in the night, of
them that saile on the Sea, and sometime
will cleave to the mast of the Shippe, or
other high parts, sometime slide round
about the Shippe, and either rest in one
part till it goe out, or else be quenched
in the water. This impression seene on
the land, is called in Latine <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi>
foolish fire, that hurteth not, but onely
feareth fooles. That which is seene on
the Sea, if it be but one, is named <hi>Helena;</hi>
if it be two, it is called <hi>Castor and Pollux.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The foolish fire is an <hi>Exhalation</hi>
kindled by meanes of violent moving,
when by cold of the night, in the lowest
region of the ayre, it is beaten downe;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45121:17"/>
and then commonly, if it be light, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to ascend upward, and is sent down
againe; so it danceth up and downe.
Else if it move not up and downe, it is
a great lumpe of glewish or oyly matter
that by moving of the heat in it selfe, is
enflamed of it selfe, as moyst hay will
bek indled of it selfe. In hot and fennie
Countries, these lights are often seene,
and where is abundance of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous
and fat matter, as about Church-yards,
where through the corruption
of the bodies there buried, the earth is
full of such substance: wherefore in
Church-yards, or places of common
buriall, oftentimes are such lights seene,
which ignorant and superstitious fooles
have thought to be soules tormented in
the fire of Purgatory. Indeed the Devill
hath used these lights (although they
be naturally caused) as strong delusions
to captive the minds of men with feare
of the Popes Purgatory, whereby he
did open injury to the blood of Christ,
which onely purgeth us from all our
sins, and delivereth us from all torments
both temporall and eternall, according
to the saying of the wise-man, The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45121:18"/>
soules of the righteous are in the Hands
of God, and no torment toucheth them.
But to returne to the lights, in which
there are yet two things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
First, why they lead men out of
their way. And secondly, why they
seeme to follow men and goe before
them. The cause why they lead men
out of the way, is, that men, while
they take heed to such lights, and are
also sore afraid, they forget their way, &amp;
then being once but a little out of their
way, they wander they wot not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to waters, pits and other very
dangerous places. Which, when at
length they hap the way home, will tell
a great tale, how they have beene led
about by a spirit in the likenesse of
Fire. Now the cause why they seeme
to goe before men, or to follow them,
some men have said to be the moving
of the ayre, by the going of the man,
which ayre moved, should drive them
forward if they were before, and draw
them after if they were behind. But
this is no reason at all that the Fire,
which is oftentimes three or foure miles
distant from the man that walketh,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45121:18"/>
should be moved to and fro by that
ayre which is moved through his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
but rather the moving of the ayre
and the mans eyes, causeth the fire to
seeme as though it moved, as the Moone
to children seemeth, if they are before
it, to run after them: if she be before
them, to run before them, that they
cannot overtake her, though she seeme
to be very neere them. Wherefore these
lights rather seeme to move, then
that they be moved indeed.</p>

                     <p>WHen the like substance in the
lowest region of the ayr,<note place="margin">Helena, Castor, Pollux.</note> over
the Sea, by the like occasion is set on
fire, if be one only, it is called <hi>Helena;</hi>
if their be two, they are called <hi>Castor,</hi>
and <hi>Pollux.</hi> These impressions will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cleave to the mast, and other parts
of Ships, by reason of the claminesse
and fatnesse of matter. <hi>Helena</hi> was of
the Heathen men taken as a Goddesse,
the daughter of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Leda. Castor</hi>
and <hi>Pollux</hi> were her brethren. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi>
was the occasion that <hi>Troy</hi>
was destroyed; therefore the Mariners
by experience trying, that one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45121:19"/>
flame of fire appearing along, signified
tempest at hand, supposed the same flame
to be the goddesse <hi>Helena,</hi> of whom
they look'd for nothing but destruction.
But when two lights are seen together,
they are a token of fair weather, and
good luck: the Mariners therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that they were <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi>
which sayling to seek their sister <hi>Helena</hi>
being carried to Troy by <hi>Paris,</hi> were
never seen after and thought to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into the number of the Gods
that gave good successe to them that
sayl, as we read in the last Chapter of
the Acts of the Apostles, that the Ship
wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayled, had a badge
of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> A naturall cause
why they may thus foreshew either
tempest or calmnesse, is this; One flame
alone may give warning of a tempest,
because that as the matter thereof is
compact, and not dissolved; so it is
like, that the matter of the tempest
(which never wanteth) as wind and
clouds, is still together, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated,
then is it like not long after
to arise. By two flames together may
be gathered, that as this <hi>Exhalation</hi>
which is very thick, is divided: so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45121:19"/>
the thick matter of tempests is dissolved
and scattered abroad by the same cause
that this is divided. Therefore not
without a reason, the Mariner to his
mates may promise a prosprous course.</p>

                        </note> of great quantity, fat and
clammy, hard-compact like a great
lump of pitch, which by the heat of the
Sun is drawn out of the Earth into the
highest region of the Air, and there by
the excessive heat of the place is set on
fire, appearing like a star with a blazing
tayl; and somtime is moved after the
motion of the Air which is circular, but
it never goeth down out of the compass
of sight, though it be not seen in the
day-time for the brightness of the Sun,
but still burneth until all the matter be
consumed. An argument of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is this, that there was never any <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:45121:20"/>
yet perceived but at the least it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
7 days; but much longer they
have been seen; namely forty days long,
yea fourscore days; and some, six
months together. Wherefore it must
needs be a wonderfull deal of matter
that can give so much nourishment for
so great and fervent fire, aud for so long
a time.</p>
                     <p>There are considered in a <hi>Comet</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Colour and Fashion, which
both arise of the disposition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Their Colours be either white, rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or blew. If the matter be thin,
the colour is white; if it be meanly
thick, then is the Comet ruddy, after
the colour of our fire; but when the
matter is very thick, it is blew, like the
burning of brimstone. And as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is more or less after this disposition,
so is the Comet of colour more or less
like to these three principal colours:
some yellowish, some duskish, some
greenish, some watchet, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In Fashion are noted three differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for either they seem to be round,
with beams round about, or with a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45121:21"/>
beard hanging downward, or else with
a tayl stretched out sidelong in length.
The first fashion is when the matter is
thickest in the midst, and thin round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the edges; the second is when the
Exhalation is upward thick, and in
length downward also meanly thick;
the third form is like the second, saving
that the tayl hangeth not down but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
aside and is commonly longer then
the beard.</p>
                     <p>The time of their generation is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in Autumn or Harvest: for in the
Spring there is too much moisture,<note place="margin">The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the four quarters.</note> and
too little heat to gather a Comet; in
Summer is too much heat which will
disperse and consume the matter that
it cannot be joined together; as for
Winter, it is clean contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Comet which is hot and dry,
Winter being cold and moyst: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no time so meet as Autumn.</p>
                     <p>Now for so much as many Learned
men have gone about to declare the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Blazing stars,<note place="margin">The signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Comets.</note> we will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
nothing that hath any shadow of

them.</p>

                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45121:21"/>
Such things as are set forth of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening
of Comets are of two sorts:
The first is of natural; The second of
Civil or Politick Effects.</p>
                     <p>They are said to betoken Drought,
Barrenness of the Earth and Pestilence.</p>
                     <p>Drought, because a Comet cannot
be generated without great heat; and
much moysture is consumed in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it.</p>
                     <p>Barrenness, because the fatness of the
Earth is drawn up whereof the Comet
consisteth.</p>
                     <p>Pestilence, for so much as this kinde
of Exhalation corrupteth the Air,
which infecteth the bodies of men and
beasts.</p>
                     <p>The Second sort might well be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,<note place="margin">Aristot.</note>
saving that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
disdaineth not to seek out Causes for
some of them.</p>
                     <p>Generally it is noted of all Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers,
that after the appearing of
Comets most commonly follow great
and notable Calamities. Beside this,
they betoken (say some) Wars, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
Changes of Commonwealths,
and the Death of Princes and Noble
men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45121:22"/>
For what time Comets do shine,
there be many hot and dry Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Ayr, which in dry men
kindle heat whereby they are provoked
to Anger: of Anger commeth braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
of brawling, fighting and war:
of war, victory: of victory, change
of Commonwealths: then also Princes
living more delicately then other men,
are more subject to infection; and
therefore dye sooner then other men. If
it were lawfull to reason of this sort,
we might enduce them to betoken not
only these few things, but all other
things that chance in the world.</p>
                     <p>Yet these predictions have a shew of
Reason: though it be nothing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but it is a wonder to see how the
Astrologians dote in such devices; they
are not ashamed to an earthly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to ascribe an heavenly influence,
and in order of judgment to use them
as very stars. Surely, by as good
reason as to the Celestial stars they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
Divine influences and effects.
But this their folly hath been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
detected by divers godly and
learned men, and this place requireth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45121:22"/>
no long discourse thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this shall suffice, both for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes of Blazing stars, and also
for all Flames in general. It followeth
therefore that with like brevity we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

which are known but only in some
Countries, and them not very large.
These Winds oftentimes have another
manner of generation, and that is on

                     <p>It must needs be confessed,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of winds.</note> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

and strong, in so much that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
both trees and houses, yet in
other Countries not very far distant, no
part of that boysterous blast is felt.
Wherefore this Wind differeth from the
general Winds both in Qualities and
Substance or Matter: for the Matter
of them is an Exhalation, and the
Qualities such as the nature of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation
is, very Airy, but not Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:

kinds of Earthquakes,<note place="margin">Divers kinds of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</note> some making
more and some less, but we shall be
content at this time to comprehend
them in four sorts.</p>
                     <p>The first kind is when the Earth is
shaken laterally, to one side, which is
when the whole force of the wind dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to one place, and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary motion to let it. This
wind, if it be not great, shaketh the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45121:26"/>
Earth, that it trembleth as a man that
hath a fit of an ague, and doth no more
harme: but if it be great and violent,
it looseth the foundations of all buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
be they never so strong, and
overthroweth whole Cities, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the great buildings, and not only
such buildings, but somtimes also ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
down great Hilles, that cover and
overwhelm all the valleys under them.
Many noble and great Cities have been
overthrown by this kind of Earthquake.<note place="margin">Twelve Cities o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown with one Earthquake.</note>
It is written, that twelve of the most
beautifull Cities, and most sumptuous
buildings in all <hi>Asia,</hi> were overthrown
and utterly destroyed with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.
How often <hi>Antiochia,</hi> yea within
short time was destroyed, they which
have read the Histories, can testifie.</p>
                     <p>How terrible was the Earthquake
that shook <hi>Constantinople</hi> a whole year
together,<note place="margin">Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople the chiefest City of Greece, now the Turks Palace.</note> that the Emperour and all
the people, were fain to dwell abroad
in the fields under tents and pavilions,
for fear their houses would fall on their
heads, it is recorded in the Chronicles,
and worthy to be remembered.</p>
                     <p>The second kind is,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind.</note> when the Earth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45121:27"/>
with great violence is lifted up, so that
the buildings are like to fall, and by
and by sinketh down again: this is,
when all the force of the winds striveth
to get upward, after the nature of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
and finding some way to be
delivered out of bondage, the Earth
that was hoysied up, returneth to his
old place.</p>
                     <p>The third kind is a gaping,<note place="margin">The third kind.</note> rending,
or cleaving of the Earth, when the
Earth sinketh down, and swalloweth
up Cities,<note place="margin">Earthquake on the Sea.</note> and Townes, with Castles,
and Towers, Hilles and Rocks, Rivers,
and Floods, so that they be never seen
again.</p>
                     <p>Yea the Sea in some places hath been
drunk up, so that men might have gone
over on foot, untill the time of tide or
flood returning covered the place with
Waters again. But in the land, where
this Earthquake swalloweth up any
City, or Country, there appeareth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the place thereof,<note place="margin">Aristot.</note> but a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
wide and deep gulfe, or hole. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>

The fourth kind,<note place="margin">The fourth kind.</note> is when great
mountaines are cast up out of the Earth,
or else when some part of the land
sinketh down, and in stead thereof arise
Rivers, Lakes, or Fires breaking out
with smoake and Ashes. It causeth also
overflowings of the Sea, when the Sea

                     <p>THe first,<note place="margin">The signes of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> is the raging of the Sea,
when there are no tempestuous
Winds to stirre it, yea, when the Ayr
is most calme without Wind.</p>
                     <p>The caus why the Sea then rageth, is,
that the wind beginneth to labour for
passage that way, and finding none, is
sent back, and soon after shaketh the
land.</p>
                     <p>The second signe is calmness of the
Ayr, and cold, which commeth to pass
by reason that the <hi>Exhalation</hi> that
should be abroad, is within the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The third signe, is said to be a long
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45121:29"/>
thinne strake of cloud seen, when the
skie is clear; after the setting of the
Sun. This (say they) is caused, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that the <hi>Exhalation</hi> or Vapor, which
is the matter of clouds, is gone into
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Others affirm, that it is the <hi>Exhalation</hi>
that breaketh out of some narrow hole
of the Earth, out of which the rest of
the wind cannot issue, neither will it
waite the time: wherefore within a
while after, it seeketh and maketh it
self by sudden eruption a broader way
to be delivered out of prison.</p>
                     <p>Also the Sunne, certaine daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it appeareth dimme, because the
Winds that should have purged and
dissolved the grosse Ayr, that causeth
this dimness to our eyes, is enclosed
within the bowels of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The Water in the bottome of deepe
wells is troubled, and the savour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
infected, because the pestilent <hi>Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
that have been long inclosed
within the Earth, doe then beginne a
little to be sent abroad. For thereof
cometh it, that in many places where
Earthquakes have been, great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45121:29"/>
of smoak, flame, and ashes is cast
out, when the abundance of brimstone
that is under the ground, through vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
motion is set on fire and breaketh
forth. Finally, who knoweth not,
what stinking Minerals and other
poysonous stuff doe grow under the
Earth? wherefore it is no wonder, if
Well-water, before an Earthquake, be
infected: but rather it is to be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
if after an Earthquake there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not a grievous Pestilence, when
the whole mass of infection is blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                     <p>Last of all, there is heard before it

yea, somtimes when there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
no Earthquake at all, when
as the wind, without shaking of the
Earth, findeth a way to passe out at.
And these for the most part, or at least

                     <p>The sound of Thunder is divers;
after which men have divided the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>The smal or little Thunder is when

Lightning which is seen on Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
nights and evenings after a hot
day.<note place="margin">Fulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</note> The generation hereof is such;
when many thin, light and hot Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
by the immoderate heat have
been drawn up from the Earth, and by
the absence of the Sun be destitute of
the force whereby they should have
been drawn further upward; yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ascending by their own nature,
in that they be light and hot, they meet
with the cold either of the night in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45121:33"/>
lowest region, or else of the Air in the
middle region; and so by resistance of
contraries (as it hath been oft before
rehearsed) they are beaten back, and
with vehement moving set on fire. This
Lightning commonly goeth out in the
Air terrible to behold, not hurtfull to
anything, except sometime when the
matter is earthy and gross, being strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
down to the earth, it blasteth corn
and grass with other smal hurt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
it setteth a barn or thatched house
on fire.</p>
                     <p>The Colour of this Lightning as of all
other,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of this Lightning.</note> is divers, partly according to
the matter, and partly according to the
light. If the matter be thin, it is white;
if the substance be gross, it is ruddy,
like flames of fire. In great light as in
the day, it appeareth white; in the
night, ruddy: yet sometime in the day
time we may see it yellow, wich is a
token that the matter is wonderfull
thick and gross. Old Wives are wont
to say that no night in the year except
one, passeth without Lightning, but
that is true as the rest of their Tales,
whereof they have great store.</p>

Lightning itself: which is two manner
of ways: One way, when clouds that

are enflamed, and the reflection of that
flame is cast up into our sight, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all points like Lightning, saving
that the Air where it appeareth, is so
clear, that we are perswaded, no Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
can be there caused. Another
way is, when there be thick clouds over
us, and commonly a double order of
clouds, one above another: if Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or any other Inflammation be in
the upper part of these clouds, the light
of them peirceth thorow the lower
parts as thorow a glass, and so appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as though it Lightned, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it did Lighten indeed, yet that
which we saw, was but the shadow
thereof: and this is often without
Thunder.</p>

although the Lightning appear unto us
a good pretty while before the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap

before the noyse, if any Thunder at all
follow, but either is after it or with
it. Wherefore that we see it before we

though they had been bit by a Serpent.
The cause of this is that the matter of
Lightning is much infected with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
&amp; other poysonous metallike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
because it is thin, and giveth them
passage into every part of the body.</p>

how winevessels of wood being burned

                     <p>The Reason why it killeth the child

appeareth no wound without,<note place="margin">Garments burnt, the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt.</note> neither

Chrystalline humour of their Eyes, so

                     <head>Of Whirlwinds.</head>
                     <p>A Whirlwind, is a Wind break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a Cloud,<note place="margin">Whirlewinds.</note> Rouling
or Winding round about, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
that which standeth neer
it, and that which commeth before
it, carrying it with him aloft in the
Air.</p>
                     <p>It differeth from a Stormy Wind in
three points.</p>
                     <p>First, in the Matter which is less
in Quantity, and of thinner Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the Moving, which
is Circular, Winding about: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Storme bloweth Aslope and
Sidelongs. Also a Whirlwind, in
the Moving divideth not it self abroad
and bloweth Directly, as the Storme
doth.</p>
                     <p>And Thirdly, in the manner of the
generation; for a Storme doth always
come out of one Cloud; but a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
sometime is Caused by means
of two Contrary Winds that meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ether.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:45121:40"/>
In like manner, as we see in the streets
of Cities, where the wind is beaten
back from two walles, meeting in the
middest of the street, there is made a
little whirle-wind, which whisking
round about, taketh up the dust, or
strawes, and bloweth it about, after the
very similitude of the great and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whirlewind.</p>
                     <p>The reason of the going about is this,
that when the walls beat back the wind
from them, which aboundeth in that
place, and those winds when they meet,
by reason of equall force on both sides,
can neither drive one the other back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
nor yet passe thorrow one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
it must needs be, that they must
both seek a way on the side at once, and
consequently be carried round about,
the one as it were pursuing the other,
untill there be space enough in the aire,
that they may be parted asunder.</p>
                     <p>The matter of a whirlewind, is not
much differing from the matter of
storme and lightning, that is, an <hi>Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
hote and drie, breaking out of a

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45121:41"/>
as it hath been said, by two, or more
windes, blowing from divers places,
which may be of particular causes, that
have been shewed before in the Chapter

                     <p>It breaketh Trees, winding them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and pulling them up by the roots.
It turneth about a Ship, and bruiseth it

                     <p>THe Circle called <hi>Halon</hi> is a garland
of divers colours that is seen about

a Crown or Garland.</p>
                     <p>The matter wherein it is made, is a
cloud of equall thickness, or thinnesse,
comming directly under the body of
the Sunne, the Moone, or other Starres,
into which the light of the heavenly
body is received &amp; so appeareth round,
because the Starre is round:<note place="margin">Circles in the water.</note> as a stone
cast into the water, maketh many round
circels, dilating in breadth, untill the
violence of the moving is ended; so is it
in the aire; the light beames peircing
it, cause broad circles to be dilated,
which appeare white,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of circles.</note> purple, black,

matter. The cause of such colours, is
shewed before in the peculiar treaty of
colours.</p>
                     <p>This circle is oftner seene about the
Moone, then about the Sunne, because
the heate of the Sunne draweth the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors</hi>
too high, where it cannot be made.
Also, because the night is a more quiet
time then the day from wind, it is more
often in the night, then in the day.
Seldome, about other Starres, because
their light beames, are too weake often
to pierce a cloud: yet oftner about smal
stars then the Sunne, because the light
of the Sunne pierceth the cloud more
forcibly, than that this <hi>Halon</hi> can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <p>Otherwhiles it is seen about a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,<note place="margin">Circles at bout a candle.</note>
which must be in a very thicke and

that it may receive the light as the

smoaky places, or hot houses.</p>
                     <p>This kinde of circle is sometimes
like a Rainebow, saving that it is a

else the cloud, in which it is seen,<note place="margin">The fignes of these circles.</note> be not

                     <p>THe Rainebow,<note place="margin">Raynebow</note> is the apparition of
certaine colours in a cloud, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
against the Sunne, in fashion of half

Sunnes looking glasse,<note place="margin">Possido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</note> wherein his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was represented, and that the blue
colour was the proper colour of the
cloud; red of the Sunne; all the other
colours of commixtion.</p>
                     <p>It differeth manifoldly from <hi>Halon:</hi>
for the Raynebow is alwayes opposite
against the Sunne: but <hi>Halon</hi> is directly
under it.</p>
                     <p>They differ not onely in place, but
also in fashion: the Raynebow is but
halfe a Circle: the <hi>Halon</hi> is a whole

                     <p>Likewise they vary in colour: for
the Raynebow is more dimme, and of

                        <hi>Halon</hi> is seen about Candles, in smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie
places, as are baths and kitchings.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the generation of the
Rainebow is such: There is opposite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sunne, a thick watery cloud,
which is already resolved into dewy
drops of raine,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> is (for a grosse simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude)
is seene on the potlid, when the
Water in the Vessell hath sodden, or
is very hot, the lid will be all full of
small drops of water, which come from
the water in the Vessell; first, by heat
resolved into smoake; after, when it
cannot goe at large, it is resolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Wherefore upon such a cloud, the
Sunne beams striking, as upon a smooth
glasse, do expresse the image of the Sun
unperfectly, for the great distance.
Or else the Sunne beames striking into
a hollow cloud, where they are refract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or broken, and so come to the eyes of
him that beholdeth the Rainbow.</p>
                     <p>The similitude thereof is seen, when

Lifewise, water in an urinall holden

                     <p>There be two kinds of Rainbows,
one of the Sun,<note place="margin">Rainbow of the Sun.</note> another of the Moon;
the one by day, the other by night: the
Rainebow of the Sun often,<note place="margin">Rainbow of the Moone.</note> but of the
Moon very seldome, in so much that it
can be but twice in fifty yeeres, and that
when the Moon is in the East or West,
full in perfect opposition.</p>
                     <p>It hath not been many times seene
since the writing of Histories, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and for the rarenesse, is taken for
a great wonder. Yet is it in colour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so beautiful as the sunnes, but for
the most part white as milke: other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of colours are scant perceived.
When it appeareth, it is said to signifie
tempest.</p>
                     <p>The time of the Rainbow is often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the point of <hi>Autumne,</hi> both for the
placing of the Sunne in competent low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and also for abundance of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
seldom or never is the Rainebow
see about the midst of Summer.</p>
                     <p>There may be many Rainebows at
one time, yet commonly but one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45121:45"/>
of which the rest are but shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and images; the second shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the first, the third of the second,
as appeares by placing of their colours.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth to shew why it is but
halfe a circle, or lesse, and never more;
and why the whole cloud receiveth
not the same colours that the Rayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
hath. The cause of the first is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the center or middle part of the
Raynebow, that is <hi>Diametrally</hi> opposite
to the center of the same, is alwayes
either in the <hi>Horizon</hi> (that is, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
cutting off our fight of Heaven by
the earth) or under it. The cause why
the whole cloud is not coloured, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in the middest, the beames
as strong, peirce thorow, but on the
edges where they are weaker, they are
reflected or refracted.</p>
                     <p>Now for so much as GOD made the
Raynebow a sign and Sacrament of the
promise, some think it was never seene
before the flood: their reason may be
this, that the earth, after the first creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was then so fruitfull, that it needed
hone or very little Raine, so that such
dark clouds were not often gathered,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45121:45"/>
the fruitfull ground not so easily remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his moysture, that then was fat and
clammy, hard to be drawne up: so it
might be, that there was no Rainebow
before, as we cannot find that ever, it
rained before. But whether it were or
not, it is certaine, that then it became
a Sacrament, whereas it was none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which when we behold, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us to remember the truth of God
in all his promises, to his glory and our
comfort.</p>

                     <p>The Rainebow, the Circles, and these

direct, straight or falling aslope. Also
they differ in place about which they
stand: for streames are onely about the

the Moon, and also about any other of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

they appear diversly, after the fashion

Sunnes should rule the World. But
oftentimes, men have seen, as they
thought in the firmament, not only
two Sunnes, but oftener three Sunnes,
and many more in number thought not
so often appearing. These, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
soever they appear, proceed of
a natural cause, which we will endevour
to expresse. They are nothing else but
Idols or Images of the Sun, represented
in an equall, smooth, and watery cloud
placed on the side of the Sunne, and
somtimes one both sides, into which
the Sunne beams being received, as in
a glasse, expresse the likenesse of fashion
and light that is in the Sunne appearing
as though there were many Sunnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whereas indeed there is but one, and all
the rest are images.</p>
                     <p>This thick and watery cloud, is not
said to be under the Sunne; for then it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45121:50"/>
would make the Circles, called crowns
or garlands: it is not opposite to the
Sunne, for then would it make the
Rainbow: but it is said to be on the
side where the image may be best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.
Also it may not be too far
off, for then the beams will be too feeble
to be reflected: neither yet too neer;
for if it so be, the Sunne will disperse
it: but in a competent and middle
distance: for so representation of many
Sunnes is caused.</p>
                     <p>They are most often seene in the
morning and evening, about the rising
or going down of the Sunne, seldome
at noone time, or about the midst of
the day, because the heat will soone
dissolve them: yet have there been some
seen, which began in the morning, and
continnued all the day long, unto the
evening.<note place="margin">Many sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

little Suns, like unto little starres, which
are caused after the same sort as we do

the cloud hath many separations, there
appeare many Sunnes, on one, side of

of them in the Clouds. Again,
the Garlands are direct under, and
therefore apter to receive such Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>It may be again Objected that the
Stars have their Image perfectly and
sufficiently expressed in glasses here on
the Earth;<note place="margin">Objection.</note> yea and at the day-time,
when their light is either none, or most
feeble and weak: as we see it is used at
Midsummer to behold that great star
called <hi>Syrius</hi> in a glass even at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.<note place="margin">Syrius a great Star seen at noone in Summer.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also we see every night the image of
the Stars in calm and quiet standing
waters: then what should let but that
their images might also be expressed in
watry Clouds?</p>
                     <p>Hereto may be answered that the Let
is in the Cloud,<note place="margin">An answer.</note> which is neither so
hard as is the glass, nor yet so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
as is the water, but consisteth of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45121:52"/>
innumerable smal drops: so that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the light of the stars were stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
it can in them express no uniform
images of them, as it doth in glasses and
in the water. Notwithstanding, in
Writers of Wonders we read some
such likething sometime to have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                     <p>There hath been often seen many
Suns in the day-time and after the Sun
setting: at the rising of the full Moon
there have appeared many Moons,
which was by this means, that the same
Cloud that received the Sun-beams in
the morning, tarried in the same place,
and at the Moons rising was ready also
to receive her image.</p>

                     <head>Of Wonderfull Apparitions.</head>
                     <p>WE will close this Book with a
brief declaration of the natural
Causes of many things that are seen in
the Air,<note place="margin">Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions.</note> very wonderfull and strange to
behold, which in these latter Years
have been often seen and beheld to the
great admiration of all men, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the singular providence of God, to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45121:52"/>
forewarne us of many dangers that
hang over us in these most Perillous
Times.</p>
                     <p>The apparitions of which, as it is
most wonderfull, so the searching of
the Cause to us is most difficult: a great
deal the rather, because no man hath
hitherto enterprised (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
to seek out any cause of them,
but all men have taken them as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
miracles, without any natural
meane or cause to procure them.</p>
                     <p>And I truly do acknowledge that
they are sent of God as wonderfull signs
to declare his Power, and move us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of life; indeed miraculous,
but not yet so that they want a natural
cause; for if they be well weighed and
considered, it is not hard to find that
they differ much from such Miracles as
are recorded in the Scripture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of Divines. So that as I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
the Opinion of <hi>Epicurus</hi> to think
that such things come by Chance, but
rather by the determined purpose of
Gods providence: so I consent not
with them that suppose when any
thing is derived from any natural caus,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45121:53"/>
God the chief and best Cause of all
things is excluded.</p>
                     <p>Some of these Wonderfull Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
consist of Circles and Rainbowes
of divers fashions and placings, as one
within another, the edge of one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another, one dividing or going
thorow another, with like placing of
small Circles about great Circles or
parts of small Circles, some with the
ends upward, some downward; some
aside, and some across; but all for the
most part in uniform order constituted
or placed for the order of them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to behold, but for the strangness
somwhat fearfull. Such a like Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made with the Suns or Moons
images joined unto these Circles set al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in good and uniform order.</p>
                     <p>The cause of all these is the meeting
together of all those several Causes
that make the Circles, Rainbowes,
Streames and Images of the Sun or
Moon, which joined all together, make
the wonderfull sight of Rainbowes,
positions of Circles,<note place="margin">Optice. Catoptrice</note> Crosses and divers
Lights which pertain to the knowledg
of <hi>Optice</hi> and <hi>Catoptrice</hi> that teach
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45121:53"/>
how by divers refractions and reflects,
ons of beams such visions are caused.
So that he which will know how they
are generated, must return into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Treatises of Rainbowes, Circles,
Streams &amp; Images of the Sun or Moons
and if in them he find not knowledg
sufficient to instruct him, I must send
him to the Demonstrations of Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
where he shall want nothing.</p>
                     <p>Another sort of them, no less often
beheld within these few years then the
former, but a great deal more strange
and wonderfull to look upon, are the
Sights of Armies fighting in the Air,
of Castles, Cities and Towns, with
whole Countries, having in them Hils,
Vallies, Rivers, Woods, also Beasts,
Men and Fouls, Monsters of which
there are no such kindes on the Earth,
and finally all manner of things and
actions that are on the Earth, as Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
Processions, Judgments, Combates,
Men, Women, Children, Horses,
Crowns, Armes of certain Noble men
and Countries, Weapons of all sorts,
somtimes Stars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Angels as they are
painted with the Image of Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45121:54"/>
beseiging of Castles and Townes,
many things and gestures done by men
or beasts, thevery Similitude of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
known to the Beholders; as of
late was seen the very Image of the
Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> insomuch that they
which beheld it, put off their Caps,
thinking verily it had been he: and of
<hi>John Frederick</hi> Prince Elector of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who that time was Prisoner with
the Emperour: Also the Image of smal
Crosses, which hath been not only in
the Air, but also on the Earth, on mens
apparell, on dishes, platters, pots, and
all other things, so that the Jewes have
been full angry that they could neither
wash nor rub them out of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.
In <hi>Germany</hi> also Fires and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such things as it were long stories
seen in the Air.</p>
                     <p>All these wonderfull Apparitions
may be caused two manner of ways;
the one Artificially, the other Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                     <p>Artificially, by certain glasses and
Instruments made according to a secret
part of that knowledg which is called
<hi>Catoptrice;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Catoptri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> and so peradventure some
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45121:54"/>
of them have been caused; but</p>
                     <p>The most part (doubtless) Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
when the disposition of the Air
hath been such, that it hath received
the image of many things placed and
done on Earth.</p>
                     <p>And because it is apt to receive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
images, as well in one place as in
another, these monstrous forms and
strange actions or stories proceed of the
joining of divers forms and actions: as
if two Histories were confusedly paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one, the whole Picture would be
strange: or (as the Poet saith) if a
Painter,<note place="margin">Horarius.</note> to a mans head, should sett a
horses neck, and after, divers feathers.
Sometimes also one image is multiplyed
in the Air into many or infinite, as are
letters and crosses which fill the Air, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
beneath: And the light of the Sun
received into little parts, maketh to
appear as it were many smal stars.</p>
                     <p>Let this suffice concerning these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Apparitions: once again admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Reader, though I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised
to declare these by natural
Reason, yet verily believing that not
so much as one Sparrow falleth to the

                     <head>Of Clouds.</head>
                     <p>A Cloud is a Vapor cold and moist,
drawn out of the Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by the heat of the Sun into the
middle region of the Air;<note place="margin">Clouds.</note> where by
cold it is so knit together, that it hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
untill either the weight or some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
causeth it to fall down.</p>
                     <p>The place wherein the Clouds do
hang, is said to be in the middle region
of the Air, because men see it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that there should be a cold
which should make those Vapors so
gross and thick, which for the most
part are drawn so thin from the
Earth, that they are invisible as the
Air is.</p>
                     <p>And although they are known often
times, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth,<note place="margin">Astristor.</note> to be
in the lowest region of the Air, neer to
the Earth, insomuch that sometimes
they fall down to the Earth with great
noise, to the great fear of men, and no
less loss and danger: yet may it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
thought that these Clouds
were generated in the middle region of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45121:56"/>
the Air far distant from the Earth,
which by their heaviness do by little
and little sink down lower into the
lowest region, and sometimes also fall
down to the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The Common Opinion is,<note place="margin">The height of the Clouds.</note> that they
goe not higher then nine mile; which
because it leaneth to no reason, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> whose reason also
is to be doubted of,<note place="margin">Albertus Magnus.</note> affirmeth that the
Clouds do scarce exceed Three miles
in height when they are highest.</p>
                     <p>And some let not to say that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they ascend not past the half of
One mile in height.</p>
                     <p>Again, Others pretending to finde
out the truth by Geometrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
make it aboue Fifty
mile to the place where the generation
of Clouds is.</p>
                     <p>How these men take the distance
from the Earth, it is uncertain: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that they assigne the least distance
and meane it from the highest parts of
the Earth as are hill tops, or from the
common playn.</p>
                     <p>Again, whether they that assign the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45121:56"/>
highest distance to be from the lowest
valleys of the Earth, or from the hill
tops.</p>
                     <p>The Reason before shewed, moveth
me to think that the most usual and
common generation, I mean the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation
or making thick of these
thin Vapors into Clouds, is in the
middle region of the Air: but for the
distance of the Clouds when they be
generated, I think they be sometime
Nine mile, sometime Three mile,
sometime Half a mile, and sometime
less then a Quarter of a mile from the
Earth.</p>

                     <p>THere be certain Cloudes that are
empty,<note place="margin">Empty oleuds.</note> and send no Rain; they
come of two sorts.</p>
                     <p>One sort are the Remnants of a
Cloud that hath rained, which cannot
be converted into water for their dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>Another sort is of them that are
drawn up out of wett and dry places,
and be rather Exhalations then Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors;
that is, they be dry, hot and
light, so that it were hard for them to
be turned into Rain: they look white
like flocks of wooll, when the light
striketh into them.</p>
                     <p>There be also empty Clouds, which
when the Winds have dispersed abroad
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45121:57"/>
any Cloud, are scattered over all the
sky: but these Clouds though for a
time they be empty, yet because they
consist of such a substance as is watry,
they may be, and are oftentimes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, and give plentifull
Rain.</p>
                     <p>Of the Colours of Clouds we have
spoken in the Second Book of Fiery
Meteors,<note place="margin">Of the colours of Clouds.</note> where those Colours and the
causes of them are described, which
seem to be Fiery, or may be thought to
be Inflammations or burnings, as to
be Red, Fiery and Yellowish.</p>
                     <p>But besides those there be White,
Black, Blew and Green.</p>
                     <p>White clouds be thin, and not very
Watry: so that the light received in
them, maketh them to appear White.</p>
                     <p>Black clouds be full of thick, gross
and earthly matter that makes them
look so dark.</p>
                     <p>Blew clouds be full of thick drose
and earthly, as the Black: so the light
received in them, maketh them to seem
Blew.</p>
                     <p>Green clouds are altogether watry,
resolved into water, which receiving
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45121:58"/>
into them the night, appear Green as

well knowne,<note place="margin">Raine.</note> it shall not be hard

commeth.</p>
                     <p>For after the matter of the cloud
being drawne up, and by cold made
thick (as is said before) heat following,
which is most commonly of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne

Water, and so it falleth in drops, to
give increase of fruit to the Earth, and
move men to give thankes to God.</p>
                     <p>There be small showers of small
drops, aud there be great stormes of
great drops.</p>
                     <p>The showres with small drops, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
either of the small heat that resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45121:58"/>
doe come of great heat, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or melting the cloud, or else of
small distance from the Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we see a plaine experiment, when
Water is powred forth from an high
place the drops are smal, but if it be not
from high, it will either have no
droppes, or very great.</p>
                     <p>The caus why raine falleth in round
drops, is both for that the parts desire
the same forme that the whole hath,
which is round, and also that so it is
best preserved against all contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
like as we see Water powred upon
dry or greasy things to gather it selfe
into roundels, to avoid the contrariety
of heat and drynesse.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be omitted,<note place="margin">Why rain water is not salt.</note> that raine
Water, although a great part of it be
drawne out of the Sea, yet most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
it is sweet not salt.</p>
                     <p>The caus is, becaus it is drawn up in

consumed by the heat of the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>The raine water doutlesse doth more

raine Water retaineth much of the

that commeth from Heaven, in raine,
will sooner come to putrifaction, or
stinking, then any other, becaus it

                     <p>HOare frost,<note place="margin">Hoare frost.</note> or white frost, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but dew congealed by
overmuch cold. The South and East
wind do cause dew, but the North and
Northern winds do freeze the Vapors,
and so it becommeth hoar frost; which
if that excessive cold had not beene,
should have turned into dew.</p>
                     <p>The dew and the hoare frost agree in
three things, namely, in matter, in
quality of time, and place of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
In matter they agree; for they
are both generated of a subtill and thin
Vapor, and also small in quantity.</p>
                     <p>In quality of time they consent, for
both are made in a quiet and calm time:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45121:64"/>
for if there were great wind, it would
drive away the matter, and so could
there be no generation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they are both generated in
the lowest Region of the Air; for (as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth)<note place="margin">Aristot.</note> upon the high hills
there is neither dew nor hoar frost.</p>
                     <p>They differ also in three things. For
the hoare frost is congealed before it be
turned into water; so is not the dew.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The dew is generated in
temperate weather, the white frost in
cold weather.</p>
                     <p>Last of all, hot Winds, as the South
and East, do cause dew; but cold winds
as the North and West, do cause hoare
frost,</p>
                     <p>Hoare frost doth often stinke, because
of the stinking matter whereof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,

which falling down to the sudden cold
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45121:64"/>

into Ice.</p>
                     <p>There be so many kinds of Haile, as
there be of raine: The fashion of haile
is sometime round, which is a token
that it was generated in the middle regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

from high, the corners are worn away.</p>
                     <p>When the Haile stones are square, or
three-cornered, the haile was genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <p>Oftentimes there is heard a great
sound in the Cloud as it were of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before haile, or of an Army fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. The cause is, That Vapors of
contrary qualities, being inclosed in
the Cloud, do strive to break out, and
make a noyse, even as cold water doth,
being put into a seething pot.</p>
                     <p>In Spring and Harvest-time is often
haile, seldome in Summer and Winter.
In winter there want hot Vapors, in
Summer the lowest region is too hot to
congeale the raine falling down. In
Spring and Autumne, there want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hot Vapors to resist the cold, nor
sufficient cold to harden the drops of

The haile stones are sometimes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and sometimes lesser; greater, with

                     <p>There is seldom haile in the night, for

                     <p>Sometime haile and rain fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                     <head>Of Earths.</head>
                     <p>THe Earth is an element, one of the
four, cold and dry,<note place="margin">Of Earths.</note> most gross and
solid, most heavy and weighty, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all other in place. When I say an
Element, I meane a simple body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded.
This Earth is no Meteor,
but as it was shewed in the water, to
the end there should be generation of
things. There is no Element that we
have which is pure and simple, but all
are mixed and compound. Our fire is
grosse and compound, so is our aire,
our water, and our earth: but the earth
notably and above the rest, is mixed.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45121:73"/>
For the pure and naturall Earth is dry
and cold; but we see much to be moist,
and much to be hot. The natural earth
is black of colour: but we see many
Earths white, many yellow, and many
red. So that first, the greatest part of
the Earth is mixed with water, that
maketh it to cleave together, with aire
and some fire, which make an oylie, fat
or clammy earth, as is clay made, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another great part is dried, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the naturall drinesse of the first qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but as a thing once mixed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dryed, either by cold, as sand,
gravell, &amp;c. or else by heat, as chalke,
oaker, &amp;c. And yet somewhat more
plainly and particularly to discourse
upon these causes, admitting the natural
colour of the Earth to be black, of the
water to be blue, of the aire to be
white, and of the fire to be ruddy, it
followeth, that upon the mixtion of
these colours, or chiefe domination of
them, all things have their colour.</p>
                     <p>The grosse substance of the Earth
therefore being diversly mixed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Elements, and those mixtures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
being eftsoones altered by divers
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45121:74"/>
and sometime contrary qualities, hath
brought forth so many kinds of earth,
as clay, marble, chalke, sand, gravell,
&amp;c. Clay is mixed with fat moysture,
taking his Colour of the mixture with
red from white; but being cold, it is
not so fruitful as Marble, which is not
alwaies so moist as it. Chalke is an
Earth by heat concocted, after divers
mixtions, and dried up. Oker, both yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and red, with such like, are of the
same nature, with mixtion of red, more
or lesse.</p>
                     <p>Sand and gravell, are dryed Earths,
as it were frozen by cold: gravell is
grosse and apparent; sand, though it
be finer, is of the same generation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of many small bodies, which are
congealed into stones. Sand seemeth
to be clay dryed by cold, and clotted
together into small stones; whereof
some are thorow-shining, which were
the moist parts; the thick were of the
grosse part: the same is gravell, but of
greater stones consisting. The like judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be given of all other kinds
of Earth, whose generation by the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of these will not be very hard
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45121:74"/>

Vapors as Brimstone is, but then they
be diversly mixed: as the coles have
much Earth mixed with Brimstone;
Jet seemeth to be all one but better
concocted then coles. Of Amber is great
contention, whether it be a minerall,
or the sperme of a Whale: for it is
found in the Sea, cast upon the shore.
Now the Whales seed being of the very
same qualities, is taken more and lesse
concrete of divers hardness; some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as hard as Amber: some softer,
and some liquid: yet <hi>Cardan</hi> plainly
defineth, that Amber is a Mineral. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he have reason or experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the vulgar opinion, let them
consider that list to contend. These
Minerals that will resolve with fire, it
is apparent, that they were concrete
with cold: in that they burnt, it is
manifest, they have a fat and clammy
substance mixed with them, as the other
kind hath not, which will not resolve
so well with fire as with Water; which
be salt, copperas, saltpeeters, &amp;c. These
burne not, being watery, Earthy, and
not fat, unctuous, nor clammy.</p>

Earthy substance mixed with their
sulphurous matter. Some be sheere, as
Salt, and Allome, having a substance
Watery dryed, and concrete. Copperas
is greene, because it hath much cold
matter that is blue, mixed with it.
Salt, the most common and necessary
of all these liquors concrete, that be
moist and not fatty, hath two manner
of generations; one natural, and the
other artificial. The natural genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is when it is first generated in

of the vertue of stones.</p>
                     <p>That vertue that is ascribed unto

which because it is more curious

                     <p>As for Magical Vertues, they be they
which are grounded on no reason, or
natural cause; which if they take effect,
it is rather of the superstition and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
of him that useth them, then of
the vertue of the stones. As that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald

                     <p>To conclude with the cause why
Stones melt not, as Metalls do, may be
gathered by that which hath been said
before, because they are congealed past

left in them no unctuous or clammy

                  <p>GOld is found in divers manners,
to wit, mixt with Sand as in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia:</hi>
on the shore-side amongst the

as in <hi>Calecut,</hi> and in the Indies.</p>
                  <p>The Generation of Gold is usually
on the tops of Mountaines, because
that there in the highest places the Sun
doth more easily purifie that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
too much earthiness in it: and
when the Raine and Torrents do flow
downe, they carry the Gold downe
with them to the foot thereof, where
it is gathered amongst the sand, or
else in waters neer thereunto, whether
it is driven by the violence of floods,
except the Ground perhaps open with
those inundations, and the Gold fall
into the gaping jaws of the Earth, and
so stick there. Now it is observable,
that that which is found in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Mine, is not the purest, but
is as an earnest to invite to farther la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45121:88"/>
and pains. That which is found in
Waters and Rivers is fished for, and is
in form of little Grains: In Rocks and
Mountains it is taken out by delving
and digging. And there be three sorts
of Mines, some are called Pendent, some
Jacent, and some Oblique and turning:
Pendent are those which are found in
the superficies and tops of Mountains:
Jacent are low, and lie in plain fields:
Oblique have a cross Course, whether
it be to that which is Pendent, or Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
all whereof is driven by Rivers

                  <p>THe most noble amongst Metalls
next to Gold, is Silver; for though
Copper in colour, and Lead in waight
do nearest approach unto Gold; yet in
Tenuity of substance, in pureness and
fastnesse, Silver is so like unto it, that
good silver may be rightly said to be
imperfect Gold in substance; sailing in
colour, and that by succession of time,
it is sometimes changed into Gold, as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45121:88"/>
in many years space Lead turneth into
Silver. The Mines of Silver are more
ordinary then Mines of Gold; and it is
usually engendred in four manners, to
wit, either in the Earth, or in Brass, or
in Lead, or in Stones, which being
purged and melted, yeeld some quantity
of Silver. In the Mountain called
<hi>Mons Regius,</hi> stones retain very much
Silver, which being put in the fire, there
is found in every pound of silver that
runneth out of them, half an ounce of
Gold at least.</p>
                  <p>Silver is many times found to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Copper, as in <hi>Alsaria,</hi> near to
the <hi>Rhine</hi> in the Mountains of <hi>S. Anne,</hi>
and in <hi>Messein.</hi> When Silver is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>MAny Authors, Philosophers, and
Chymists, disagree in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and discourse of Amber; some
reckon Amber amongst plyable and
hard metalline substances; others will
not acknowledge it but to be but the
gum of a Tree producing Rosin which
is common in <hi>Arabia.</hi>

                     <hi>Philemon</hi> writeth, that in two places
of <hi>Scythia,</hi> Amber is digged out of the
ground like a kind of stone, and in one
place it is white, and in another it is
yellow; to omit this Argument, and to
agree with those who allow Amber to
be a Metall, is most consonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
The nature and property of it
is a mean betwixt Gold and Silver, and
such is the true and naturall Amber:
as for that which is used for Beads, it is
but artificiall.</p>
                  <p>Amber partaketh more of Gold then
Silver, because it is more pure, &amp; more
apt to be wrought; for if it consist more
of Silver, it could not endure the forge
and hammer.</p>
                  <p>Vessels are made of Amber, some for
beautie, some for profit: and if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of true and good Amber, they
will discover poysons by cracking, and
making signs of an Arch within: for
when the rare humidity thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be consumed by the force of
venome, it cracketh, and the colour
changing in the Vessel, it seemeth in
stead of the great splendor thereof,
there doth a kind of stain represent it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45121:90"/>
selfe like unto an Arch. Now that this
Metall is more rare, is ignorance that
knoweth not the vertue; or avarice,
that greedily thirsteth after Gold and
gaine.</p>
