            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>HOw! The Great <hi>CARE</hi> Deceas'd! And not one Verſe</l>
               <l>Dropt by ſome Muſe on his <hi>Lamented Hearſe!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>It cannot be: All muſt his Praiſes tell,</l>
               <l>That did both <hi>Write,</hi> and <hi>Live,</hi> and <hi>Die</hi> ſo well.</l>
               <l>That maugre <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> durſt be good,</l>
               <l>And in moſt <hi>Crooked Times,</hi> moſt <hi>Upright ſtood:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whom all the <hi>Tory's</hi> Curſes could not draw</l>
               <l>From an Adherance unto what he ſaw</l>
               <l>Would the <hi>True Intereſt</hi> of his Countrey be,</l>
               <l>Which is, <hi>A well-Eſtabliſhed Liberty</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In Things Religious;</hi> that none may have Pow'r</l>
               <l>His Neighbour for his Conſcience to Devour.</l>
               <l>For when of late, the <hi>Church-men</hi> with high hand,</l>
               <l>Did perſecute <hi>Diſſenters</hi> through the Land,</l>
               <l>And on pretence of their <hi>Lowd Penal Laws,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Made them a Prey to the Devouring Jaws</l>
               <l>Of Villanous Informers, who were then</l>
               <l>The <hi>Kings beſt Subjects</hi> ſtil'd, by thoſe Hot Men:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>CARE</hi> Saw, and Griev'd to ſee what work they made:</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Divert them</hi> by his <hi>Pen</hi> Eſſay'd:</l>
               <l>And did to <hi>Peaceful Counſels</hi> them incline,</l>
               <l>(But this, Alas! was Croſs to their <hi>Deſign;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which was for the <hi>Diſſenters Ruine</hi> laid,</l>
               <l>From which no Arguments could them perſwade)</l>
               <l>For his <hi>Diſcerning Soul</hi> did then fore-ſee</l>
               <l>Thoſe <hi>Violences</hi> ſoon would fatal be</l>
               <l>Unto <hi>Themſelves,</hi> and Gall and Wormwood bring,</l>
               <l>When once they were conſider'd by the King:</l>
               <l>This He Remonſtrated; but all in vain:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Diſſenters</hi> then no <hi>Favour</hi> could obtain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when Great <hi>JAMES</hi> into his Royal thought</l>
               <l>The Sufferings of Diſſenting Subjects brought;</l>
               <l>And to the great Rejoycing of the Nation</l>
               <l>Did Publiſh <hi>His moſt Gracious Declaration</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and ſet free</l>
               <l>Diſſenters from the Church-mens Tyranny:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>CARE</hi> did in <hi>Heroiek Numbers</hi> ſing</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Praiſes</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Thanks</hi> unto the <hi>King:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This was the Joyful <hi>Epocha!</hi> From hence</l>
               <l>He ſaw <hi>Great Britains</hi> Glory would commence:</l>
               <l>'Twas this he ſaw that would the Kingdom Crown</l>
               <l>With <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Honour, Riches</hi> and <hi>Renown.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And therefore when the Nations <hi>Reſtleſs Foes</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So great a Bleſſing did <hi>in Print</hi> oppoſe,</l>
               <l>He thought himſelf obliged to declare</l>
               <l>How <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Groundleſs</hi> their <hi>Pretences</hi> were:</l>
               <l>And that ſuch might have <hi>nothing left to ſay,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He alſo Publiſh'd his <hi>DRACONICA.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And always, as Occaſion did him Urge,</l>
               <l>He unto <hi>Perſecutors</hi> prov'd a <hi>Scourge:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This he himſelf affirm'd to be <hi>his Station:</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But O! ſo great a Bleſſing to the Nation</l>
               <l>Is ſnatch'd from hence, even in his prime of Years,</l>
               <l>And left all Good men for his Loſs in Tears:</l>
               <l>His Loſs indeed is National we ſee,</l>
               <l>And as <hi>his Loſs</hi> is, ſhould <hi>Our Mourning be:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Well may we drein whole Rivers from our Eyes,</l>
               <l>For we his <hi>Matchleſs Worth</hi> could never prize!</l>
               <l>But <hi>Tears</hi> alas cann't bring him <hi>back;</hi> His <hi>Gain</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Does prove our <hi>Loſs;</hi> and we now Sigh in vain,</l>
               <l>And tho Vile men have oft <hi>Reproach'd him</hi> here,</l>
               <l>He did not <hi>them</hi> nor their <hi>Reproaches</hi> fear:</l>
               <l>Nor did their Threats their hop'd-for iſſue find:</l>
               <l>He did his <hi>Duty,</hi> not his <hi>Danger</hi> mind.</l>
               <l>And maugre all their <hi>Scoffs</hi> that him deride,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> he <hi>Liv'd,</hi> and ſuch he <hi>Dy'd.</hi>
