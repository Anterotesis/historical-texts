            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But to anſwer more particularly to each part of this objection. That many have charged both this Rebellion and all the blood that hath been ſpilt in the purſuance thereof upon the King and thoſe faithfull ſubjects of his, that adhered to him, is too well known; and tis pretty well known, that this way of ſhifting off ſinne from themſelves to others, is of all the many other wayes, the moſt impudent and deteſtable. I hat others perſwaded them, tempted them, incited them, ſcared them, or forced them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch and ſuch ſins, have been frequent excuſes that we read of in ſeverall facred and other ſtories: but this ſhifting off ſin whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from themſelves, when they know themſelves fouly guilty, and charging it upon others, whom they known to be, in that reſpect, moſt innocent, is never practiſed but by men of brazen faces, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantine foreheads, black tongues, and blacker hearts: And, if God will bee a <hi>ſwift witneſſe</hi> againſt any, then ſurely againſt ſuch as doe not onely bear <hi>falſe witneſſe</hi> againſt, but <hi>condemn</hi> the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: <note place="margin">Mala. 35.</note> and if he will <hi>plead the cauſe</hi> of any <hi>or execute judgement for them,</hi> ſo as to being them forth to the light, that they may behold <note place="margin">Micah. 7. v. 9.</note> his righteouſneſſe, and others theirs; then without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he will doe it for them, that are ſo palpably and unjuſtly ſlandered and accuſed, and have ſo juſt and cleare cauſe of appealing to his Juſtice for it But why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tay I ſo long upon a recrimination, ſo fooliſh and ridiculous as well as falſe and odious! I dare appeale to the Conſciences of them themſelves, that have ſo charged it (as cauteriſed as they are) for the unjuſtneſſe of the charge, If the Rebellion and Blood guiltineſſe of this Nation (I joyn them together; becauſe they, that are guilty of the Rebellion, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all further diſpute guilty of all the blood that hath been ſhed in it) can be charged upon the King and his loyall Subjects; why have not the other party all this while put it upon that iſſue, and when they had the King (as to our unſpeakable griefe they have) and the moſt of his loyall Subjects in their power; why did they not legally charge them therewith, and urge the Lawes, and indite them, (I mean the Subjects, though they bluſh not to talke of inditing the King himſelfe) by thoſe laws, and ſo proceed to tryall againſt them according to the laws of the Land, the true and onely rules, whereby Rebellion and Murther is to be tryed and judged here in this Nation! Was it their mercy? Why then have they waved that way of trying and judging thoſe particular Perſons of the Kings party, upon whom they have exerciſed their power to the height of cruelty, and proceeded againſt them onely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59779:6"/>
Votes and Ordinances, or by illegall Judges and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Juries, and other unheard of proces! Or to bring the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer yet cloſer; If the Rebellion and Blood guiltineſſe of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to be charged upon the King and his loyall Subjects: why doe they of the other part, that have ſhewn ſo much mercy to them, deſpair of all ſecurity, or at leaſt, diſtruſt all the ſecurity that can be given them, againſt the known eſtabliſhed Laws of this Kingdome! What need they any act of Indemnity, or Oblivion? What need they any Pardon from the King, or any ſecurity againſt him or his party? Let the King live, and the Law run in her courſe, might be their wiſh rather then any's. But alas, their Conſciences tell them, That if the King and his party ſhould return to their own juſt power and rights again, and the Laws of this Kingdome to their due force and vigor, and they ſhould be no more mercifull to them then they have been juſt to them, or then the Laws are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to their courſes; they and theirs would indeed, as they ſay, be but in a miſerable condition. But whereas they from thence reſolve; That therfore ſurely 'tis their beſt courſe to ſtand ſtill upon their juſtification, and to go on to the laſt, as hitherto they have done, That is but a deceitfull as well as an impious reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Impious it is, and that ſo hideouſly impious, that I will ſpend no more breath in declaring the impiety of it, then by telling you, that this is deſpaire worſe then <hi>Caines;</hi> for when he had ſlain his brother, and God had cold him of the cry of his brothers blood, <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> and what paniſhment he muſt ſuffer for it, he did not reſolve to go on in his ſhedding more bloods; but the guilt of that blood, which he had ſhed, did ſo torment him, that he was afraid <hi>that every one that ſhould find him, would ſhed his blood:</hi> and therefore I know not with what deſperate wicked reſolution to match this; unleſſe it be with that of Judahs, (before mentioned though in other words and from another text) when they returned this anſwer to the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.

And therefore, if any of you ſhould come into their power, and they ſhould exerciſe that power upon you to their utmoſt of fury and vengeance; they could not deale ſo ill with you, as you have done with them, except they ſhould act over your owne Tragicall practiſes upon your ſelves; and yet ſtill they would come farre ſhort of you, becauſe they ſhould doe, what they ſo did, but by way of recompence where tis firſt deſerved, and they thereunto deeply provoked, whereas you did it only in pure malice without any deſert or provocation at all, more then what your owne falſe feares and jealouſies fained and fancied. And if they ſhould match your crueltie as farre as they were able, and reward you according to your wayes and according to your doings, which is Gods uſual way of dealing with men, when no other way will doe good on them; As it would be moſt juſt with God, ſo the moſt of men would be ready to juſtifie them in it; and ſo ſhould I, if theſe two cautions or conditions were truly obſerved; 1.

That the Church of England in its Reformed eſtabliſhed Religion was not onely a defence and refuge, but the glory and honour of all the Reformed Churches in Chriſtendome cannot juſtly (and therefore I hope will not) be denyed by any of thoſe Churches: if it ſhould, wee are able to evince it out of the mouths of their own moſt learned and eminent Preachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. And had not thoſe unhappy di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This the <hi>Tobiahs</hi> and <hi>Sanballets</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have known and maligned ſo long, that their attempts againſt this Church and the eſtabliſhed Religion thereof have been more, and more induſtriouſly and eagerly proſecuted, then againſt any Church whatſoever: though they have not omitted any opportunitie of practiſing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted deſignes upon any of the Reformed Churches or the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. And having tryed all the other wayes and courſes that they could invent, and ſome of them ſuch as, I hope, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten of this Nation. Some few yeares before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Parliament, Cardinall <hi>Richeleiu,</hi> the Politique favourite of <hi>France,</hi> and gracious ſonne of <hi>Rome,</hi> uſed all his art and skill to kindle a fire againſt us in <hi>Scotland:</hi> which art and skill of his proſpered too much there by the unskilfulnes and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſome of our managers of Church affairs here in <hi>England.</hi> No ſooner was that fire kindled, but Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

About the ſame time there were not a few of thoſe Incendiaries diſpatcht hither into <hi>England,</hi> to practiſe upon thoſe of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that were diſaffected to the eſtabliſhed Government of this Church, or that diſtaſted ſome new rites and practiſes, too much favoured and countenanced by ſome of the Governours thereof: and ſo far had they within a ſhort time crept into the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59779:10"/>
favours and Counſels of ſome leading men of each ſort, that this Church and State began to be much diſtempered; Inſomuch that our moſt Gracious and Religious Soveraign, next under Chriſt the prime defender of our Faith, and nurſing Father of our Church and Common-weale (whom they had many other wayes aſſaulted but found impregnable) was perſwaded, for the peace and ſafety of both his Kingdoms, to call a Parliament, and within a while after, for the peace and ſecurity of all his three Kingdomes, (the third being alſo then inflamed) to derive unto them greater liberty of continuance, but otherwiſe not of any power, then ever Parliament had; and, as we finde by ſad and wofull experience, then they had grace to make good uſe of. The Jeſuites and Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted party finding this advantage, and feeling by the Pulſe of the chief of the diſaffected and diſcontented part of that great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, how their hearts ſtood inclined; they applyed themſelves to them in all wayes and ſervices poſſible: One Jeſuite, (well known to the moſt reverend and Religious the Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> his Grace) was a conſtant Tabler and Counſellor to the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> an active, furious driver on of the mad factious peoples deſperate turbulanc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe worthy members of the honourable Houſes of Lords and Commons, that held firm to their duty and allegiance, were forced from the tions; ſo bold were thoſe Romaniſts grown, that an honourable member of the Houſe of Commons was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly importuned by one of them, an acquaintance of his, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a Pettion to the Houſe in behalf of the Romiſh party, for the taking off all penall laws from them; which he refuſing to doe, and expoſtulating with the Gentleman about it, as ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he came to intrap him, and to render him more diſtaſtfull to the factious party, and ſo more diſſerviceable to his King and Country; the Gentleman replyed, that he was very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59779:11"/>
framed; and thereupon it was for that time waved and laid aſide. Since that how far the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Jeſuited</hi> party have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and ſucceeded in their proſecuting of that deſigne of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, is ſufficiently viſible in the fruits thereof to every ſeeing eye; But becauſe the greater part of men will neither ſee nor heare, or, if they doe, dare not ſpeak what they ſee or heare, how prejudiciall or deſtructive ſoever it be to Religion or ought elſe that good is; I ſhall in the cauſe of Religion adventure a little further in the diſcovery of the deſignes of thoſe profeſſed enemies thereof. I have been aſſured by a perſon of Honour, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>France,</hi> had towards the beginning of theſe unnaturall and unchriſtian wars, reſolved upon a Declaration againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Subjects of <hi>England</hi> their taking up of Arms againſt their King, and had publiſhed it, had not the forenamed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall daſhed it, and underhand wrought them to too much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof; rendering by that one ſubtill act of his, the ſaid Proteſtants odious to their own Soveraign for approving ſuch Antiregal, Antimonarchicall attempts, and alſo advancing thereby his own deſigne of fomenting our deſtructive diviſions. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn neerer home: Who, but the Jeſuites and Jeſuited Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that Rebellion in <hi>Ireland?</hi> And who but their favourors here in <hi>England</hi> drove it on to that height, by making thoſe Rebels deſperate, in ſelling their lands and Voting them and theirs to ruine, paſt all hope of mercy; by detaining the King from going thither in Perſon to quiet that Rebellion, when he ſo graciouſly offered it, and ſo piouſly endeavoured it; by diverting thoſe fair, full, free, running ſtreames of bounty and liberality flowing all this Kingdome through, towards the reliefe of the diſtreſſed Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into thoſe foule, black, bloody rivers of Warre and Rebellion, overflowing this whole Kingdome to the waſting and weakening if not to the ruining and deſtroying of the now deſpiſed Proteſtants of <hi>England:</hi> and laſtly, by the with-holding and delaying, all along from the firſt to the laſt, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupplies of men, moneys, armes, and other proviſions from that Kingdome, notwithſtanding the Kings often and often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Houſes to be mindefull thereof, and conjuring them thereto (as appears by his many Meſſages and Declarations to that purpoſe) and notwithſtanding the loud and dolefull cryes of the Proteſtants of that Kingdome from the greateſt to the leaſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ecchoing in their ears If the Jeſuites and Jeſuited Papiſts of this Kingdome had not their hands deep in all this, and too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent a power with thoſe, that had the power of ordering that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59779:11"/>
buſineſſe better, let any man, that knowes one hand from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, judge.</p>
            <p>But to come yet nearer, thoſe incendiaries of Nations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers of the peace of Chriſtendome, are fowly belyed, by one, whoſe brother hath been one of them theſe many yeares, and he himſelfe is now theirs, and was then litle better. If there were not in, and about the Citty of London, and in, and neere the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, about 3 weekes or a month, before that heavy blow at Nazeby, above ſevenſcore Jeſuites and other Romiſh Prieſts (known the moſt of them to him) which kept correſpondence diverſe of them and gave intelligence to them at Weſtminſter, and ſerved them both in keeping off aſſiſtance from the King, from Princes of their Religion, and in betraying the Kings counſels and the reſolutions of his Army (which they, by their inſtruments and favourers crowded into thoſe quarters, got knowledge of) to the adverſe party; ſo that they could draw the kings Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what part of the kingdome they pleaſed, and there fight them, or not fight them, as they ſaw the advantage. Inſomuch that a Noble Colonell of the Kings Party, and a man of good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and credit, being then a Priſoner in the Counter in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, and having there fed at his table and preſerved the author of this information, that had been a priſoner in the ſame priſon, but was then by his Brothers meanes ſet at liberty; was, about that time before mentioned, adviſed upon thoſe grounds and ſome other by the ſaid informer (and that in gratitude as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, knowing no other way of acknowledging his bounty and liberality towards him) forthwith to make his compoſition and peace with the Parliament, for that the King would without all peradventure (yet the King was at that time in as high and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition as ever he had been in from the beginning of theſe warres) be brought very low. Strange propheticall counſaile at that time, had not the counſelour had too ſtrong preſumption to conclude from.</p>

I know there are ſome in this Kingdome of the Romiſh Religion, that have given ample and honourable teſtimonies of their Allegiance and fidelity to their Soveraign, and of their love to their Country: for which they deſerve all Chriſtian and civill reſpect and honour that can be ſhewn them (and that makes me ſo often to uſe that limitation of Jeſuites and Jeſuited, to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch, which, as hath been often and truly ſaid, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes look contrary wayes to our furious Separatiſts and other Sectaries, but joyn with them in the ſetting this Kingdome on fire.)

And if the maintainance of the Proteſtant Clergie, were but as poore and contemptible, as is deſired by many; the Clergie it ſelf would ſoon be as baſe and deſpicable, as could be wiſht by any; and then, beſides the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples growing like their Prieſts: (which;) conſtant obſervation hath made a Proverb, it would be no ſmall temptation to ſuch a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, upon hopes and promiſe of recovering their old ancient hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portions and revenues, to deſert that Religion, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows their Miniſters ſuch miſerable ſtarving pittances, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that, which rewards theirs with ſuch liberall, plentifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Much more might be ſaid to that point; but I touch it onely in relation to the deſigne of the Popiſh party, who have been and ſtill are the principall inſtigators to all ſacrilegious acts and reſolutions in this Kingdome, and will be, without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, the greateſt gainers thereby: not that they themſelves would practiſe the ſame, when they ſhould come into power, but becauſe they know there is no more ready way for them to come into power, then by ſuch practiſces of ours which would both render the Clergie of this Kingdome contemptible to the people, and the people not a little odious to them, as alſo otherwiſe fit and prepare both for their working them into what they ſhall pleaſe.

            <p>And what was their anſwer? The Lords they anſwered like Lords, profeſſing much joy at the zeale and care of the Miniſters of thoſe Counties for the preventing the further increaſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, &amp; Prophaneneſſe, &amp;c. They deſire them to continue in their indeavours therin, &amp; ſay they wil not be wanting to give them al incouragement, &amp;c. they aſſure them that they wil improve their power for ſuppreſſing of Error, Hereſie, ſeducing Teachers, and ſoul-ſubverting books, &amp; likewiſe for the ſetling of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment according to the Word of God, &amp;c. Here was a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, but that they had not conſulted the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for they return another, and indeed their common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, viz. That the moſt of the particular deſires of their Petition were then under conſideration, and they hope will be brought to a ſettlement ſpeedily, &amp;c. O the miraculous care and diligence of that Houſe! There was ſcarce ever any Petition, for redreſſe or reliefe in any things preſented unto them, but they were juſt then in Conſideration of them, and hoped that they would be ſpeedily ordered as they deſired, only through ſome intervening obſtructions they could not do as they would. But how came it to paſſe that the Commons had moſt of thoſe particulars under their conſideration, and had proceeded ſo far in them as to hope for a ſpeedie ſettlement therein, and yet the Lords knew of no ſuch thing, at leaſt forgot it quite in their anſwer? Well but let that paſſe: How much of all theſe faire promiſes hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed either by the one Houſe or the other from that time to this? Why ſo nothing but the juſt contrarie, that everie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination complained of in that Petition is increaſed to that height, and hath received that countenance from ſome of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned (as well as ſome of the Petitioners) that though each of them deſerve a particular ſad complaint (in a ſharp Petition) yet 'tis thought but vain for any to petition or complain to them of them all. And do but remember what ſucceſſe all other Petitions ſince that from other Counties, either for Religion, or King, or Lawes, or ought elſe that good is, have found at their hands, and hope for reliefe or redreſſe from them if you can.</p>

Next to the conſideration of the dangerous and deplorable condition of Religion here in this Kingdome, be pleaſed (as many of you as have any ſpark of Religion in you) timely to conſider the ſtate and condition of your King.

And although I ſleight the objection, yet <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10. Rom. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You have had ſuch triall of King <hi>Charles</hi> his fidelity and firmneſſe to the Proteſtant Religion, as never Prince gave the like; and I hope, never Prince either in this or any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be put to the like; for he hath had as great and as ſtrong temptations, as proſperity and adverſity in the height and depth of both could court or torment with, even ſuch as would have made a <hi>Luther,</hi> or a <hi>Calvin,</hi> a <hi>Cranmer,</hi> or a <hi>Ridley,</hi> or anie other of the moſt renowned confeſſors, or Martyrs of the Reformed Religion, either to have ſunk or ſhrunk under them; or elſe would have rendered them far more glorious then their confeſſions or ſuffrings did or could render them, though they want for no acceſſe of Glorie on Earth or reward in Heaven. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware then I ſay in time, for if King CHARLES ſhould come to reſiſt unto blood, as he hath alreadie often done to the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of hazard of it, and that Royall Religious blood of his ſhould be ſhed by you, that profeſſe your ſelves to be of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with him, (if of anie at all) either by your contributing money, horſe, armes, perſonall aſſiſtance, or ought elſe, to thoſe that thirſt and hunt after his blood, and to the reſiſting of thoſe that ſeek with the expence of their own to ſave it, or elſe by their not contributing what is in your power, to the hazzard of your own lives for the preſervation of his ſtill in ſuch known hazzard; (for they that preſerve not blood from being ſhed, when it is in their power to preſerve it, are undoubtedly guiltie of ſhedding it:) Beſides the deep everlaſting ſtaine that you would thereby bring upon the Proteſtant Religion, ſuch a guilt and horror would withall ſeize upon your ſoules when God ſhould come to <hi>ſet your ſinnes in order before your eyes</hi> (as <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21</note> doubtleſſe he will ſooner or later) that if ye did not like ſome Murtherers beleeve that whatſoever ye lookt on, ye behold King CHARLES his bſeeding ſides, and whatſoever ye eat or drunk, ye taſted King CHARLES his Blood; yet would ye wiſh ten thouſand times over, that you had loſt everie drop of your own bloods, and of the bloods of thoſe that are moſt yours, that ye had but done your dutie in time for the preſerving of his. Of all blood-guiltineſſe take heed of being guiltie of the blood of a

Yea what if I ſhould ſay that they which are guiltie of the blood of their King, are to be reputed as guiltie of doing their utmoſt to ſhed the blood of God (if I may ſo ſpeak after the manner of men) or of Chriſt himſelfe? I ſhould not need to be put to prove it, if what is moſt true be but confeſſed; namely, that Kings are Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate vicegerents, and the moſt repreſentative image of his Majeſtie, and therefore called <hi>Gods:</hi> which may be one reaſon if not the main one, why the ſhedding of the bloods of the moſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 6.</note> wicked of Kings, by anie of their own Subjects, hath been alwaies ſo publikely and ſeverely avenged, as in ſeverall ſtories is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Ye have indeed divers of you (that you might render them the more odious, and thoſe whom ye have ingaged againſt them the leſſe ſuſpicious, and the more bloody) raiſed rumor upon rumour, lie upon lie, and ſlander upon ſlander, and caſt them all upon them; particularly that grand cheating ſlander, wherewith the poore people have been ſo often fooled into blood, that the principall men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, by name the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> are great Papiſts; whereas the Kingdome knowes, (and ſo do many of you that raiſed and fomented that lie) that both theſe right honourable perſonages are as ſound, firme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Proteſtants, as any in this Nation; and if you were but as farre from Poperie as they, you would both abhorre ſo to bely them, and tremble to appeare in Armes againſt them. And what I ſay of thoſe two, may, I am confident, be avouched (and will be by thoſe that know them) of the reſt of thoſe Worthies that are with them, infinitely beyond what can be affirmed of the moſt ſelect Regiment, yea Troop that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Army can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now that they are named, ſuffer me to interpoſe this one word more concerning them. If there be any thing beſides their known loyaltie, that does exaſperate the factious ſeditious party againſt them, 'tis their eminent and approved firmeneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveableneſſe in the Proteſtant Religion. And if they ſhould miſcarry in this action (which I ſhall with all earneſtneſſe and conſtancie, as all that wiſh well to this languiſhing Church and ſtate ought to do, pray that they may not) the Proteſtants would find as great a loſſe in them, as in any of their Peeres within the three Kingdomes. But I have ſevered them too long from their honourable and ever to be honoured ſociety and fellow-Souldierie. Are they not all or the moſt of them men of known, tried integrity and honeſty, (and many of them your very next neighbours) and have they not ſo proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Declarations, Remonſtrances, and actions? Do they not all profeſſe clearly, that they have and do ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this preſent undertaking only for the defence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the eſtabliſhed Proteſtant Religion; for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Soveraigne from bondage and impriſonment, and from being murdered therein: for the reſtoring of his Majeſty to his lawful Government, juſt rights, and throne in Parliament, for the maintenance of the known Lawes of the land, and the rights, Liberties and properties of their fellow-ſubjects; and for the procuring and ſetling of a firme and happy peace in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably divided and allmoſt utterly ruined Kingdome? would to God that the Army, which call themſelves the Parliaments when they pleaſe, had declared, or would out yet declare halfe ſo much, and give ſuch aſſurance for the performance thereof, as thoſe Worthies will give; and then it might be hoped, that theſe unnaturall warres would ſoone be ended; But when ſo many of that Army have ſo openly declared and proclaimed the contrary to all theſe; and ſome of them have been bold to ſay, that they fought neither for King nor Parliament; and that they had above ſixty thouſand to be at eight houres warning, to fight both againſt King and Parliament, and have given very obſervable earneſts of their having too many in a readineſſe, by their ſudden raiſing ſuch conſiderable Troopes and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch, and wholly ſuch within very few daies.

And this concluſion you have confirmed in each circumſtance by many remarkable and cleare examples, as one of the Bookes of the Prophets, namely, in. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Propheſie: As in Gods dealing with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Mount-Seir,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines, Ezek.</hi> 25. with thoſe of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> chap. 26. with thoſe of <hi>Zidon.</hi> chap 28. with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and all <hi>Egypt,</hi> chap. 29. and with the reſt of the <hi>heathen,</hi> chap. 36.

'Tis true, if a man killed any perſon unawares, there were <hi>Cities of refuge</hi> appointed by God for ſuch a one to <hi>flye unto,</hi> from the <hi>avenger of blood;</hi> but Oh, my poore Countrey-men, what Cities of refuge can ye fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to your ſelves, who wilfully murther your brethren?</p>
            <p>And what leſſe can the King ſay of you, then this, or to this effect? The Countie of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> 'tis the moſt Rebellious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all my Dominions. For when one of my Kingdomes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not againſt me; when a ſecond roſe up for me; and when the third Petitioned for me from almoſt all parts, and tooke up Armes for me in moſt parts, they of <hi>Suffolke</hi> neither Petitioned for me, nor moved for me, but roſe up againſt me: and when Rebellion was expiring its laſt poyſonous breath, they hazarded their owne lives to prolong its life, and to preſerve the lives of thoſe Rebells, that ſeeke nothing more then to take away mine: When thouſands of my Loyall Subjects were indeavouring to fetch me out of my Cruell Bondage and Impriſonment, then they helpt to beſiege and impriſon, to kill &amp; murther thoſe very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and when others with them were making what haſte they could to ſet my Crowne againe firme on my head, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me againe to thoſe Rights, Honours and Comforts, which I was wont to injoy, they did what they could to throw my Crowne back againe to the ground, and to keepe mine Honour ſtill in the duſt, and me from all hopes of enjoying any Rights or externall Comforts here in this life.

            <p>I know there are very many amongſt you, in this Countie, of very much Religion and Loyaltie, Honour and Honeſtie; O that God would but give you that Spirit and Courage which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the exerciſing of thoſe excellent indowments, and without which, thoſe excellencies will be of little benefit to others, or comfort to your ſelves; nay, they will aggravate your ſhame here, and your confuſion hereafter: For your poore countrey-men will ſay (as many of them have alreadie ſaid) If ſuch and ſuch had in due time ſhewne themſelves to be what they ſeemed, and wee thought them, wee had ſhewne our ſelves to have bin other then what we are now thought, and are.

Jerem. 13. v.</hi> 20. 21. The ſame may I ſay to you, word for word; and every one of you, if you will, may ſee cauſe enough why I ſhould ſay ſo. 'Tis often threatned in Scripture as an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of judgements, That <hi>God will give up ſuch or ſuch a people into the hands of ſtrangers:</hi> And it muſt be confeſſed, That 'tis moſt juſt with God, to give you up into the hands of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who have ſo unworthily deſerted your owne King, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects: and the juſtice of God will be ſomewhat the more remarkable, in his giving you up to thoſe Northerne ſtrangers of all others; becauſe they were they, whom ye your ſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called in, and contributed ſo liberally to their comming in to your aſſiſtance againſt your King, though ye pretended to them that it was to fight for him: And therefore now it muſt needs be the more obſervable juſtice both in God and them, that they ſhould come in of themſelves to the aſſiſtance of the ſame King, and his faithfull Subjects againſt you, that deſerted him and them ſo ſhamefully, and have thereby diſcovered your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hypocriſie &amp; other iniquitie ſo notoriouſly. And let me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell you, That, if thoſe Strangers ſhould not avenge the King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59779:27"/>
and Kingdoms wrongs ſufficiently, 'tis to be believed, ſome other Strangers, more fierce, bloudy, &amp; cruell, ſhal do it. For remember, I beſeech you, that famous and pertinent Story of Gods dealing with the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> when they deſerted their King, (though the moſt wicked of Kings, <hi>Ahaz</hi> by name) becauſe he was brought low, and <hi>made a confederacie with thoſe two tayles of thoſe ſmoaking fire-brands, Rezin and Pekah. For that very cauſe</hi> (as God by his Prophet gives the Reaſon, <hi>Iſa. 8.) did the Lord threaten to bring up upon the men of Judah, the King of Aſſyria, and all his hoſts</hi> (called there <hi>his glory)</hi> compared to the <hi>waters of an over-flowing river, ſtrong, and many;</hi> and that he and they ſhould <hi>paſſe thorow Iudah, and ſhould over-flow</hi> and <hi>goe over,</hi> and <hi>reach even to the neck &amp;c.</hi> which was all accordingly done, as you may finde by comparing <hi>Iſa. chap.</hi> 7. and 8. with 2 <hi>Chron. chap.</hi> 28. and 32. And do but obſerve further, how God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. from <hi>v.</hi> 9. to <hi>v.</hi> 16. ſcornes and mocks at the men of <hi>Iudah's aſſociating themſelves,</hi> and joyning their forces with others againſt their owne King; and how earneſtly he calls upon his Prophet, not to <hi>walke</hi> in the <hi>way of that people</hi> himſelfe, and to inſtruct others not to joyn <hi>in confederacie</hi> with them, nor to <hi>feare their feare, nor be afraid,</hi> (which is the principall cauſe of ſuch Rebellious Confederacies) but <hi>to ſanctifie the Lord of Hosts, and to let him be their feare, &amp;c.</hi> promiſing them ſafetie that ſhall avoyd ſuch a Confederacie, &amp; threatning ruine to ſuch Confederates, and to thoſe that joyn with them. So ſpake &amp; did the Lord then, and he is the ſame Lord ſtill, &amp; changeth not; and they that commit the like fins, may juſtly fear the like puniſhmens. And now anſwer to that queſtion, which God by the ſame Prophet, though in another chapter, propounds unto you; unto you, my lamented Countrey-men, who have joyned in a Confederacie with thoſe, who (as the Prophet deſcribes them, with a <hi>woe to them prefixed, Iſa. 10.) decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievouſneſſe,</hi> which they have preſcribed, <hi>to turn aſide the needy from judgement, and to take away the right from the poore, &amp;c. that widowes may be their prey, &amp; that they may rob the fatherleſſe.

Give the Devill or any of his Imps but a little, &amp; that gives them power over all that ye have: and now that they have gotten you into the ſame way with them, they'l find allurements enough to draw you on, or fears enough to frighten you on, or force enough to drive you on, as far as they pleaſe. Then if other Counties riſe up againſt them, &amp; joyn with the Northern Army, which private as well as publike intereſt will perſwade them to, (unleſſe God ſhould give them up to a reprobate ſenſe, as he hath done ſome of you) <hi>Suffolke</hi> muſt then be the Stage of War, at leaſt <hi>Suffolke-</hi>men muſt be the chiefe Actors on that Stage; and to be ſure, the moſt deſperate parts of that Tragedie will be put upon them, as hath bin alreadie practiſed; though when ought of ſpoyle chanceth to fall to their lots (which is but a <hi>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urie, ſo farre as Gods unſearchable Judgments can be gueſſed at by mans ſhallow reaſon and obſervation. How neere a Famine is to the doores of other Counties, is beſt knowne to God and them; onely this is knowne to every one, that knowes ought of Gods Word and wayes, That when God hath brought the Sword upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to avenge the quarrell of his Covenant, and that people doe not repent of their tranſgreſſing his Covenant, but inſtead thereof tranſgreſſe it more and more (as we have generally done in all Counties of this Kingdome, for ought that I could either ſee or heare) 'tis Gods uſuall courſe then to ſend both a Plague and a Famine too upon ſuch a people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may devoure what the Sword ſpares. So God profeſſes to doe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and in ſundry other places.</p>
            <p>But for this Countie, unleſſe we ſhut our eyes (as we have done too often) we cannot but ſee a ſore Famine already at our doores, and ready to breake in upon us ſuddenly. The Sword we drew our ſelves againſt our ſelves, when it would have bin otherwiſe, in all likelyhood, quiet; and ſince we drew the Sword, God ſeemes to have bent his Bow in the Clouds, as it were with the Bend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as though, upon our forgetting our Covenant with him ſo much, he would forget his Covenant with us ſo farre, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us with Raine, though he never will again deſtroy the world ſo. Never was this Countie ſo richly furniſhed with all ſorts of Graine in their fields, and they ſo hopefull, as they were this yeare, which makes me to feare a Famine the more; for when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59779:29"/>
God intends to bring his ſore Judgements upon a people he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally takes that for his time, when men leaſt thinke of any ſuch thing, and when there is moſt expectation to the contrarie, which renders his Judgements ſo much the more ſore: as when there is moſt ſhew of peace and ſecuritie, then does God, if provoked, commonly bring the Sword; and ſo, when there is moſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of plentie and fulneſſe, that time does God make choyſe of to ſend a Famine: becauſe, as I but now ſaid, the Judgement is moſt ſore, when the contrarie is moſt expected; and then alſo is the hand of God moſt ſeene in it, and the Judgement beſt diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be from his hand: which are the two principall reaſons that ſome later learned Divines have given, from S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why God ſent the generall Deluge in the Spring time, when all things were in their flouriſhing glory, and the Seaſon moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely for ſuch a Floud. But to returne (if this be a digreſſion) to what I was ſaying; Never was this Countie ſo richly furniſhed with all ſorts of Grain, and they ſo hopefull, as they were this year, till they began to imbrue their hands in their brethrens blouds; and ſince that, even from that very time (if the obſervation of many more, beſide my ſelfe, doe not faile us) the Lord hath cauſed it to raine upon theſe parts (whatſoever it hath done upon other) in ſuch a manner and meaſure, and for ſo many dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the like hath ſcarce ever been, or at leaſt hath not been tranſmitted to us by any tradition or record that I could meet with: inſomuch, that the faire-promiſing chearefully flouriſhing Corne-fields of this Countie are now likely to afford little other Harveſt, but what (as the Prophet ſometimes threatned) <hi>will be an heape in the day of griefe and deſperate ſorrow.</hi> And what then will <note place="margin">Iſa. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Without repentance, it is impoſſible that any thing which ye doe ſhould be accepted; much more impoſſible is it, that ought which ye ſuffer, ſhould be removed; for Gods Judgements ſhall accompliſh their end for which God ſends them, either converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or confuſion. A removall there may be, and often is, of this or that particular Judgement, where the ſinnes that cauſed it are not repented of; but if God intend mercie to ſuch, other Judgements or Chaſtiſements are inflicted, and they are by them brought to repentance; or elſe the removall of Judgements is a ſore Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the aſſured fore-runner of deſtruction; as might be at large ſhewne, if need were. What other way ſoever therefore ye think to take, you will finde your ſelves, as hitherto ye have, farre out of the way of obtaining what you deſire and expect, if your deſires and expectation be ſuch as beſeeme Chriſtians: and if ye doe <hi>get out of one fire</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>another</hi>

Be intreated therefore, my deepely afflicted, and of me moſt compaſſionately affected, Countreymen, as ye love either your Religion, your King, your Countrey, your Honour, your owne comforts, or the comforts of any of yours; your preſervation in this world, or your ſalvation in the world to come.

            <p>And if any of you do diſtruſt or doubt of the Kings pardon and acceptance of you, or of your fellow Subjects firm and loving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with you; If that which I have ſaid to that purpoſe, doe not ſufficiently ſatisfie you, be pleaſed to imploy me (if ye have no other ſervant more fit &amp; worthy, for ye have none more affectionate and faithfull) in that ſervice for you; and I ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe my life in procuring of it, or reſign it up willingly into your hands, to be diſpoſed of at your pleaſure, if I doe not bring you an ingagement under hand and Seale from all thoſe men of
