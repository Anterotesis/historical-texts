            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it be well known, that neither the fir≈øt writers of
the≈øe Letters now by me printed, nor yet the Spaniard <hi>Don
Bernardin</hi> to whom they are directed had any de≈øire to heare
of any good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe to the State of <hi>England:</hi> as may appeare
in the writer, by ≈øhewing him≈øelfe grieved, to make any good
report of <hi>England,</hi> other then of meere nece≈ø≈øity he was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
And in <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> who was ≈øo impudent, or at the lea≈øt, ≈øo
blindly ra≈øh, as to disper≈øe in print, both in <hi>French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spani≈øh,</hi>
mo≈øt fal≈øe reports of a victory had by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> even when the victory
was notable on the part of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> vanqui≈øhed; yet whil≈øt
I was occupied in the printing heerof, a good time after the Letters were ≈øent
into <hi>France,</hi> there came to this City certaine knowledge, to all our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
of ≈øundry happy Accidents, to the diminution of our mortall enemies in
their famous Fleet, that was driven out of our Seas about the la≈øt of <hi>July,</hi> 1588
towards the farthermo≈øt North parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Wherefore I have thought
it not ami≈ø≈øe to joyne the ≈øame to this Letter of <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> that he may
beware not to be ≈øo ha≈øty of him≈øelfe, nor yet to permit one <hi>Capella,</hi> who is
his common ≈øower of reports to write the≈øe fal≈øe things for truthes.</p>
            <p>The particularities whereof are the≈øe. The Fleet was by tempe≈øt driven
beyond the I≈øles of <hi>Orknay,</hi> about the fir≈øt of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> 1588. the place
being aboue three≈øcore degrees from the North Pole: an unaccu≈øtomed
place for the young Gallants of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that never had felt ≈øtormes on
the Sea, or cold weather in Augu≈øt. And about tho≈øe North I≈ølands, their
Mariners and Souldiers died daily by multitudes; as by their bodies ca≈øt on
land did appeare. And after twenty daies or more, having ≈øpent their time in
mi≈øeries, they being de≈øirous to returne home to <hi>Spain,</hi> ≈øailed very farre South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we≈øtward
into the Ocean to recover <hi>Spaine.</hi> But the Almighty God, who
alwaies avengeth the cau≈øe of his afflicted people which put their confidence in
him, and bringeth downe his enemies that exalt them≈øelves with pride to the
Heavens, ordered the windes to be ≈øo violently contrarious to this proud Navie,
as it was with force di≈ø≈øevered on the high Seas We≈øt upon <hi>Ireland:</hi> and ≈øo
a great number of them, driven into ≈øundry dangerous bayes, and upon rockes,
all along the We≈øt and North parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in ≈øundry places di≈øtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an hundred miles a≈øunder, and there ca≈øt away, ≈øome ≈øunke, ≈øome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
≈øome run on ≈øands, ≈øome burned by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them≈øelves.</p>

≈øeeme to be per≈øons of great e≈øtimation.</p>

was of <hi>S. Seba≈øtians,</hi> wherin were three hundred men, who were al≈øo
all drowned ≈øaving three≈øcore. A third Ship with all her lading was ca≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at a place called <hi>Breckan.</hi>

            <p>In another place afore Sir <hi>Tirlogh Obrynes</hi> hou≈øe, there was al≈øo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>July,</hi> when this Navy was fir≈øt beaten with the Navie of <hi>England,</hi> untill the
tenth of <hi>September,</hi> being the ≈øpace of ≈øeven weekes and more, it is mo≈øt
likely that the ≈øaid Navie had never good day nor night</p>
            <p>Of the re≈øt of the Navie, report is al≈øo made that many of them have bene
≈øeene, lying of and on upon the coa≈øt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to≈ø≈øed with the windes, in
≈øuch ≈øort as it is al≈øo doubted, that many of them ≈øhall hardly recover <hi>Spaine,</hi>
if they be ≈øo weakned with lacke of victuals and Mariners, as part of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
that were left on land do lamentably report. The≈øe accidents I thought
good to adde to the printed Copies of the Letters of <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> that he
may ≈øee how God doth favour the ju≈øt cau≈øe of that gracious Queen, in ≈øhewing
his anger towards tho≈øe proud boa≈øting enemies of Chri≈øtian peace, as the
whole world, from <hi>Rome</hi> to the uttermo≈øt parts of Chri≈øtendome may ≈øee, that
≈øhe and her Realme, profe≈ø≈øing the Gospell of his ≈øonne Chri≈øt were kept and
defended, as the words of the P≈øalme are, <hi>Under the ≈øhadow of his wings
from the face of the wicked that ≈øought to afflict her, and compa≈ø≈øe her

once in ≈øome towardne≈ø≈øe of re≈øolution among≈øt the Coun≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
that they ≈øhould have bin returned and put to their former
liberty. But the heat of the war being kindled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Kings <hi>Armado,</hi> being at that time come to the
<hi>Groigne,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> readine≈ø≈øe with ≈øo great an

yea to come to London, and a generall murmur of the
people again≈øt all ≈øuch <hi>Recu≈øants</hi> of reputation, was the cau≈øe
of the ≈øtaying of the≈øe Gentlemen at <hi>Ely,</hi> notwith≈øtanding
their offers of their ≈øervice to the Queen: And ≈øo they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Bi≈øhops palace there, with fruition of large walks
about the ≈øame, altogether without any impri≈øonment, other
then that they are not ≈øuffred to depart into the town or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and yet for their Religion,<note place="margin">The Recu≈øants are not put in danger of their lives for their Religion, but are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at ≈øums of money.</note> I thinke ≈øurely they doe, and
will remaine con≈øtant to the obedience of the Church of
Rome; for the which neverthele≈ø≈øe they are not impeached to
any danger of their lives, but onely charged with a penalty of
money, becau≈øe they will not come to the Churches, whereby,
by the law., a portion of their revenue is allotted to the Queen,

            <p>By which kind of proceedings our adver≈øaries here doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that both the≈øe Gentlemen, and all other of their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

privately ≈øpeaking with ≈øuch our adver≈øaries, as we thinke are
not maliciou≈øly bent to have men pro≈øecuted to death only for
their Religion (for to ≈øay the truth, and as the proverbe is, not
to belye the Devill, very many of our Contraries are in that
point not uncharitable) we doe object to them the executions
by cruell torments, and deaths of very many, both here about
London, and other parts of the Realme, whom we account as
Martyrs, in that they doe witne≈ø≈øe by their death their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Pope, and the Catholique Church of Rome.</p>

but for that they which have been executed, have bin found to
have wandred in the Realme ≈øecretly, and in a di≈øgui≈øed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which the adver≈øaries ≈øcornfully terme as ruffians,<note place="margin">The Seminaries for the mo≈øt part come di≈øgui≈øed like Ru≈ø≈øians.</note> with

people, with whom they dare adventure to ≈øpeake, not only to
be reconciled to the Pope, and Church of Rome, but to induce
them by vowes and oathes to renounce their obedience to the
Queene; to deny her to be their Soveraigne, and them≈øelves to
be di≈øcharged of their Allegiance; and to repute all Magi≈øtrates
under her to be unlawfull, and in con≈øcience not to be obeyed,
with many more ≈øuch matters (which I neverthele≈ø≈øe count to

the Realme.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Defenders of the≈øe judgements and executions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,

the Queen, the Lawes, and the Government, and ≈øtate of

all proce≈ø≈øe of law extended and pur≈øued again≈øt them, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øtly

no mention made of charging them with their Religion, but
that they have attempted to per≈øwade the Queens ≈øubjects to

            <p>In this ≈øort, the≈øe men for their advantage, doe at all times,

though, where I and others may reply without perill to our
≈øelves (as ≈øurely in ≈øome ≈ømall companies we may, u≈øing mode≈øt

their Religion; yet is it on the other part again≈øt us alleadged,
and maintained, that they are neither endited, condemned, nor
executed for their Religion, or for offering of them≈øelves to
die for their Religion, but onely for their former trea≈øons in
con≈øpiring again≈øt the Queen &amp; ≈øtate of the Realme: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe
then of late time <hi>Babington</hi> and all his Complices, who
were condemned for their attempt to have rai≈øed war in the
Realm, and to have murdered the Queen, and to have ≈øet up the

voluntarily confe≈ø≈øed, and were condemned and executed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for tho≈øe their great trea≈øons; and yet divers of them at the
place of their execution, did in like maner (as the≈øe Prie≈øts and
Je≈øuites u≈øe to doe) make confe≈ø≈øion of their Catholike faith,
with offer to dye for the ≈øame; and yet (≈øay our adver≈øaries) it
ought not to be affirmed, that <hi>Babington</hi> and his complices
were put to death for Religion, but for their trea≈øons.</p>
            <p>And for further maintenance of the coloured arguments
wherwith I, and others my good, faithfull, and Catholike bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are often troubled how to an≈øwer them, it is alleadged
that the great number of gentlemen, and gentlewomen, ye,
≈øome of honourable calling, and of other meaner degrees, are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63459:9"/>
knowne manife≈øtly to be of a contrary Religion to the Lawes

being called to an≈øwer thereto, if they can ≈øhew no ≈øuch

to pay a penalty out of their goods and lands, if they
have any, and not otherwi≈øe puni≈øhed, nor yet by inqui≈øition
any of them examined of their faith. But yet ≈øay the≈øe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,

argued to the griefe of me and ≈øome others a mo≈øt vehement

            <p>Of the number and ≈øtrength of the Queenes owne ≈øhips of

heretofore. But yet I will make you a true report of the ≈øtate of
them this pre≈øent Summer, what I have credibly heard therof,
becau≈øe I have been very ≈øorry to heare how you and others
have been therein abu≈øed: And that not only in this matter of

≈øome part hath been here by very many, maliciou≈øly, and in
common ≈øpeeches imputed to your owne invention and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
whereof in a few words I will make ≈øome digre≈ø≈øion
before I ≈øhall ≈øhew the e≈øtate of the Queens Navy.</p>
            <p>In this Summer pa≈øt,<note place="margin">Two notable lyes printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and imputed to <hi>Don Bernardia Mendoza.</hi>
               </note> there was printed in <hi>Paris</hi> by your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(as it was reported) a notable untruth, which I did ≈øee
and reade, That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had be≈øieged <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and
had won it by a≈ø≈øault, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed it quietly, whereof no part
was true, nor any cau≈øe to imagine the ≈øame, though I wi≈øh it
had ≈øo been; but not for any good will that I now beare to that
King, but for the trouble to this Queen. For in truth there is
no good for us to be hoped for from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> how≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Scotti≈øh Bi≈øhops in <hi>France</hi> have ≈øought to make you
beleeve otherwi≈øe, who is ≈øo rooted in the <hi>Calvini≈øts</hi> Religion,
as there is never hope that he can be recovered to the Church

know the truth of the ≈øtate of the Queens Navy this Summer.<note place="margin">The ≈øtate of the Navy of England this Summer.</note>
The ≈øame was in the beginning of the yeare, when the brute
was brought of the readines of the Kings Armado in <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
and of the army by land upon the Sea-coa≈øts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with
their ≈øhipping, divided into three companies; the greate≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

had al≈øo been high Admirals afore him, whereof both France
and Scotland have had proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63459:10"/>
Another company were appointed to remaine with the L.

Protector in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> Hen. Seymour.</note> and brother to the Earle
of Hartford; and the≈øe companies for a time continued in the
narrow ≈øeas betwixt England and Flanders, under the charge
of the ≈øaid high Admirall, to attend on the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi>
actions.</p>
            <p>A third company were armed in the We≈øt part of England
towards <hi>Spain</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Francis Drake</note> a man
by name, and fame known too too well to all Spam, and to the
Kings <hi>Indias,</hi> and of great reputation in England; and this
was compounded, partly of ≈øome of the Queens owne ≈øhips,
and partly of the ≈øhips of the We≈øt parts.</p>
            <p>But after that it was certainly under≈øtood that the great
Navy of <hi>Spaine</hi> was ready to come out from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and that
the fame thereof was blowne abroad in Chri≈øtendome to be
invincible, and ≈øo publi≈øhed by books in print: The Queen and
all her Councell I am ≈øure (what≈øoever good countenance they
made) were not a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, as looking certainly for a
dangerous fight upon the Seas, and after that for a landing and
inva≈øion. Whereupon the Lord Admirall was commanded to
≈øaile with the greate≈øt ≈øhips to the We≈øt of <hi>England</hi> towards
<hi>Spaine</hi> to joyne with <hi>Drake,</hi> whom he made Vice-Admirall,
and to continue in the Seas betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to

opinion we had conceived by the reports of the world, that

was ≈øo exce≈ø≈øive mon≈øtrous, beyond all the Navies that ever

both of her actions to maintain the liking of all her people, and
of the generall earne≈øt devotion ≈øhewed to her by all e≈øtates,
noble and meane, rich and poore, as I thinke no Prince chri≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ever had greater cau≈øe of comfort in her people, which I
may judge to breed a pride in her. And to recompence the

when mo≈øt danger was threatened, in all her actions towards
her people, as carefull for their weale, and for the ≈øafety of her
Realme, without any ≈øpeciall or particular provi≈øion, or regard
to her owne per≈øon, as ever any Prince could doe. Fir≈øt, to let

There were al≈øo ≈øundry armies de≈øcribed, to defend every coa≈øt

the ≈øecrets of the Court, was importunate with her Councell

the greate≈øt number of the ≈øaid ≈øouldiers were compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
yet the Captains, Leaders, and the principall Knights and

            <p>Be≈øide the≈øe fore≈øaid arguments, to di≈øprove the opinion of

both contentation and readine≈ø≈øe, in all the Nobilitie of the

relations of the generall great and fervent love of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

for there is nothing at this pre≈øent more univer≈øally, with

that they now evidently ≈øee, that the King their Ma≈øter was
with ≈øuch informations greatly abu≈øed, yea rather betrayed. For
they ≈øay there was no man of value in all this army, but he
heard it con≈øtantly affirmed, and ≈øo delivered for comfort of all
that ≈øerved therein, before they were ≈øhipped, that they ≈øhould
not be afraid of any re≈øi≈øtance to land in <hi>England,</hi> for tha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
there was good a≈ø≈øurance given to the King, that they ≈øhould
finde a ≈øtrong army of Catholiques ready in their favour,
as ≈øoon as ever their Navy ≈øhould be ≈øeen upon the Sea-coa≈øt,<note place="margin">No po≈ø≈øibility to invade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a Realme, without favour of a party inward.</note>

done ≈øome part thereof, he fell ≈øicke of a burning fever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
my letter remained with him upon hope of recovery for
ten or twelve dayes, and ≈øeeing no hope thereof, I intreated
another very tru≈øty and a ≈øound Catholique, having perfect

it into French, wherein was al≈øo longer time ≈øpent: ≈øo as my

in the mean time meet for your knowledge.</p>
            <p>About the ≈øeventh of Augu≈øt, the L. Admirall returned with
the Navy, having followed the Spani≈øh Navy (as they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
as far as the 55 degree Northwards; the Spani≈øh Navy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a cour≈øe either to the furthe≈øt parts of <hi>Norwey,</hi> or to the
<hi>Orcades</hi> beyond <hi>Scotland;</hi> which if they did, then it was here
judged that they would goe about <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63459:20"/>
they could recover provi≈øions of ma≈øts, whereof the Engli≈øh

con≈øidering I de≈øpaired of their return for many re≈øpects,
both of their wants, which could not be furni≈øhed in <hi>Norwey,</hi>
and of the lacke of the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> ability to bring his
army on the Sea for want of mariners. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, upon

               <note place="margin">Order taken by the K of Scots in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Engli≈øh.</note>
and that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had given ≈øtrict commandement

charge, to attend upon the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> attempts,
either towards <hi>England,</hi> which was mo≈øt unlikely, or toward
<hi>Zeland,</hi> which began to be doubted. But within three or foure
dayes after this, ≈øuddenly there came report to the Court, that
the Spani≈øh Navy had refre≈øhed it ≈øelfe in the I≈ølands beyond
the <hi>Orcades,</hi> both with water plentifully, and with bread, fi≈øh
and fle≈øh, as for their money they could get, and would returne
hither once againe, to attend on the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> army, to
conduct it by Sea into <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon grew ≈øome new
bu≈øines here, wherewith I know the Queen and her Councell
was not a little perplexed what to doe; but in the end, order
was given to ≈øtay the di≈øarming of her Navy, and ≈øo the whole
Navy was very ≈øpeedily made ready againe, only upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reports: wherewith I and many others were very glad, to
≈øee them thus newly troubled, and upon every light report put
to great charges. But this la≈øted not pa≈øt eight or ten dayes, for
upon more certain knowledge by two or three Pinnaces, that
were ≈øent to di≈øcover where the Spani≈øh fleet was, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
that they were beyond the <hi>Orcades,</hi> ≈øayling towards the
We≈øt, in very evill ca≈øe, having many of their people dead in

al≈øo of mariners. A new commandement was given to di≈ø≈øolve
the Navy, ≈øaving that which ≈øhould attend on the Duke of

were al≈øo de≈øtined to all villany; the rich Merchants hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes

graven with markes, to be heated for the marking of all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

might be knowne hereafter to have been the children of the

murmure, that tho≈øe Spani≈øh pri≈øoners ought not to be ≈øuffered
to live, as they did, but to be killed, as they had purpo≈øed to
have done the Engli≈øh. But the wi≈øer ≈øort of men, and ≈øuch as
had the charge of the pri≈øoners, having no commandement
from the Councell, did ≈øtraitly looke to the ≈øafety of the pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as a matter not to be ≈øo ra≈øhly ≈øuffered. But to content the
people with ≈øome other matter, there was upon Sunday la≈øt, at
the reque≈øt of the Major and his brethren, a great number of
Banners,<note place="margin">Banners, Streamers and En≈øignes of the Spaniards ≈øhewed to the people.</note> Streamers, and En≈øignes, which were won from the

rage of the people was greatly a≈ø≈øwaged, the fury generally
converted into triumph, by boa≈øting in every place, that this
was the act of God, who had heard the fervent prayers of the

to have ≈øuch Banners and Streamers, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
