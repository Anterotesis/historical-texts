         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Printer to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it be well known, that neither the firſt writers of
theſe Letters now by me printed, nor yet the Spaniard <hi>Don
Bernardin</hi> to whom they are directed had any deſire to heare
of any good ſucceſſe to the State of <hi>England:</hi> as may appeare
in the writer, by ſhewing himſelfe grieved, to make any good
report of <hi>England,</hi> other then of meere neceſſity he was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
And in <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> who was ſo impudent, or at the leaſt, ſo
blindly raſh, as to disperſe in print, both in <hi>French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi>
moſt falſe reports of a victory had by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> even when the victory
was notable on the part of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> vanquiſhed; yet whilſt
I was occupied in the printing heerof, a good time after the Letters were ſent
into <hi>France,</hi> there came to this City certaine knowledge, to all our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
of ſundry happy Accidents, to the diminution of our mortall enemies in
their famous Fleet, that was driven out of our Seas about the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1588
towards the farthermoſt North parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Wherefore I have thought
it not amiſſe to joyne the ſame to this Letter of <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> that he may
beware not to be ſo haſty of himſelfe, nor yet to permit one <hi>Capella,</hi> who is
his common ſower of reports to write theſe falſe things for truthes.</p>
            <p>The particularities whereof are theſe. The Fleet was by tempeſt driven
beyond the Iſles of <hi>Orknay,</hi> about the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1588. the place
being aboue threeſcore degrees from the North Pole: an unaccuſtomed
place for the young Gallants of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that never had felt ſtormes on
the Sea, or cold weather in Auguſt. And about thoſe North Iſlands, their
Mariners and Souldiers died daily by multitudes; as by their bodies caſt on
land did appeare. And after twenty daies or more, having ſpent their time in
miſeries, they being deſirous to returne home to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſailed very farre South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtward
into the Ocean to recover <hi>Spaine.</hi> But the Almighty God, who
alwaies avengeth the cauſe of his afflicted people which put their confidence in
him, and bringeth downe his enemies that exalt themſelves with pride to the
Heavens, ordered the windes to be ſo violently contrarious to this proud Navie,
as it was with force diſſevered on the high Seas Weſt upon <hi>Ireland:</hi> and ſo
a great number of them, driven into ſundry dangerous bayes, and upon rockes,
all along the Weſt and North parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in ſundry places diſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an hundred miles aſunder, and there caſt away, ſome ſunke, ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ſome run on ſands, ſome burned by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>As in the North part of <hi>Ireland</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> betwixt the two rivers
of <hi>Loughfo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

them broken, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forced to come to land for ſuccour amongſt the
wilde <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another place, twenty miles South-weſt from thence, in a Bay called
<pb facs="tcp:63459:3"/>
               <hi>Calbeggy,</hi> three other ſhips driven alſo upon rockes. In another place South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

belonging to the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> one ſpeciall great Ship of a thouſand tunne,
with fifty braſſe peeces and foure Cannons was ſunke, and all the people drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſaving ſixteene: who by their apparell, as it is advertiſed out of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
ſeeme to be perſons of great eſtimation.</p>
            <p>Then to come more to the Southward, thirtie miles upon the coaſts of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
North from the river <hi>Shennan,</hi> two or three moe periſhed, whereof
one was burned by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves and ſo driven to the ſhore: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
was of <hi>S. Sebaſtians,</hi> wherin were three hundred men, who were alſo
all drowned ſaving threeſcore. A third Ship with all her lading was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at a place called <hi>Breckan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another place afore Sir <hi>Tirlogh Obrynes</hi> houſe, there was alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Ship loſt, ſuppoſed to be a Galliaſſe Theſe loſſes above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
were betwixt the fift and tenth of <hi>September,</hi> as was advertiſed from
ſundry places out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> ſo as by account, from the one and twentieth of
<hi>July,</hi> when this Navy was firſt beaten with the Navie of <hi>England,</hi> untill the
tenth of <hi>September,</hi> being the ſpace of ſeven weekes and more, it is moſt
likely that the ſaid Navie had never good day nor night</p>
            <p>Of the reſt of the Navie, report is alſo made that many of them have bene
ſeene, lying of and on upon the coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> toſſed with the windes, in
ſuch ſort as it is alſo doubted, that many of them ſhall hardly recover <hi>Spaine,</hi>
if they be ſo weakned with lacke of victuals and Mariners, as part of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
that were left on land do lamentably report. Theſe accidents I thought
good to adde to the printed Copies of the Letters of <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> that he
may ſee how God doth favour the juſt cauſe of that gracious Queen, in ſhewing
his anger towards thoſe proud boaſting enemies of Chriſtian peace, as the
whole world, from <hi>Rome</hi> to the uttermoſt parts of Chriſtendome may ſee, that
ſhe and her Realme, profeſſing the Gospell of his ſonne Chriſt were kept and
defended, as the words of the Pſalme are, <hi>Under the ſhadow of his wings
from the face of the wicked that ſought to afflict her, and compaſſe her
round about to take away her ſoule:</hi> Which I doubt not, by thankfullneſſe
yeelded by her Majeſtie and her whole Realme, will alwaies cotinue.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Embaſſador, though at the time of my
laſt large writing to you of the ſtate of this
countrey, and of our long deſired expectation
of ſuccours promiſed, I did not thinke to have
had ſuch a ſorrowfull occaſion of any ſecond
writing, as now I have of alamentable change
of matters of eſtate here; yet I cannot forbeare (though it be
with as many ſighes as lines) to advertiſe you of the truth of
our miſerable condition, as now to me and others of our
party the ſame appeareth to be, That by comparing of all
things paſt in hope, with the preſent now in deſpaire, your
L. who have had the principall mannaging hitherto of
all our cauſes of long time both here and there in France, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King Catholique aſſiſted with the Potentates of
the holy League, and all our countrey men which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
obedience to the Church of Rome may now fall into
ſome new and better conſideration, how our ſtate both for
our ſelves at home, and our brethren abroad, now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
fallen (as it were) into utter deſpaire, may be revived and
reſtored to ſome new hope, with better aſſurance of ſucceſſe
then hath happened hitherto:<note place="margin">In what termes England ſtandeth in the opinion of the Catholiques.</note> For which purpoſe I have thought it neceſſary to advertiſe you in what termes this
countrey now ſtandeth, far otherwiſe then of late, both we
at home, and others abroad did make account of. You know
how we have depended in firme hope of a change of the
ſtate of this countrey by the meanes of the devout and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
incitations of the <hi>Popes Holineſſe,</hi> of the <hi>King Catholiqve,</hi>
and of other <hi>Potentates</hi> of the <hi>Holy League,</hi> to take upon
them the invaſion and conqueſt of this Realme, and by your
aſſurances, and firme promiſes, we were now of a long ſeaſon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63459:4"/>
paſt perſwaded, that the <hi>King Catholique</hi> had taken upon him
the ſame glorious Act, and thereof from yeare to yeare we
looked for the execution, being continually fed and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from you to continue our hope, and ſundry times ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by your earneſt requeſts and perſwaſions to encourage
our party at home not to waver, as many were diſpoſed by
ſight of continuall delayes, but to be ready to joyne with the
outward forces that ſhould come for this invaſion. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the delayes and prolongations of times appointed for
the comming of the Kings forces, ſpecially by ſea, have been
ſo many, as until this laſt ſpring we were in deſpaire: at what
time you advertiſed us with great aſſurance that all the
Kings preparations,<note place="margin">The Spaniſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration 3 yeares in making.</note> which had bin in making ready theſe 3
or 4 yeares together, were now in full perfection, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faile would this Summer come into our Seas with ſuch
mighty ſtrength, as no Navy of England, or of Chriſtendome
could reſiſt and abide their force; and for more ſurety, and for
avoyding of all doubts, to make the intended conqueſt ſure,
the ſame ſhould alſo have joyned to it, the mighty army
which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had made ready, and kept in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
in the low countries all this yeare paſt,<note place="margin">The Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas army in Flanders.</note> wherwith he
ſhould land, and ſo both by ſea and land, this Realme ſhould
be invaded, and a ſpeedy conqueſt made thereof, to the which
were alwayes added ſundry reaſons: Whereupon was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that neither by ſea, nor by land, there would be any great
reſiſtance found here,<note place="margin">No forraine force could invade Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, without a strong party in England. Hope of victory by the Spaniſh army with aſſiſtance of a party in England this Summer.</note> but a ſtrong party in this Realme to
joyne with the forrain force. For otherwiſe then with ſuch
helps to be aſſuredly had from hence, I know, it was alwayes
doubted that no forrein force could prevaile againſt this
Realme, being (as it is) environed by ſea, and notably repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with more mighty and ſtronger people then any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in Chriſtendome. But with the hope of the landing of
theſe great armies and our aſſiſtance in taking part, we here
continued all this yeare paſt in aſſured hope of a full victory,
untill this laſt month. But alas and with a deadly ſorrow, we
muſt all at home and abroad, lament our ſudden fall from an
immeaſurable high joy, to an unmeaſurable deep deſpaire,

conceive that this way of reformation intended by the Popes
Holineſſe is not allowable in the ſight of God, by leaving the
ancient courſe of the Church by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which
was the exerciſe of the ſpirituall ſword, and in place thereof

againſt ſuch prognoſticated conqueſts, as in a very ſhort
time all her whole Realme and every corner were ſpeedily
furniſhed with armed people on horſebacke, and on foot, and
thoſe continually trained, exerciſed, and put into bands, in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
manner, as in no age ever was before in this Realme. Here
was no ſoaring of money to provide horſe, armour, weapon,

carriages, and victuals in every County of the Realme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>The numbers made ready in the Realme I cannot affirme of

place above twenty thouſand fighting men on horſebacke and
on foot, with field ordinance, victuals, pioners and carriages,
and all thoſe governed by the principall Noblemen of the
countries, and reduced under Captaines of knowledge.</p>
            <p>And one thing I heard of, that was very politiquely ordered
and executed at this time, as of many late yeares was not uſed;
that as the leaders and officers of the particular Bands were
men of experience in the warres: ſo to make the Bands ſtrong
and conſtant,<note place="margin">All the bands were under the principal Knights of the Realme, compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the moſt mighty men being their tenant, and ſervants.</note> choiſe was made of the principall Knights of all
countries to bring their tenants to the field, being men of
ſtrength, and landed, and of wealth: whereby all the forces ſo
compounded were of a reſolute diſpoſition to ſticke to their
Lords and Chieftaines, and the Chieftaines to truſt to their
owne tenants. And to remember one ſtrange ſpeech that I
heard ſpoken may be marvelled at, but it was avowed to me
for a truth,<note place="margin">A strange report of the wealth of a hand of ſouldiers.</note> that one gentleman in Kent had a band of 150 foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

you have been deceived with advertiſements of many, which
had no proofe to know the truth thereof, and ſo I confeſſe my

manifeſtly that for all earneſt proceeding for arming, and for

was no difference to be ſeen betwixt the Catholique and the

without reſpect of Religion, as they all appeared to be

whom heretofore you have had the names in ſuch Catalogues

upon the report of the comming out of the army to the ſeas,
ſent to the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> there to remaine reſtrained of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

would adventure their lives in defence of the queene, whom
they named their undoubted <hi>Soveraigne Lady</hi> and <hi>Queene,</hi>
againſt all forrain forces, though the ſame were ſent from the
<hi>Pope,</hi> or by his commandement: Yea divers of them did offer
that in this quarrell of invading of the Realme with ſtrangers
they would preſent their owne bodies in the foremoſt rankes
with their countrey-men againſt all ſtrangers. Whereupon I
heard alſo by a ſecret friend of mine in the Court, that it was
once in ſome towardneſſe of reſolution amongſt the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
that they ſhould have bin returned and put to their former
liberty. But the heat of the war being kindled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Kings <hi>Armado,</hi> being at that time come to the
<hi>Groigne,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> readineſſe with ſo great an
army and ſhipping in Handers, daily looked for to land in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
yea to come to London, and a generall murmur of the
people againſt all ſuch <hi>Recuſants</hi> of reputation, was the cauſe
of the ſtaying of theſe Gentlemen at <hi>Ely,</hi> notwithſtanding
their offers of their ſervice to the Queen: And ſo they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Biſhops palace there, with fruition of large walks
about the ſame, altogether without any impriſonment, other
then that they are not ſuffred to depart into the town or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;

will remaine conſtant to the obedience of the Church of

            <p>By which kind of proceedings our adverſaries here doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

privately ſpeaking with ſuch our adverſaries, as we thinke are
not maliciouſly bent to have men proſecuted to death only for
their Religion (for to ſay the truth, and as the proverbe is, not
to belye the Devill, very many of our Contraries are in that
point not uncharitable) we doe object to them the executions
by cruell torments, and deaths of very many, both here about
London, and other parts of the Realme, whom we account as

            <p>To which,<note place="margin">The Jeſuites are not executed for Religion but for treaſons.</note> theſe our adverſaries, pretending ſome ſmal drops
of charity do anſwer us, That no execution hath bin of any, to
their knowledge, for their Religion, or for profeſſion thereof;

have wandred in the Realme ſecretly, and in a diſguiſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which the adverſaries ſcornfully terme as ruffians,<note place="margin">The Seminaries for the moſt part come diſguiſed like Ruſſians.</note> with
feathers and all ornaments of light coloured apparell, like to
the faſhion of Courtiers, and doe uſe many means to entice all
people, with whom they dare adventure to ſpeake, not only to
be reconciled to the Pope, and Church of Rome, but to induce
them by vowes and oathes to renounce their obedience to the
Queene; to deny her to be their Soveraigne, and themſelves to
be diſcharged of their Allegiance; and to repute all Magiſtrates
under her to be unlawfull, and in conſcience not to be obeyed,
with many more ſuch matters (which I nevertheleſſe count to
be very vain calumniations) tending to make the facts of all
ſuch holy Prieſts as are ſent with Commiſſion to win mens

the Queen, the Lawes, and the Government, and ſtate of
the Realme, and all others that are ſo perſwaded by them, are

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63459:8"/>
all proceſſe of law extended and purſued againſt them, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
declare the ſame. Wherein theſe our adverſaries doe
ſometimes for maintenance of their arguments, ſhew the very
copies of their enditements and judgements, wherein there is
no mention made of charging them with their Religion, but
that they have attempted to perſwade the Queens ſubjects to
forſake their Allegiance, and conſequently to be rebels to their
Queen and Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>In this ſort, theſe men for their advantage, doe at all times,

though, where I and others may reply without perill to our
ſelves (as ſurely in ſome ſmall companies we may, uſing modeſt
words) we object the confeſſion of the Catholike faith by the
parties at their death, and that with great conſtancy, which
our adverſaries cannot deny,<note place="margin">Babington ſuffered for his treaſons voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed not for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though at his death he profeſſed the Romane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> ſo as it may ſeeme they dye for
their Religion; yet is it on the other part againſt us alleadged,
and maintained, that they are neither endited, condemned, nor
executed for their Religion, or for offering of themſelves to
die for their Religion, but onely for their former treaſons in
conſpiring againſt the Queen &amp; ſtate of the Realme: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then of late time <hi>Babington</hi> and all his Complices, who
were condemned for their attempt to have raiſed war in the
Realm, and to have murdered the Queen, and to have ſet up the
Q. of Scots, all which the ſaid <hi>Babington</hi> and all his complices
voluntarily confeſſed, and were condemned and executed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for thoſe their great treaſons; and yet divers of them at the
place of their execution, did in like maner (as theſe Prieſts and
Jeſuites uſe to doe) make confeſſion of their Catholike faith,
with offer to dye for the ſame; and yet (ſay our adverſaries) it
ought not to be affirmed, that <hi>Babington</hi> and his complices
were put to death for Religion, but for their treaſons.</p>
            <p>And for further maintenance of the coloured arguments
wherwith I, and others my good, faithfull, and Catholike bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are often troubled how to anſwer them, it is alleadged
that the great number of gentlemen, and gentlewomen, ye,
ſome of honourable calling, and of other meaner degrees, are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63459:9"/>
knowne manifeſtly to be of a contrary Religion to the Lawes
of the Realme,<note place="margin">A multitude of gentlemen ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be Papiſts, yet never endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their lives.</note> both near the Court and far oft, and yet they are
never purſued by any forme of Law to put their lives in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or queſtioned, or impriſoned, for their opinions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby to bring them in any danger. Onely ſuch as are
preſented or complained of by the Pariſhioners where they
dwell, for never comming to any Church by the ſpace of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
months in a whole yeare, are thereof indited, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being called to anſwer thereto, if they can ſhew no ſuch
lawfull excuſe as the Law hath provided, they are then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to pay a penalty out of their goods and lands, if they
have any, and not otherwiſe puniſhed, nor yet by inquiſition
any of them examined of their faith. But yet ſay theſe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
if they ſhew themſelves by their open deeds and facts to
be reconciled from their allegiance &amp; obedience to the queen,
and that they will therein perſiſt, then they are therwith char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and puniſhed according to the Lawes therfore provided.</p>
            <p>Theſe arguments in their defence I doe not repeate as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of them, but yet ſurely they doe move me, and ſome

there would have bin a greater increaſe of numbers perſwaded

all at the proper coſts of the Burgeſſes, for certaine moneths,
with men, victuall, and munition, which did joyne with the
Queens owne Navy all this Summer, a thing never in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

hired, waged, and victualled by the Kings of the Realm, which
argued to the griefe of me and ſome others a moſt vehement

Port Townes, ſuch as they ſhewed themſelves therin ready to

            <p>Of the number and ſtrength of the Queenes owne ſhips of

heretofore. But yet I will make you a true report of the ſtate of

becauſe I have been very ſorry to heare how you and others
have been therein abuſed: And that not only in this matter of

ſome part hath been here by very many, maliciouſly, and in
common ſpeeches imputed to your owne invention and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
whereof in a few words I will make ſome digreſſion
before I ſhall ſhew the eſtate of the Queens Navy.</p>
            <p>In this Summer paſt,<note place="margin">Two notable lyes printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and imputed to <hi>Don Bernardia Mendoza.</hi>
               </note> there was printed in <hi>Paris</hi> by your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(as it was reported) a notable untruth, which I did ſee
and reade, That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had beſieged <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and
had won it by aſſault, and poſſeſſed it quietly, whereof no part
was true, nor any cauſe to imagine the ſame, though I wiſh it
had ſo been; but not for any good will that I now beare to that
King, but for the trouble to this Queen. For in truth there is
no good for us to be hoped for from the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Scottiſh Biſhops in <hi>France</hi> have ſought to make you
beleeve otherwiſe, who is ſo rooted in the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Religion,
as there is never hope that he can be recovered to the Church
of Rome; and ſo I thinke you are of late duely informed, and
by his violent actions againſt divers Catholikes, and againſt all

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63459:10"/>

            <p>But now to leave this digreſſion, and to returne to let you
know the truth of the ſtate of the Queens Navy this Summer.<note place="margin">The ſtate of the Navy of England this Summer.</note>
The ſame was in the beginning of the yeare, when the brute
was brought of the readines of the Kings Armado in <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
and of the army by land upon the Sea-coaſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with
their ſhipping, divided into three companies; the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the charge of <hi>Charles L. Haward</hi> high Admirall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">L. <hi>Haward.</hi> L. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall.</note>
whoſe father, grandfather, uncles, great unckles, and other
of his houſe, being of the noble houſe of the Dukes of Norfolk,
had alſo been high Admirals afore him, whereof both France
and Scotland have had proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63459:10"/>
Another company were appointed to remaine with the L.
<hi>Henry Seymour</hi> ſecond ſon to the Duke of Somerſet that was
Protector in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> Hen. Seymour.</note> and brother to the Earle
of Hartford; and theſe companies for a time continued in the
narrow ſeas betwixt England and Flanders, under the charge
of the ſaid high Admirall, to attend on the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi>
actions.</p>
            <p>A third company were armed in the Weſt part of England
towards <hi>Spain</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Francis Drake</note> a man
by name, and fame known too too well to all Spam, and to the
Kings <hi>Indias,</hi> and of great reputation in England; and this
was compounded, partly of ſome of the Queens owne ſhips,
and partly of the ſhips of the Weſt parts.</p>
            <p>But after that it was certainly underſtood that the great
Navy of <hi>Spaine</hi> was ready to come out from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and that
the fame thereof was blowne abroad in Chriſtendome to be
invincible, and ſo publiſhed by books in print: The Queen and
all her Councell I am ſure (whatſoever good countenance they
made) were not a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, as looking certainly for a
dangerous fight upon the Seas, and after that for a landing and
invaſion. Whereupon the Lord Admirall was commanded to
ſaile with the greateſt ſhips to the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> towards
<hi>Spaine</hi> to joyne with <hi>Drake,</hi> whom he made Vice-Admirall,
and to continue in the Seas betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to
ſtop the landing of the Navy of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And with the Lord
Admirall went in certaine of the Queens ſhips,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>L.</hi> Tho. Haward. <hi>L.</hi> Sheffeld.</note> the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Haward</hi> ſecond ſon to the laſt Duke of Norfolke, and the
Lord <hi>Sheffeld,</hi> ſonne to the Admirals ſiſter, who is wife to the
Queenes Embaſſadour in France, with a great number of
Knights of great livelihood. And at that time the Lord <hi>Henry
Seymour</hi> was left with a good number of ſhips in the narrow
Seas, upon the coaſt of <hi>Flanders</hi> to attend on the Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe two Navies were thus divided, I confeſſe to you
that I and others of our part ſecrerly made a full account that
none of all theſe Engliſh ſhips durſt abide the ſight of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado
of <hi>Spaine;</hi> or if they would abide any ſight, yet they
ſhould all be ſunke at the firſt encounter, For ſuch conſtant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63459:11"/>
opinion we had conceived by the reports of the world, that
the greatneſſe and the number of the ſhips, and the army of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> being the choſen veſſell of all the Kings Dominions,
was ſo exceſſive monſtrous, beyond all the Navies that ever
had been ſeen in Chriſtendome (not excepting the Armado at
<hi>Lepanto</hi>) that no power could abide in their way. But how far
deceived we were therein, a very ſhort time, even the firſt day,
did manifeſtly to the great diſhonour of <hi>Spaine</hi> diſcover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
when the Catholique army came to the coaſt of <hi>England,</hi>
which indeed the Engliſh confeſſe did ſeeme far greater then
they looked for, and that they were aſtonied with the ſight of
them,<note place="margin">The fight of the Engliſh Navy with the Spaniſh.</note> yet the Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> and <hi>Drake,</hi> having but onely fifty
of the Engliſh ſhips out of the haven of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> where
the reſt remained for a new revictualling, without tarrying for
the reſt of the Navy that was in <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> they did offer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſight, and furiouſly purſued the whole Navy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above 160 ſhips: ſo as the ſame, with the furious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
ſhot of the Engliſh one whole day,<note place="margin">The flying away of the Spaniſh Navy.</note> fled without any
returning. And after, the Engliſh Navy being increaſed to an
hundred great and ſmall, renued their fight with terrible great
ſhot all the whole day, gaining alwayes the wind of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Navy. And as I am ſorry to remember the particularities,
which the Engliſh have largely written to their owne praiſe:
ſo to ſpeake all in one word, for nine dayes together they ſtill
forced them to flye, and deſtroyed, ſunke, and tooke in three
dayes fight divers of the greateſt ſhips, out of which, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
out of the principall great ſhip of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and out of
the <hi>Admiranta</hi> of <hi>Guipuſque,</hi> and thirdly out of the principall
great <hi>Galliaſſe</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> great numbers were brought (beſide
many moe killed and drowned) to <hi>London,</hi> and to ſundry other
Ports of the Realme, to the great diſhonour of <hi>Spain,</hi> amongſt
which priſoners were a great number of Captaines both for
land and ſea. And beſides that, which deeply blemiſheth the
honour of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Spaniard priſoners ſay, that Christ ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a <hi>Lutheran</hi> in this Summer voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Spaniſh Navy.</note> and vexeth me at my heart, to conſider the
inequalitie of fortune, it is vaunted by our adverſaries, that in
all the time of theſe fights ſo many dayes, the Spaniards did
never take, or ſinke any Engliſh ſhip or boat, or break any maſt,
or tooke any one man priſoner. A matter that indeed theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63459:11"/>
Spaniards which are taken doe marvell at greatly, and chafe
thereat: ſo as ſome of them in their anguiſh of mind let not
to ſay, that in all theſe fights Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe a <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though ſuch ſpeeches be unadviſed, and not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yet ſurely it is moſt manifeſt,<note place="margin">God ſhewed no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Spaniſh Navy from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the ending.</note> that in all this voyage from

other things reported to the diſhonour of the Duke of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who it is ſaid, was lodged in the bottome of his ſhip for

            </p>
            <p>And now I muſt needs thinke that you are ſtricken with
ſome griefe of minde, or rather with ſome anger towards me,
to heare from me ſo much of thoſe averſe things, although
they are too true; and therefore I alſo imagine you may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
for your better contentation, to underſtand what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
we that are here have, being thus fruſtrate of our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

comfort our ſelves with a conceit that this Action may be, by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63459:12"/>
any probabilitie, once againe renewed this next yeare, for the
recovery of our loſt hope this yeare, famouſly ſpoken of by the
number of 88. and ſo verified to the loſſe of all Catholiques.
Wherein ſurely for our owne parts,<note place="margin">I conſider him</note> as by ſecret conference I
find with many with whom I have ſecretly of late upon this
unfortunate accident conferred, we cannot judge of any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of good ſucceſſe for any long time; and if there ſhould
any be hoped for, ſurely the Sea-forces of the King Catholique
muſt of neceſſity be more increaſed, and better alſo governed
then they were this yeare. For this we here doe conſider that
this enterpriſe of invaſion and conqueſt, was alwayes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
grounded upon many probable opinions of the evill ſtate
of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> of the weakneſſe of the Engliſh Navy; for ſo you know
you were divers wayes this laſt yeare advertiſed from hence,<note place="margin">The three hopes conceived against England, are now all fruſtrated.</note>
and ſo alſo many of us here did conceive the ſame, wherein we
ſee by all this yeares ſervice with theſe ſhips, we did all nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
erre.</p>
            <p>Next,<note place="margin">2.</note> of a ſuppoſed evill contentment of a number of people
in this land to ſerve the Queene, and her Government, againſt

            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">3.</note> and moſt principally, of a great ſtrong party that
would be found here in the favour of us for the Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that ſhould take armes againſt the Queen upon the firſt
ſight of the Catholique Navy on the coaſts of England. Of all
which opinions, ſetled in good mens minds in maner of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we know that none in the world did more conſtantly
aſſure the King thereof then you; which, as the matters have
evill ſucceeded, may I feare, bring you in danger of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
although I know you meant very well therein.</p>
            <p>And as theſe three opinions have all fayled this yeare, ſo I
aſſure you, though ſome of ours on that ſide the Seas may perſiſt
in their former opinions againſt the experience lately ſeen (as
it is likely they may be forced to doe, to maintaine themſelves
in credit, for continuing their neceſſary reliefe from the Pope,
and the King, having no other meanes to keep them from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Arguments, though I am ſorry at my heart to remember them,
wherby you in your wiſdome (if you be not blinded by others)
ſhall ſee it moſt certaine, that theſe former opinions, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to be had from hence, will prove the next yeare as ſtrong
againſt us, and in ſome part more ſtrong then they proved this
yeare, if any account ſhall be made thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the Navy of England, which hath this yeare to the
ſight of the world proved to be of great force and value for
thoſe Seas, and able to overmatch in their manner of ſight, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their number of the great <hi>Gallions, Carikes, Galliaſſes,</hi> or
<hi>Gallies,</hi> it is certaine that it will be greatly increaſed this next
yeare: For I know that within theſe few dayes, bargaines are
already made,<note place="margin">The Engliſh Navy will be ſtronger the next yeare.</note> and Impreſt of money delivered, and certaine
ſent into the <hi>Eaſtlands,</hi> for great ſtore of all maritine proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And as for the increaſe of the number of good ſhips for the
Queens proper uſe, there is already a great quantity of timber
ready, and order given to fell more in November and Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

be doubted that this Realme, this next yeare, will be double as

            <p>As to the ſecond branch of our hope,<note place="margin">Arguments to prove no miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the people toward the Queen.</note> depending upon opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ſome great miſcontentment of ſundry perſons againſt
the Queene, the proofe of the contrary ſo appeared this yeare,
both of her actions to maintain the liking of all her people, and
of the generall earneſt devotion ſhewed to her by all eſtates,
noble and meane, rich and poore, as I thinke no Prince chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ever had greater cauſe of comfort in her people, which I
may judge to breed a pride in her. And to recompence the
ſame, ſhe did moſt notably ſhew her ſelfe in this time, even
when moſt danger was threatened, in all her actions towards
her people, as carefull for their weale, and for the ſafety of her
Realme, without any ſpeciall or particular proviſion, or regard
to her owne perſon, as ever any Prince could doe. Firſt, to let
her people underſtand what care ſhe had to make her Realme

               </gap>aſion,<note place="margin">The providence of the Queene to make her Realme ſtrong.</note> ſhe politikely, yea moſt carefully, by
her owne frequent directions, cauſed her whole Realme to be
put in armes, ſhe tooke account thereof her ſelfe by monethly
certificate from ſuch as were made her Lievtenants in every
ſhire of her Realme; ſhe cauſed armour, pouder, weapon, to be
ſent to all countries, and ordnance to all maritine countries:
There were alſo ſundry armies deſcribed, to defend every coaſt
of the Sea; and as I heard it reported by ſome that did know
the ſecrets of the Court, was importunate with her Councell
to leave no day unoccupied, to bring theſe ſervices to effect,
and yet ſhe did ſtill continue her Commiſſioners in the Low
Countries to treat of peace, which ſurely ſhe deſired to have
obtained, ſo that ſhe might have had the ſame with certaine
conditions. So as to content her people, ſhe did both treat and
deſire peace, and did not in the meane time neglect to make
her Realme ſtrong for defence, if peace could not be gotten.
But in the end, when her demands were wholly refuſed
(whereof we and all Catholiques were moſt glad) and that
ſhe underſtood very certainly, that the army of the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> ſhould come firſt to deſtroy the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhe
revoked her Commiſſioners, approached <hi>London</hi> in perſon,
and did lie (as it were) in the Suburbs of the ſame: whereby
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63459:13"/>
they of the City took great comfort, having daily in ſhew and
muſter of their owne ten thouſand men armed, and trained of
very able men of the City, and in readineſſe thirty thouſand
more able to fight.</p>
            <p>She cauſed alſo an army to be brought to incamp neare the
Sea ſide,<note place="margin">The Queene being in the army in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex when moſt danger was threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in landing.</note> upon the river of <hi>Thames,</hi> betwixt the Sea and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
20 miles beneath the City; and after the army was come
thither, ſhe would not by any adviſe be ſtayed, but for comfort
of her people, and to ſhew her owne magnanimity of heart (as
ſhe ſaid, ſhe would ſo doe though ſhe was a woman) ſhe went
to that army lying betwixt the City and the Sea) under the
charge of the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> placing her ſelfe betwixt the
enemy and her City, and there viewed her army, and paſſed
through it divers times, lodged in the borders of it, returned
againe, and dined in the army: And firſt, ſaw the people as they
were, by their countries, lodged and quartered in their ſeverall
camps, which ſhe viewed from place to place. Afterward,
when they were all reduced into battels, ready (as it were) to
fight with any enemy, ſhe rode round about them, and did
view them curiouſly, being accompanied onely but with the
Generall, and three or foure others attending on her: But yet
to ſhew her ſtate, I well marked it, ſhe had the ſword carried
before her by the Earle of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There ſhe was generally ſaluted with cries, with ſhouts,
with all tokens of love, of obedience, of readineſſe and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to fight for her,<note place="margin">The nottable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Queene for her preſence in the camp.</note> as ſeldome hath been ſeen in a camp and
army, conſidering ſhe was a Queene, and all tended to ſhew a
marvellous concord, in a mutuall love betwixt a Queene and
her ſubjects; and of reverence, and obedience of ſubjects to a
Soveraign: All which ſhe acquited with very princely thanks,
and good ſpeeches. I could inlarge this deſcription with many
moe particularities of mine owne ſight, for thither I went, as
many others did; and all that day, wandring from place to
place, I never heard any word ſpoken of her, but in praiſing her
for her ſtately perſon, and princely behaviour; and in praying
for her life and ſafety, and curſing of all her enemies, both trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and all Papiſts, with earneſt deſire to venture their lives
for her ſafety.</p>

in very tunable manner, divers Pſalmes put into forme of
Prayers in praiſe of Almighty God, no wayes to be miſliked,
which ſhe greatly commended, and with very earneſt ſpeech
thanked God with them. This that I write, you may be ſure, I
doe not with any comfort but to give you theſe manifeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that neither this Queene doth diſcontent her people,
nor her people doe ſhew any diſcontentation in any thing that
they be commanded to doe for her ſervice, as heretofore hath
been imagined.<note place="margin">An army provided for the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the army ready to withstand the landing of the enemy.</note> She had alſo an army of about forty thouſand
footmen, and of ſix thouſand horſemen, under the charge of the
Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Lord Chamberlain, as Lievtenant of that army,
made ready from the Inland parts of the Realme, to be about
her owne perſon, without diſarming the maritine counties:
ſo as many marched out of ſundry countries towards her, at
the very time that ſhe was in the camp; ſome came to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
and townes neare <hi>London,</hi> whom ſhe remaunded to their
countries, becauſe their harveſt was at hand, and many of them
would not be countermanded, but ſtill approached onward on
their owne charges (as they ſaid) to ſee her perſon, and to fight
with them that boaſted to conquer the Realme. But though
the greateſt number of the ſaid ſouldiers were compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
yet the Captains, Leaders, and the principall Knights and
Gentlemen came to the Court to offer their ſervice, and thoſe
were graciouſly accepted of her with many thanks, and are
now for the more part returned with a full determination and
firme promiſe, to continue their Bands in ſuch readineſſe, as
upon a few houres warning they will aſſuredly returne with
them in good array.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe foreſaid arguments, to diſprove the opinion of
diſcontentment of the people, which heretofore hath been
thought a great furtherance to this honourable action, I will
alſo remember you ſome other more notable actions, to prove
both contentation and readineſſe, in all the Nobilitie of the
Realme at this time, that were not tyed to abide in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
by reaſon of their offices, as Lieutenants and Governours
there for martiall ſervices I or as ſoone as it was heard that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63459:14"/>
Queene was come neare London,<note place="margin">Great power of horſmen brought by the Nobility to attend on the Queens perſon.</note> and that the armies were in
gathering to come out of the countries, for defence of all Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and reports brought from the ſea coaſts of the appearance
of the Spaniſh Navy; all the Noblemen in the Realme, from
Eaſt and Weſt, from North and South, excepting onely ſuch
great Lords as had ſpeciall Governments in countries, that
might not lawfully be abſent from their charge, and ſome few
that were not able to make forces according to their deſire,
came to the Queene, bringing with them according to their
degrees, and to the uttermoſt of their powers, goodly bands of
horſemen, both launces, light horſemen, and ſuch other as are
termed <hi>Carabins</hi> or <hi>Argeletiers,</hi> lodging their bands round
about <hi>London,</hi> and maintaining them in pay at their own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
all the time, untill the Navy of <hi>Spain</hi> was certainly known
to be paſſed beyond <hi>Scotland.</hi> And of theſe Noblemen many
ſhewed their bands of their horſemen, before the Queene even
in the fields afore her own gate, to the great marvell of men of
good judgement (as I heard reported) for that the number of
them was ſo great, and ſo well armed and horſed, as knowing
that they were no parcell of the numbers of horſemen limited
in every countrey, and put into bands with the armies deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
it was thought before they were ſeen, that there had not
been ſo many ſpare horſes of ſuch valour in the whole Realm,
excepting the North part of <hi>England</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe
forces conſiſt chiefly of horſemen.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhewed his bands to the Queen,<note place="margin">The Viſcount <hi>Mountagues</hi> ſhow of horſemen was the firſt.</note> was that noble,
vertuous, honorable man, the Viſcount <hi>Mountague,</hi> who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
men doe judge of him for opinion in Religion, yet to
tell you the truth, he is reported alwayes to have profeſſed, as
now alſo at this time he did profeſſe and proteſt ſolemnly, both
to the Queen, and to all her Court, in open aſſemblies, that he
now came, though he was very ſickly, and in age, with a full
reſolution to live and dye in defence of the Queene, and of his
countrey, againſt all invaders, whether it were Pope, King or
Potentate whatſoever, and in that quarrell he would hazard
his life, his children, his lands &amp; goods: And to ſhew his mind
agreeable therto, he came perſonally himſelf before the Queen,
with his band of horſemen being almoſt two hundred: the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63459:15"/>
ſame being led by his own ſons, and with them a young childe
very comely ſeated on horſ-back, being the heire of his houſe,
that is, the eldeſt ſon to his ſon and heir: a matter much noted
of many, whom I heard to commend the ſame, to ſee a grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
father and ſon, at one time on horſ-back afore a Queen
for her ſervice, though in truth I was ſorry to ſee our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſo greatly pleaſed therwith. But I cannot conceale it from
your Lordſhips knowledge, becauſe I think this Nobleman is
known unto you, having bin uſed as an Embaſſadour to the
King Catholik many years paſt by this Queen (as I have heard)
to require confirmation of the treaties of amity, betwixt both
their Fathers. And of this Noblemans conditions, I thinke
there be ſome others, of whom there is no account to be made
that they will give favour to any attempt againſt the Queen, or
to any invaſion of the Realme.</p>

which by theſe former relations appeare could nor be poſſible,
the whole Nobility being aſſured to the Queen, and the force

So by this you may ſee what account may be made of any

               <note place="margin">The third and laſt hope which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes had of a party in the realme, was all fruſtrate.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As to the laſt point of the three foundations of the principall
hope conceived, wherupon the invaſion was chiefly grounded
and taken in hand, which was moſt certainly and generally
beleeved, that there ſhould be found here in the realm a ſtrong
party of Catholiques, againſt the Queen to joyne and aſſiſt the
invaders, upon the appearing of the Spaniſh Navy. By my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
relations of the generall great and fervent love of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
towards the Queene, and of the great offers of ſervice now
made by the whole Nobility of the Realme, this their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may appeare to have been wrong laid, onely by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as it were upon a quick-ſand, or rather as flying in the
ayre.<note place="margin">The Spaniſh priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners condemne the Kings purpoſe, as being abuſed by the exiled Catholiques, whom the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards call traitors to their countrey.</note> And yet it appeareth very truly that no ſmall account
was made hereof by the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by his principall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
for there is nothing at this preſent more univerſally, with
one lamentable voyce ſpoken of, by all the multitude of the
Spaniards, now here priſoners; yea by the chiefeſt of them, then
that they now evidently ſee, that the King their Maſter was
with ſuch informations greatly abuſed, yea rather betrayed. For
they ſay there was no man of value in all this army, but he
heard it conſtantly affirmed, and ſo delivered for comfort of all
that ſerved therein, before they were ſhipped, that they ſhould
not be afraid of any reſiſtance to land in <hi>England,</hi> for tha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
there was good aſſurance given to the King, that they ſhould
finde a ſtrong army of Catholiques ready in their favour,
as ſoon as ever their Navy ſhould be ſeen upon the Sea-coaſt,<note place="margin">No poſſibility to invade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a Realme, without favour of a party inward.</note>
and ſo they all here ſay, they were encouraged to come to this

all reaſon, to invade a Realme, with opinion to conquer
it, without both ſome title of right, and a party alſo; but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
without a good ſure party.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63459:18"/>
And therefore now finding this report very falſe, many of
theſe priſoners do by name curſe you, as being the Kings Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour;
as him,<note place="margin">The Spaniſh priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners condemne the enterpriſe &amp; courſe of <hi>Don Bernardin</hi> of <hi>Mendoza.</hi>
               </note> they ſay, who upon the opinion of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which you had gotten in <hi>England,</hi> was therein more
credited then any other, and had theſe many yeares together
tempted the King their Maſter, upon hope, and other ſuch like
perſwaſions, to attempt ſuch a matter as this was, being utterly
in all wiſedome to have been condemned, without ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of this latter part, ſpecially to have had a ſtrong party
here. They alſo curſe all ſuch Engliſh-men as have ſled out of
this countrey, whom they ſpare not to call arrant traitors, for
offering the ſale of their countrey to the Pope and the King of
<hi>Spaine.</hi> And theſe priſoners adde alſo, that they were borne in
hand, that this countrey was ſo open to march in, and ſo weak
to withſtand any force, and the people ſo miſerable, as they
thought the conqueſt thereof had been of no more difficulty
then the overcomming of a number of naked <hi>Indians</hi> was at
the beginning of the conqueſt thereof by King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for ſtrength of this countrey and people, many of
theſe priſoners having bin brought from the Sea-coaſts hither
to <hi>London,</hi> whereby they have obſerved the countrey and the
people, doe ſpeak marvellouſly thereof, counting the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
otherwiſe then by treaſon of ſome great party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realme. But whether all theſe ſpeeches which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reported of them proceed from their hearts, or that
they ſpeake thus to pleaſe the Engliſh, becauſe they are well
uſed by them, who alſo are eaſily deceived with flattery, I
know not; but ſure I am they doe thus ſpeake daily, without<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew of great paſſions againſt ſuch as have been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

               </note> although of him they confeſſe he

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63459:18"/>
any numbers of men, but by the Queenes authority when
they were at their beſt: As the priſoners wonder how the king
could be ſo deceived to give them penſions, otherwiſe then for

ſo (by entituling of himſelf) to be a <hi>Duke,</hi> a <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> and an
Earle of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſo was a long time entertained, as a man
that could doe great ſervice againſt the Q. of England, untill at
length the King underſtood his falſhood, and ſo baniſhed him
out of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and repairing to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was by the Pope alſo
maintained for a time, untill he was diſcovered even by ſome
good Catholiques, that could not endure the Popes holineſſe
to be ſo groſſely mocked; of whom ſome of the priſoners uſing
merry ſpeeches, how both the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> and afterward
this King &amp; the Pope, were ſo notably deceived by this <hi>Stuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
doe conclude meerly, that they think ſome of theſe Engliſh
that have thus abuſed the King, have followed <hi>Stukelyes</hi> ſteps.
And in very truth, I and many others have bin very often aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to heare ſo broad ſpeeches of the King and the Pope, yea
of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> whom ſuch a companion as <hi>Stukeley</hi>
was, could ſo notably deceive; and the more to be marvelled it
was, how he could deceive the King Catholique, conſidering
he was known to many of his Councell, at the Kings being in
<hi>England,</hi> to have bin but a vaunting beggar, and a Ruffian, and
afterwards a pyrat againſt the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord Embaſſadour,<note place="margin">A concluſion by the writer, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade another courſe, not by violence.</note> by theſe my large relations of

mortall) for both the univerſalitie of the people through the
Realme, are ſo firmely and deſperately bent againſt our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as nothing can prevaile againſt their united forces. And
whoſoever ſhall by right ſucceed to this Crowne after the
Queen (who is likely to live as long as any King in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)

Realme deſcended both of the Royall houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter.</hi>
There is no account to be made, but every one of them
that now live at this day, are knowne to be as vehemently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to withſtand the authority of the Pope, as any of the

after all circumſtances well conſidered, for the preſent I

God, and to all the Saints in heaven, with our continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and in earth to the holy Counſels of the Pope, and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
with our ſupplications to relieve the afflicted number

others that are not rooted in hereſie.</p>
            <p>And for relief of ſuch has are forced to pay yearly great ſums

to the Church,<note place="margin">A tolleration from the Pope for the Recaſants in England</note> it were to be charitably conſidered, whether
there might not be ſome diſpenſation from the Popes holines,
for ſome few yeares, to tolerate their comming to the Church
without changing of their faith, conſidering a great number
doe ſtand therein, not for any thing (as they ſay) uſed in this
Church, that is directly contrary to Gods Law; but for that
the Rites and prayers (though they are collected out of the
body of the Scripture) are not allowed by the Catholique
Church, and the head thereof, which is the Popes Holineſſe:
And for that cauſe laſtly, all true Catholiques account this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63459:19"/>
Church to be ſchiſmaticall. By which remedy of tolleration, a
great number of ſuch as will be perpetually Catholiques,
might enjoy their livings and liberty, and in proceſſe of time
the Catholique Religion (by Gods goodneſſe) might with
more ſurety be increaſed, to the honour of God, then ever it
can be by any force whatſoever. For ſo did all Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at the firſt begin, and ſpread it ſelfe over the world; not
by force, but only by teaching, and example of holineſſe in the

            <p>About the ſeventh of Auguſt, the L. Admirall returned with
the Navy, having followed the Spaniſh Navy (as they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
as far as the 55 degree Northwards; the Spaniſh Navy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a courſe either to the furtheſt parts of <hi>Norwey,</hi> or to the
<hi>Orcades</hi> beyond <hi>Scotland;</hi> which if they did, then it was here

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63459:20"/>
they could recover proviſions of maſts, whereof the Engliſh
Navy had made great ſpoyle, they might returne. But I for my

conſidering I deſpaired of their return for many reſpects,
both of their wants, which could not be furniſhed in <hi>Norwey,</hi>
and of the lacke of the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> ability to bring his
army on the Sea for want of mariners. Nevertheleſſe, upon

either towards <hi>England,</hi> which was moſt unlikely, or toward

dayes after this, ſuddenly there came report to the Court, that
the Spaniſh Navy had refreſhed it ſelfe in the Iſlands beyond
the <hi>Orcades,</hi> both with water plentifully, and with bread, fiſh
and fleſh, as for their money they could get, and would returne
hither once againe, to attend on the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> army, to
conduct it by Sea into <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon grew ſome new
buſines here, wherewith I know the Queen and her Councell
was not a little perplexed what to doe; but in the end, order
was given to ſtay the diſarming of her Navy, and ſo the whole
Navy was very ſpeedily made ready againe, only upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reports: wherewith I and many others were very glad, to
ſee them thus newly troubled, and upon every light report put
to great charges. But this laſted not paſt eight or ten dayes, for
upon more certain knowledge by two or three Pinnaces, that
were ſent to diſcover where the Spaniſh fleet was, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
that they were beyond the <hi>Orcades,</hi> ſayling towards the
Weſt, in very evill caſe, having many of their people dead in
thoſe North parts, and in great diſtreſſe for lacke of maſts, and
alſo of mariners. A new commandement was given to diſſolve
the Navy, ſaving that which ſhould attend on the Duke of

had in a ſort quartered <hi>England</hi> among themſelves, and had

graven with markes, to be heated for the marking of all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

might be knowne hereafter to have been the children of the

that came from the Engliſh Navy, as having heard the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
confeſſe the ſame: ſo as for a time there was a generall
murmure, that thoſe Spaniſh priſoners ought not to be ſuffered
to live, as they did, but to be killed, as they had purpoſed to
have done the Engliſh. But the wiſer ſort of men, and ſuch as
had the charge of the priſoners, having no commandement
from the Councell, did ſtraitly looke to the ſafety of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as a matter not to be ſo raſhly ſuffered. But to content the
people with ſome other matter, there was upon Sunday laſt, at
the requeſt of the Major and his brethren, a great number of
Banners,<note place="margin">Banners, Streamers and Enſignes of the Spaniards ſhewed to the people.</note> Streamers, and Enſignes, which were won from the

rage of the people was greatly aſſwaged, the fury generally
converted into triumph, by boaſting in every place, that this
was the act of God, who had heard the fervent prayers of the
people, and was pleaſed with their former prayers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings;
to have ſuch Banners and Streamers, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
meant to have brought and ſet up in all places of the City,
as monuments of their triumphs, by his good providence in
