            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DEDICATION TO FORTUNE.</head>
            <p>I Dedicate this Book to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for I believe she is a powerfull Princess; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she favours, the World admires, whether it be worthy of admiration, or no; and whatsoever she frowns on, the World runns from, as from a Plaguy Infection, and not only shunns, but exclaims against it, although it be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue herself; and that which is most to be lamented, is, that the strictest Votresses to Virtue turn Reprobates, become Infidels, and with false and superstious Devotion worship the Golden Fortune; and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, which are the Priests, offer false Praises thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50040:3"/>
Wherefore if Fortune please, with her helping hand, she may place my Book in Fames high Tow'r, where every Word, like a Cymball, shall make a Tinkling Noise; and the whole Volume, like a Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, shall Eccho from Side to Side of Fames large Brasen Walls, and make so loud a Report, that all the World shall hear it.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>But if not favour'd, then my Book must dye,</l>
               <l>And in the Grave of Dark Oblivion lye:</l>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Reason why I have not dedicated any of my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Books to your Lordship, is, that when I have writ all I mean to print, I intend, if I live, to Dedicate the whole summe of my Works unto you, and not by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: for indeed you are my Wits Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; not that I lay the Defects, that may be found, to your charge, for upon my Conscience all the Faults are mine own; but if there be any Wit, or any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Commendations, they are the Crumms I gathered from your Discourse, which hath fed my Fancy; and though I do not write the same way you write, yet it is like Nature which works upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal matter, mixing, cutting, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it out into several Forms and Figures; for had not Nature Matter to work upon, She would become Useless; so that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter makes Nature work, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes not Eternal Matter. Thus she
<pb facs="tcp:50040:4"/>
is but as a labouring servant; and as in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Matter there lives Spirit and Motion, which is Life and Knowledge, so in your Discourse lives Sense and Reason, in your Wit, Delight and Pleasure; in your Mind, Honor and Honesty; in your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Valour and Prudence; in your Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Generosity and Humility; in your Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, Patience and Magnanimity; in your Friendship, Truth and Constancy; to your King and Country, Fidelity and Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; to your Neighbours, Affability and Kindness; to your Enemies, Pardon and Pitty.</p>
            <p>But, My Lord, I must do as the Painter did, which was to draw <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in that posture, as he stood to view his Daughter offerr'd as a Sacrifice; who when he came to Pencil out his Countenance wherein Sorrow sate so lively, he was forced to draw a Veil over his Face, his Grief being too great for his Art to imitate: So I, when I come to describe your worth by my Pen I find your Merit so far beyond all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that I am forced to leave off Writing, only subscribing my self, as I am,</p>

            <head>An Epistle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THIS Book, most of it was written five years since, and was lockt up in a Trunk as if it had been buried in a Grave, but, when I came out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I gave it a Resurruction; and after a view, I judged it not so well done but that a little more care might have placed the words so, as the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage might have run smoother, which would have given the Sense a greater Lustre; but I being of a lazy disposition, did choose to let it go into the World with its Defects, rather than take the pains to refine it; besides, to me it seemed as if I had built a House, and not liking the Form after it was built, must be forced to take it in pieces and rebuild it again, to make it of that fashion I would have it, or be contented as it was; which considering with my self, I found it would be as great a charge of Time and Pains, as if I should build a New one on an other Ground; besides, there is more Pleasure and Delight in making than in mending; and I verily believe my Neighbours, which are my Readers, would have found fault with it if I had done it as I could, and they could but dispraise it as it is; but I am so well armed with carclesness, that their several Censures can never enter to vex me with Wounds of Discontent; Howsoever, I have my delight in Writing and having it printed; and if any take a Delight to read it, I will not thank them for it; for if any thing please therein, they are to thank me for so much pleasure; and if it be naught, I had rather they had left it unread: But those that do not like my Book, which is my House, I pray them to pass by, for I have not any entertainment fit for their Palats.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT cannot be expected I should write so wisely or wittily as Men, being of the Effeminate Sex, whose Brains Nature hath mix'd with the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and softest Elements; and to give my Reason why we cannot be so wise as Men, I take leave and ask Pardon of my own Sex, and present my Reasons to the Judgement of Truth; but I believe all of my own Sex will be against me out of partiality to themselves, and all Men will seem to be against me, out of a Complement to Women, or at least for quiet and ease sake, who know Womens Tongues are like Stings of Bees; and what man would endure our effeminate Monarchy to swarm about their ears? for certainly he would be stung to death; so I shall be condemned of all sides, but Truth, who helps to defend me. True it is, our Sex make great complaints, that men from their first Creation usurped a Supremacy to themselves, although we were made equal by Nature, which Tyrannical Goverment they have kept ever since, so that we could never come to be free, but rather more and more enslaved, using us either like Children, Fools, or Subjects, that is, to flatter or threaten us, to allure or force us to obey, and will not let us divide the World equally with them, as to Govern and Command, to direct and Dispose as they do; which Slavery hath so dejected our spirits, as we are become so stupid, that Beasts are but a Degree below us, and Men use us but a Degree above Beasts; whereas in Nature we have as clear an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Men, if we were bredin Schools to mature our Brains, and to manure our Understandings, that we might bring forth the Fruits of Knowledge. But to speak truth, Men have great Reason not to let us in to their Governments, for there is great difference betwixt the Masculine Brain and the Feminine, the Masculine Strength and the Feminine; For could we choose out of the World two of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Brain and strongest Body of each Sex, there would be great difference in the Understanding and Strength; for Nature hath made Mans Body more able to endure Labour, and Mans Brain more clear to understand and contrive than Womans; and as great a difference there is between them, as there is between the longest and strongest Willow, compared to the strongest an largest Oak; though they are both Trees, yet the Willow is but a yielding Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not fit nor proper to build Houses and Ships, as the Oak, whose strength can grapple with the greatest Winds, and plough the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in the Deep; it is true, the Willows may make fine Arbours and Bowers, winding and twisting its wreathy stalks about, to make a Shadow to eclips the Light; or as a light Shield to keep off the sharp Arrows of the Sun, which cannot wound deep, because they fly far before they touch the Earth; or Men and Women may be compared to the Black-Birds, where the Hen can never sing
<pb facs="tcp:50040:6"/>
with so strong and loud a Voice, nor so clear and perfect Notes as the Cock; her Breast is not made with that strength to strain so high; even so Women can never have so strong Judgment nor clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding nor so perfect Rhetorick, to speak Orations with that Eloquence, as to Perswade so Forcibly, to Command so Powerfully, to Entice so Subtilly, and to Insinuate so Gently and Softly into the Souls of men; Or they may be compared to the Sun and Moon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the discription in the Holy Writ, which saith, <hi>God made two great Lights, the one to Rule the Day, the other the Night.</hi> So Man is made to Govern Common Wealths, and Women their privat Families. And we find by experience, that the Sun is more Dry, Hot, Active, and Powerfull every way than the Moon; besides, the Sun is of a more strong and ruddier Complexion than the Moon; for we find she is Pale and Wan, Cold, Moist and Slow in all her operations; and if it be as philosophers hold, that the Moon hath no Light but what it borrows from the Sun, so Women have no strength nor light of Understanding, but what is given them from Men; this is the Reason why we are not Mathematicians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians, Logicians, Geometricians, Cosmographers, and the like; This is the Reason we are not Witty Poets, Eloquent Orators, Subtill Schoolmen, Substracting Chimists, Rare Musicians, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Limners; This is the reason we are not Navigators, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectures, Exact Surveyers, Inventive Artizans; This is the reason why we are not Skilfull Souldiers, Politick Statists, Dispatchfull Secretaries, or Conquering Caeasars; but our Governments would be weak, had we not Masculine spirits and Counsellors to advise us; and for our Strength, we should make but feeble Mariners to tugg and pull up great Ropes and weighty Sayls in blustring Storms, if there were no other Pilots that the Effeminate Sex; neither would there be such Commerce of Nations as there, is, nor would there be so much Gold and Silver and other Mineralls fetcht out of the Bowells of the Earth if there were none but Effeminate hands to use the Pick-axe and Spade; nor so many Cities built, if there were none but Women Labourers to cut out great Quarrs of Stone, to hew down great timber Trees, and to draw up such Materials and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thereunto belonging; neither would there be such Barrs of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, if none but Women were to Melt and Hammer them out, whose weak spirits would suffocate and so faint with the heat, and their small Arms would sooner break than lift up such a weight, and beat out a Life, in striving to beat out a Wedge; neither would there be such Steeples and Pyramids, as there have been in this World, if there were no other than our tender Feet to climb, nor could our Brains endure the height, we should soon grow Dissy and fall; down drunk with too much thin Air; neither have Women such hard Chests and strong Lungs to keep in so much Breath, to dive to the bottome of the Sea, to fetch up the Treasures that lie in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Womb; neither can Women bring the furious and wild Horse to the Bit, quenching his fiery Courage, and bridling his strong swift Speed. This is the reason we are not so active in Exercise,
<pb facs="tcp:50040:6"/>
nor able to endure Hard Labour, nor far Travells, nor to bear Weighty Burthens, to run long Jornies, and many the like Actions which we by Nature are not made fit for: It is true, Education and Custom may adde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to harden us, yet never make us so strong as the strongest of Men, whose Sinnews are tuffer, and Bones stronger, and Joints closer, and Flesh firmer, than ours are, as all Ages have shewn, and Times have produced. What Woman was ever so strong as <hi>Sampson,</hi> or so swift as <hi>Hazael?</hi> neither have Women such tempered Brains as men, such high Imaginations, such subtill Conceptions, such fine Inventions, such solid Reasons, and such sound Judgement, such prudent Forecast, such constant Resolutions, such quick, sharp, and ready flowing Wits; what Women ever made such Laws as <hi>Moses, Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Solon,</hi> did? what Woman was ever so wise as <hi>Salomon,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle?</hi> so politick as <hi>Achitophel?</hi> so Eloquent as <hi>Tully?</hi> so demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative as <hi>Euclid?</hi> so inventive as <hi>Seth,</hi> or <hi>Archimedes?</hi> It was not a Woman that found out the Card, and Needle, and the use of the Loadstone; it was not a Woman that invented Perspective-Glasses to peirce into the Moon; it was not a Woman that found out the invention of writing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Art of Printing; it was not a Woman that found out the invention of Gunpowder, and the art of Gunns. What Women were such Soldiers as <hi>Hannibal, Caesar, Tamberlain, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg?</hi> what woman was such a Chymist as <hi>Paracelsus?</hi> such a Physician as <hi>Hipocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen?</hi> suth a Poet as <hi>Homer?</hi> such a Painter as <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les?</hi> such a carver as <hi>Pigmalion?</hi> such an Architect as <hi>Vitruviuss?</hi> such a Musician as <hi>Orpheus?</hi> What Women ever found out the <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in imagination, before they were found out by Navigation, as a Bishop did? or what ever did we do but like Apes, by Imitation? wherefore Women can have no excuse, or complaints of being subjects, as a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from thinking; for Thoughts are free, those can never be inslaved, for we are not hindred from studying, since we are allowed so much idle time that we know not how to pass it away, but may as well read in our Closets, as Men in their Colleges; and Contemplation is as free to us as to Men to beget clear Speculation; Besides, most Scholars marry, and their heads are so full of their School Lectures, that they preach them over to their Wives when they come home, so that they know as well what was spoke, as if they had been there; and though most of our Sex are bred up to the Needle and Spindle, yet some are bred in the publike Theatres of the World; wherefore if Nature had made our Brains of the same temper as Mens, we should have had as clear Speculation, and had been as Ingenious and Inventive as Men: but we find She hath not, by the effects. And thus we may see by the weakness of our Actions, the Constitution of our Bodies; and by our Knowledge, the temper of our Brains; by our unsettled Resolutions, incoustant to our Promises, the Perverseness of our Wills; by our facil Natures, violent in our Passions, superstitious in our Devotions, you may know our Humours; we have more Wit than Judgment, more Active than Industrious, we have more Courage than Conduct, more Will than Strength, more Curiosity than Secrecy, more Vanity than good Houswifery, more Complaints than Pains, more Jealousie than Love, more Tears than Sorrow, more Stupidity than Patience, more Pride than Affability, more Beauty than Constancy, more Ill Nature than Good; Besides, the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:50040:7"/>
and libertie of Conversation which Men have, is both unfit and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to our Sex, knowing, that we may bear and bring forth Branches from a wrong Stock, by which every man would come to lose the property of their own Children; but Nature, out of love to the Generation of Men, hath made Women to be governed by Men, giving them Strength to rule, and Power to use their Authority.</p>
            <p>And though it seem to be natural, that generally all Women are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Men, both in Body and Under standing, and that the wisest Woman is not so wise as the wisest of Men, wherefore not so fit to Rule; yet some are far wiser than some men; like Earth; for some Ground, though it be Barren by Nature, yet, being well mucked and well manured, may bear plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Crops, and sprout forth divers sorts of Flowers, when the fertiller and richer Ground shall grow rank and corrupt, bringing nothing but gross and stinking Weeds, for want of Tillage; So Women by Education may come to be far more knowing and learned, than some Rustick and Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bredmen. Besides, it is to be observed, that Nature hath Degrees in all her Mixtures and Temperaments, not only to her servile works, but in one and the same Matter and Form of Creatures, throughout all her Creations. Again, it is to be observed, that although Nature hath not made Women so strong of Body, and so clear of understanding, as the ablest of Men, yet she hath made them fairer, softer, slenderer, and more delicate than they, separating as it were the finer parts from the grosser, which seems as if Nature had made Women as purer white Manchet, for her own Table, and Palat, where Men are like coarse houshold Bread which the servants feed on; and if she hath not tempered Womens Brains to that height of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor hath put in such strong Species of Imaginations, yet she hath mixed them with Sugar of sweet conceits; and if she hath not planted in their Dispositions such firm Resolutions, yet she hath sowed gentle and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Obedience; and though she hath not filled the mind with such Heroick Gallantry, yet she hath laid in tender Affections, as Love, Piety, Charity, Clemency, Patience, Humility, and the like; which makes them neerest to resemble Angells, which are the perfectest of all her Works; where men by their Ambitions, Extortion, Fury, and Cruelty, resemble the Devill; But some women are like Devills too, when they are possest with those Evills; and the best of men by their Heroick Magnanimous Minds, by their Ingenious and Inventive Wits, by their strong Judgments, by their prudent forecast, and wise Mannagements, are like to Gods.</p>

            <p>I Desire those that read any of this Book, that every Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be read clearly, without long stops and staies; for it is with Writers as it is with men; for an ill affected Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion or Garb, takes away the Natural and gracefull Form of the Person; So Writings if they be read lamely, or crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and not evenly, smoothly, &amp; throughly, insnarle the Sense; Nay the very sound of the Voice will seem to alter the sense of the Theme; though the Sense will be there in despight of the ill Voice or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but it will be concealed, or discovered to its disadvantage; for like an ill Musician, or indeed one that cannot play at all, who instead of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he puts the Fiddle out of tune, and causeth a Discord, which if well plaid upon would sound Harmoniously; or is like one that can play but one Tune on all sorts of Instruments; so some will read with one Tone or Sound of Voice, though the Passions and Numbers are different; and some again in reading wind up their Voices to such a passionate scrue, that they whine or squeal rather than speak or read; others, fold up their Voices with that distinction, that they make that three square that is four square, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that should be broad, and high that should be low, and low that should be high; and some again so fast, that the Sense is lost in the Race: So that Writings, though they are not so, yet they sound good or bad Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Readers, and not according to their Authors; and indeed such advantage a good or ill Readers gives, as those that read well, shall give a grace to a foolish Author, and those that read ill, disgrace a wise and a witty Author. But there are two sorts of Readers, the one that reads to himself and for his own benefit, the other to benefit another by hearing it; in the first, there is required a good Judgement, and a ready Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; in the other, a good Voice, and a gracefull Delivery; so that a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath a double desire, the one that he may write well, the other, that he may be read well; And my desire is the more earnest, because I know my Writings are not strong enough to bear an ill Reader; wherefore I intreat so much favour, as to give it its own Countenance, wherein you will oblige the Writer to be</p>

                  <head>What the desire of Fame proceedes from.</head>
                  <p>THE desire of Fame proceedes from a doubt of an after being; And Fame is a report that travells far, and many times lives long, and the older it groweth, the more it florishes, and is the more particularly a mans own, then the Child of his loines; for Fame is a child of his merit, which hath no compartner in it, and many times the child of his loines deceives the parent, and instead of keeping his fathers fame, brings him an infamy: as being a coward, a traitor, a lier, a fool, or the like: which the world will judge, being apt to cast aspersions, that they were qualities which he had by inheritance from his father; but actions that his merits beget, will never deceive him, when it is rightly and honorably gotten: but there be bastard fames as well as bastard Issues, which men of honour will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver own. But all those that are born are not so fruitfull as to have issues of their brain, or so fortunate as to overcome their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or so rich to build Towers and Castles, or monuments of fame, or so happy to have such advantages, to shew their own worth and abilities; And those that cannot leave a child of fame, must content themselves to live a life of quiet, for fame is seldome gotten with ease, but with paines and labour, danger and trouble, and oftentimes with life it self.</p>

                  <p>IT is a Justice to a mans self; and no vain ostentation or brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to write or speak truly of his own good service to his king and country; since none knowes it better then they, that the world may know them; so as to be remembred with love and honour. For though fame is not alwaies a true Recorder, yet it is a loud reporter, which is a more certain reward to his merits, then from Kings and States: For Kings and States most comonly receive the service, and forget ths reward: and many times gives them disgrace instead of honour, and death for life.

For Infamie is a loud reproach, where Fame is a loud Applause, yet neither of them are got by ordinary means, but by extreams, either by Nature, Fortune, or Fate; As to make them ring aloud, for the sound to be heard through many Nations, and to live in many Ages. But infamie hath this advantage, if it be one, that it lives longer, and strikes harder upon the ears of the World, then Fame doth.</p>

                  <p>NExt, the being born to the glory of God, Man is born to produce a Fame by some particular acts to prove himself a man, unlesse we shall say there is no difference in Nature, between man and beast; For beasts when they are dead, the rest of the beasts retain not their memory from one posterity to another, as we can perceive, and we study the natures of Beasts, and their way so subtilly, as surely we should discover some-what: but the difference betwixt man and beast, to speak naturally, and onely according to her works without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence, is, that dead men live in living men, where beasts die without Record of beasts; So that those men that die in oblivion, are beasts by nature, for the rational Soul in man is a work of nature, as well as the body, and therefore ought to be taught by nature to be as industrious to get a Fame to live to after Ages, as the body to get food for present life, for as natures principles are created to produced some effects, so the Soul to produce Fame.</p>

                  <head>The Fame of valour, and wisdom.</head>
                  <p>IT is a better and more certain Reputation to have the Fame of being a wise man, then a man of courage, because every man that is wise hath courage; for he that is a coward cannot be wise, because fear puts him out of the right way: but there be many men that have courage which be not wise, for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is only a resolution of the minde, either to Act or suffer, and to destroy or be destroyed, so that courage doth not direct and guide as wisdom doth, but dares and executes, besides wisdom is more to be admired, because it is rarer; as scarce one wise man is found in an Age; but men of Courage whole Armies full in every Age, neither is wisdoms Fame subject to fortune as courage is, for Wisdom makes fortune her servant, and uses all times and accidents to her advantage, and the worse her fortune is, the greater she appears, when the Fame of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is a slave to fortune, and onely flourishes in her smiles, but is buried in her frowns.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Courage is a vertue that defends and protects its Countrey, and keeps an enemy in awe, yet it is a vertue that is onely exercised in destructior, in the patient suffering of his own, or the acting to anothers. Where wisdom is alwayes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in uniting and composing, searching and leading into the wayes of peace, when courage chuseth and searches for the wayes of danger, and courts her as his loveliest and beautifullest Mistris, and is many times so couragious as he, forceth her, and had rather die in the arms of danger, then live in the arms of peace.</p>

them, and examples to humble them, for every several man, if wit were not discovered, would think not any had it but he, for men take pleasure first in their own fancies, and after seek to gain the approving opinions of others: which opinions are like womens dressings; for some will get such advantage in putting on their cloaths, who although they have ill faces, and not so exact bodies, will make a better shew then those that are well favoured, and neatly shaped, with disordered attire, wherein some men are so happy in their language and delivery, as it beautisies and adorns their wit, which without it would be like an unpolished Diamond, but such difference there is between, that to create a fancy is the nature of a God, but to make neat and new words, is the nature of a Tailour.</p>

                  <p>POets make us see errours, as what we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and what we should shun, it revives the spirits, it animates the minde, it creats wit in the readers brain, it is a shop of curious varieties, where every one may see for their love, and buy for their paines; but a true Poet is like a Spider that spins all out of her own bowels. And though the web be Artificial, yet that art is naturall, not exemplary, but as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets make us finde our own errours, so History shews us the errours of others, and gives us advantage, by inabling us to look back to former times, for it increaseth and strengthens mens courage, by reading their battles, it begets patience, in reading their miseries, it humbles the minde, in perceiving the changes of fortune, Witty in reading their orations, Civil in knowing their Ceremonies; so that History is a repetition of things past, and is bound to write nothing but what have been done, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie is a recreation for times present, which is neither bound to line, nor level.</p>

                  <p>THere is as much difference betwixt a Poets stile and an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, as a French galliard and a Spanish pavinne, besides Poetry is most fiction, and History should be truth; Poesy may be phantastical, History must be grave, Poesy is to move passions, History is to confirm truth; History draws the minde to look back Poesy, to look right forth; Poesy is simulising, History is repetition; Poesy is beautiful and spritely; History is brown and lovely; Poesy goeth upon his own ground; but History goeth upon the ground of others.</p>

                  <p>TRuth should be the guide of an Historian; yet the truth of History should not be drest in Poetical fancies, but with grave Rethorick; Truth should be delivered civilly, not rudely; it should be ushered in with eloquence; for truth should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered smoothly, comly, sweet and Harmoniously; not rudely, roughly, basely, fantastically, nor contemptibly: but a Poet will never make a good Historian, because he is too full of fancy and invention, which may disturb his way; for a Poet, though he useth numbers, yet he keeps no reckoning, where an Historian makes an exact account, but as a Historians brain is too slow for a Poets, so a Poets brain is too quick for an Historians.</p>

                  <p>A Natural Philosopher may judge well the motions of the Elements, and a moral of the dividing, or dissecting of passions, or framing of Common-wealths; but there is much division amongst them of the way. So a Divine may judge well of the mystery of Religion; although there is as much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction amongst them as with the Philosophers; So Historians may judge of some particulars; being conversant in the action of times; but Logicians seldom; for if judgement is the last act of reasoning, as it is, or it is not, in which Logicians seldome come to a conclusion; nor Mathematitians if their chief study be Arithmetick; for then they are too much addicted to multiply, and diminish. Most of these afore mentioned are too hard set in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate studies; and dwel too long upon them; at least these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judgements had need be good, for their time will not give them leave to consider of many things; but Poet are quick of invention, easie to conceive, ready in executing, and flies over all the world, yet not so swiftly, but they take a strickt notice

                  <head>The difference of Poetry.</head>
                  <p>POets most usually put their fancies into verse or scenes, and verse is numbred fancy, and scenes are distinguishing of humours; the scenes are most commonly acted upon Theaters; for action is the life of humour; besides, it clears the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and makes a deeper impression in the minde of the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, then when they are onely read; and these expressions of humours, not onely shews errours that are past, or those that may come; but vices that are to be shunned, and vertues that are to be followed; besides, it begets hate to the one by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the deformities, and love to the other, by the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her beautie, which is beneficial, and a good instruction to the ignorant lives of men; but the meaner and smaller Poets, if they may have the honourable name of Poets, do more harm then good; for their scenes are rather Romancical tales, then the expressions of mens natures; in which they onely teach effeminate men, and foolish women to be whining lovers: and there be others, although they be good Poets, yet they are ill natured ones, and so crabbed as they corrode both the eare, and the minde, in which they seem to observe the ill humours more then the good, as if they lay to watch, to steal, and intrap mens vices: and take them up by little parcels, to sell them out by whole sale, and seeme glad that men have vices for them to divulge. But those sorts of Poets correct too much, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage too little: but again, some are so flattering, and insinuating, as they become parasits to mens humours.</p>

                  <p>IT is not every Poet that can make a good copy of verses, nor proper scenes, neither is a particular copy or scene enough for an applause, but a life full, and the spring must be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and flow easy, not forced by pipes from other mens wit, for those are but watry braines, that have neither oyl nor fire, which make their fancy so dull, as their conceits are inchanted; and some flie so high, as if they would rend the wings of their brain, which wearie others braines to finde them out, and when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50040:12"/>
they finde them, they are not worth their paines; were taken for them; for what writing soever is darkned, or obscured either in the sence, or by hard and unusual words, grows troublesome and unpleasant to the readers; again some are so long and tedious upon a subject as they lose their wit: for wit never dwels long upon one thing, other Poets their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are untunable; they do not strike upon the strings of the soul, for the excellency of Poetical wit is to move passion, it is true, numbers without wit will move passion, but they cannot keep or make passion stay, and it may strike upon a passion but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raise one, yet wit appears best when it is drawn in triumph in the golden Chariot of numbers.</p>

                  <p>A Poet may be compared to a musitian, that playes upon four and twenty strings; so Poets strike upon four and twenty letters, for a Poet will tune his readers voice, to his own passions, as tomake the voices to go by numbers; rise and fall by their several straines of wit; like light Cellebrands, or Currantoes; or merry Jyggs, or grave Pavins, or melancolly Lacrimacs; for Poets translate mens mindes into as many several shapes; as they write fancies.</p>

                  <p>ROmancy is an adulterate Issue, begot betwixt History and Poetry; for Romancy is as it were poetical fancies; put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Historical stile; but they are rather tales then fancies; for tales are number of impossibilities: put into a methodical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and though they are taken from grounds of truth, yet they are heightned to that degree, as they become meer falshoods; where poetry is an Imitatour of nature to create new, not a falsefying of the old: and History gives a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not inlarging the reckning.

                  <p>THe reason why men run in such obscure conceits, is, because they think their wit will be esteemed, and seem more when it lies an odde and unusual way, which makes their verse not like a smooth running stream; but as if they were shelves of sand, or rocks in the way, and though the water in those places goeth with more force, and makes a greater sound: yet it goeth hard and uneasy.

                  <p>OF all discourses, the worst enemy to society is the divulging the infirmities of others; wherein some are so evil natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in striving to defame others, as they will not onely use all their rethorick to make their faults appear more odious, or their vertues lesse, but will strive to make their vertues seem vices, when to discover infirmities is ignoble, but to lessen ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is the part of an envious man, which is the nature of a devil; and since union is the bond of society, the discourse should alwayes tend to peace, and not to discord: for there is no man but hath vertues to praise, as well as vices to dispraise, and it is as easie to take the better side; I am sure it is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the speaker, for faults in particular should never be mentioned, but in private to themselves, in an admonishing way, otherwise they do but inveterate. The next enemy to society in discourse is disputation, which affords the least pleasure in society, for first it is tedious, next it is contradictory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets enemies of friends, and it is a kinde of rudenesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict strangers, though they should speak non-sence, but Logick, which is the art of disputations should be left to Schooles, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and publike Theatres, which are appointed places for such discourse; for some say Logick is to make truth appear, others that it is to make falshood appear like truth, and some say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that it is to dispute on both sides, and that it makes more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord then it can compose, which is discord, the cause of so many writings, and several religions, and factions in the world, which makes men become Tigers and Vultures to one another, when otherwise they would be like the society of Angels. The last and worst enemy to society, is forswearing and blasphemy; for what pleasure or advantage can a man have to blaspheme, which is to curse God, who hath the power to return his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on his head, with horrid punishments; and for swearing, though it be allowed for the confirmation of a truth, and for the keeping of a promise whereby it is made sacred and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet to make it common is to make it of no effect. Besides it shows little wit and lesse memory, that they should want words to fill up their discourse with, but what oaths are fain to supply; and for lying where there is no truth, there can can be no trust; and where there is no trust, there can be no union; and where there is no union, there can be no perfect society, but may rather be called a concourse, which is to meet rather then to unite, where society is the father of peace, the bond of love, the arm of strength, the head of policie, the heart of courage, the hand of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50040:16"/>
industry, and the bowels of charity; and discourse is the life which gives light to the eyes of the understanding, sound to the ears, mirth to the heart, comfort to the sorrowful and afficted, patience to the oppressed; entertains the time, recreates the mind, refreshes the memory, makes the desires known, and is a heavenly consort.</p>

                  <head>Of Silence.</head>
                  <p>IT is said that silence is a great vertue, it is true, in a sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons chamber, that loves no noise, or at the dead time of night, or at such times as to disturb natural rest, or when supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours are by, or in the discourse of another, or when attention should be given, or if they have great impediments of speech, and speaking many times is dangerous, infamous, rude, foolish,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50040:17"/>
malicious, envious, and false. But it is a melancholy conversation that hath no sound, and though silence is very commendable at sometimes, yet in some cases it is better to speak too much then too little, as in hospitality, and the receiving civil visits; for it were better their strangers and friends, should think your talk too much, then that they should be displeased in thinking they were not welcome by speaking too little: besides it is a lesse fault to erre with too much courtesy, then with too much neglect, and surely to be accounted a fool is not so bad as to be said to be rude; for the one is the fault of the judger, the other is the fault of the actor or speaker; for civility is the life to society, and society to humane nature: it is true that there are more errours commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in speaking, then in silence, for words are light and subtle and airie, as that when they are once flowne out, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called again, but only to ask pardon with more: and there is an old saying, to talk much and well is seldom heard, but it cannot be verified in all, for some will speak well as long as there is grounds to speak on, but the length of time makes it sound to the eare, as wine tastes to a drunken man, when he cannot relish between good and bad; so that it is not onely the matter, but the manner, time and subject in speaking, which makes it so hard to speak well, or please many, and though it be alwayes pleasing to the speaker to delight others, yet that doth not alwayes please others that he delights to speak of: as there is nothing more tedious to strangers then to hear a man talk much of himself, or to weary them with long complements; and though civilityin that kinde ought to be used; yet they should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such forms and times as not to lose respect to themselves, or to be over troublesome in long expressions to others, but there is few but loves to hear themselve talk, even preachers; for a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that preaches long, loves rather to talk then to edifie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the memory must not be oppressed in what they should learn, or their reproofs too sharp in what they should minde, for with one word or two of reproof he reforms, half a score undoes again, which makes it a railing instead of exhortation; neither is it alwayes required, for a man to speak according to his profession or imployment in the affaires of the world; for it would be ridiculous for a Lawyer in ordinary conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to speak as if he were pleading at the bar, yet every one ought to have respect in his discourse to his condition, calling, or dignity, or to the quality of others, for it is not fit that a Priest which either is, or should be a man of peace, to speak like a souldier, which is a man of war, or to speak to a noble man as to a peasant; again, there is nothing so much takes away the sweetnesse of discourse as long preambles, or repetitions, and indeed the whole discourse is tedious, and unpleasing if it be over-long, though their tongues were as smooth as oyl, &amp; run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wayes of truth, yet too much doth as it were over-fil the head, and stop the eares, for the head will be as the stomack

when it is over charged, it will take surfeit of the most delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meat; wherefore in speaking judgement is required, yet some are so over-wise in the ordering their discourse, as it is not onely troublesom to themselves, but a pain to the hearers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so set and constraint a way of speaking, as if their words went upon hard scrues, when there is nothing so easie as speech; for there is no part of man so unwearily active as the tongue, and of the other side, some are so full of talk, as they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give room nor time to others to speak, and when two or three such persons, of this voluble quality or nature meet, they make such a confusion in speaking altogether, as it becomes a tumultuous noise, rather then sociable discoursing: which is a disturbance to society, for discourse should be like musick in parts</p>

                  <p>KIssing dances are commonly dances, which were invented by the meaner and ruder sort of people, at wakes, and faires; which kinde of people, knows not the ceremonies of modest civilities; for Country dancing is a kinde of a rude pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, and cannot be called truly a dance, but rather a running in figaris, for the true art of dancing, is measured sigures, by the feet in divided times; for the feet keepe as just a distance of times, as notes of musick.</p>

                  <p>HE is more praise-worthy that invents something new, be it but rude and unpolished, then he that is learned, although he should do it more curious, and neater; an imitator can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so perfect, as the inventor, if there can be nothing added to the thing invented; for an inventor is a kinde of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; but most commonly the first invention is imperfect; so that time, and experience add to the growth, and perfection, and many times there are many creatours to one invention; for he that addes is as much as he that begun, only the second lights his candle from the first, but he goeth his own way, and may be away that the first inventor had not guessed at: or at least thought it impossible: but an imtator adds nothing to the substance or invention, only strives to resemble it, yet surely invention is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier then imitation: because invention comes from nature, and imitation from paintul, and troublesome inquirie; and if he goeth not just the path that hath been trod before him; he is out of the way, which is adouble pain at first to know the path, and then to tread it out; but invention takes his own wayes, besides, invention is easie because it is born in the brain.

                  <p>SOme say as I heare, that my book of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emes, and my book of Philosophical Fancies, was not my own; and that I had gathered my opinions from several Philosophers. To answer the first, I do protest, upon the grounds of Honour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Religion, they are my own, that is, my head was the forge, my thoughts the anvil to beat them out, and my industry shaped them and sent them forth to the use of the world; if any use may be made thereof, but my Lord was the Master and I the Prentice, for gathering them from Philosophers, I never converst in discourse with any an hour, at one time in my life; And I may swear on my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I never had a familiar acquaintance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant conversation with any prosest Scholar, in my life, or a familiar acquaintance with any man, so as to learn by them, but those that I have neer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, as my Husband, and Brothers; it is true, I have had the honour sometime to receive visits of civility from my Noble and Honorable acquaintance, wherein we talk of the general news of the times, and the like discourse, for my company is too dull to entertain, and too barren of wit to afford variety of discourse, wherefore I bend my self to study nature; and though nature is too specious to be known, yet she is so free as to teach, for every straw, or grain of dust, is a natural tutor, to instruct my sense and reason, and every particular rational creature is a sufficient School to study in; and our own passions and affections, appetites and desires, are moral

Doctors to learn us; and the evil that follows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, teaches us what is bad, and by moderation we finde, and do so learn what is good, and how we ought to live, and moderate them by reason, and discourse them in the minde, and there is few that have not so much natural capacity, and understanding, but may know, if not finde out what is needful for life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out artificial education, for nature is the chief master; art and education but the under ushers, in the School of life; for natural objections may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied without the help of arts, and natural rules of life, may lead us safe, and easy wayes to our journeys end; and questionlesse nature was the first guide, before art came to the knowledge, and if it were not for nature, art many times would lose her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; yet let nature do what she can, art oft times will go out of the right way; but many will say it is the nature of man that invents, and the nature of man to erre that is, tis the nature of man to be so ambitious, as to strive to be wiser then nature her self, but if nature hath given men ambition, yet nature hath given men humilitie to allay that fiery appetite; and though nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men ignorance, yet nature hath given men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destanding, to bring them out of that darknesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of knowledge; and though nature hath obscured the secrets of the natural cause, yet he hath given men nature to observe her effects, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to conjecture of her wayes, and reason to discourse of her works, and understanding to sinde some out, and these gifts are general to mankinde: wherefore I finde no reason, but my readers may allow me to have natural imagination understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inquiries, as well as other Philosophers, and to divulge them as they have done, if that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I am produced by nature, and not by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices hand, cut out like a stone-statue; but if my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will not allow my opinions, and fancies to be my own, yet truth will; but there is a natural edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

to all, which comes without pains taking, not tormenting the body with hard labour, not the minde with perturb'd study, but comes easy and free through the senses; and grows familiar and sociable with the understanding, pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the contemplation, for there is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that the sense can bring into the minde, but is a natural in structour to produce the breeding of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal opinions, and understanding truthes; besides, imaginary fancies, if they will give their minde time as to think, but most spend their time in talk rather then in thought; but there is a wise saying, think first, and speak after; and an old saying that many speak first, and think after; and doubtlesse many, if not most do so, for we do not alwayes think of our words we speak, for most commonly words flow out of the mouth, rather customarily then premeditately, just like actions of our walking, for we go by custome, force and strength, without a constant notice or observation; for though we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe our wayes, yet we do not ordinarily think of our pace, nor take notice of every several step; just so, most commonly we talk, for we seldom think of our words we speak, nor many times the sense they tend to; unlesse it be some affected person that would speak in fine phrases; and though speech is very necessary to the course of mans life, yet it is very obstructive to the rational part of mans minde; for it imployes the minde with such busy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable maters, as all method is run out of breath, and gives not contemplation leave to search, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after truth, nor understanding leave to examine what is truth, nor judgment how to distinguish truth from falshood; nor imagination leave to be ingenious, nor ingenuity leave to finde invention, nor wit leave to spin out the fine and curious threed of fancy, but onely to play with words on the tongue, as balls with rackets. Besides a multiplicity of words consounds the solid sense, and rational understanding, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:50040:23"/>
in the discourse; yet to think very much and speak yery seldom, makes speeed uneasy, and the tongue apt to faulter, when it is to deliver sense of the matter they have, and want of uncustomary speaking makes the Orator to seek for words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the sense of his meaning, or the meaning of his sense; besides, want of eloquence many times, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not onely rational opinions, but conceals truth it self, for want of perswading rhetorick, to raise up belief, or to get understanding; so that a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platory person hath the disadvantage of words; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though most commonly they have the advantage of thoughts, which brings knowledge; but life being short, those that speak much, have not time to think much, that is, not time to study and contemplate; wherefore it is a great losse of time to speak idle word, that is, words that are to no purpose, and to think idle thoughts, that bring no honest profit to the life of man, nor delight for lifes pastime. nor news to the knowledge and understanding, but most men speak of common matters, and think of vulgar things, beats upon what is known, and understood, not upon what ought to be known, and understood; but upon known improbabilities, or vain ambitions, or upon that which nothing concerns them, or upon evil designes to work distractions, or upon that which cannot advantage them nor any body else; but it is very probable, my readers will at this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course condemn me, saying, I take upon me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, as if I thought my self a master, when I am but a novice, and sitter to learn. I answer, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to instruct what ought to be done, then to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise what is best to be done; but I am so far from thinking my self able, to teach, as I am afraid I have not capacity to learn, yet I must tell the world, that I think that not any hath a more abler master to learn from, then I have, for if I had never married the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I have, I do beleeve I should I never have writ so, as to have adventured to divulge my works, for I
<pb facs="tcp:50040:23"/>
have learned more of the world from my Lords dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, since I have been his wife, then I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I should have done all my life, should I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to an old age; and though I am not so apt a Scholar as to improve much in wit, yet I am so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious a Scholar to remember whatsoever he hath said, and discoursed to me, and though my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is dull, and slow, and my capacity weak to all other discourses, yet when I am in company, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew my simplicity then be thought rude; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I chuse rather to speak, though foolishly, then say nothing, as if I were dumb, when I am to entertain my acquaintance, and though I do not speak so well as I wish I could, yet it is civility to speak. But it is my Lords discourse that gets me understanding, and makes such impressions in my memory, as nothing but death can rub it out: and my greatest fear is, that I the Scholar should disgrace him the Master, by the vulgar phrases and the illiterate expressions in my works: but the truth is, I am neither eloquent by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor art; neitherhave I took the accustomary way of often speaking, to make my words, or letters fluent, not but my tongue runs fast and foolish when I do speak, but I do not often speak, for my life is more contemplary, then discoursing, and more solitary then sociable, for my nature being dull and heavy, and my disposition not merry, makes me think my self not fit for company.</p>

then delights them; to see a beautiful object, and to hear a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious found, to have an odoriferous scent, a delicious taste, a soft touch all at once, distracts; for the spirits running from one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another, knows not what to chuse, or where to rest; therefore true delight comes soberly and singly one by one, besides the delights that our senses receive in outward objects, there is a delight of inward contemplation, whose materials the senses bring, in which the imagination doth work upon, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and cutting, and inlaying those several pieces, and so is represented to the minde as a new recreation, which are called fancies, or ideas, for though it be nothing untill it be put into act, and every thought cannot be acted; some for the hazards and inconveniences others for the impossibilities, which are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes that live not long after the birth, or so sickly, that there is little delight in them, neither do they harm but rather good; for it pleaseth for a time, coming in sweetly, and goeth out quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but thoughts that may be put in acts, should be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wisely governed, for those beget great desires, those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires run violently into acts, not staying for consideration; which makes men commit, not only idle and vain follies, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous even to the ruine of estates, or reputation, or lives, which must needs bring discontent, for there can be no hapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in ruine; and since a greater pleasure and happinesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in thoughts, they must rule them so, not to murmur in discontents of what they would and cannot, or not safely do; but their wishes and desires must rather be within the circle of their abilities then without, and rather think they have too much then too little, for they that think they have too little, will never be quiet in striving to get more, so the pleasure of wise thinking is, when the thoughts are begot honestly, nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moderately, and ordered carefully, these bring true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

in over-populating it; for those kingdoms that are very full of people, growes mutinous, and runs into civil wars, where many states are sorced to war upon their neighbors; for no other end but to discharge the stomack of the Common-wealth; for fear it should breed incurable diseases. Besides, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may be over-stockt, like grounds which causeth great dearth and plagues, in a Common-wealth, so that those states which have more traffick then men, are rich, where those that have more men, then trade, are poor; and Civil war pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not so much out of plenty, as out of proud poverty, the next cause for plenty they are of a spare diet, and most of what they eat or should eat, by their order, is Fish, Roots, and the like; but if they do get a good bit one may say, much good may it do them, for they get it by stealth, and eat it in fear, at least not openly to avoid scandal; but if they do not spare in the matter of meat, yet they spare in the manner, which cuts off all prodigal superfluities of feasting, or open house-keeping, wherin is spoiled more then eaten, neither doth it relieve the hungry, by the Almes-basket; so much as it over-Gorges the full, and for Ceremonies it keepes the Church in order, and gives it magnificency: besides it is beneficial to the State, for it Amuses the Common people and busies their mindes, and it is as it were a recreation: and pastime to them, as Saints dayes and the like; nay they take pleasure, and make a recreation to have fasting dayes, so as they have much to think on, and imploy their time in, as fasting-dayes, processions of saints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, penance, absolutions, and the like, as Mass and Musick, and shewes, as at Christmas, Easter, our Lady day, &amp; on many dayes of the yeers, and these affording one and the same, but varieties in all; besides, every Saint having power to grant se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral requests; it will take up some time to know, what to ask of them, and all these one would think, were sufficient, to keep out murmur and discontent, which is got by idlenesse, which is the cause of rebellion.

But women ought to put on as many several shapes, and formes ofbehaviour, as she meets with humours; as austere and severe behaviour, to the bold, a sweet and gentle behaviour to the humble, and bashful; but a woman that would preserve her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by fame as well as by chastity, she must put on as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several faces, and behaviours as a State doth; for a state in time of war puts on a face of anger; and in time of plague and pestilence, a face of pietie, after rebellion a face of clemency; in times of peace and plenty, a face of mirth and jollity; so wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men must put on as many behaviours, as she meets with several humours, as neglect to the proud, and severe to the bold, and wanton, a sweet and gentle behaviour to the humble, and bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and observing and serious behaviour, to the wise and grave learned; a dutiful and respective behaviour, to the grave and aged, a cheerful and pleasant behaviour to their neerest friends, and there are so many more, that it is past the memory of my Arithmetick.</p>

then mens vanities is to some purpose in one regard or another; now that which is called vanity, may be divided into two parts, as particulars and generals, the general vanity is to eat, to drink, to sleep, to act any thing, or to think, but the particular vanities are those that men condemn in one another most: as for a man to think of those things he knoweth to be impssible, or to do that he knoweth the end will bring him no profit, but if the ends of vanity be not profitable, yet the wayes are pleasant, or else men would not take such delight in them; and what is the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly designe of men but pleasing themselves, and shall we think that nature made the world to be a torment to us? and onely beasts to take pleasure in themselves, and that nothing but hard labour, and restraints are lawful to man, for beasts eat and drink, and take their ease, and for al we know, please themselves in their thoughts, and may be they have as various and vain thoughts as mans, unlesse men torment them, and put them to labour, and though labour and industery may be pleasant to some, yet not when it is put upon them, as a law of necessity, for laws, and necessities are bonds, though we make them our selves, and men may think all things are lawful, that are, or tend not to the destruction of nature, for nature is bountiful and easy, and ties not up her creatures, but gives them liberty, and use of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, unlesse it be to destroy themselves unprositably, which is against nature; but for preservation, and to prolong the life of somthing else, as Fame, Friends, Countrey; which he rather lives in, then dies to, and nature is the giver of life to all, and therefore those that maintain life in most things, is the greatest friend to nature, as in losing one life to save many, and to die for fame, is to live longer in the memory of other men, then he knows he shall in the life of his own body; but one would think there were no vanity in man, for there was nothing done or thought, but was to some purpose, which is to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; though all thoughts, and all actions are not pleasing, but those I suppose are inforced; and upon necessity; and not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, then it is no greater vanity then what cannot be avoided, for some take more pleasure in getting or striving to get the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others, then they can grieve at the paines they take, and some take as much pleasure in building an house of cardes, as another doth of stone, and some take as much, if not more pleasure in a phantasme; as another in the gravest and assured'st thoughts; for what pleasure Poets take in their imaginations of impossibilities, as if men should imploy their time &amp; thoughts in nothing, but what is merely necessary, they would grow a troublesome burthen to themselves; being made by nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive, busie and contemplative; For there are few things serve meerly to the use of necessity, unlesse we will fill our time with superfluities, and curiosities which are called vanitie; and this vanity is that which sets all Common-wealths awork, and makes them to live by one another, that which is called

vanitie is of a middle nature, as by that which is called vice, and that which is called vertue, for there is no malignity in vanity; for where malignity is, it leaves to be vanity, and turnes to be vice; vanity is the worldly delight of man, if man had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny delight in the world; But the wise Preacher saith, All is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie under the Sun, and vexation of spirit, and to eat and drink in peace is the onely happinesse; if so we are onely happy when we are eating and sleeping; they say in all desires obtained man is more unsatisfied: and that the onely pleasure is in desiring, and in endevouring, and not in the injoying, and that man is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pleased with nothing that he hath in possession, but it is not that man that is displeased with all that he hath, but that pleasure is not permanent: and though pleasure is according to every mans delectation; yet there is no man but hath pleasure somtimes one way, somtimes another; but as the sense seemes to be ravished at the first touch, yet by the often repetition it growes troublesome, and painful, and so ceaseth; for it is with the senses as it is with the strength, for great Labour wearies and weakens the strength; nor can the strength be in every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at once, no more then the senses can receive their full gust at once: for the leggs wil grow feeble with labour, and actions of the armes, though the bulk of the strength lies not in the armes; for a man cannot run fast, and give a violent motion to his armes, but the one will hinder the other so much, as both will be of little use, the same will be with the senses; for a generality takes part away from every particular, and one and the same motion to every particular wearies and troubles ti, in so much, as that which was a pleasure becomes a grief or pain, so as it is not that man that takes not pleasure in what he enjoyeth; for if any one delights in particular tast, if the appetite were not wearied, the delight would be the same, as it was at the first touch, to eternitie, but the senses being tirrable, grow wearied, feeble, and sick with violent motion and continual labour, that they cannot relish that they did before; besides, al desires that proceed from the senses increaseth their motion. and as all the senses are chiefly in the head, so their like and dislike to most things proceeds from thence; for the brain will be so weary with one and the same motion, as the leggs with running; and the violenter the senses are, the sooner tired they be; but there are two chief sortes of pleasure, the one wholy dwelling in the senses, which is fading, the other lasts as long as life, and hath a desire to last longer; these are those things or thoughts, as lie not wholy in the senses, but onely found out by them, and kept and nourished by the minde; in this the senses follow the minde, and where the minde leades the senses it walkes them with so moderate a pace, and rules them with so equal motions, as they are never weary. But when the senses lead and rule the minde, it is alwayes out of order, and is tired in following the uneven, strange, and violent wayes, not knowing where to rest;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50040:30"/>
but the reason why displeasure lasts longer then pleasure, is because displeasure is of the nature of death; For though mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not cease as in death, yet it is slow and dull, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which is of the nature of life, is full of motion, bot and violent, the one is like a long and tedious sicknes, the other like a hot and burning fever, that destroyes soon.</p>

Riches make a man ambitious of Honourable Fame, which desires make them rule their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the length of good opinions but poverty is ambitious of nothing but riches, and thinks it no dishonour to come to it any any way. Thus poverty is ambitious of riches, and riches of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50040:42"/>
Ceremonies, their Wars, or Contracts of Peace, thus they may come to be good Statesmen, or Commanders in War, and be able to do their Country good service, and to get to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves honour and fame: besides, the knowledge of the world gives a satisfaction to the mind; for when they see there is a change, and misfortunes that are not to be avoyded, they will not make every little cross an affliction, but take afflictions as things necessary, and ought to be born with patience; and by this shall they live more happily, and dye more willingly.</p>

                  <p>CHildren should be taught at first, the best, plainest, and purest of their language, and the most significant words; and not, as their nurses teach them, a strange kind of gibbridge, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken language of their own making, which is like scraps of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meats heapt together, or hath'd, mixt, or minced: so do they the purest of their language; as for example, when Nurses teach children to go, instead of saying go, they say do, do, and instead of saying come to me, they say tum to me, and when they new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come out of a sleep, and cannot well open their eyes, they do not say My Child cannot well open his, or her eyes, but my chid tant open its nies, and when they should bid them speak, they bid them peak, and when they should ask them if they will or would drink, they ask them if they will dinck, and so all the rest of their language they teach Children, is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when it is as easy for those that learn Children to speak, and more easy for the Children to learn, plainly, and the right language, than this false language, which serves them to no use, but only takes up so much the more time to learn to speak plain, and as they should do, which time might be imployed in the understanding of sense, which is lost in words. And it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the foolish, and ill-bread nurses that speak to Children thus, but their Fathers, which many times are accounted Wisemen, and their Mothers discreet Women, which my thinks is very strange, that wise and rational men, when they talk to Children, should strive to make themselves Children in their speech, and not rather strive to make Children speak like wise men: yet such is the power of custom, that wisemen will follow it, although it be unnecessary, uneasy, and foolishly hurtful; for certainly this broken compounded and false language they teach Children, is so Imprinted in the Brains, as it can hardly be rubbed out again, and the Tongue gets such a habit of an ill and false pronuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as when they are grown to men and womens estate, their speech slows not so easy nor sweet, nor their tongue moves not so voluble nor smooth, as other ways they would. Likewise they learn them the rudest language first, as to bid them say such a one Lies, or to call them Rogues and the like names, and then
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50040:42"/>
laugh as if it were a witty jest. And as they breed them in their language, so they breed them in their sports, pastimes, or exercises, as to play with children at boe-peep, blind-man-buff, and Cocks hod, as they call them, that is, to muffle their head and eyes, and then they run about to knock their heads against the doors, posts, and tables, to break their Legs over stools, thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, or to run into the fire, where many times they desorm themselves with the mischiefs that follow; or to hide themselves behind hangings and old cubbords, or dirty holes, or the like places, where they foul their cloaths, disaffect the Brain with stincks, and are almost chokt with durt and dust Cobwebs, and Spiders, Flys and the like getting upon them; also to role upon the ground, likewise to stand upon their heads, when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing might be learned with the feet, as easy as tumbling in several postures, and to stand upon the head; and is it not as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to learn them to write, and read, as to build houses with Cards? they are both but making of figures, and joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and is it not as easy to learn them the Globe, as to play at Cards? and is it not as easy to tell them of Arts and Sciences, as to tell them feigned and foolish tales of <hi>Tom Thum,</hi> and of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the like, frighting them so much as makes them of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous natures, and Effeminat Spirits? when Children would take as much delight in Arts and Sciences, nay more, if they were taught them at first. Likewise it were as easy, and less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to teach them to valt, which is necessary for horsemen, as to climb a Pear-tree and the like; and likewise it were as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to learn them to fence with a stick, or at least to hold it in a defensive posture, as to play at Cat, or Chick stone, Quaits, or the like; wherefore it is no wonder there are so few wise men, when Children are bread so foolishly; so many so unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely behaved, when Children are bred so rudely; so many Cowards, when Children are bred so fearfully; so many defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when Children are taught such dangerous, mischievous, and hurtful sports; so many false, when they are taught to tell lyes from their Cradles, as thinking it no vice, or fault in Children; and many more examples might be given of the ill breeding of Children.</p>

                  <head>Of Gentlewomen that are sent to board Schools.</head>
                  <p>IT is dangerous to put young Women to board Schools, unless their Parents live so disorderly, as their children may grow wicked or base by their examples; for most commonly in these Schools they learn more vices than good manners; for it is a good task, for one body to breed up one child well, and as they ought to be bred, at most two or three, but it is too much for one to breed up many, as for one Woman to breed up twenty young

Maids; it is true, they may educate their Persons, but it is a doubt whether they do, or can educate their minds; they may learn them to sing well, but it is a question whether they learn them to think well; they may learn them measures with the feet, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the measures of a good life; they may learn them to write by rule, but forget the rules of modesty.</p>
                  <p>For the danger is in those Schools, where a great many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of several Families and Births, degrees of ages, various humours, different dispositions, natures and qualities, do like several sorts of fruits, which when they are gathered and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together, soon putrifie and corrupt, and some become rotten at the Coar; where if every Pear, Aple, and Plum were layd even by themselves apart, in a dry and clean place, they would be sound, wholesome, and last as long as their natures were to last: so if young Women were bred singly, carefully, and industriously one by one, there would be no danger they should learn from each other crafts, dissembling, fraud, spight, slander, or the like; besides where, there are many together of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dispositions, they are not only apt to catch the infection of ill qualities from each other, but many times they breed vices, which ruin themselves, fortunes, and Families, and like Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets consume their Estates, or eat a hole thorough their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Besides, all board Scholars of the Effeminat sex are like sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat drest at a Cooks shop, which alwaies tasts of the dripping pan or smoke; so most commonly those that are bred at Schools, have a smack of the School, at least in their behaviour, that is a constraintness; but the exercises although they are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Women of quality, yet it is not these exercises or vertues (as they call them) in <hi>Italy,</hi> which give them good breeding, but to instruct their youth with useful knowledge, to correct their ignorance with right understanding, to settle their mind to virtue, to govern their passions by reason, to rule their unsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or distempered appetites with temperance, to teach them noble principles, honourable actions, modest behaviours, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil demeanours, to be cleanly, patient, and pious, which none can teach either by example, or instructions, or both, but those that have been nobly bred themselves.</p>

great strengths; the fifth gives his limbs a graceful moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His exercises should be Masculine: for better it were to see a Gentleman shooe an Horse, than to play on the Vial, or Lute, Virginal, or any other musical instrument; for that sheweth the command Man hath over Beast. Or to carry a burthen on his back, than to sit idely at Cards or Dice: for Idleness is like the sluggish Worm, that is neither able to help nor defend it self. Or it were better see a Gentleman hew down trees, or dig in the bowels of the earth amongst minerals, than painting, or pencil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for that shews manly strength, command and force over the hardiest of natures works, so as it be voluntary and not sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish.

The Talkative Fool loves not to hear any body speak but himself, neither will he let them; for he speaks so fast, as he permits not, nor gives room for any other to take place; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, as what with his loud, fast, and tedious discourse, he will make his Hearers deaf.</p>
                  <p>The Superstitious Fool is an Observer of Times, Postures, Figures, Noyses, Accidents, and Dreams, and many such like. As for Times, they will not begin a Journey, or marry, or buy Land, or build, or begin any work, but on such Days as appear to be lucky. For Dreams, if they dream their Teeth fall out of their head, or of Flowers, or Gardens, or of any thing green, or the like, or to see their Faces in a Glass, or to fall from a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, or being at Weddings, they think it Fatal. For Noyses, the howling of Dogs, the croaking of Ravens, the singing of Crickets, the skreeching of Owls. For Accidents, the bleeding three drops at the Nose, Iron molds, the Right Eye itching, Salt falling to them. For Postures, or Figures; as a Hare to run cross them, or to stumble at the Door. Insomuch as they never enjoy any present Recreation, for fear of an evil Accident.</p>
                  <p>The Venturous Fool thinks all desperate Actions honourable Valour; as to go into the Field for Battel unarmed, or to wear something as a mark for the Enemy to shoot at, or to give the Enemy any advantage; Where the Honour of the Valiant is, to beat, and not to be beaten; For he is a Fool that will give his Enemy ground. And others think it a Valour to leap over Hedges, and Ditches, and Gates, to jump over dangerous places, to swim, or make their Horses swim over large, great, and deep Rivers; or to try Experiments upon themselves; and all to no purpose, but to shew what they dare do. Whereas true Valour will do none of these Actions, unless it be upon strong necessities; as to avoyd and hinder a great danger: but Fools have neither Foresight to prevent, nor Judgement to choose, nor Patience to suffer; neither will they take any example, to avoyd either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, or Danger; they run blindfold into all Actions, (and as the Proverb saith, <hi>They leap before they look</hi>) and stumble at Straws; and either they so trouble themselves with what may come, as they never enjoy the present, or they consider the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time so little, as they are destroyed before they are aware. But as Fools make all things worse than they are, in not giving them the right use: so Wise Men prevent Evils by their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, mend what is bad, shun Danger, and what cannot be avoyded, they bear with Patience.</p>
                  <p>I have heard say, that <hi>the World is as one great Fool, in which, say some, the Wise, though there be very few, are buried in the Rubbish of Fools, without Monuments.</hi> But that saying is both foolish, and unjust, as to Condemn all, because there is Folly in the most: But Envy and Malice may bark, yet they cannot bite; therefore the Wise live in Renown, when Fools shall be scattered as Dust before the Wind.</p>

The Busy Fool is one that had rather break his head at his Neighbours door, than keep it whole at home; he strives to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all petty Quarrels, wherein he is sure to get the hatred of one side, if not both; he is the Hackney for News, lading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the Posthouse, and disburthening himself to all he meets; he is more concerned with a forein Embassador, though he hath no use of him than the Embassador is with his Embassages; he never faileth Sessions, and Assizes, nor Executions; he riseth early, he eats hastily, walks fast, goeth to Bed late; and his Thoughts beat quicker than a Feaverish Pulse; full of vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; offers his service to all, although he is not able to do any; he strives to know all things, and takes not time to learn any thing; he makes himself his greatest Enemy.</p>
                  <p>The Vain-glorious Fool is one that sets himself to the most publick view; and if he hath any Estate, he spends it in vain Entertainment; he seems to despise those things he covets most; he reads his Letters in the Streets, as he rides, or walks, to have the People think he is a Man of great business, although they be Letters of his own writing; he makes his Horse pranse at a fair Ladies door, or walks by, and looks up often, as if he had some Interest there, when the Lady knows him not, or would despise him if she did; When any one visits him, he calls for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, asking where his people are, complains they are never at home to wait, when the most he hath is but a Lacquey and a Groom. Sometimes he will pull out his Handkerchief, as for use, and two or three pieces of Gold shall come forth with it, and scatter on the Ground, as if his Pockets were full, when he laid those Pieces there of purpose; and when he reads a Letter of News that he hath borrowed, he will take out as many more as will sill a Bag; that he may be thought a man of great business. He is like Alchimy, that makes a great shew, but hath little worth.</p>
                  <p>The Exceptious Fool is one that thinks that all which is said, or was meant, is against him; he hates whispering or laughing in any besides himself, and is jealous of all men; he is as a Troubled Water, where no Beast will drink.</p>
                  <p>The Cautious Fool is alwaies considering, but never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving.</p>
                  <p>The Credulous and Incredulous, the one believes against all Reason, the other will believe no Reason at all.</p>
                  <p>The Facile Fool can deny nothing; he will promise that he knows not how to perform; he followeth not Good, because it is best; nor shuns Evil, because it is worst; for he followeth as Perswasion leads, not as Reason guides.</p>
                  <p>The Inconstant Fool is one shuns all things which he knows; he will be a Friend to death for a day, and the next as great an Enemy; he hath no settlement, neither for his Soul, Body, nor Estate; he hath more several Colours than the Camelion, and more Shapes than <hi>Proteus;</hi> he is as a Labyrinth, where none can find a sure way.</p>

The Impertinent Fool is alwaies asking such questions as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be resolved; offers his service where there is no occasion, or use of it; requesting those things that cannot be granted; so as he will neither by denyed, resolved, nor counselled.</p>
                  <p>The Prodigal Fool is like a weak Stomack, that whatsoever it receives, it casts forth; which makes his Purse like his Body, to dye of a Consumption.</p>
                  <p>The Extravagant is like the Prodigal, onely his way is more various.</p>
                  <p>The Kind, Fond, and Tender-hearted Fool, is one that will promise, or part with any thing that he hath for the present, but repents himself as soon as he hath done; he embraceth all things, but flings them away before he knoweth what he had; his Heart is softned with sudden pity, but is hardned with little time; so that it is variety of Objects that makes that Passion work.</p>
                  <p>The Affected Fool is one that speaks alwaies in phrases, and proportions the distance of Time between his words; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and his Discourses, with several postures of his Face, and his Hand, are like the Vane, or Weather-cock of a House, which is alwaies in motion; and for its Garb, it is either so loose, as if there were a solution of his Joynts, or else so stiff, as if he had no Joynts at all; he neither eats, drinks, sits, walks, speaks, sleeps, or any Natural Act, but he doth it in a particular, and Artificial form.</p>

Neither are they pleased with the Company of their own Sex; for if there be no Man amongst them, they are very dull, and as mute as one would wish; unless it be at a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipping, where a Cup of good Liquor runs about: But if a Man be amongst them, of what Condition soever, but especially a vain Young Man, then their Pipes are set to the highest note, and with such ridiculous Laughter, as they seem neither to stand, or sit still; or they are dancing, playing, and toying with every thing: But in their grave Discourse they set their Countenance, and twinkle with their Eyes; and contract their Mouth in a round Compass, and speak their Words finely, and they that are not Handsom, as few Women think but that they are; Or if they be in Years, they strive to be thought Wits, and all their Discourse is of Love, justifying Loving Friendships by the Conversation of Souls. Some of the Graver sort run into State Affairs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Politicks thereof: Others pretend to be learned in Divinity, and talk of Predestination, and Free-will, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and the like; and others pretend to Devotion, repeating of Scriptures, when, say they, the Thoughts, are Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously affected, as those who discourse wildly: Therefore, say they, it is no marvel if the Men be so prevalent in their Amorous Assaults, since the Women do so easily yield; nay, say they, they do more than yield, for they invite the Enemy to betray themselves.

                  <p>IN some Nations, Women have much more Liberty than in others; As for example, <hi>France, England,</hi> the seventeen Provinces, <hi>Germany,</hi> and others, have more Freedome than <hi>Turky, Italy, Spain;</hi> not that those Nations are less sensible of the honour of Constancy in that Sex than the others, but that they are more confident of their Virtue and Chastity; Or else, wisely considering, Restraint is but a Whetstone to Appetite; For most Travellers confirm, that those Countryes that have most Restraint, have least Chastity. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> may be an Example, who gave leave by their Laws, that any Man of their Nation might enjoy any Woman he fancyed; and not onely so, but the Young Women and Men danced uncloathed in publick Theaters; yet so Modest and Chast they were, that for many hundred years there was hardly known an Adultery committed. So that it is neither the freedome of Choyce, or Fashion, or Bodies, that infect one another, but the Mind, which is disorderly educated: For Nature would be Chast, if Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were Honest, which is, to instruct Youth with Noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Profitable Rules, and to let them know how beneficial and necessary Justice and Propriety is to the orderly Life of Man; and so to breed them with Sense and Reason, Knowledge and Understanding, or else Liberty is dangerous, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Effeminat Sex, if they be not ballanced with wise Admonitions, to make them swim steddy and even through the World, that the over-large Sails of Ambition may not overturn them, nor the Whirlwind of Evil Perswasions may not swallow them, nor to be lost in the dark Nights of Ignorance: but let the bright Star of Knowledge light them, and the Needle of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing direct them.

                  <p>IN Marriage it is far worse, and more Inconveniencies come by the disobedience of the Wife, and her Adulteries, than the Husband. For first, she dishonours her self, insomuch as her Company is an Aspersion to all honest Women that frequent therein, which makes the Chast to shun her Society. Next, she is a dishonour to the Family from whence she sprung, and makes the World suspect the Chastity of her Mother; for there is an old saying, <hi>Cat will after kind:</hi> thus we see that the World is apt to judge from the Original. The third dishonour is to their Children; for were they never so Beautifull, and Virtuous, yet Families of Honour refuse to match with them, unless they bring great advantage by their Wealth; and then none will receive them into their Stock, but those whom Poverty hath eaten up; for the disgrace is like the Leprosy, never to be cured; and it infects the whole Posterity, and it gives Spots to the Family it is joyned with. The fourth and last dishonour is to the Husband; for let a Husband of a dishonest Wife be never so worthy a Man, yet her Follyes shall lessen the Esteem of his Merits to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the World; Although he have a great Valour, a flowing Generosity, a sound Judgement, a fine Wit, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Mind; well bred, Beautifull, Rich, Honourable, yet the vulgar part of the World will point at him, as a Fool, a Coward; and all they can think to be bad in a Man; nay those excellent Virtues of Nature and Education, shall be dimm'd, and lose their Gloss even to the Wife, although it be unjust to mis-prize
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50040:50"/>
one for the fault of the other: Yet such is the nature of the World, as they will censure by what they can mistrust, as well as that they can assuredly know, and think that some Defects undivulged lye hid, which makes her prefer another in her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections before him; and any thing that is despised, seems poor and inferiour at the first blush, unless they meet with them that value things as they are, and not as they seem, which few do; for the most part of the World regard more the outside than the inside, and are carried away more by the shew than the substance; which makes so many mistake, that they despise what they should admire, and love what they should hate, and hate what they should love. This is the reason that Gallant, Worthy, and Wise Men are dishonoured by their dishonest Wives. Besides the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, the Inconveniencies are many; First, it abolisheth all lawfull and right Inheritance; for the Child that is born in Wedlock, although begot by another Man, shall inherit the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Estate, although it be known to be another Mans, by our Laws. Next, for the abuses of Industry; as for the profit and pain of his Labour to go to a Stranger. Thirdly, for the weakning of Natural Affection; for a Man that mistrusts that all are not his own, makes him not love any, because he cannot guesse which are his; rather, he hates all, for fear he should love him that brings him Dishonour, and Discontent; or at least set the Parents upon the Wrack, with Fear and Grief, as afraid to mistake their own, and grieve that their own may have too little Affection from them. Thence it takes away the tenderness of Affection from the Parents, and neglects and rigour to their Children; it makes disobedience from Children to their Parents, for the disgrace and wrong they receive; so that Suspicion is become the Master of the House, and Shame the Mistris, Unthankfulness the Steward, and nothing is entertained but Discontents.</p>

                  <p>THE like Dishonour and Inconvenience comes not by Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the Husband, as the Wife; for the Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no dishonour by the Fathers Liberty, nor the Wife very much; for the worst that can be thought, is, that she is not so pleasing to her Husband, either in her Person, or in her Humour. Nay, it begets rather a greater Luster to her Merits, and sets off her Virtues more to her Advantage; as, to shew her Fortitude in Patience, her Constancy in Chastity, her Love in her Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which the World taking notice of, pities her hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in an unkind Husband; and Pity proceeds rather from Love than Scorn, and gives the Dishonour to the Husband for his Inconstancies, and not a Disgrace to the Wife in being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken; if she have an approved Virtue, knowing it is Facility in being subject to change, not her want of Merit, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50040:50"/>
that come thereon; it is ruine to a Mans Estate, for Concubines are chargeable, for Women are won oftner by Gifts, than for pure Affection: For though Affection sueth often, it speeds but seldome, when Gifts commonly prevail; and besides, Charges is multiplyed by their increase, the next is apt to corrupt Noble Natures, by the practice of Dissembling, and Flattery of the Enamoured, to grow False and Deceitfull to all other, for Custome is a Second Nature: Then this Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Love hinders all Business, and Affairs of the World; so that it is not onely wasting his present Estate, but makes him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of raising another; for although all Lovers are most Ingenious and Industrious to obtain their Beloved, yet to all other things of the World they are as dead. Next, as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for himself, so he is not profitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for he that hath his Mind full of Women, can have no room for any thing else; besides, his Heart is in his Mistrisses Breast: This kind of Love effeminates and degrades a Man of his Valour to all, but for his Mistrisses Love, witness <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> I mean not all those that are affected to Women; for Moderate Love gives an Edge to Valour: but those that are swallowed up, and become wholly Lovers to be precise in <hi>Cupid's</hi> Temple, and are alwaies praying to their Mistris their Deity: but their Goddess doth not alwaies hear their Prayers, which makes them go home to their Melancholy Wives.</p>

                  <head>Of Marriage.</head>
                  <p>THE Cause why there be so many Unhappy Marriages, is in the unequal Matches; and the fault is in the Parents not breeding their Children according to their Quality, or Estates; for some, their Breeding is too high for their Estates, and others too low for their Estates, and Qualities, and Degrees; For some, though they have great Estates, yet will bring up their Children in Dirt and Rags, and Keep them short of Means, and so much under their Power, as when they come to be Masters of an Estate, and Family, and not knowing before the use of Goods and Liberty, they become Prodigal Spendthrifts, and Inconstant Husbands, in not being acquainted enough with the Vanities of the World, to despise them for the World; and Vanities, the more they be known, the less they are admired, loved, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Others again, that are of a high Degree, and having low Fortunes, think to humble their Children by their breeding, to make their Minds agree with their Fortunes, and leave them to the Conversation of mean and mechanick People, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the like; whereby they can learn nothing that is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Honourable, but Sharking, Swearing, Drinking, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rude in their Behaviour, russ in their Conversation, mean in their Practices; when most commonly the Son marries the Chamber-maid, and the Daughter the Serving man, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference of better Company: but finding their Errour afterwards, it most commonly makes them Unhappy all the rest of their Lives, and repining at the Advantages that they thought hey had lost, and might have had; for Time brings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and Consideration many times Repentance, to think with themselves how they might have advanced their Estates by their Marriages, and what Inequality there is in their Births, making them despise their Choyce; so as they run into two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50040:51"/>
the First, in being over-fond, in marrying so soon, and unequally, and after, having so much, as they regard nothing, or please themselves with any thing that is at home, so as they seek what is to be found abroad to divert their Discontentments, and so become Wanderers, thinking thereby to shun or cast off their former Follyes; which the more they look back on, the ostner they repent of. Others again, through Carelesness, make their Children fall into the same Errours, not instructing them with Noble and Honourable Principles, but suffering them to run about into every Dirty Office, where the young Master must learn to drink and play at Cards with the Kitchin-Boy, and learn to kiss his Mothers Dirty Maid for a Mess of Cream. The Daughters are danced upon the Knec of every Clown and Serving Man, and hear them talk scurrilous to their Maids, which is their Complement of Wooing; and then dancing <hi>Sellingers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Round</hi> with them in <hi>Christmas</hi> time, and many other such things, which makes them become like unto like; and their Parents think no harm in it, because they are young: And some say by ill example; For when Children see their Parents to do not well, and disagree, they think it Warrant enough for them to do the same. And others breed their Children at that high rate, that it ruins their Estates, or at least hinders the increase so, as by their Decay', or not raising their Estate, they cannot match them so high as their Breeding requires; which makes them to leave them with Low Fortunes, and High Minds, which can never agree. Neither will they own any thing that is not above them, but despise even that which is equal to them in every thing, unless their Breeding be not so, Or where there is a despising or scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Man and Wife, there will be alwaies a Neglect, and a Disagreement: yet of the two, there comes less Inconveniency in the High Breeding than in the Low and Mean; for the first, though it breeds Pride, yet it shuts out Baseness, and begets No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thoughts, and Honourable Qualities; and the other begets mean Thoughts, base Qualities, and disordered and foolish Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Affections: and whatsoever is rooted in the young and tender years, is seldome stubbed up with Age; but if it be, it is with great Difficulty and Labour. So that Children, according to their Estates, Conditions, and Degrees, must be bred with Plenty without Prodigality; with Respect, not with a Neglect, nor too much Observance; their Discourse to them Wise and Solid, not Idle and Foolish; their Recreations Seasonable and Suitable, not Extravagant and Wild; they must rather Animate their Spirits than Deject them, and not to fill them with too much Art, for fear of spoyling their Natural Parts.</p>

                  <p>MEN have three several Strings to tye the Knot of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; first, Conscience, or Religion; next, Nature; the third, Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>First, There is no Religion in the World that makes not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Sacred; and in Christian Religion they are a Consecrated Pair, wherein they are commanded to leave all others, and live together, and love each other; and for Nature, there is no such relation betwixt any of her Works, as to make a perfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as between Man and Wife; all other Friendships are as it were Forced, or Artificial, and not Natural; for Man and Wife are like one Root, or Body, that whatsoever toucheth the one, is truly sensible to the other; nay, so as it is the same Joy and Grief. Then for Gratitude, the Man ought to love his Wife, not because she is as his Servant, in being Overseer in the Houshold affairs, or in nursing up his Children, and the Care and Fear of them, or in being sick or ill in the breeding of them: but the Horrid Pain in bringing them forth into the World, and the Danger they pass through, which is more hazardous to every particular Woman, than to every particular Man in Battel. Then for the Weal publick, which is as the great Wheel in a Clock, so every private Family is as the little Wheel for the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; if a Man and his Wife disagree, which is want of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, then their Children, when they are grown up, begin to grow Factious, some siding with the Mother against the Father, and others with the Father against the Mother; which Custome will make them grow Factious in the Weal-publick, as well as in the Weal-private.</p>

                  <p>SO Ridiculously Foolish, or so Maliciously Envious is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as one would think Nature was either Defective, or else full of Malignity, when she made him. As for example, If a Man love his Wife with a clear and constant Affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Amorous Allurements of other Women for her sake, finding all in his Wife that he can wish, or at least desires no more than what he enjoys, and is best pleased to live a life of quiet at home, ruling his Family with Love and Obedience, thinking it more wise to enjoy the World thus, than to trouble himself with those Affairs of the World which neither bring him Ease, Peace, nor Profit; but if he must act several parts upon the Stage of the World, to which he is forced either by Honour or Necessity, not by Choyce, this Man shall be thought either an Uxorious Man, or a Fool, or a Madman, either to give himself over to various and voluptuous Delights, or to deliver up not onely his Person and Estate, but his Reason and Liberty, to the humours and will of his Wife; As if a Man when he gives his Child a Hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse, because he lets his Child do so and so in many like Causes, and if the Child desire to go abroad, the Father desires to please his Child, when it hinders not more potent Affairs; thus if he doth not cross his Child in every thing, but is well content to please and humour him in harmless things, he is thought too fond and indulgent a Father to his Child: just so is a Husband condemned if he humours and pleaseth his Wife in letting her have her will in honest, and not in dishonourable Recreations. But what Gallant Man will not favour the Female Sex? nay, what Gallant Man will not condescend to all their Desires, and seek and invent waies to please them, so far as Honour will give them leave? And shall a Man despise, and cross, and neglect his Wife because she is his own, lawfully joyned and united? Shall it be more Dishonour for a Man to love his Wife, than another Mans Wife? Shall a Man be accounted a Fool because he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to Wedlock? because he is kind to his own Wife? Was <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> less Wife because he loved? or <hi>Pompey</hi> less Valiant because he loved? <hi>Salomon</hi> may be said to be less Pious towards God through the great Love he bore to <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Daughter, which was his first, and dearly beloved Wife, yet he was not less Wise in respect of the World. But Men seek for that abroad, whereof they have better at home, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable Desire of Mankind makes them search for what is never to be found: But where Nature gives a Satisfactory Mind, she gives a Happy Life; and what can we imagin the Joys of Heaven, but a stint to our wandring Desires; therefore those that are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50040:53"/>
most fixt, are nearer Heaven; and he is the Wisest, that is nearest to Unity; and those that are most united, are likest to a God.</p>
                  <p>But where Discord happens, Hell is resemb'ed, and harsh, haughty, and not insulting Natures, are composed like Devils; and <hi>Caesar</hi> shewed himself a Fool in nothing but in quitting his Guard, and not hearkning to his Wife, which was to shew his Courage, and to let the World see he durst go unarmed, singly alone as it were, and his freedom from the chains of fond Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; thus quitting Prudence and Love, he dyed too violent a Death. And <hi>Seianus</hi> quitting the Affection towards his Wife, and placing it upon <hi>Julian,</hi> raised such a Jealousie in <hi>Tyberius,</hi> as it cost him his Life, otherwise he might have ruled the Empire, and so the most part of the World. Thus <hi>Anthony's</hi> leaving his Wife for the love of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> lost him the third part of the World. Neither are the Counsels of a Wife alwaies to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, if all were honest, nor to be lockt from the private Affairs of her Husband; <hi>Portia</hi> was able to keep a Secret, and was of <hi>Brutus</hi> her Husbands Confedenacy, though not Actually, yet Concealing; And if Caesar had condescended to his Wives Perswasion, he had not gone to the Senate that day; and who knows but the next might have discovered the Conspiracy? and numberless of the like Examples might be given. Besides, it is to be observed, where the Husband and Wife disagree, their Family is in disorder, their Estates go to decay, Jealousies arise, which cause Discords, from whence proceeds a discontented and unhappy Life; And where the Husband and Wife are united in Minds, as well as in Body. all prospers; and most commonly Ease and Plenty crown that Family, Industry is their Recreation, Peace is their Joy, Love is their Happiness: for a kind Husband makes an obedient Wife, dutifull Children, faithfull Servants; for a Wise Man rules his Family with gentle, kind, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Perswasions, with honest and sincere Actions, with gratefull and just Rewards; and Kindness, and Constant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, work hard and obeisant Natures to be more pliant and facile; for Kindness melts hardest Hearts, and makes them flexible to form them as they please; where Cruelty or Severity hardens them so much, as they will rather break than bend.

                  <p>THere be some that condemn the Art of Painting in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, others that defend it; for, say they, as Nature hath made one World, so Art another, and that Art is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Mistris of Nature; neither is it against Nature to help the Defects. Besides, those that find out new Arts, are esteemed so, that they become as Petty Gods, whether they become Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to Man, or no; as the Memory of those that found out the Art of Gunpowder, Guns, Swords, and all Engins of War for Mischief; and shall they be more praised and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended than those that find out Arts and Adornments; as Painting, Curling, and other Dressings; for the one destroyes Mankind, this increaseth it; the one brings Love, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Hate. But some will say, those Arts defend their Lives; but where they once use them to defend their Lives, they use them ten times to destroy Life; and though it is no Fault in the Inventer, but in the User, no more is Painting, when it is used
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50040:54"/>
for a good intent, as to keep or increase lawfull Affection. But, say they, it is a dissembling to make that appear otherwise than it is. 'Tisanswer'd, No more than to keep warm in Winter; for Cold is Natural, so is the sense of it in Winter; but Clothes to keep it out are Artificial; and the true use of the Art of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to keep warm a Lawfull Affection. Besides, If we must use no more than what Nature hath given us, we must go naked; and those that have a bald Head, must not wear a Peruick, or Cap to cover it; and those that are born with one Leg shorter than the other, must not wear a high Shoe to make them even, nor indeed wear any Shoes at all, especially with Heels, because they make them seem higher, but go with the Feet bare; and those that are Crooked, must wear no Bombast; and many such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples may be brought. But, say some, it is a Bawd to entice, in begetting evil Desires. It is answered, No more a Bawd than Nature is in making a handsome Creature; but if they must do nothing for fear of Enticing, then Mankind must neither cut their Hair, nor pare their Nails, nor shave their Beards, nor wash their selves, which would be very slovenly, for fear they should appear so handsome, as they may perswade and entice the Lookers on to evil Desires; which if so, let them be like Swine, and wallow in Mire; but it is to be feared, that the Mire will be too hard for the evil Desires; so as there may be more brought in defence of Painting, than can be said against it. Wherefore, say they, it is lawfull both in Maids and Wives; the one, to get a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; the other, to keep her Husband from coveting his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife; for it is an Honour for Maids to get good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, because it is a kind of Reproach to live unmarried, for Marriage is Honourable, and gives a Respect to Women, unless they be incloystered, which all Constitutions will not agree withall; and an honest Wifes care is to please her Husband, if she can, when she hath him; for Marriage is the end of an honest Mind to all but Widows, for they, when they marry again, do as it were Cuckold their dead Husband, and their living. Besides, if they have Children, they make a Distraction and Division in their Families, and most commonly to the ruine of the first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Estate, having so great a share, and so much power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Laws; And though they should not marther themselves, as the Custome hath been in other Countryes, but contrary rather, to preserve their Health, and to dry their Eyes after a while of those Obsequies of Tears, which are Sacrifices to the Dead, yet to live a retired Life, to shew their unalterable Affections; for though it be fit for a Widow to put off her vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Passion of Sorrow as well as she can, yet there is no Humour becomes that Condition better than Sadness; for Sadness, which is a moderate Grief, looks full of Fortitude, and is Humble, Modest, Gracefull, and so far from dis composing any part, as it gives a setled, and majestical Face: So Painting is most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowable in Widows, for they should take the example of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi>

where it is said, when she went to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> she anointed her self as she did usually in her Husband <hi>Manassas</hi> time, which it seems she used not after he was dead, before this time; for as they have none to Displease, so ought they not to Allure. But some will say, that their Poverty is such, as they know not how to live, and they may be presented to such a Fortune, as may make them live happy, and free from the Misery that Poverty compels them to. It is answered, that Nature is satisfied with a little, if their Ambition be not great: but if not they must make use of the old Proverb, which is, that <hi>Necessity hath no Law,</hi> in case they present not their Necessity to be greater than it is. But to return to Beauty, it is pleasing, either Natural or Artificial, and both to be admired; for if Art be Commendable, why not in the Face, as well as in the Feet in dancing Measures, or as in the Hand upon Musick Instruments, or in the Voyce, or in the Art of Oratory, and Poetry, which will sooner increase Desires: yet this is allowed of in all places and times, not onely in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Society, but in Spiritual Unions, where <hi>David,</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, was a great Master in the Knowledge and Practice of them. And if these Arts be Commendable, and are Graces to all parts of the Body, shall it be condemned onely for Colour in the Face? And as Beauty is the Adornment of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so is Art the Adornment of Beauty; and this saith the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant against the Plaintiff. But all Opinions have, or most of them, Sides, and Factions; but my Opinion is so far with the Defendant, as I believe all Adotnments of Beauty are lawfull for Women, if the Intention be good. Yet I am utterly against the Art of Painting, out of three respects; The first is Dangerous, for most Paintings are mixed with Mercury, wherein is much Quicksilver, which is of so subtil a malignant nature, as it will fall from the Head to the Lungs, and cause Consumptions, and is the Cause of swelling about the Neck and Throat. The next is, that it is so far from Adorning, as it Dis-figures: for it will rot the Teeth, dim the Eyes, and take away both the Life and Youth of a Face, which is the grea'est Beauty. Thirdly and lastly, the Sluttishness of it, and especially in the Preparatives, as Masks of Sear-Clothes, which are not onely horrid to look upon, in that they seem as Dead Bodies embowelled or embalmed, but the Stink is Offensive. Then the <hi>Pomatum</hi> and <hi>Pultis,</hi> which are very uneasy to lye in, wet and greasy, and very unsavoury; for all the while they have it on, it presents to their Nose a Chandlers Shop, or a greasy Dripping-pan, so as all the time they fry as it were in Grease; neither will their Perfumes mend it, and their Oils: And though I cannot say they live in Purgatory, because they shun all hot places, for they cannot have the comfortable heat of the Fire, and shun the Natural heat of the Sun, as they must live alwaies, as if they were at the North Pole, for fear the Heat should melt away their Oil, and Oily Drops can be no grace to their Face, Dry Painting shrivels up the Skin so, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50040:55"/>
Age in their Face, in filling it full of Wrinkles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paintings are both Dangerous, Ill-favoured, and Sluttish, besides the troublesome pains. But for other Adornments in Women, they are to be commended, as Curling, Powdring, Powncing. Cloathing, and all the Varieties of Accoutrement, in that they have none of the said former Qualities, but give a gracefull advantage to the Person. Besides, Dressing is the Poetry of Women, in shewing the Fancyes, and is the cause of imploying the greater part of a Commonwealth; for in four parts, three of them are in the Arts of Adornments; for it is not onely, Tailers, Imbroyderers, Perfumers, Milleners, Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Jewellers, Mercers, Silkmen, Semsters, Shoemakers, Tiremen, and many, many more, but every one of these Trades have many Trades belong to them; as for example, How many Trades belong from the Silk-worm to the Ladies Gown? and from the Golden Mine to the Lace that is laid upon it? and so in order to all other things, which is the cause of keeping a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in Union, in busying and imploying their Minds, which keeps them from Factious Thoughts, and Designs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it distributes and spreads the Maintenance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for without particular Commerce, and Trasick, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth cannot stand, and subsist: for though many a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth may subsist without the help of their Neighbours, yet it cannot live without their own Imployment and Dividement among themselves: for as some share in Lands, so others in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the rest in Trades, wherein all trasick, from the one to the other; so that every Man lives by his Neighbour, and not altogether upon himself.</p>

                  <p>WHen a sudden Paleness seizeth the Face, it shews a Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness, or some great Fear; but a Blush will come into the Face many times, when there is no occasion to raise it; for it oftner proceeds from the Constitution of the Body, than from a Guiltiness of the Mind; for when the Blood is thin, and the Spirits are hot, they are apt to run up to the Face without the Minds consent or knowledge; but when Blushing is raised by the Mind, it is commonly from a Noble Suspicion, that is the Mind, which would not have an evil Construction, where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves nought but a good Opinion. But it is better to be Bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Particulars, and Confident to the World, than Confident to Particulars, and Bashfull to the World; for it is a sign they are afraid to hear of themselves, though not to shew their Persons, which seems as if their Actions should bring a Scandal to their Reputation; yet a Bashfulness doth so obstruct the sense, as they cannot deliver any thing perfect to their Understandings, but seem like Changelings, or Fools, although they have great Wits.</p>

                  <head>Of Boldness and Bashfulness</head>
                  <p>THE most of Mankind are either too bold or too bashfull; either so bold that they seem rude, or so bashfull that they seem simple: As for Boldness, it is worse in respect to others, but better in respect to themselves; And Bashfullness is better in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to others, but worse in respect to themselves; for Bashfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is allwaies humble and civil to others, but fearfull and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to it self; insomuch as those that have this Vertue Vice (as I may call it) have neither freedome nor liberty to express themselves after their natural accustomed manner, much less in waies of advantage; for they neither speak Sense, nor their words plain, but speak quite from the purpose, stuttering and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering; or else the Tongue is so tyed, that they become like those that are dumb; neither can they behave themselves well, and are so far from a gracefull Garb, that they behave themselves like Changlings or Innocents, puting their Faces into a hundred several Countenances, and their Bodies into as many several Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures; nay Bashfullness hath such a forcible power over the Body &amp; Mind, as it draws &amp; distorts the Lims and Motions of the one, as the Disease of Convulsions doth; and distempers and distracts the other, as the Disease of Madness, in not knowing what they doe; it unthrones the Understanding, and blindfolds Judgement; and this Bashfulness proceeds from too great an apprehension of Misdeameanours; but this Bashfullness is a Tyrant, for it tortures the Mind upon the Rack of Imagination, and whips the Body with the pains of Restraint, giving no freedom to the Thoughts, Words, or Actions; it imprisons Wit, and inslaves noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; it obscures Vertue, and dims Beauty, it lames Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, it takes away the Majesty of State, and the State of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; it is affronted by the bold rude, or the mdely bold; it loseth respects from the half-witted men, and only gets pitty from the Wise; But those that are bashfull are not only Judicious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, as Witty and Wise, but most commonly have sweet and kind Natures, noble and generous Dispositions, valiant and couragious Spirits, honest and temperate Lives; but the pleasure of their life is disturbed with their imaginations, and conception of the Opinions of the World; fearing their Censures, and <note place="margin">I mean the World of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</note> doubting their Applause. This Bashfullness proceeds from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ambition, or a pious Intention, either to get Fame, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to Humility; but Bashfulnes looks as thorow a Perspective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass, searching into obscurities; when Boldness is blindfold, either with a Muster of I gnorance, or Vain-Glory; it either wants Breeding or Wit: For a poor simple Pesant, many times, hath more Confidence than a noble Lord; a rude Clown than a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Gentleman; a Market-woman than a great Lady; because they neither examin, know, nor fear the Errors they may fall into:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50040:56"/>
Again, others are so vain-glorious as to think they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit faults; but this Courtly Vice, or Vice that is Courted, carries it self with haughty behaviour, and a proud demeanour, outfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Truth, yet shrinks at Dangers; speaks loud, but acts little; threatens much, but dares not fight: They can receive no affronts, because they will take none; for whatsoever is offerd as an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, they take as a Jest, or Rallerly, or out of an Insensibility, take all well as being meant well, or out of a Vain-glory think none dares offer it. But howsoever their behaviovr is to others, or others to them, they are at liberty, and free in themselves, not bound with the Chains of Bashfullness, nor manacled with the Irons of self mistrust; they have no repinings for what they have thought they have done amiss; nor blushing Cheeks, raised by surpitious doubts; nor tender eyed, that dare not look on an evill Object, or objects that they may falsly think are so; when they are innocent they know, but Boldness doth out-face, not only what evill might be thought, but what evill they have done; and strange it is, yet true, Boldness hath such a pow'r, to make great Crimes seem lesse than they are; and those that are bold, more great or nobler than they are; like Masking Scenes set with false Lights, present a City or a stately Tow'r, when it is nothing but Pastboard painted over.</p>

                  <p>WOmen are more happy in their Husbands affection when they are indifferently handsome and various humour'd, than when they are more exact: for a woman that is extreme fair is more for admiration than for a setled affection; a woman that is constanly patient, seems senseless or simple, which makes him dislike her; and a woman that is allwaies cholerick and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, seemes a Fury; and she that is allwaies merry, disturbs her Husband's serious Contemplation of solid Thoughts; and she that is allwaies sad, dulls him; she that is allwaies complaining, is never pittied; and those that are sickly, their Husbands can find no lively contentment; for what melancholy Company are the dying? nor to be too devout and precise; for men in this World, had rather converse ordinarily with Mortals than with Angells. But if a Woman be healthfull of Body, plump of Flesh, not deformed, nor exactly handsom; gracefull in Carriage, without affectation; of a ready wit, and contriving Judgement; cleanly, without curiosity; honest, without pride; carefull, without choler; thrifty, without sluttishness; and various in their Dresses, and other Humours: Such a Wife it will not be in her Husband's power to dislike; and he will not only like her, but extremely love her, even to Dotage; for those Qualities do violently draw his Affections.</p>

                  <p>WIsdom and Wit are to be preferred before Riches or Beauty; for Wisdom knoweth how to get, keep, and use Riches; neither can Beauty paralell Wisdom; for Wisdom makes a man happy all his life, in governing his Passions, in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his waies in order to his affairs, for his best advantage, not only for himself, but for others in distress, by his Counsell; for which he is Honored, Esteemed, Loved, and sought after, to redress the incumberd, to relieve the distressed, to unite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; She helps the blind, in giving Eies of understanding to the Ignorant. Wisdom is the Arm of strength to defend; the watchfull Eye to descry dangers; the Fingers to point and direct; the Tongue to perswade and admonish; It is the Heart of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the nourishing Liver, the Stomach or Store-house, the Bowells and Center, the Head and Governor of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And Wit is to be preferred before Beautie; for there is as much difference as betwixt Soul and Body; for Wit is as it were spiritual, where Beautie is Corporal, and Beautie is subject to the variations of several Opinions; for Beautie is not Beautie in all Nations, but Wit is Wit in all Languages; Beautie wearies the Eye by Repetitions, where Wit refresheth the Ear with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Discourse; Wit is the God of Passion, creating and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them at his pleasure.</p>

Thus Beauty is admired and divulged according to the Wealth and Dignity; unless some strange and unusual Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happens to the Beautifull to noyse it abroad; otherwise we shall not hear of Poor and Mean Persons mentioned in many Ages, but those which the Fancies of Poets make; but of Beauties that were Great and Rich, their Chronologies are full.</p>

                  <p>THE Reason why I print most of what I write, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I observe, that not only the weak Writings of men get Applause in the World, but the infinite weak Translators of others Works; thus there are many simple Books take the World by the Ears; but I perceive it is not the wit, or worth of what is written, that begets a delight to the Readers, and a Fame to the Writers; but it must fit the Genius of the Age: And truly, if we will but note it, there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the wit or understanding of some Ages, I mean for the generality of men, as between some Writers and others; For some Ages are like old <hi>Nestor,</hi> wise; others like <hi>Ulysses,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent; some like <hi>Achilles,</hi> valiant; others like <hi>Paris,</hi> amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and effeminate; some like <hi>Hercules,</hi> striving to suppress Vice; others like wicked <hi>Nero,</hi> that alwaies strive to tyrannize over Vertue, making War and Faction; some like <hi>Orpheus</hi> Harp that charmes the spirits with Peace; And as the Starrs have an Influence over every particular, so they take their turns to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and are predominant over every Age; But I find I live in a Carping age; for some sind fault with my former Writings because they are not Grammar, nor good Orthography; and that all the last words are not matched with Rime; and that the Feet are not in just Numbers: As for the Orthography, the Printer should have rectisied that; for I think it is against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a Woman to spell right, for my part I confess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; and as for the Rimes and Numbers, although it is like I have erred in many, yet not so much as by the negligence of those that were to oversee it; for by the false printing, they have not only done my Book wrong in that, but in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the very Sense is altered; as for surfets, sercutts; wanting,

                  <p n="2">2. There would be no Twilight if there were no Clouds: for the Clouds are like the Wieck of a Candle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Platonick Love is a Bawd to Adultery; so Romancy, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If a Woman gets a spot in her Reputation, she can never rub it out.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the greatest study in the Life of a Chast Woman, to keep her Reputation and Fame unspotted: for Innocency is oft scandalized amongst the Tongues of the Malicious.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Womens Thoughts should be as pure as their Looks; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, Noble, Honourable, Worthy, and Virtuous, are words of Praises, more proper for Women, than Gallant, Brave, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spirits; these are too Masculine Praises for the Effeminat Sex.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Men should follow Reason and Truth, as the Flower that turns to the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Pockholes take away the gloss of Youth from a Face.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Some give Women more Praises than their Modesty dares countenance.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. True Affection is not to be measured, because it is like Eternity, not to be comprized.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Those that would be Honoured, must have Noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, Gratefull Performances, Generous Liberalities, and Charitable Compassions.</p>

12. A Man may be as soon dishonoured by the Indiscretion of his Wife, as by her Dishonesty.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is better to live with Liberty, than with Riches.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. With Virtue, than with Beauty.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. With Love, than with State.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. With Beasts, than with Fools.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. There is no Sound so unpleasing, as to hear Amorous Lovers, or Fools, speak.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. There is no Sight so unpleasant, as Affectation.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. A Gracefull Motion sets forth a Homely Person, and wins more Affection than the rarest Beauty that Nature ever made.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Wit, and <hi>bon Miene,</hi> and Civility, take more than Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gay Clothing.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Pride without State, doth as ill as State without Civility.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. It is better to hear Sense in mean Phrases, than Phrases without Sense.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. A Man should alwaies wear his Life for the service of his Honour.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Men should have Variety in nothing, but Gainfull Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. It is proper for a Gentleman to have a <hi>bon Miene,</hi> to be Civil, and Conversible in Discourse, to know Men and Manners.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. It is more proper for a Gentleman to be active in the use of Arms, than in the Art of Dancing; for a Gallant Man hath more use of his Arms than his Heels.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. It is more proper for a Gentleman to learn Fortification than Grammar: But what pains will a Man take in learning se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, wherein their Tongues are exercised, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect that Learning that should maintain their Honour? which is, the Sword; the one doth but trouble their Heads, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Memories; the other gets Honour, and saves their Lives; the one is onely proper for Scholastical Pedants, the other for Heroick Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. A Man should court his Sword as his Mistris, and study to learn its Virtue, and love it as his Friend, which defends his Honour, to revenge his Quarrels, and guard him from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. For he is the more Gallant Man that hath a Generous Mind, a Valiant Heart, than he that hath only a Learned Head; the first is Noble, the other Pedantical; the one gives, the other receives.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. It becomes a Gentleman rather to love Horses and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, than to fiddle and dance.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. And he is not worthy the name of a Gentleman, that had rather come Sweating from a Tennis-Court, than Bleeding from a Battel.</p>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:50040:67"/>
35. Men should never give Gifts, but out of three respects, either for Charity, Love, or Fame; and it is a good chance when they meet all in one Subject; not that one Subject should be all, but all in one.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. All Civility hath a Natural and an Attractive Quality, and, like a Loadstone, draws Affection to it.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. There is nothing more Noble, that to overcome an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Curtesy.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. And there is nothing more base, than to insult over an Enemy in Adversity.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. It is more Noble to win an Enemy to be their Friend, than when they have them in their power, to revenge their Quarrel; for it is the part of Generosity to Pardon, as well as to Exalt.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. It looks with a face like Generosity, to be Gratefull.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. There is no greater Usury, or Extortion, than upon Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy; for the Lone of Money is but ten, twenty, or thirty in the Hundred; but the Lone of Curtesy is to inslave a Man all his life.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Yet Gratitude is nothing but to pay a Debt: for if one Man save another Mans life, and he returns with the hazard of his own, he hath paid him what he owed him; but if he looks for it oftner than once, its Usury; than twice, it is Extortion.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. It is Commendable to Censure like a Noble and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Judge, not like a Wicked Tyrant.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Who would esteem Fame, when the Cruel and Wicked shall many times have Fortune befriend them so, that they shall live with Applause, which is Fame; and the Virtuous, and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving, shall be stabbed or wounded with Reproach, which is Infamy; so that Fame is like a great King, and Fortune the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Every one cannot be a <hi>Caesar,</hi> or an <hi>Alexander;</hi> but there must compile such Times, Ages, and Actions, and Minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to produce such Exploits.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Humility is the way to Ambitious ends; for few come to them by Pride, but by Time serving, or Bribery.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. For seeming Humility is the Tower whereon Ambition is bailt and Pride is the Pinnacle, where Envy is an Engin, to pull it down.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Nature makes, but Fortune distributes.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. God by Fortune doth not alwaies protect the Honest from the Envious of the World, or Accidents of Chance.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. It is as impossible to separate Envy from Noble and Great Actions, as to destroy Death.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. Power is like unto Love, it is the strongest when it is drawn to one point; for Power divided, is weak; so is Love; or like the Sun, when the Beams are gathered together into one point, it burns.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. Kings desire Power, because they would be like to a God; but Tyrants may be said to keep their Power by the sweat of their Brows.</p>
                  <p n="54">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:50040:68"/>
54. To keep the Common People in order, they must be awed with Fear, as well as nourished with Love, or flattered with Hopes.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. What hopes can People have of a King to govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when he doth not reform his own Houshold, but lets it run into Faction and Disorder?</p>
                  <p n="56">56. The Service to Kings, is Allegiance.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. The Service to Nature, is Self preservation.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. The Service to God, is a Pure Life, and Unfeigned Love.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. The Reward from Kings, is Outward Honour.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. The Reward from Nature, is Death.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. The Reward from God, Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. Every one is afraid of Tyrannie that is under Subjection; but when Tyrannie turns from it self to Clemency, then Love comes where Fear was.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. The best way for Princes to keep up Authority, is to make good Laws, to distribute Justice, to correct Vice, to reward Virtue, to countenance Industry, to provide for the safety of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and People.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. A Man that suffers all Injuries, is a Fool; but to suffer some or to suffer a Moderation, is Patience.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. For Patience is the way to Folly, as Fury or Choler to Madness.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. To put up, or pass by an Injury from those that have power, seems to proceed from Fear; but to pass by an Injury from the powerless, seems Heroick.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. Of all Virtues, Patience hath the fewest Passions mixt with it; and though it seems unsensible, yet it seeth clearly into its own Misfortunes; for Patience belongs to the Misfortunes that concern a Mans self.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. Yet Patience should not be a Bawd to a Mans ruine.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. There is none can be so patient as those that have suffered much.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. The Designs of Hate are easier followed, and oftner pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed, than of Love; for one may easier take Revenge of a Foe, than deliver Life and Liberty to a Friend.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. There is none so apt to revenge, as those that have been forgiven.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. There is none so sorrowfull, as those that want Means, and Waies to make Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. Many times Guiltiness is more confident than Innocency.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. There is as much difference betwixt Pleasure and Joy, as Sorrow and Melancholy; for one disorders the Spirits, the other composes them. An overplus of Joy, is like those that are drunk, for it makes the Head of Reason dissy. There are many sorts of Melancholy, but Love-Melancholy makes them cry out, O Pleasing Pain, and Happy Misery.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. There is a fix'd Grief, and a moving Grief; the one hath neither Sighs nor Tears, but seems as a Marble Pillar; the other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50040:68"/>
breaks into Complaint, and pours it self forth in Showers of Tears; Yet there are many sorts of Tears; for there are Tears of Joy, and there are Tears of Sorrow, and Tears of Anger, Tears of Pity, and of Mirth; and in all Passions, Tears are apt to flow, especially from moyst Brains: But deep Sorrow hath dry Eyes, silent Tongues, and aking Hearts.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. When the Spirits are wearied with Grief, they fall into a Melancholy Weeping, and then are setled with a compliance to time.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. Passion will rise in the defence of Honour, and the Tongue will display the Passion.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. For all we call Love, is Friendship, which is begot by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Humours, or received Curtesies, or a Resemblance of Parts, which is alterable: but there can be no true Love, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the unalterable God.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. There are waies to perfect Love, but no Body can arrive to the Journeys end, untill they come to Heaven, because there is no Perfection in this World; and there can be no perfect Love, but upon a perfect Object.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. They that love much, can never be Happy; for the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what Evil may come to that they love, takes away the sweetness of what they enjoy: Thus the fear of Losing is more unequal than the pleasure of Enjoyment.</p>
                  <p n="81">81. The Root of Love is like a Rock, which stands against all Storms; but Wantonness is like the Root of a Flower, that every Worm may eat thorow.</p>

                  <p>THE Britains of <hi>England</hi> were a Valiant People, but that they had not skill of Arms answerable to their Courage, as the Romans had; yet <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all the Emperours, could not conquer that Island in so short a time as <hi>Alexander</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered most part of the World; therefore it seems their Courage was great, since their Skill was less, and could make it to the Romans so difficult a Work: For <hi>Britain</hi> was like a Body dis joynted, or rather separated Limb from Limb; for it was not joyned in one Body, but divided amongst many Petty Kings, which made it weak; for being not united, the Body hath little power; without the Legs do uphold, and the Eyes do direct, and the Arms do defend, it is an easy thing to throw down a Criple; but it was a sign the Spirit was strong in this Criple, that could resist so long against a Giant, as the Romans were: Therefore <hi>Britain</hi> was worthy of Praise, since their Courages defended them so long.</p>

                  <p>QUeen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reigned long and happy; and though she cloathed her self in a Sheeps skin, yet she had a Lions paw, and a Foxes head; she strokes the Cheeks of her Subjects with Flattery. whilst she picks their Purses; and though she seemed loth, yet she never failed to crush to death those that disturbed her waies. Her Favourites for Sport, she would be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to, sometimes in Favour, and sometimes out of Favour, as <hi>Essex, Leicester, Ralegh, Hatton,</hi> and the like: But she stuck close to her old Counsellors and Favourites, <hi>Burleigh, Walsingham,</hi> and the rest. Neither did the first Favourites get so much as the last, <hi>Ralegh</hi> got not so much as <hi>Burleigh</hi> did; some may say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they spent more, they laid up less; but vain Favourites get more Enemies to themselves, and Hatred to their Princes, than Profit to themselves; for the sight of their Vanities makes the People remember their Taxes, and think that their Prince hath posed from their Purses to maintain their Vanities; and their Prince thinks they have given them more, because they shew what they have, and many times more than they have: But the Wisest save, and lay it up, till the Envy is past, and the Tax forgot. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> maintained more forein Wars at one time, than any of her Predecessors before her, and yet without the Grievance of the People; for it was not so much out of their Purses, as the Prizes she got by Sea; for though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had the Honour of being Master of the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had the Honour of being Mistris of the Sea; so her Ships were her Mines, to maintain her War against him.</p>

He was not like <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, for his Favourites cost him his Crown and Life. I observe, that soft natures are apt to be crusht, and very hard natures are apt to be broken in governing; therefore severe, but not cruel, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull or kind, but not credulous, reign happiest. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth spent great Sums of Money, as that which his Father left him, and that which he had out of <hi>France,</hi> then the vast Sums he raised out of Monasteries, yet no great advantage redounded to his Kingdome: But his Expence was much to keep Peace

                  <p>IT was not so much the Wisdome of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh that gave him the Crown, as his Good Fortune in having a Tyrant Opposer, on which the Peoples fear was above their feeling; for they did apprehend more Tyrannie than they found in the time that <hi>Richard</hi> did reign; for he made more good Laws in the time of his Reign, than had been made in the Reign of many Kings before or after him: But the Peoples mistrust cannot be satisfied with any Act, let it be never so just or profitable, but by their absence, which they never think far enough, untill they go to the Shades of Death; and many times that which they believe

                  <p>MOST commonly it may be said of Kings or Governors, as they say of <hi>March,</hi> It comes in like a Lion, it goeth out like a Lamb; and when it comes in like a Lamb, it goeth out like a lion.</p>
                  <p>But when a Man desires to raise an Empire, or himself to be an Emperor, he flatters the People; but when he is once become Emperor, he makes the People flatter him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> might have proved a good Emperor, but he had not time to be an ill one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> was a wise Prince; he knew there was no way to settle the new-born Empire, and to enjoy it peaceably, but by gaining the Love of the People; not by the base servile way of Flattery, but by executing Justice, and making wise and good Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> was a good Prince, whilst the memory of <hi>Augustus</hi> lasted in the Minds of the People; and a wise Prince, that he could dissemble his Humour so well, and so long; and none was so fit as <hi>Ascianus</hi> to bring him to bed of his great belly'd Cruelty. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was of a lazy disposition, as we may know by his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and luxurious life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> came too soon to the Empire to reign well; Vanities, the Rulers of Youth, despise Prudence, and Temperance, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Age; his Vanities bred Vices, his Vices bred Fear, Fear bred Jealousie, Jealousie bred Tyrannie, Tyrannie bred Conspiracy, and Conspiracy Destruction; in brief, he had not Age enough to poyse him; he killed himself more out of Fear than Courage. Both the <hi>Neroes,</hi> the Uncles, and the Cosen, were much of a humour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero Germanicus,</hi> his Son; he was Proud, Cowardly, Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat, Envious, Vainglorious, Covetous to get, Prodigal to spend, Cruel without Craft, and Mad; he was not wise enough to rule his Empire, nor temperate enough to govern his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor couragious enough to dissemble his Fears, or be a good Prince.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, he was more learned than wise,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50040:75"/>
and he had more good Nature than Constancy; and whatsoever ill he did, he was seduced to do it by those he loved. True it is, he was of an easy Disposition, but that proceeds more from a good Disposition in Nature, than an evil one; and it rather comes from Love than Hate, although the Effects be all one; for he that is easily perswaded, and suddenly believes, commits more Cruelty by his Credulity, than distributes Justice by his good Nature.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Galba,</hi> he had too narrow a Soul for so great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; for the Vices of Age and Covetousness had got hold of him: he was Old and Crazy; he had no Generosity to entice, nor Sweet Behaviour to win, nor Oratory to perswade, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to order, nor Faith to perform; and whatsoever Man hath these Faults, must needs get more Enemies than Friends.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Otho,</hi> he had not Patience to try his Fortune, neither lived he so long as any one could judge of his Government: he was better beloved of his Souldiers, than fortunate in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses; besides, he was beloved more of the People after he was dead, than when he was living; but whether he killed himself for the grief of those Souldiers that were lost, or fear of the loss of the rest, or for fear of himself, it is doubtfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vitelius</hi> was cruel, gluttonous, and of an unworthy nature.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Vespasian,</hi> he was very greedy of Gain, to the height of Covetousness, and yet he was very Generous; for whatsoever he got, though ill, yet he bestowed it well: he was a very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Prince, and very few Faults to be found in him. He sprung from a Family of no great growth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus Flavius,</hi> Son to <hi>Vespasian;</hi> he was so good, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enough be said in praise of him; he was a Wise Prince, and a Just Prince, a Mercifull Prince, and a Loving, Temperate, Carefull, and Religious Prince; he seemed to have more Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in him, than were waies or means to express it; he was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, Learned, Mild, Patient, Industrious, Skilfull in all Arts, and Majestical.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flavius Domitianus</hi> was Cruel and Vainglorious; he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the steps of his Father, nor Brother.

                  <p>Others dispraise him, and say, It was Envy to <hi>Caesar</hi> that brought him out against him, more than for the Publick Good; and that if <hi>Pompey</hi> had had but the same Fortune, he would have taken upon him the same Command.</p>

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:50040:76"/>
Others again praise <hi>Caesar,</hi> and say, that he was forced to use his Power and Arms against the Senate, out of necessity, the one, being much in Debt, having exhausted his Estate, the other, in defence of his Life, knowing the Senate would accuse him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of rewarding him for his good Service; and that Rational Men may judge, by the succession of Story, that he was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and that Fortune being on his side, gave him greater Hopes, and higher Designs, which he thought not at first on; and that he had Reason, though he had not been necessitated; for though the Roman Government began from a Low and Mean Beginning, yet it came to be the most Powerfull and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whilst Mediocrity ruled amongst them: for at first their Poverty made them Just, not daring to do Wrong; and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in providing the best waies and means to keep and raise themselves; and Valiant and Industrious, to defend themselves, and to increase their Dominions. Thus Virtues begot their Strength, and raised their Fame: But their good Fortune brought Plenty, and Plenty Pride; the one runs into Luxury, the other into Ambition; and Ambition begot Factions so much, that in the latter daies of their Government, though it was called a Republick, yet every Man was striving to be Chief, and setting up for themselves. And, say they, why may not <hi>Caesar</hi> think himself as fit to be Emperor as any of his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Citizens, seeing the Government would change? And that it was as great an Injustice, when he cannot do another good, to do himself wrong, as to do another wrong, and do himself no good, or to do himself and another wrong; for how often was it aimed at by <hi>Sylla Cataline,</hi> and many more, though not ripe untill <hi>Caesar's</hi> time? so that <hi>Caesar</hi> had not onely Necessity and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity but Justice to perswade him, on his side; for any Government is better than none; for they were come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to that pass, that there was no Unity; for every Man was against one another, but onely sided when they saw a particular Rise. But the general Faction fell into two hands, the one for a Republick, the other for a Monarch, wherein the Monarchical Faction prevailed, wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> was Chief; and it may be a question, whether the other Faction did not take the Republick onely for Name, but had a Monarchical Design? But, say they, Envy, that is the Enemy to all Good Success, would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against the other side, if they had had the same Fortune; for Envy dyes not when Action ceaseth, but lives as long as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Fame survives; and that Good Fortune made <hi>Caesar</hi> seem Ambitious, and <hi>Pompey</hi> more humble by his Ill; for though Good Fortune hath many Friends, and more Followers, yet it is to the present Condition. But to conclude, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was Valiant, Witty, Industrious, Sweet-natured, and Bountifull, Gratefull, Constant to his Friends, and Mercifull to his Enemies, shew by his Acts; and for his Valour, he fought many Battels upon great Ods and Disadvantages, and hazarded his Life other
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50040:76"/>
waies many several times. Others dispraise <hi>Caesar,</hi> and say, he was a Traitor, an Usurper, and naturally Cruel, but what he did artificially with Prodigality to compass his Ends; and that he was a Coward, and bought more Victories by his vast distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Provinces, and other Gifts, than were truly got by his Courage, or Conduct. But the Factions of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> dyed not when their Wars ceased, but have lived ever since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Historians; for they cannot praise one so well, unless they dispraise the other; for to praise, or dispraise them both, would have made their Theme so short, they should have little to write on; for Disputes both lengthen and heighten. But there are most commonly more faults found by Historians, than Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses; but Writing hath as great a defect as Government in Commonwealths and Armies, though of less Consequence. But, they say, Men of Action have two sides, a good side, and a bad side, and some take the good side of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the bad of <hi>Pompey;</hi> others, the good side of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the bad of <hi>Caesar;</hi> but the bad side lyes more open and broader than the good, which makes it so often beaten upon by Envy; for Envy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the one; and veils the other.</p>

We must not judge Strangers according to our Laws, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Nations where they were Natives, for she had taken them as Husbands; if the Men had more Wives than they should have, or put away good Wives for her sake, that was their Inconstancy; and we must not

make their Faults, her Crimes; and they call her a Dissembling Woman, because she did strive to win her Husbands Affections; shall we say those dissemble, that strive to please those they love? if they say true Love can dissemble, they may as well say Truth is no Truth, and Love is no Love: but the Lover delivers his whole Soul to the Beloved. Some say she was Proud and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, because she loved those had most Power: She was a Great Person her self, and born to have Power, therefore it was natural to her to love Power; Besides, she might have got a worse Reputation, in being thought a base and unworthy spirited Woman, if she had loved any below her Worth. Some again say, she loved out of Craft to keep her Kingdome, I say there is an honest Policy, and it is out of Envy when they lay a reproach on it; for whosoever is to choose, it is lawfull to make the best choyce, when it is in an honest way.</p>

It is true, she was Chast, but she gave her self leave to be Courted, which is a degree to Unchastity, and a means whereby her Husbands Estate was wasted; for if she had check'd, and not permitted them at the first, they would never have grown unto that Impudence: But it seemed she loved to have her Ears filled with her own Praises; for they that love their own Praises, most commonly are catched in the Snare of Flattery; for there are seldome Praises without much Flattery. It is true, she might be a Chast Woman, but she shewed her self but an Indifferent Wife, and not worthy of so much praise: for it is not Honesty that makes a perfect good Wife, although it be the chief Ingredient, but she must be Thristy, and Cleanly, Modest, reserved in her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and secret to her Husbands Counsels; for often times a Woman dishonours her Husband by her Indiscretion, as much as by the act of Adultery; for there is nothing dearer to a Man than his Fame, so a Wife should have a care to keep it.</p>

                  <p>IT was not out of Courage that the Romans killed themselves, but out of Fear; for knowing they must dye, they thought it was less pain to dye by their own hands, than by anothers; like Parents, that will not suffer another to beat their Child, but think their own Correction the easier, though their Stripes be equal; and every one thinks that better done which they do themselves, than what another doth: so they kill themselves to avoyd Pain. But those are most willing to leave the World, when the World hath left them; for it is the Vanities that makes Men so in love with the World, and themselves; for most think they enjoy no Life, if they enjoy no Vanity; I will not say All, although I say Most, for the Wise and the Virtuous reject both; or if they do not, they embrace them but moderately; and the Virtuous and Wise have Courage; and the Couragious, as they do not fear Death, so they despise not Life; for as Virtue is a Mean between two Extremes, so it keeps in the Mean of all Conditions and Estates.</p>

                  <p>SOme say there are no Monsters, nor ugly Creatures in Nature; for a Toad, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the like, are as beautifull Creatures in Nature, if it be according to their kind, as the lovelyest Man or Woman. It is true, as being according to the natural shape of such a kind of Creature: but that which is ugly, is that which is deformed, and that is deformed that is mishapen, and that is mishapen that is made crooked, or awry, or one part bigger or less than another. And those Creatures are to be called Monsters, that have more parts than they should have, or fewer, or when their parts do not sit in their proper place; as for example, if a Man should have two Heads, or four Legs, or more Hands, or Feet, or Fingers, or Toes, or Eyes, or Noses, or Ears, or the like; or if the Eyes should be placed in the Breast, in the Neck, or Mouth; or the Ears in the Breast, or Belly, or behind in the Head; or if the Arms should be where the Legs are, or the Legs where the Arms are set; or that an Arm or Hand, Leg or Foot, should grow out of the Head; or if a Man should be in some kind like a Beast, and many the like Examples might be given; this being against the nature of the kind, and not according to the natural shape, may be called a Monster. Thus there are both ugly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Monsters; the one being a Defect of Nature, the other a Fault of Nature, or as I may say, a Vice in Nature. But a right shap'd Toad may be of an ill favour'd kind, as not being so handsom a kind as Mankind, or many other kinds of Animals; for I never heard any Poetical high Expressions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation

                  <head>Memory is Atoms in the Brain set on fire.</head>
                  <p>SOme say Memory is the folding of the Brain, like Leaves of a Book, or like Scales of Fishes, which by motion of Wind or Vapours, are caused by outward Objects, which heave up their Folds, wherein the Letters or Print of such things as have been represented to it; and those things that have been lost in the Memory, is either by the reason those Folds have never been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after they were printed, or that the Prints have been worn out, as not being engraven deep enough. But I think it is as likely that the Brains should be full of little Substances no bigger than Atomes, set on fire by Motion, and so the Fire should go out and in, according as the Motion is slackned or increased, either by outward Objects, or inward Vapours; and when things are lost in the Memory, it is when the Fire of those Atomes is gone out, and never kindled again; and that sometimes the Memory is not so quick as at other times, is, because some Vapours damp and smother the Fire, or quench it out. But Memory is the light and life of Man, and those that have the most of those kindled Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or Atomes, are the greatest Wits, and the best Poets, having the clearest Sparks. Now the Substances are plain, and not figured in new born Children, nor clearly kindled, but take Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures as they receive Objects; and when they see their Nurse, which is the first thing they take notice of, then one of those small Substances turns into the Figure of the Nurse; yet that Figure being not kindled presently, because the moysture of the Brain hinders that Motion that kindles the Fire; and the Figure doth no good, unless it be thorowly kindled; and the brighter it is, the perfecter is the Memory. And the reason why Children
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50040:80"/>
have not so much Knowledge, is, because they have not so much Heat, nor so many Figures in their Brains, nor those Substances so clear: for Wood that is newly set on fire is not so bright a Fire as when it is half burnt out; for Men we see in their middle age have the perfectest Understanding; and the reason why Old Men become as Children, is, because Children are as a Fire that is first kindled, and Old Men as Fire that is burnt out. Now there are not onely those Figures that the Senses have brought in, but new Figures that former Figures have made, which are those Fictions which Poets call Fancy; and the reason why all Men are not so good Wits as some, is, because their Fuel is too wet, or too dry, which are those Atomes; and the reason why some Men are not so wise as they might be, is because Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects come not in time enough: for though they take the Prints, yet they take not the Fire. Now those Prints or Forms are like Glasses, or several Forms of Pots of Earth; for though they are formed, and figured, yet they are not hardned or perfected untill they have been in the Fire; so that the Form may be there, although not kindled: but when they are kindled, they are Thoughts, which are, Memory, Remembrance, Imagination, Conception, Fancy, and the like.</p>

                  <head>Of Reason.</head>
                  <p>SOme say, Reason is born with a Man as well as Passion; but surely we may more certainly say that it is bred with a Man, than born with a Man; for we see many times that Men are born, which have never the use of Reason, as those we call Changelings or Naturals, but we never saw any Man born without Passion; for Passion seizeth the Body as soon as Life, and they are inseparable, and no more to be separated than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Life: for as soon as the Body receives Life, it receives Like and Dislike as Pain grieves it, and Ease pleaseth it, so that Passion is the Sense of Life, and Reason the Child of Time: But Reason is like the stone or kernel of Fruit-trees, which if it be well set, with the help of the Sun, and Earth, may come to be a Tree; but yet it is not a Tree whilst it is a Kernel: so we may say Man is born with Reason, because in time he is capable of Reason; but yet he is not a reasonable Creature untill he can distinguish between Good and Evil for himself; but as Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Sense, so Sense begets Reason. Thus Reason is a second or third Cause of Nature; for Nature works producingly, as one thing produceth another, and that other a third. But Natures first Work, and principal Material, is Life, and Life is Motion, and Motion is Nature, and Nature is the Servant of God; for Art is the Invention of Man, and Man the Invention of Nature.</p>

                  <head>Passion and Appetite of Beasts.</head>
                  <p>SOme say, Beasts have no Despair or trouble in Mind; but we find by experience, they will be Mad, and we know not from whence the Cause proceeds, whether from the Body, or Mind; then we find by experience, that they be Jealous, Amorous, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull, Spightfull, Deceitfull, Treacherous, and Theevish, they will steal one from another; Again, they say there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice in Beasts, yet what greater Injustice can there be among Men, than there will be among Dogs? for one Dog shall come, and take another Dogs Bone from him, although that Bone was given him by Man for a Reward of some good Service done by him for his Master; Again, what Ambition is there amongst Beasts? for one Horse, striving to out-run another, will run so fast, untill it be near dead; and so the like of Dogs: Then what Envy is there amongst them, that if any Strangers, although of their own kind, come amongst them, they will beat them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or kill them? Then what Covetousness is there amongst them, to hoard and lay up? but this we call Providence in Beasts, and onely Coverousness in Man; and so for Birds also: Then what Pride is there amongst them? as we may perceive in Peacocks', Turky-cocks, Horses, and many others, and we can guesse at Pride but by the Outward Carriage in Men, so in Beasts: Then they say, Beasts are Temperate, and full of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and that they never surfet themselves with Excess, nor drink, nor commit Adultery; and yet how often have we seen Pigeons break their Crops with their eating? and Dogs and Cats so to over charge their Stomacks with eating, as they are forced to vomit it up again? and many Creatures will burst themselves: And what Man can or will be more drunk than the Ape, if he can got wherewithall to be drunk? And we find few Beasts that will refuse good Liquor, when it is given them, as Horses, Dogs, and the like; and if they had as much as was proportionable to their Bodies, they would be drunk as often as Men; and believe it, if there were Ponds of Wine, as well as of Water, they would drink of the Wine, and leave the Water; and if they had those Meats that Men call Delicious, they would be as Luxurious, and as great Epicures, as Man; for most Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures love sweet things, which shews them Lickerish; besides, Birds will choose the best Fruits in a Garden to eat of; and they love Savoury-meat, for Pigeons will pick holes in Walls for Salt-Peter, and many the like Examples; and that which we call Adultery and Fornication in Men, is common among Beasts, for every Bird and Beast will choose his Mate to breed on; but yet not contented with one, they will strive to take each others Mate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50040:82"/>
away, at least make use of them; and how often do Beasts with Beasts, and Birds with Birds, fall out about it, and beat one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and many times kill one another in the Quarrel? Thus Beasts commit Adultery, as well as Men, if there had been a Law against it; howsoever, they are false in their Loves, and are as Jealous as Men, in taking each others Mate, or making Love to each other, as well as Men and their Wives; besides they will make use of their own Breed, which few Nations will do among Men. Then they say, Beasts have no judgement which to choose and distinguish; but we find Beasts can choose the warmest and safest Habitations; then we see Hounds, that they will smell first one way, then another, but never stay to sent the third way, but run on, as judging of Necessity the Hare must run that way, having no other way left, which is Logick; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all Animals that pursue, or are pursued, shew great Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Wit, both in the choyce of their way, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Pursuit; and the like have those that are pursued, in avoyding the places of Danger, and choosing the places of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, if there be any to be found: And what hath more Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the Bears going backward to her Den? Besides, Beasts know by sight how to distinguish betwixt Friends and Foes; Besides, what Judgement do Birds shew, when they fly in a pointed Figure to cut the Air, that their flight may be easy? Then they say, they have no Compassion; but we see they will bury their Dead, and help one another in Distress, or at least do their endeavour; as a Hog, that is a Creature that sheweth as little Good Nature as any Creature, yet when a Dog bites one of them by the Ear, and the Hog cryes out, all the rest of the Hogs, that are within hearing, will come running to the rescue, although they do nothing but grunt when they come; and though they can do their fellow Hog no good, yet it shews a good will. And again, they say they have no Grief; and yet we see daily, how they will mourn for their Young, or the absence of their Mates; and the Turtle Dove seems never to be comforted, but dyes for Grief. Then they say, Beasts have no Memory, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; which if they had not, how should they return to their Holes, or Nests, when they are once gone out? And there are many Creatures, if they were carried many hundred miles, let them be but loose, and at their Liberty, and they will return to their first Habitation; wherefore they are forced to muffle many Creatures, that they may not see which way they go, because they should not know how to return. Then, that they are not Sociable, nor delight in Society; but we see they will play and sport with one another; and Sheep love Company so well, that they will not thrive, nor grow, but where there are great Flocks of them together. Then, that they have not Fancy; but we see that Nightingales have great Fancy in the variety of their Tones and Notes, and their Invention in many things beyond the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Man. Thus there is no Virtue, nor Vice, as Men call
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50040:82"/>
them, but may be found in other Creatures as well as man, but only we give our Knowledge proper Names, and those none. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they say there is no War nor Tyranny, in other Creatures or Animals, but man; yet certain there are many other Animals more Tyrannical &amp; Cruell even to their own kind, than man, and will take as heavy a Revenge one upon another, and love Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and Power; will not the Cocks fight as fiercely and cruelly one with another for Preheminency, as men? so Bulls against Bulls. They say men have Command over Beasts, but it is as some men have Command over others, that is when they have more Power, as Strength of Body, or advantage of help, either of Numbers, Place, or Time.</p>

                  <p>A good Disposition is caused by an equal Temper of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Body, and an orderly Habit belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; also when the Humours therein be fresh, sweet, clear, and thin.</p>

                  <p>A Hating Disposition is produced from a Weak Constitution of Body, and an overflowing of Malignant Humours, which rise like a High Tide, which cause an Aversion, Loathing, or Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seousness to their Object or Subject.

                  <p>But Passionate Hate makes open War, and onely pursueth that which it thinks is Evil; and is the Champion of Virtue, the Sword of Justice, the Guard and Protector of Innocents, and the Pillar of Commonwealths.</p>

This Loving Disposition proceeds from Moyst Humours, and a Sanguine Constitution, which makes the Disposition fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, or pitiful, tender-hearted (as we say) and Amorously kind. From this Disposition Tears flow often through the Eyes, large Professions and Protestations, fond Embracements, kind Words, and dear Friendships, as long as it lasts, but dissolved upon every small Occasion, and never fails to break all to pieces, and those pieces to rise up as Enemies, if any Misfortune comes.</p>
                  <p>But Passionate Love professeth but a Little, and promiseth Nothing; but will endure all Torments, and dye Millions of several waies, if it had so many Lives to give, for what is loves.</p>

                  <p>But a Cholerick Passion is the Fire of the Mind, giving Heat to the Thoughts, which raiseth Ambition, and gives Courage to the Active, Vigour to the Strong, Quickness to the Words, Confidence to the Countenance, with a Resolved Behaviour, &amp;c.</p>

Those that dye for unlawfull Desires, or in desperate Fury, or the like, these deserve Pity, and Tears of Sorrow, because their Death was their Dishonour; but to dye for their Country, their Religion, Friends, or Chastity, there Tears should be wiped from all Eyes, and Acclamations of Joy should ring for the Renown of such Constant Virtue, as to seal it with Voluntary Death, where Life was onely a Cover to hide it; besides, the Spirits they beget, by example, they give: but this kind of Valour hath few Companions.</p>

But every one (as I said) that will fight, is not Valiant; for some fight through Fear, as when they cannot avoyd the Danger of an Enemy, or when they are forced by Command of Authority to fight, or else they are sure to be punished with a certain Death; some for Shame, some for Example, some for Revenge, some for Covetousness, some out of Despair, some for one thing, some for another: but True Valour fights for no other End but Honour.</p>

But Valour, the Hand of Fortitude, never strikes, but in a Noble Quarrel: for they are not alwaies Valiant that dare fight, but those that fight for Truth and Rights sake, and to defend Innocence from devouring Wrong: but Desperateness followeth its Appetite, and the Hands of Rashness strike at all. But there is no Motion of the Mind that hath more consideration than Fortitude, nor freer from Extravagancies of Anger or Hate, nor loveth Life better, nor more desirous to be from Scars, or shuns Danger more, than True Valour: for true Fortitude cares not to be known so much to others, as to be satisfied in it self, with Noble Thoughts, and Worthy Actions, either to Act Gallantly, or to Suffer Patiently. Neither is True Valour exempted from Fear, for it is afraid of all Dishonour; and though a Valiant Man is not afraid to lose his Life, yet he freely offers it to defend his

Besides, there is no Man so exact, but a Stander by may find some Faults at one time or other, either at his Words, Actions, or Behaviour, especially if Censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; And there is no surer way to judge of a Fool from a Wise Man, than by Exceptions: for a Wise Man takes few Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but makes the best of all things, but a Fool turns all things to the worst sense, and thinks that all things he meets, have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to affront him, which makes all his Thoughts full of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and Discontent; and there is an Old Saying, <hi>A Word is enough to the Wise,</hi> so one may say, A Word is enough to a Fool, as to trouble all the Company he keeps, or comes into; but the World is onely scattered with Wise Men, and filled with Fools, which makes the Wise cautious; for though they will not Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet for quietness sake they are forced to dandle and dance the Humours of Fools upon the Tongue of Fair Words.</p>

                  <p>THere are few Men can be true Friends; A Cautious Man, a Politician, a Casuist, a Jealous and an Amorous Man, a Cholerick and Exceptious, a Facile, a False, and Envious, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull, nor a Coward, or Fearfull Man, for all their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours turn the Byas of Friendship another way: Wherefore a Friend must be Wise, Honest, Valiant, Generous, Constant, Sweet, and Patient Man. But these Virtues seldome meet in one Person, which makes so many Professions, and so few Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in Friendships: yet most think they could be Perfect Friends, although nothing harder to perform: for true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships are neither confirmed, nor known, but in Extremities, and those Extremities are seldome put in use, which makes Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships like Bonds that are unsealed: Neither can a Man so truly know himself, much less another, as to be assured of having a true and a constant Friend, but by being, one himself; for a Man may be a Friend in one Extremity, and an Enemy in the next;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50040:88"/>
nay, a Man may be a Friend a thousand years, and in as many Extremities (if it were possible) and yet one minute may alter him; so Various and Inconstant are the Passions and Affections of Men, and so little do they know themselves, as not onely to be willing to dye, but to have the Courage to endure all the Torments that Life can bear, and yet at some other times of their Lives are so fearfull, as they will part from that which is most dear, but for hopes of Life, or ease from Pain, besides other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accidents of less Consequence than Life, that may cross Friendship; which makes an Impossibility of Friendship in this World, unless a Man had an absolute power over himself, or that he had an unalterable Nature, which is onely in the Society of Angels, and not in the Friendships of Men. But those that may be accounted Friends amongst Mankind, are those that do timely Curtesies; and to choose Friends otherwise, is out of a foolish and affected Humour; for one cannot say, I will choose me a Friend for Conversation onely, but that is no Friendship that is but a Companion; so an Acquaintance, and a Companion, and a Friend, are several: for I may have an Acquaintance with one, and yet not my Companion; and my Companion, and not my Friend; but a Friend makes the Triangle.</p>

                  <head>Friendship of Parents and Children.</head>
                  <p>IT is said, Parents and Children cannot have Friendship; for they must have no tyes of Nature, but be Voluntary and Free; where in Parents it is rather a Self love, or Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest, than a clear Friendship: Where I answer, that there can be no Friendship, but proceeds from Self-love and Interest; for their delight is in their Friend; and to dye for a Friend, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot live without him. Besides, say they, there is a Bar that hinders the Friendship of Parents and Children, which is, the Duty and Respect which ought to be in the Child towards the Parent, and a Reservedness of the Father to the Child: But to my thinking, it is a strange Reason, that Duty and Respect should hinder Friendship, as if Friendship were built upon an open Rudeness; But certainly True Love, which is that which makes Dear Friendships, takes, more pleasure to be Commanded, and to Obey those they love, than to Command, and be Obeyed. Besides, Respect hinders not the disclosing, or the receiving into the Mind, or helping with their Bodies or Estates, or parting with Life, which are the Acts of Friendship; For I take Duty and Obedience to be from the Mind, as consenting to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and respect as towards the Body; by an humble presenting of it self: But a Reservedness of the Parent to the Child, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a proud Insulting, and Love of Authority, than out of Love or Consideration for their good, or to keep their Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for it must be a very Ill Nature, that sweet and kind Perswasions, free and open Relations, seasonable and secret Counsellings, willing and reasonable Actions, shall not onely keep the Natural Love, as from the Child to the Parent, but tye a perfect Friendship, as from Man to Man; unless you will say, there can be no perfect Friendship, except there be an equality of their Ages, which indeed a Child and a Parent can never be even in. But Parents are so far from making of Friendship with their Children, as they know less, and are more unacquainted with them, than with Strangers, by their reserved Formalities; or else they are so rudely Familiar with their Children, as makes their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren rudely Familiar with them; in which kind of Natures and Humours can be no tyes of Friendship, neither with their own, nor Strangers.</p>

                  <head>Of Madness in general.</head>
                  <p>THere are more that run Mad for the loss of Hope, than for the loss of what they have Enjoyed; as for example, How many have run Mad for the loss of their Servant, or Mistress which are called Lovers? but few or none for their Husbands or Wives; every Town, or Kingdome at least, may be an Example of the first, but few in the whole World to be heard of the last. And how many Parents have run Mad for the loss of their Children, because they have lost the hopes of their Perfections, or Excellencies, which Time might have brought forth, that might have been an Honour to their Name and Posterity, which by Death were cut off? So as it is not so much for the present Comfort they lost in their Child; for few Parents make their Children their onely or chief Society; but the expectation of the Future being lost, is that they most commonly run Mad for; for there are none that wish not themselves in a good Condition; and there are very few, that not onely wish themselves in a better Condition, though they have no cause to complain, but hope to be so; and where the Hopes are cut off, and the Desires remain, they must needs grow Impatient, and Impatiency grows Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, and Extravagancy is Madness. But how seldome is it heard, that Children run Mad for their Parents? the reason is, because there is little hopes from them, but of their Estates, or Titles, if they have any; for Men never consider so much what is past, as what is to come, unless it be to compare the past time with the present, that they might guess at the Future: So that there is nothing to hope from Parents, because all things are past from them; for Men joy more in looking forward through their Posterity, than in looking back upon their Ancestors; the one is a Contemplation of Life, the other but a Contemplation of Death; and though they are sometimes proud of their Forefathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Actions, yet they take more delight in the hopes of their own Posterity. And when Men grow Mad for the loss of their Estates, it is not for what they have enjoyed, but for what they would, or might have enjoyed, had not Ill Fortune been, but now they cannot. And when Men fall Mad through Despair, it is because they have no hopes of Heaven: So that Hope is the Life of Mans Thoughts, and the Ground of his Actions; it makes Piety in the Church, and Industry in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; where the want of it is a Death in Life.</p>

                  <head>An Epistle to the Unbelieving Readers in Natural Philosophy.</head>
                  <p>MANY say, That in Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy nothing is to be known, not the Cause of any one thing; which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perswade my self is Truth: for if we know Effects, we must needs know Causes, by reason Effects are the Causes of Effects; and if we can know but one Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is a hundred to one but we shall know how to produce more Effects thereby.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Natural Philosophy is an endless Study, without any profitable Advantage: but I may answer, That there is no Art nor Science but is produced thereby; if we will, without Partiality, consider from whence they were derived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it is impossible that any thing should be known in Natural Philosophy, by reason it is so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and hid from the knowledge of Mankind: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That it is impossible that Nature should perfectly understand, and absolutely know her self, because she is Infinite, much less can any of her Works know her; yet it doth not follow, that nothing can be known; As for example, There are several parts of the World discovered, yet it is most likely, not all, nor may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be; yet most think, that all the World is found, because <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Cavendish</hi> went in a Circular Line, untill they came to that place from whence they set out
<pb facs="tcp:50040:90"/>
at first; and I am confident, that most of all Writers thought all the World was known unto them, before the <hi>West-Indies</hi> were discovered; and the Man that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it in his Brain, before he travelled on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Sea, and offered it to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, was slighted by him as a Foolish Fellow, nor his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence believ'd; and no question there were many that laugh'd at him, as a Vain Fool; others pity'd him, as thinking him Mad; and others scorned him, as a Cheating Fellow, that would have cosened the King of <hi>England</hi> of a Sum of Money: but the Spanish Queen, being then wiser than the rest, imployed him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured a great Sum of Money to set him forth in his Voyage, which when the Success was according to the Mans Ingenious Brain, and he had brought the Queen the discovery of the Golden and Silver Mines, for the Spanish Pistols, Then other Nations envyed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and like a Company of Dogs, which fought for a Bone, went together by the Ears to share with him. So the Bishop that declared his opinion of the Antipodes, was not onely cryed down and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against by the Vulgar, which hate all Ingenuity, but Learned Sages stood up against him, and the Great and Grave Magistrates condemned him as an Atheist for that Opinion, and for that reason put him from his. Bishoprick, and thought he had Favour, in that his Life was spared; which Opinion hath since been found true by Navigators. But the Ignorant &amp; Unpracticed Brains think all Impossible that is not known unto them. But put the Case that many went to find that which can never be found, as they say Natural Philosophy is, yet they might find in the search, that they did not seek, nor expect, which might prove very beneficial to them. Or put the case ten thousand should go so many waies to seek for a Cabinet of pretious Jewels, and all should miss of it but one, shall that one be scorn'd and laugh'd at for his Good Fortune, or Industry? this were a great Injustice: But Ignorance and Envy strive to take
<pb facs="tcp:50040:90"/>
off the gloss of Truth, if they cannot wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. But I, and those that write, must arm our selves with Negligence against Censure; for my part, I do: for I verily believe, that Ignorance, and present Envy, will slight my Book; yet I make no question, when Envy is worn out by Time, but Understanding will remember me in after Ages, when I am changed from this Life: But I had rather live in a General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, than in a Particular Life.</p>

                  <head>Of Philosophy.</head>
                  <p>THere have been of all Nations, that have troubled their Heads, and spent the whole time of their Lives, in the study of Philosophy, as Natural and Moral; the first is of little or no use, onely to exercise their Opinions at the guessing at the Causes of Things, for know them they cannot; the last is a Rule to a strict Life, which is soon learned, but not so soon practiced, as they have made it, in the dividing it into so many and numerous parts, having but four chief Principles, as Justice Prudence or Providence, Fortitude, and Temperance; Justice is but to consider what one would willingly have another to do to him, the same to do to another, which is the beginning of a Commonwealth. Prudence or Providence, is, to observe the Effect of Things, and to compare the past with the present, as to guess, and so to provide for the Future. Fortitude is, to suffer with as little Grief as one can, and to act with as little Fear. Now Temperance is something harder, as to abate the Appetites, and moderate our Passions: for though there are but two principal ones, as Love, and Hate, yet there are abstracted from them so many, as would take up a Long Life to know them after the strict Rules of Temperance. But indeed it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be justly Temperate, as to know the first Causes of all Things; as for example, A Man loseth a Friend, and the Loser must grieve so much, as the merit of the Loss deserves, and yet no more than will stand with his Constitution, which in many is impossible: For some, their Constitution is so weak, that the least Grief destroys them; so that of Necessity he must needs be Intemperate one way, either for the not sufficient Grief for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50040:91"/>
the merit of his Friend, or too little care for himself. So for Anger; a Man must be no more angry, than the Affront, or any Cause of his Anger doth deserve; and who shall be Judge, since there is no Cause or Act that hath not some Partiality on its side? and so in all Passions and Appetites there may be said the like. Therefore he that can keep himself from Extravagancy, is temperate enough. But there are none that are more intemperate than Philosophers; first, in their vain Imaginations of Nature; next, in the difficult and nice Rules of Morality: So that this kind of Study kils all the Industrious Inventions that are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and Easy for the Life of Man, and makes one sit onely to dye, and not to live. But this kind of Study is not wholly to be neglected, but used so much, as to ballance a Man, though not to fix him; for Natural Philosophy is to be used as a Delight and Recreation in Mens Studies, as Poetry is, since they are both but Fictions, and not a Labour in Mans Life. But many Men make their Study their Graves, and bury themselves before they are dead. As for Moral Philosophy, I mean onely that part that belongs to every particular Person, not the Politick, that goeth to the framing of Commonwealths, as to make one Man live by another in Peace, without which no Man can enjoy any thing, or call any thing his own, for they would run into Hostility, though Community of Men will close into a Commonwealth for the Safety of each, as Bees and other Creatures do, that understand not Moral Philosophy, nor have they Grave and Learned Heads, to frame their Commonwealths.</p>
                  <p>NAture is the great Chymist of the World, drawing out of the Chaos several Forms, and extracted Substances; the gross and thicker part goeth to the forming of Solid Bodies, the Fume to Air and Water, the thinnest part to Fire and Light, the Sense or Spirits to Life.</p>

Yet we find, that Nature works not so curiously upon the Essence of Things, as upon the Corporal Substance: for Nature is but rude in the Minds of Men, and so in other Creatures, untill Community and Art have civilized them, and Experience and Learning have perfected them.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50040:92"/>
peace, somtimes forty or an hundred years, nay some above a Thousand (as the <hi>Venetians</hi>) without Civil Warrs; for the old saying is, <hi>So many Men so many Minds;</hi> yet they meet all in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Desires; and naturaly Self-love seeks and strives for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency &amp; Command, which all cannot have, &amp; yet submit and obey, which is strange: But say some, it is Love that Makes, Unites, and Keeps a Common-wealth in Peace; no saies another, it is Fear, and another may say as <hi>Tichobrahe</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> said of the Sun and Earth; For <hi>Ptolomy</hi> saith that the Sun moveth and the Earth stands still, <hi>Copernicus</hi> said that the Earth moved and the Sun stood still, &amp; <hi>Tichobrahe</hi> took up the third Opinion, to which could be added no more but that they both moved: So one may say it is both Love and Fear, since those two Passions most commonly accompany one another. But say they, all things naturally incline to Peace and Unity, and that War is unnatural, because it tends to Destruction; but some may say again, that we find Nature hath made nothing but is subject to Preying, Ravening, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, one thing of another, and that most things live upon the spoil of another, by the Humours, Constitutions, and Desires she hath given them; for in many things their Lives cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist or be nourished, but by the Death of other Creatures; So that Men are not only subject to War upon one another, but all Creatures that Nature hath made, as also the Elements, for what is Thunder, but a War betwixt Heat and Cold? for Nature, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Contrarieties, must needs Dispute when they meet, and are never quieted untill one part get the upper hand; and though Numbers make aConsort, yet they must have a Sympathy one to another. Thus all things are subject to War, yet the Causes are different that provoke them to it; But Nature would have wanted work, if she had made all things to continue, and nothing to decay; for Death is as natural as Life; but it seems to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures great Art to make all things subject to War, and yet live in Peace, as not to make an utter Destruction.</p>

                  <p>THE Air is more corrupted in the Spring and the Autumn, than in the Winter and Summer; for in the Winter it is less corrupted by reason it is more united, as being congealed by Cold; neither hath the Sun that Force, to draw more Vapours than it can digest; besides, for want of Heat the Pores of the Earth are shut, where by less Vapours issue out; and in Summer it hath a sufficient heat to concoct what it draws up, or at least it contracts it so, as to keep it from running into corruption; and the Spring, at the Suns return, opens the Pores of the Earth, suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out Vapour there from, which V pour is like the first milk of a Cow, or the like Udder'd Creature, when they have new cast forth their Birth, which Milk is all corrupted with Blood and Matter, by reason it hath been so long in the Udder; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Vapour is corrupted when it is first drawn as it were by the returning Sun, by reason it wanted Vent and Agitation to purify it, and as it is ascending it mingles with those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that live upon the Earth; for the Pores of the Creatures that live upon the Earth, also open by the springing heat, from whence Vapours like wise do issue from their Bodies; yet they live by the Air that encompasseth them, as Fishes do in Water, which if the Water be corrupted, the Fishes dye, caused by the Malignity they draw in; for though they are not smotherd or choaked, as in Frosty weather; yet could the thinnest Air be so hard and so solidly froze as water which is of a grosser Body, Man and Beast would be smothered for want of Breath, as Fishes are in great Frosts; yet many Creatures of the Earth are frozen to death, not only by having their Limbs Conjealed, Benummed, and Dead, destroying the Natural Motions therin; for surely the thinnest Air being congealed, they can get none to serve for Breath; that is, there is none fit to move the Lungs; for though some Creatures Lungs require grosser Air than others, and some a finer, yet Man and Beast I observe, require a middle temper or mixture; for too thin Air is as unusefull as too grosse; so for the Temper, too hot is as hurtfull as too cold; the one scalds or burns the Lungs, the Brain, and the rest of the inward parts, or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50040:93"/>
sets the Spirits on fire; the other benumbs and stupifies them, at least obstructs them; but when the Air is putrified and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it mingles with the thinner Parts, as the Humours, the Blood and the like, causing corrupted Diseases and putrifyed Limbs: but as I said, the Spring Vapour, which is the rising Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, is like the Beesting Milk; so the Vapour in Autumn, which is the falling Vapour, is like Cheese that is ill prest, or too moist kept, which corrupts and breeds Maggots; so Vapour being not well clarified or concocted by the Sun, becomes Malignant.</p>

                  <p>THere are many sorts of Vapours, according to the several tempets of those parts of the Earth they are drawn from; but when they are drawn to such a height, they all mix, yet seldom so, but that some sort may predominate, whether salt Vapour, sharp Oil, bitumenous, waterish, or grosse and Earthy, as dull and heavy or more light and Aery: Thus the Sun, as I say, draws and mixes, boils and clarifies Vapours; but if there be more than his Heat can overcome, they corrupt and fall back; and that which is thinnest and purest it turns into serene Air, the Crude and Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part it turns into Wind, the Watery part into Rain, the Bitumenous part into Thunder, the Oily part into Lightning or Meteors, the Scum into Clouds, which servs as wicks of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to take Light; the corrupted part insensibly falls back to the Earth again.</p>
                  <p>But when the Malignity of the Earth, and the corruption of the Air, and the distempered Humours of Bodies join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it causeth great and horrible Plagues, making a general Malignity, and untill this Malignity hath spent its strength, with struggling and striving with the strength of Life, it never ceaseth, and at the last it grows fainter and fainter, untill it hath no Power.</p>

                  <p>AS there is a natural Heat and a natural Moisture, proper and inherent in every animal Body; so there is a natural Vapour that is produced therefrom, as a right and natural begotten Child. Or like Chymistrie, where Fire extracts from grosser Bodies, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of Matter, as Smoak, Oil, Essence, Water, Salt, and Incipid Dreggs: so the Natural Heat, on Food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, extracts Vapour, Fat, Blood, Spirits, Sweat, Humours, and Excrements. Now if the Heat be of an equal temper, and the Limbeck, which is the Stomach, free from Defects,
<pb facs="tcp:50040:94"/>
the Digestion is good, which makes the Extraction pure and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; now the thinnest but strongest Extractions are the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or Vital Spirits, the next thinnest and most powerfull is the Vapour, which Vapour is that which reposeth the Senses, and feedeth the Brain, nourishing Imagination, Conception, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and the like, and is the Creator of Fancy and Phantasms; the Grosser part of Vapour is a Smoak that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually issueth out through the Pores, and the like open passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; which Smoak is a superfluity that serves for no use, but may do Mischief if it be stopt, choaking and smothering Life, or at least, causeth such Distempers as may disorder the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but the Animal spirit indeed is a Vapour, which proceeds from the Radical Heat and Moisture of the Body, wherin, if the Heat be too violent, or the Moisture too gross, Quenches or Burns them up; and the Reposing Vapour proceeds from the Natural digesting Heat and Moisture that is in the Body; and the Superfluous Vapour or Smoak proceeds from the actual Heat or Moisture put into the Body by violent Motions, or hot Weather, or hot Meats, or moist Meats, or much Meat or Drink: When these Vapours join to the Natural Vapours of Repose, they cause as it were dead sleeps, as we see by those that have out Eat or Drank their Natural Temper; for though much eating will many times hinder Sleep, by reason it makes the Vapour so gross that it cannot easily flow, yet much Drinking never fails; for a drunken man will be so strongly asleep that he cannot be awaked; but indeed the Senses will be drunk as well as the Brain, which causeth them to be as if they were asleep, but are not, only their Strength is for a time taken away, as being Slack'd or rather as it were drown'd; but when strong sleep is produced by overmuch eating, it is rather an Epilepsie than a natural Sleep, the Brain being as it were almost sinothered with the thick and full Smoak, and the Senses choaked or strangled therewith; and so will the Senses be in these Distempers, untill they are dispersed or rarified, either by Time, Motion, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat; but Temperance causeth sweet, natural, and healthfull Sleeps, being a Vapour that ariseth from a good Digestion, caused by a Natural Heat and Moisture; for when the Stomach is too empty, it hinders Sleep as much as when it is too full.</p>

                  <p>AS Winds make the Cloudes in the Air, and the Waves of the Sea to War, and make a Noise by the beating thereon, so it makes Thunder, for Thunder is nothing, in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but Winds beating upon Christling Drops, which is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter congealed in the middle Region; for Cold knits the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Body into a more Solid, and Winds that are made by Rarification give it Motion, which motion makes it powerfull,

                  <p>THE reason why it'doth not Thunder in the Winter as in the Summer, is, that most of the matter that makes Thunder in Summer, is turned into Wind in Winter; for Water, Air, Wind and Thunder, are all but one Element, only thicker and thinner; <note place="margin">The effects of Water.</note> for Wind is a condensed Air, and Air a rarified Water, and thus by Dilating and Contracting, alter their Forms, and their Properties, which makes that Matter seem of several Qualities, <note place="margin">This common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is held.</note> only works different Effects, and these Effects being different by their several Motions, which give them several Forms, and make <note place="margin">External Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I mean.

But Fire being an Element not subject to change, somtimes parts the Fray, and somtimes sets them more one against another: for in the Summer the Sun being hot, raiseth the Vapour so high that it gets into the Middle Region, and being there condenses into Wind, and when it is there it seeks a Passage out, and so falleth foul upon the Clouds, beating them about untill its Fury and Strength be spent; but in the Winter the Sun-beams being weak cannot draw the Vapour so high, and so blows uppon the Earth and amongst the lower Clouds, which by crushing them together, squeeseth out Rain, or breaks them in sunder, which falls down in Showres; this makes more Rain, and frequenter Storms in Winter than in Summer; and Thunder in Summer, because it is drawn so high that it cannot easily return. Thus Wind in the Middle Region causeth Thunder, and in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (going no further than the lower Region) causeth Storms;

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50040:97"/>
doth not seem probable; for we find by Experience that the Nature of Water being Moist, Soft, and Plyable, doth suck out with the Liquid Tongue, the Salt and Tincture of every Thing, even from the soild'st Body, as Minerals, which are harder far, and more close, than the Porous part of the Earth; And for experience, we see and taste those Waters that run thorow Mines, have not only the Tincture and Taste of those Minerals, but the purging effects which proceed from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture belonging to them; which shews, that it is unlikely that Salt should be taken out of the Water, when Water draws and sucks out all Salt or the like into it self, unlesse they could prove Earth to be more Thin and Liquid than Water, whose Liquid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sucks out all the looser Ingredients, which is not only as I said before the Tincture and Taste, but the natural Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and since it is improbable that the Salt should be retained by the Earth from the Water, but far more probable that the Water should become more salt, from the Earth, which makes me think it is improbable that the Veins of the Earth should be filled with Water immediatly from the Sea; but to my Apprehension they are filled after this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Planets, like Water-Mills, draw up Vapours from the Sea, and the Sun, as the hottest Planet, doth by his heat as it were Calcine the Salt Vapour; although the Vapour cannot be so salt as the Sea-Water, because the Gross Salt is not so light to be drawn up, but rather remains as fixt; but when the Sun hath Calcined it, the Volatil part flyes up to the Body of the Sun, or else staies in the middle Region, and there meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Sulphurous and Bitumenous Matter mixeth therwith, and makes a Matter of the nature of Gunpowder, which shoots Thunder, &amp; flashes Lightning; the Watry part distills back again on the Earth in Showres of Rain, and that fresh Water distilled which falls upon the Earth, soaks into the Earth, and fills the Veins therein, causing fresh Springs to rise where the Veins are too full: But in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the like, where it seldome Rains, because the Sun is there fierce and heady, that it hath not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to draw by degrees as in Vapour, but draws up a Sea at once, which they call <hi>Nilus;</hi> for the Appetite and the Strength joining together, draws up so great a quantity, that the Strength being not able to draw it up high, makes it only swell up, which heaves no higher than to cover the Earth some small depth, as some few Yards, or Feet high; and the Reason why it riseth but twice a year, is, that the Sun is gathering his Forces half a Year to make a sufficient Strength to compass that Work; and the Reason that it seldome or never faileth, is, because it is the Nature of the Sun in those Parts, to draw Moisture after that manner, and what is Natural is a constant Habit or Custome.</p>

                  <p>SOme are of opinion, That the Sea runs thorow the Veins of the Earth, as the Blood thorow the Body of an Animal, as a Man; which, to my reason, is very unlikely; for then there must be much more Water than Earth; if so, the Earth would be drowned with a superabundant quantity, what with the Sea that runs about it, and the Rain that falls upon it, and the Water that runs thorow it perpetually. For put the Case it be as they say, that it runs out at some places, as fast as it comes in at others, yet it would wash and moulder away the Earth by the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and recourse, if not the Solidst part, yet the most Porous part. Besides, if it were so, the Earth would not be so dry as in many places it is, unless they hold, that some parts of he Earth have Veins, and other parts none. But if they say, that the Earth being so much greater in quantity than the Sea, which is the Watry part of the World, it hath not alwaies a sufficient quantity to satisfie the Drought, which causes the Veins to be dry, that Reason would make me think, that there should not be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Quantity of Water to keep in a Body, to make a Sea so large to run about it, especially of that depth the Sea is of, and to run through the vast Earth, besides feeding the Air with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. Thus if there were less Water than Earth, the Earth-Ball would be burnt up, or at least so dry, as to bear nothing; and if the Water were more than the Earth, the Earth would be drowned. Wherefore, in my opinion, the Ingredients of the World are equally mix'd, and proportionably made, as Earth, Water, Air, and Fire; so the Sun proportionable to the rest of the Planets, and the Planets proportionable to the Sun: so that the whole Globe is in equal temper, and the whole Body sound; and though we, who know not the Constitution of the World, may think sometimes the Elements are distempered, which is their natural temper to be so, but not in our knowledge to know how.</p>

                  <p>WE cannot see, with a Perspective glass, the several Drops of the Sea, as we see the several Parts in a Heap of Sand: for if we look into the Sea, it only shews a shining Body; but look on the Sand, and every little Grain will seem a little Stone, and so a small Heap seems like a Rock, and the Perspective shews per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly what it is, because it lyes in distinct Parts which may be magnified: But we cannot magnifie the Drops of Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a Liquid Body, where every part mingles into one another, or cleaves so close, as it becomes one entire Body, so as there are no distinct Parts visible.</p>

                  <p>JUST as a Perspective glass carries the sight afar off, so a Trunk, or Pipe, conveys the sound and voyce to the Ear at a great distance. Thus we may perceive, that the Figure of a round Circle hath the nature to gather up, and to draw to a Point all Species whatsoever: for they do not onely gather these from the Brain, but those that come from outward Objects; and the more round Circles there are, the straiter and further the several Species go, and the sharper is the Point, as being bound, not having Liberty to stray forth. That is the reason, that the longer the Perspective is, or the Pipe, or Trunk, the clearer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter we see, and hear: for a Pipe, or a hollow Trunk, gathers up the several Letters, and Words, as a Perspective gathers up the several Objects. Besides, the Eye and the Ear are much of the nature of a Burning-glass, which gathers all the loose and scattered Beams of the Sun to a Point, becoming there so strong, being united, as the Reflexion strike upon all Bodies, it meets, and peirceth into whatsoever is Porous: Just so the Reflexions of what the Senses have gathered together, strike upon the Optick Nerve, and peirce into the Brain; and if the Species of Sense were so material as those Species which are drawn from grosser Bodies, the Nose would see a Sent, and the Ear see a Sound, as well as the Eyes see a grosser Object which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it: But the Matter being Thin, and Aery, the Objects cannot be so soild and substantial, as to make a Figurative Body to last so long as for our gross Senses to see.</p>

Neither can we rationally think, but the very same Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of all her Principles have been before in the Generality of her Works, although not made known in the Particulars of every of her Works. But every Age are apt to flatter themselves, out of a Natural Self-love, that Nature hath out-wrough her former

                  <p>THE greatest Chymists are of a strong Opinion, that they can enforce Nature, as to make her go out of her Natural Pace, and to do that by Art in a Furnace, as the Elixar, in half a Year, that Nature cannot in a hundred or a thousand Years; and that their Art can do as much as Nature, in making her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals another way than she hath made them; as <hi>Paracelsus</hi> little Man, which may be some Dregs gathered together in a Form, and then perswaded himself it was like the Shape of a Man, as Fancies will form, and liken the Vapours that are gathered into Clouds, to the Figures of several things. Nay, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do more than ever we saw Nature to do, as if they were the God of Nature, and not the Work of Nature, to return Life into that which is dead, as to renew a Flower out of its own Ashes, and make that Flower live fresh again; which seems strange, since we find nothing that Nature hath made, that can be more powerfull, or more cunning, or curious, than her self: for though the Arts of Men, and other Creatures, are very fine and profitable, yet they are nothing in comparison to Natures works, when they are compared. Besides, it seems impossible to imitate Nature, as to do as Nature doth, because her Waies and her Originals are utterly unknown: for Man can only guess at them, or indeed but at some of them. But the reason of raising such Imaginations in Man, is, because they find by practice, that they can extract and divide one Quality from another, though it may be in question, whether they can do it purely or no, but so as to deform that Nature hath formed: But to compass and make as Nature doth, as they imagin they can, is such a Difficulty, as I believe they have not the power to perform; for to divide, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, is to undo; and Nature hath given that Faculty to Man to do some things when he will, but not in all, as, he may ruin and destroy that he cannot build, or renew; &amp; though he be an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as all other things are, to further Natures Works, since she is pleased to work one thing out of another, not making new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for every thing, yet he cannot work as she worketh: for though he can extract, yet he cannot make; for he may extract Fire out of a thing, but he cannot make the principle Element of Fire; so of Water and Earth; no more can he make the Elizar, than he can make the Sun, Sea, or Earth; and so it seems as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50040:100"/>
impossible to make a Man, as to make a piece of Meat, put into a Pot, and setting it upon the Fire, of what temper, or which way he can, he shall never turn it into Blood, as it doth in the Stomack, or make such Excrements as the Bowels cast forth: And to make the Essence of a Flower return into the same Flower again, seems more strange; for first, that Motion is ceased and gone, that gave it that Form; and where they will find that Motion, or know what kind moves it, or what moved it to that Form, I doubt is beyond their skill. Besides, those Qualities, or Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are evapoured out, that gave it that tast, or smell, or that made it such a thing; and though they be never so Industrious to keep those Vapours in, yet they are too subtil to be restrained, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible to be found again, when once they are separated: so as it is as hard to gather the dispersed Parts, as to make the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which none but the God of Nature can do; for it is a hard thing out of the Ashes of a Billet to make a Billet again. But Nature hath given such a Presumptuous Self-love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and filled him with that Credulity of Powerfull Art, that he thinks not onely to learn Natures Waies, but to know her Means and Abilities, and become Lord of Nature, as to rule her, and bring her under his Subjection. But in this Man seems rather to play than work, to seek rather than to find; for Nature hath infinite Varieties of Motions to form Matters with, that Man knows not, nor can guess at; and such Materials and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, as Mans gross Sense cannot find out insomuch that we scarce see the Shadow of Natures Works, but live in Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and have not alwaies that; but sometimes we are in Utter Darkness, where the more we wander, the apter we are to break our Heads.</p>

But Physicians should watch, as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the Stars, with Observations, and in time they may guess so well, as seldom to fail of a Remedy.

                  <p>THE most Renowned and most Learned Physician, Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi> hath found out the Circulation of the Blood, by his industrious study, so methinks it should be very beneficial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the health of Man, to find out the Motion of the Blood, as it runs, whether it hath one intermixing Motion as it runs; or whether the Blood doth not do as the Water seems to do, which going in a swift source, where the following Drops are as great Strangers to the leading Drops, as the situation of either Pole: for though the hinder Drops press forwards, and drive on the former, like Crouds of People, one shuffling another, yet they do not seem to intermix, or incorporate, but rather seem to break, and divide into parts; for if they should intermix, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one drop into another, their intermixing Motion would hinder their running Motion so much, as it would be scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how it went forward; and if the Blood do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix, then some Veins may have foul and corrupted Blood, and some very pure Blood, which we many times see; which makes me think it doth not intermix; if so, we may take out our good Blood, and leave our bad behind us, not knowing where the Corrupted Blood lyeth; and this Corrupted Blood may infect the Vital Parts, as it runs along. This makes some, that when they let Blood in Feavers, they are never the better, because that Vein was not open where it lay: so that Physicians had better strike two or three Veins, and venture the loss of Good Blood, than miss the Bad, for it may corrupt all the rest, though not by intermixing, yet by corrupting the Liver as it floweth.</p>

                  <p>THere are more Diseases come in having too much Blood, than too little: for when the Veins are too full, the Blood hath no liberty to run out, and for want of Motion corrupts, which Corruption bursts out into Small-Pox, Fistaloes, Kings Evils, and many such like Diseases. But if the Humour thrusts not Outwards, it corrupts the Inward Parts, as, the Liver, the Lungs, or else breeds Imposthumes, and many such Diseases. But if there be much Blood, and thin, then by the agitation it grows hot, or else by the many Spirits in much Blood, it begets too much Motion, Motion Heat, and Heat and Motion fires the Blood, and inflames the Spirits, which causeth Feavers of all sorts, Frenzies, and Consumptions; for there may be as well too much Motion in the Body, as too little. But when the Parts of the Body are congeal'd, or tyed up with Cold, then the Blood <note place="margin">Apoplexies come by the stoppage of the Blood.</note> cannot run, nor the Spirits work, but Motion ceaseth, and the ceasing of Natural Motion is Death.

                  <p>THere is nothing preserves Health more, and lengthens Life, than due and just proportion of Diet, according to the strength of the Stomack: for one should eat so, that the Body should feed upon the Meat, and not the Meat to feed upon the Body, as it doth with those that eat more than they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, for the Superfluity makes Slough and Slime in the Body, which Slime drowns the Spirits, slackens the Nerves, corrupts the Blood, and weakens the Body; besides, it bringeth many Diseases. Neither should one eat so little, as to let the Body feed upon it self; for much Fasting dryes the Blood, heats the Body, and fires the Spirits, which Fire once getting into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, is seldome or never cured, being a Hective Feaver. But it is as hard to know a just proportion to the strength of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, as to keep it when they know it. This Knowledge comes by observing the Stomack, for at some times the Stomack re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more than at other times, although the Appetite may be less, when the Stomack is empty, or it is requirable to give it more: for some have such weak Appetites, as they sterve their Bodies, because they would not displease their Tast; or else eat such things as would yield no Nourishment: for there is a great difference between the Appetite and the Stomack.

                  <p>THE Reason is, That one and the same Quality and Quantity of Purging Medicines works so different in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bodies, and at several Times, in one and the same Body, is caused by the Validity and Solidity of the Humour: for the Bodies of Animals are like to several Grounds, some Dusty and Dry, some Stony and Hard, some Tuff and Clammy, as Clay, some Muddy and Dirty, others Washy and Wet; which causeth Husbandmen to yoke more Oxen, or Harness, more Horses, to adde Strength, not onely when their Draughts are heavily laden, but when the Waies are ill, and uneasy to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in: for in some Waies ten Horses will not draw so easy as one in other Waies, or in Winter as in Summer, but are forced to whip and lash, to tug and pull: so are Bodies, where Physick, like Horses, or Oxen, doth pull and gripe the Guts, to draw out clammy Flegm; where, in Light and Sanguine Bodies, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick runs fast, and the Humours follow easily; or in Melancholy, and Dry Waies, where the Humour is so hard, as the Physick rather beats upon it, than penetrates or divides it, and at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Lame, and Weak, as Horses which are foundred; but Cholerick Bodies are like Sandy Waies, where the Humours like Dust, fly about. But there must be several sorts of Physick given to several Constitutions, as Husbandmen sow several sorts of Grain; as, some Humours must be digged up with Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Medicines, other Humours plowed up with Fomenting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; some Humours harrowed with Extenuating Medicines, others raked as with Drawing and Attractive Medicines; some must be watered with Solable and Sucking Medicines, others must be manured and nourished with fine Light-Meats, and Gelly Broths; others must be comforted with the hot Sun of Cordials. Thus if Bodies be not husbanded according to the Nature Constitution of the Soyl, they will never have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Stock of Health to pay Life, their Land lord, his Rent; and Death will seize upon their Lease, as forfeited to him before the Rent-day.</p>

                  <p>THE Animal Spirits are the Radical Vapour in the Body, produced from the Natural Heat, and Radical Moysture: but Obstruction, which comes by Superfluity, stops the Natural Heat, hindring the Extenuating Faculty and Corruption which is caused by Superfluous Moysture; and Unnatural Heat damps the Natural, and drowns the Radical Moysture, by which the Animal Spirits become weak. This is the reason, that those Diseases that come by Obstruction, or Corrupted Humours, make the Body faint and lazy, and the Mind dull and melancholy.</p>

                  <p>HEat and Cold produce many times one and the same Effect: for as Cold draws all Spirits inward, so Heat thrusts all Spirits outwards: for Cold is like a Hook, to pull Heat inward; and Heat like a Spear, or a Staff, to thrust outward; As for example, From Wine is distilled <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or the like, which are Spirits by the means of Fire; and Wine in a Barrel, if it be much frozen, will cause all the Spirits in the Barrel to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the midst, and no Spirits are left in that which is frozen; as likewise in extreme Fear, all Spirits will be drawn to the Heart, as the Center, insomuch as all the rest of the Members will have none left to support them, as they become useless; and in great Heats the Spirits go to the Outward Parts, and leave the Inward Parts so voyd, as they become saint and exhausted, for want of their help.</p>

                  <head>The Difference of Heat and Cold in the Spring and Autumn.</head>
                  <p>THE Face of the Earth is like the Hearth of a Chimney, and the Sun as the Fire that lyeth thereon; that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the Spring is not so warm as the Autumn, or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn so cold as the Spring, because the Sun is not so hot in the Winter to heat the Earth, as in the Summer: for as the Hearth of a Chimney will require some time to be heated, after the Fire is laid thereon, so it will retain a Heat sometimes, after the Fire is taken therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Likewise this is the reason, that it is coldest just before the break of Day, because at that time the Sun hath been longest absent: for there is some Heat in the Night, though but weak; not but that the Night may be hot, when the Day hath been cold: but then that Heat proceeds rather from the Bowels of the Earth, than the Beams of the Sun; for though the Sun may have a Constant Heat, yet his Beams have not, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, some Summer Daies are much colder than others; for some Daies may be hotter when the Sun is Oblick, than when it is Perpendicular over our Heads, by reason that cold and moyst Vapours may arise from the Earth, and as it were quench the Violent Heat in the Beams of the Sun; and Wind may cool the Heat also, or Clouds may obstruct the Heat, as a Skreen set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire: yet neither Wind, nor Vapour, nor Clouds, can alter the Heat inherent in the Sun, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Of the Sickness in the Spring.</head>
                  <p>THE Reason there are more sick in the Spring than in the Winter, is, that the Pores of the Body being closer shut in Winter, by the Contraction of the Cold, than in any other Season, keeps in the Fire, the Smoke, and Vapour, that should, and would if it could, issue out: But the Parts being stopp'd,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50040:104"/>
having not a sufficient Vent to transport a proportionable Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, it lyes and corrupts; for want of Agitation, the Quantity increasing, it overcharges the Body, that by such time the Spring is arrived, the Body is so distempered, as it falls sick, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption having bred a Malignity that infects the Noble Parts.</p>
                  <p>For the Body having more Vapour than the Natural Heat can digest, makes it not onely corrupt, for want of a sufficient Heat to purifie it, but that Corruption quenches out the Natural Heat, which causeth Agues; and begets an Unnatural Heat, which causeth Feavers, and the like Diseases; and the Corruption causeth the Small-Pox, Meazels, Imposthumes, Soar Throats, and many such kinds of Diseases.</p>
                  <p>But when this Distemper of the Body is joyned to the like Corrupted Vapours drawn from the Earth, it is most commonly deadly, and produceth great Plagues the Summer following, the Body being then like Rotten Wood, which is quickly set on Fire, and soon burnt out.</p>
                  <p>But if the Body hath a Sufficiency of Natural Heat to clarifie the Vapour, that arises from the Stomack, and Bowels, and to dry up the Superfluous Moysture, the Body is safe from Danger: but if the Body have more Heat than Moysture, it feeds upon the Noble Parts, and causeth Hective Feavers.</p>
                  <p>But Hective Feavers are seldome cured by the stoppage of the Pores: for the Natural Heat in the Body is like External Fire, which is extinguished if it be stopp'd, and hath not Vent.</p>
                  <p>But there are several sorts, or kinds, or manners of Unnatural Heat, caused by Obstructions, and other Accidents; as there is a Smothering Heat in the Body, caused by Obstructions; and there is a Smoking Heat of the Body, caused by too violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Motions. or such Meats that actually heat; also a Fiery Heat in the Body, caused by too much, and too strong Interior Motion: but these Heats, that are Moyst Heats, and Unnatural, cause Corruption.</p>

                  <head>Of the Sickness in Autumn.</head>
                  <p>THE Reason there is more Sickness in Autumn than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is, that the Powers of the Sun abating, let fall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all the Dregs and Dross of that Vapour it drew up from the Earth, when it was in its full Strength; which having more power to draw, than to digest, the Superfluity corrupts; which Corruption falls back upon the Earth, infecting the Air, also the Bodies of Men, and many times Beasts: yet the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is received, or infects, according as the Bodies are tempted: For if the Bodies are full of Humours, and the Blood corrupt, the Air is apt to catch hold, as having a Sympathy each to other, for as the old Proverb is, <hi>Like will to like;</hi> and those Bodies, and also those Meats, that are moyst, are most apt to corrupt: for Heat and Moysture are said to be the Father and Mother to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50040:105"/>
Curruption, which causeth those that eat much Fruits and Herbs in the Summer time, to fall into Fluxes, and Feavers, and the like Diseases, in the Autumn; for those Humours that are bred in the Summer, the Body strives to cast forth in Autumn, like a Child birth; for when the Humours are come to such a Growth, the Body is in travel with painfull Throbs, and strives to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; where some are soon delivered of their Burthen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dye in their Labour.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Diseases of the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</head>
                  <p>THE Diseases in the Spring are Agues, Small-Pox, Meazels, Imposthumes, and the beginning of Plagues; for all the Malignity that was tunn'd up in the Body in the Winter, is set abroch in the Spring, by the returning Sun, whose Beams, though weak, yet peirce, like small Gimlets, or Spiggots, all the Pores of the Earth, and the Creatures thereon. The Diseases in the Summer, are Phrenzies, by reason the Heat burns and inflames the Spirits; and Plagues, by reason the Heat inflames those Malignant and Corrupted Humours that the Winter hath bred by Obstructions, like Houses that are musty, and fusty, and smoky, and foul, for want of Air to sweeten them; and full of Spiders, and Cobwebs, and Flyes, and Moths, bred from the dusty dirty Filth therein, for want of Vent to purge them, for the Winter shuts up all the Windows and Dores, which are the Pores; likewise the Blood corrupts, and the Body is apt to rot, like Linnen, that is laid up damp, or in a moyst place; for the Rheums that are subject to be in the Winter, corrupt and rot the Lungs, and the Vital Parts of the Body; likewise Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faintings are Summer-diseases, by reason the Natural Moysture is rarified so thin, and the Pores open so wide, as it evaporates all out, even the Radical Moysture, and the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits issue out therewith.</p>
                  <p>The Diseases of Autumn are Fluxes, by reason the Summer breeds sharp Humours, with the Heat and the Drought; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Diets of Men are crude and raw in that Season, as eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fruits, Roots, Herbs, and the like. Also this Season is subject to Meagrums, and Feavers, which are also caused by sharp Humours; likewise Head-akes, and Vomitings, caused by sharp Chorerick Humours, which the Summer Diet breeds; likewise Plurisies, that are caused by burnt or corrupted Blood, which is bred by too much Heat, or an Unnatural Heat, and a Supersluity of Moysture; also Collicks, by reason the Summer rarifies the Vapours into Wind, which causeth not onely in the Bodies of Men great Collicks, but in the Bowels of the Earth, which causeth Earthquakes, and great Tempestuous Winds in the Air; for in this Season of the Year there are greater Winds
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50040:105"/>
than in any Season, and hold the longest: for though in <hi>March,</hi> when the Pores of the Earth are first opened, as I may say, by the returning Sun, whereupon the thinnest Matter will first fly out, yet those Winds are neither so strong, so long, nor so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as those in Autumn.</p>
                  <p>The Diseases of the Winter are Coughs and Rheums, by reason the Pores being closer drawn, and the Air grosser and thicker in Winter, it doth as it were daub rather up, like Morter upon a Wall that hath Holes and Crevises, than enter in; which causeth a closer Stoppage; which Stoppage causeth Dew, and Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for the Heat and Moysture stewing together, the Body becomes like a Still, or rather like a Pot, or Vessel, that is close covered, which hath Meat, or some Liquid Substance in it, where by Heat, the Moysture thereof, is rarified into Vapour and ascending to the Cover, and at the Top as the Cover there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, finding a Depress, straight gathers into a Dew, and so into Drops; then falls, having a sufficient Vent, like Showers of Rain, where some run through the Pipes of the Nostrils, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some through the Gutter of the Throat, and some fall streight down on the Stomack, as the Earth: for as it is the Nature of Vapour to spread, and to ascend, as being Light and Thin; so it is the Nature of Water to descend, or to run streight forth, by reason it is more Solid, and Weightier likewise.</p>
                  <p>Likewise Coughs are Followers and Attendants of Rheums, which by tickling those Parts where it falls or trickles along, causeth a straining, and so a coughing, though many times Wind produceth the same Effect by a tickling touch. Also Sneezing is an Attendant to Rheum and Wind, and causing a tickling on the Brain, or in the Nose: for indeed Sneezing is nothing but a Cough through the Nose, as through the Throat. Likewise Tooth-aches are caused by Rheums: for the Rheum falling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rots the Bones, or makes Holes therein; like as Water, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually dropping on a hard Stone, works a Passage thorow. Also Soar Throats are caused by Rheums; but that is when the Rheum is sharp or salt. Then Winter is subject to cause Apoplexies, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies, numb Palsies, and Gangrenes, that are caused by the stoppage of the Pores, which, as I said, are not only drawn closer by Cold, which makes the Skin thicker and harder, but by the gross and thin Air, which is contracted into a more Solid Body by Cold. Thus the breathing Passages of the Body being stopp'd, there flyes up so much grosser Vapours to the Head, as <note place="margin">Vapoun thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Flegm; Cold congeals it Stone, Heat confirms it like Metal.</note> choaks the Brain, and smothers the Vital Spirits there; and the Body having less Vent in Winter than in Summer, grows so full of Humours, as obstructs the Nerves and Muscles, with cold, clammy, or hard baked Flegm, as they cannot stir with a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Motion; for in the Nerves and Muscles doth the Sense of Touching live; and where they cease from moving, those Parts are dead and numm'd. Gangrenes are produc'd by the benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Spirits, as when the Spirits are congeal'd to Ice,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50040:106"/>
which causeth in very cold Countryes, as <hi>Russia,</hi> or the like, to have their Noses and Fingers fall off from their Faces and Hands. Likewise, if the Spirits are quenched out with too much Moysture, or their Motions hindered by some Obstruction, or as it were corrupted by some Blow, Bruise, or Wound, those Parts, for want of Lifes Motion, gangrene, and so rot off. Likewise Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staloes are subject to this Season, because this Season being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to breed Rheums of all Sorts and Natures, according as the Humours are in the Body, so it breeds that sharp Rheum which makes Fistaloes: for that Humour is as sharp as <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and it doth in the Body as <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> doth on Metal, running about, and eating holes quite thorow. Also this Season is subject to hard white Swellings, bred by cold, clammy, or tough Humours. The Stone and the Gout reign in every Season, but not in every Age: for though Children have the Stone many times, yet seldome or never the Got: But the Gout, although its not the Stone in the Toe, yet it is an Humour which is of the Nature of Lime, which is somewhat of a Brimstony, Hard, Dry, Bitumenous Humour.</p>

                  <p>AN Apoplexy is a dead Palsie in the Brain, and a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, a numb Palsie in the Brain; And the reason many times why dead and numb Palsies, when it takes them on one Side, ruin the Legs, or Arms, and yet live, is, because it hath not touched the Vital Parts, which is caused by some Obstruction in the Veins, or some of the Nerves, which either is by gross and thick Blood, or hard and crusted Flegm, or cold and clammy Flegm: But if it be in the Head, which we call Apoplexies, it is either caused by a Cold Humour in the Brain, which doth as it were congeal and freez up the Spirits; or by a Malignant Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, proceeding from the Stomack, or Bowels, which Vapour choaks or smothers up the Spirits. And indeed the greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Brain is the Vapour that proceeds from the Ill-affected Bowels, or Stomack: for Vapour, being Smoke, ascends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Head, which is the Chimney of the Body, where the Smoke vents out; for the Bowels may be compared to the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50040:106"/>
Hearth; the Stomack to the Pot, or Furnace; the Meat to the Fuel; the Heart to the Fire, or Flame, which is fed by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or Oily Substance; the Lungs the Bollows, to keep it alive; the Head, as I said, the Chimney, to gather up the Smoke; the Nose, Mouth, and Ears, the Tunnels from whence it issues out: for if the Nose and Mouth be stopped, the Fire of Life goeth out, and not having Reviving Air, it is choked with its own Smoke: for though the Pores of the Body do evaporate some of the Smoke, yet that is onely the thin and subtiller Part; but if the Pores of the Body be stopped by a Cold, the Body shall grow Feaverish with it, so that many times it sets the House on Fire; and when the Head is Idle and Frantick, it is because the Head, which is the Chimney-top, is set on Fire by the Feaver: but the Vapour that ascends to the Head, is either a great Friend or Enemy to the Wit; for a Gross Vapour chokes the Wit, a Thin Sharp Vapour quickens it, a Cold Vapour congeals it, a Hot Vapour inflames it, and several sorts of Vapour make va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Wit, and the several Figures, and Works, and Forms, that that Vapour, which is a Smoke, raiseth up, cause se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Imaginations, and Fancies, by giveng several Motions to the Brain.</p>

Thus a Feaver is caused by the Humours of the Body, which being not well tempered, sets the Barn, which is the Body, on Fire, by the Corruption therein; for Heat and Moysture are the Parents to Corruption. But there is a Natural Heat and Moysture, which produceth Legitimate Issues; and there is also an Adulterate Heat and Moysture, from whence proceed Bastardly Diseases, which are as Numerous, as Natural Children.</p>

                  <p>SLeeping and Waking are the flowing and ebbing of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour: for when Vapour flows to the Extreme Parts, it causeth Sleep, as it were, for a time; Or filling up all the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senses, as Water doth a Pipe, or a Vessel, or as Wind doth a Bladder, where nothing can be received therein, untill they be empty: so no Outward Objects can enter in at the Five Senses, untill the Vapour wherewith they are filled be dispers'd; or falling back, by contracting into a Lesser Compass; which when they are contracted or dispers'd, they wake; so that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour in the Body is as necessary for Life, as Food; And indeed Food is the chief Cause of Vapour; for Heat and Moysture make Vapour; and like as Food, received into the Body, doth either distemper or nourish it, so doth Vapour that slows in the Body, make Sleep sound and easy, or trouble some and unquiet; for Malignant and Corrupted Vapours are like Malignant and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Humours: for as Malignant Humours cause the Body to be sick or painfull, so Malignant Vapours cause Sleeps to be full of Dreams, Startlings, and often Wakings; though many times Dreams are caused by Rarified Vapours, like a Wind which blows upon the Brain, causing many Motions therein; or rather furrows the Grosser Vapours, causing them to role in Billows and Waves, hindring them from flowing easy and smooth; which Tempestuous Winds beat the Vapours backward, as it were, or drive them from the utmost Extent, which hinders the Senses from being thorowly fill'd, which causeth not so sound Sleeps: for when the Senses are not fill'd, the Vapours are like Water in a Vessel not half full, which when it is quite full, there is little or no Motion; though the Vessel be moved, the Water stirs not much: but when it is but half full, or three parts, when the Vessel is stirred, it flashes and sprinkles about.</p>

                  <p>SOme and the same things, or Acts, will cause Sleep, or put by Sleep; as for the Passions, sometimes Grief, Joy, Anger, and the like, will cause Sleep, othertimes hinder it; the reason is, according as the Passions work inwards, or extend outwards: for when the Passions settle or move most inwards, they draw all the Vapours backwards; and when they flow outwards, they carry Vapours with them; and as Passions many times carry out Vapours, so Vapours many times carry out Passions, as we may observe by the Effects, as Sighing, Groaning, and Weeping, as Railing, Threatning, Cursing, Fighting, Laughing, Hooping, Hollowing, Praising, Singing, and Dancing, which are all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Motions: But where they work inward, the Heart beats, or works, and the Brain thinks stronglyer than the Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution requires; which Motion causeth Unnatural Heat, which drinks up the Vapours; or else the Brain, or the Heart, are so strongly bound to an Object, and holding as it were so fast thereon, as it draws all the Powers of Life to assist therein: This causeth Deep Musing, Heart-griping, fix'd Eyes, and slow Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which draws the Vapours so much inward, as almost extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth the Fire of Life, and smothers the Understanding, starves the Body, and makes the Senses unusefull; and many times the Slow Motions congeal the Vapours, like Ice, making them unapt to slow.

                  <p>AGues are half Sisters to Feavers, which are like Fuel half dry, set on Fire by Accidental Motions, and not kindled by a Natural Course: This Fuel half dry, is Humour half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; the other part raw, and undigested, which is like Hay, or the like, not dryed enough by the Sun: so Digestion wants Natural Heat to dry, which is, to concoct the Superfluous Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: for when the Moysture is too much for the Heat, although it be not sufficient to quench it out, yet it doth damp and smother in the Heat, staying the Quickness of the Motion, blunting the Edge and Sharpness, allaying the Penetrating Faculty; and the Heat being not strong enough to drink up the Superfluous Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture at once, but onely hath so much strength as to rarify it into Vapour, which Vapour is Smoke, which Smoke is thinner and thicker, according to the quantity and quality of the Moysture, or as the Heat and Moysture doth predominate; for when the Heat is Master, the Vapour is so thin, as it flashes into a Flame, as Lightning from a Cloud, which is an Intermixing Feaver; but when the Moysture is Mistris, and predominates, the Vapour is more Gross; which Gross Vapour doth not onely quench out that Flame caused by the Unnatural Heat, but stops and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Extenuating Faculty of the Natural Heat, like as a Cloud should obscure the Sun, obstructing his Beams, which disperseth his Heat by the Line of his Light, which causeth the Air to be Dark and Cold. Thus in the midst of Summer, when the Sun is at the height of his Glory, a Dark Cloud, made of Vapour, will cause the Complexion of his Light to be of a Black Pale, and the Body of the Day to be Cold; But when the Sun breaks thorow by degrees, he dissipates those Black and Sullen Clouds, rarifying the thinner part into Wind, and the thicker condenses into Water; the one bloweth over, the other showers down: So those that have Agues, their Flesh looks with a blue, black, pale, and is very cold to the Touch; but when the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat dissipates, that Cold and Gross Vapour that is raised from a raw, or half concocted Humour, the thinnest part spreads about the Body, like the Wind, getting into every Cranny, Corner, or Part of the Body, as Veins, Arteries, Muscles, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, putting the Body into a Violent and Unnatural Motion, which is the Shaking Fit; and when the Rarified Vapour is spent, the Shaking Fit ceaseth, and goes over; and then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient entreth into a Burning Heat; for the Unnatural Heat, which was involved in the Grosser Vapour, as Fire in Clouds, which lightens and thunders, begins to break thorow, especially when it is helped by the Sun, which is as the Natural Heat of the Body; the Body, as the Air, grows soultry hot, and the Heat dissipating those Foggy and Cloudy Vapours in the Region of the Body, condenseth the Gross Parts into Water, which issueth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50040:108"/>
forth in Sweat, as Showers of Rain. Thus when the Vapours are dispersed, and breathed out of the Body, thorow the Pores of the Skin, or otherwise, the Body is like the Air, Serene and Clear, untill there are more Vapours ascended from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and half concocted Humours, which sometimes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sooner, and sometimes are longer before they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into Clouds again: This is the reason some have Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidians, Tertians, Double-tertians, and Quartans.</p>

                  <head>Of a Hectick Feaver.</head>
                  <p>MOST Hectick Feavers are caused by an Excessive Heat in the Arteries, which Heat is more difficult to quench, than to stop a prickt Artery: for in this case letting Blood doth more harm than good, by reason that the Moysture of the Blood strives to quench the Fire therein, or at least to temper the Heat thereof; for it is Wet that puts out Fire, not Cold; for hot Water will as soon put out Fire, as cold Water. Neither can the keeping in the Blood cure the sick Patient, it may some short time retard Life from expiring; the reason is, because the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Heat not onely corrupts the Blood, and melts the Fat of the Body, but it doth evaporate Life forth, like boyling Water, that consumes in Smoke. Thus it becomes an Incurable Disease, when once the Heat overpowers the Moysture.</p>

                  <head>Of Coughs.</head>
                  <p>THere are many several sorts of Coughs; some proceeding from a Superfluity of Moysture, others from too much Heat; some from a Corruption of Humours, others from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Inward Parts; others from sudden Colds upon great Heats, and some proceed from Wind, likewise from sharp salt Rheums, and some from fresh Rheums. Those that proceed from a Superfluity of Moysture, are strong Coughs, that raise up Flegm: for in that sort of Coughs, when the Stomack is full of Humours, the Flegm riseth highest, like the Scum of a Pot on the Fire, or like Whites of Eggs that are put into any hot Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and when the Stomack is hot, it boyls up like a seething Liquor, which boyling or seething provokes to strain; which straining is not so violent, as to vomit: for those sorts of Coughs are of the nature of vomiting, as in straining, or striving, or shuffing upward; but by reason it is not so violent a Motion as Vomiting is, it onely provokes to Cough, bringing up Flegm, or Water, with the Motion thereof. After the like manner are such sort of Coughs as proceed from Corrupt Humour, and most commonly are the Fore-runners of the Small Pox, Meazels, or the like Diseases.</p>
                  <p>But Coughs that proceed from a great Heat, either in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or Bowels; the reason is, that the Heat causeth a great
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50040:109"/>
Vapour, which Vapour ascending to the Head, there gathers into Clouds of Water, where dissolving, it falls back again, like Showers of Rain, where it sometimes falls in pouring Showers, other times like mizzling Rain. And the fuller of Moysture the Body is, the greater Showers of Rain fall down. This stopping the Passages of the Throat, causeth a straining and striving in the Throat, as when any thing goeth awry, or Crums or Bones lye in the Throat, or stop the Wind-pipe: for every part of the Body, if it be bound, or hurt, will strive and strain to help it self. But if the Constitution of the Body be Naturally or Accidentally Dry, the Vapour is thinner, and then it ariseth, like a steam in a Still, or Limbeck, where the Head, like the top of a Still or Limbeck, gathers that steam into a Dew, which falleth back in distilling Drops; which Drops trickling down the Throat, as Tears on the Cheeks, do rather tickle the Throat, than stop the Wind-pipe, or strain the Throat: but if the Rheum be sharp, or salt, it causeth a gentle smart, which is of such a kind of touch as tickling is; provokes a faint or weak Cough.</p>
                  <p>But Coughs that proceed from a decay of Parts, are, when any part of the Body is corrupted it becomes less solid; as from being a Solid Flesh, to be of a Jelly Substance, which dissolves with the least Heat, melting by degrees away; and as it melts, it falls into liquid Drops, which Drops tickle or smart those parts they fall or trickle on: for by reason the Inward Parts are as it were raw, or very thin skinned, they make it sensible of the least touch; besides, there is a faint strife, when the dissolved part falls from the other, which strife tickling, causeth a Cough; but the Cough is more or less, according as the part dissolves. But these tickling Coughs are the most dangerous Coughs, for the one causeth a Consumption, the other is caused by a Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: for when these tickling Coughs proceed from the Body, they are caused from a Consuming Part, that melts and dissolves by degrees; but when it is Distillation from the Head, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts Parts by falling thereon, like as Water, with a constant dropping, will penetrate thorow a Stone; much more may a Constant Distillation corrupt a Spungie Matter, as Flesh; and according as the Rheums are fresh, salt, or sharp, the Parts decay flower or faster: for salt, or sharp Rheums, ulcerate the Parts, and destroy them soon.</p>
                  <p>Also Wind will cause a tickling in the Throat, as a tickling in the Nose, which causeth Coughs; for Sneezing is but a Cough thorow the Nose: but when Wind riseth thorow the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, it causeth a Chine-cough; for as long as the Wind ascends, the Patient cannot draw in Air, but coughs so long, without drawing in of the Breath, till they are black in the Face, being as it were choak'd or strangled, or rather smothered almost to Death.</p>
                  <p>As for Remedies, those Coughs that proceed from a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluity of Moysture, or from Corrupted Humours, there must be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50040:109"/>
applyed purging Medicines, and letting of Blood: but for Coughs that proceed from Decayed Parts, there is no help for them: for when the Intrals are corrupted, and wasted, they cannot be restored again, nor made as they were before; nor can they be healed up, if they be ulcerated, as the Outward Parts of the Body can; for we cannot come so easily to lay Plasters, and Pultesses, to draw out the Corruption, and Putrified Humour from the Sounder Parts, that are not corrupted; yet there may be given, or taken, such Medicines, as may prolong or retard the hasty Wast; which Medicines must be cooling and clensing, as Julips made of Burrage-water, Plantain-water, with Sirrop of Suckery, and Sirrop of Burrage, and Bugloss, and the like; Also, Broths with Cooling Herbs, as Strawberry-leaves, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Suckery, and the like. But no Hot Sirrops, nor no Sharp Herbs, as Sorrel, and the like; nor no Hot Herbs, as Thyme, Rosemary, Winter-Savery, Marjerum, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Also I should think Almond-milk should be very good; for the French barley, that is boyled in the Water, is both cooling and clensing, and quenches out the Fiery Heat; and Almonds are healing and smothering. But in these Diseases, Physicians do most commonly give those Medicines which are very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, as Mithridate, Brimstone, Saffron, Licquerish, and Hot Cordials; those Hot Medicines, instead of comforting those Decayed Parts, rather inflame them; and the Heat therein dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves and melts them more hastily away.</p>
                  <p>But those Medicines are more proper for those that are stopped in their Stomack or Head by Cold, which hath congealed the Vapour into Icy Contraction, Hot Medicines rarifie it thin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; although many times Cold causeth an Unnatural Heat, by stopping by Contraction the Pores of the Flesh, keeping in, and hindring the Smoke of the Body from breathing forth; which Smoke smothers the Inward Parts, causing thereby a Suffocating Stoppage; whereupon Cold Medicines give the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient more ease than Hot, as it hath been found by Experience.</p>
                  <p>But for those Coughs that proceed from a tickling Rheum from the Head, the best Remedies are Issues; the next is letting a little Blood; the third, to give the Patient Cooling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, such as I named before, especially Almond-milk; for it doth not onely quench the Unnatural Heat, but it allayes and tempers the salt and sharp Vitriols that are most commonly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in those Rheums: Yet there must alwaies be a care, that they do not weaken the Stomack by over-cooling Drinks: wherefore they must drink but a little at a time, and at certain times, as, not upon a full Stomack, but when the Stomack is most empty, for then it works better Effects, and hinders not Digestion. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Consumptive-coughs, the Patient must not use any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Exercise, so as to heat the Body, but must use Moderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises. Likewise their Meats must be light of Digestion, and rather to eat Boyl'd-meat than rosted, and rather Flesh-meat
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50040:110"/>
than Spoon-meat; provided, that they be Fine Meats, as Pullet, Chicken, young Turkyes, Partridges, and the like; young Rabbits are also good, and Pigs, Lamb, and the like; but not to eat too much at one time, nor to eat untill they feel the Meat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested; <note place="margin">The Salt that is in the Blood remains more in Rost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats than in Boyld-meats, for the Water sucks it forth.</note> for Ill Digestion causeth an Unnatural Heat, and breeds the Body full of sharp Humours.</p>
                  <p>As for Chine-coughs, those Medicines must be applyed, as do expell Wind, and to purge away the raw and unconcocted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that produce Wind.</p>

                  <head>Of the Disease called the Small-Pox.</head>
                  <p>SMall Pox, or the like Diseases, are caused either by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Humours: for the Body having more than it can discharge, it lyes and corrupts; Or else by an Evil Diet, or an Ill Digestion, which breeds more Humours than Good Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or by great Heats, or sudden Colds. Of this Disease many dye, that would otherwise live, if they were rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their Sickness; unless the Corruption hath taken hold on the Noble Parts, before it begins to break forth, and then there is no Cure; Otherwise I believe it is as easy a Cure, as any Disease, if Moderation be used: for those that strive hastily to throw out the Corruption by forcible Medicines, as those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that are hot, do like those that take out Dirt out of a Ditch, not taking time to sling it far enough; and to disperse it several waies, throw it on a high Heap, on the Verge, or Edge of the Ditch; and being too great a Quantity to consist in one Body, or to keep one place, falls back again, carrying some part of the Bank, or Earth it lay on, along with it: So in the Diseases of the Small-Pox, striving to cast out the Corruption, it falls with greater Violence, and deadly Effects, back again. Besides, most commonly this Disease is accompanied with a Feaver, and all hot Medicines increase a Feaver, and many times it is a Feaver that kils, and not the Pox; And it is to be observed, that where one lives, that hath very Hot Medicines applyed to him, ten will dye. But in these Diseases there must be applyed gentle dilating Medicines; and those that are smoothing and healing, as Possets made with very small Alc, with Figs, Rasins, and Lickerish boyled therein: Also a little letting Blood is very good, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be Feaverish, although some account it deadly, but certainly it is a safe Remedy. As for Purging Medicines, they are very dangerous, for drawing in the Humour; but a Vomit is not amiss, for that doth rather cast forth, than draw inward; neither must they keep them too hot in their Beds, nor too cold, but of a temperate heat.</p>
                  <p>Gargarizing is also very good in this Disease, for it doth not onely purge the Head of Corrupted Humours, where it is most commonly over-charged, but it keeps the Throat safe, and clear from Scabs, or at least mollifies them.</p>

                  <p>ALL Dry Bodies may use more Violent Exercises, with less Danger, than Moyst, where Heat and Moysture produceth Corruption; where to Dry Bodies, the Heat onely makes it more dry, but not corrupts: The onely Danger is, Violent Exercise to Dry Bodies may wast the Radical Moysture, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Spirits, which produceth Frantick Feavers: But when a Moyst Body is over-heated, the Blood is apt to putrisie, the Humours to corrupt, the Fat to melt, Vapours to arise; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Small-Pox, Meazels, Plurisies, Collicks, and very often Consumptions, by disordering or melting the Noble Parts in the Body; but especially, if a sudden Cold be taken upon a great Heat, for the sudden Cold strikes the Heat so violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as Extraordinary Motion doth either set the Body on Fire, or melts it, as Metal in a Furnace, producing an Unnatural Heat in the Arteries, and inflames the Vital Spirits therein, which produceth incurable Hectick Feavers.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50040:112"/>
hot, which otherwise were not; but I answer to that, that the pressing with the Teeth makes the Liquor not less hot than another Press doth, and for the Age it may grow the hotter for being sharpened; but we find that it is very hot in the Press or Vat, for the very Steam where they are prest, will make men drunk, and they will go into the Liquor new prest, finding a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in curing cold Diseases; but no question some Fruits are hotter than others (though none are cold) by having more or less spirits; but all spirits have a sufficiency of spirits to heat, and the spirits lye in the Liquor, not in the Solid parts, for all spirits dwell in the thinnest Bodies or Parts, and are the subtillest in Operation; now may the solid part of Fruit be cooling, when the spirits, which are the thinnest Juice, are hot, as being baked, roasted, or boiled; where the effect of the Fire hath evapoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Heat: But this Opinion is begot, by seeing many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which eat much Fruit, become pale and sickly; so men, by drinking much Wine, will become pale and full of Diseases, and many times will have the contrary operation of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions, and become very Red, though the inward cause is all one: for in some it soaks and dries up all the Blood, or rarifies too thin, which makes the Face pale; and in others it burns and crusts the Blood, which makes the Face Red and Pimpled, so that it dries the Body by the Vitriol Humour, and burns the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the unnatural Heat therein. Another Opinion why they hold them cold, is, by the often Surfets many fall into by the much eating of it; and the reason they give, is, because it is so cold it cannot digest. I answer, that Surfets are caused by the Quantity, and not so much by the Quality: for there are many that surfet of strong Wines, by over-charging their Stomacks therewith; and so in all Meats, which otherwise are good and wholsome, if not immoderately taken, but according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting Stomacks: for some will surfet of that Quantity, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall not with ten times more; such difference is in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Constitutions of Men. There are many things by the effect cooling, by being applyed outwardly, which applying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, work the contrary: for Vinegar cooleth outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slammations, but shal increase an inward one, being too tender for so sharp a Medicine; and all things that corrode, make too much Motion, and all Motion heats. All Limmons, Citrons, Oranges, Pomegranates, Barberies, Currans, and the like, are accounted very cooling, being inwardly taken, and also very wholsome, which may be very good and effectual, being applyed to such Diseases as require a sharp Medicin, thogh not cooling: But if they were cooling by their nature, as there is no great reason to believe it, having as much Spirits as other Fruits have, by reason of their fulness of Liquor, though I do not say that all sorts of Liquor are full of Spirits, but such Liquors of such Natures; yet by the effect inwardly it heats, for the very corroding Quality inflames the Blood more than the Nature can cool; for all things that are
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50040:113"/>
sharp, have an ingraving Quality or Faculty, not onely to cut away Rotten and Superfluous Humours, but to eat upon the Noble Parts.</p>

                  <head>Of Roots.</head>
                  <p>ROots are more nourishing than Fruits, by reason they have in a degree as much moysture as Fruit, and have not that acuteness which Fruits have, which cause not so many Spirits, but are soberer in their operations, and firmer: for whatsoever hath much Spirits, can never nourish much, because it grows too near the nature of Fire; but it fits and prepares for Nourishment, knitting, clensing, and strengthening the Digestive Parts; but those things nourish most, where Heat and Moysture are equally mix'd, which Roots come nearer to than Fruits.</p>

                  <head>Of Herbs.</head>
                  <p>ONE would think there should be but little nourishment in Herbs, by reason they are so much inclining to the nature of the Earth, which is of a drying Quality; but we find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by the feeding and fatning of Beasts, which live upon the Herbs of the Field. But some may say, that that which will nourish Beasts, will starve Men, as Hay, and the Leaves of Trees, and the like: But I answer, It is onely Custome which hath made it not agreeable with the Stomacks of Men, and by that reason maketh ill digestion, and so nourisheth not. But it is not alwaies the Meat that causeth ill or no nourishment, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Stomack: for an Ill Stomack shall corrupt Wholsome Meats, and a Good digestive-Stomack shall convert Unwholsome Meat to Good Nourishment, but may endanger the Stomack in using it often, not being accustomed to it before. But of all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, there are none that have so many and so excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as Herbs, not onely for curing both inward and outward Diseases, but in preventing Diseases, besides the nourishment of Men and Beasts.</p>
                  <p>But there are many that will choose places for their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to live in, for the Air, though they be incommoded much otherwise, and want the Varieties of Pleasures to entertain their Lives withall: for many think Long-life, though it be spent dully, Pleasure enough. But the Trouble and Care to keep Health, and the Fear to lose it, makes the Life not onely dull, having their Thoughts onely imployed upon that, but trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and full of vexation, with barring themselves of those things that otherwise they would willingly enjoy. Thus we make Life worse than Death, if truly considered: for Death frights more than hurts. But some will say, that may be, if Death would come before Sickness; but it is to avoyd Pain, not to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50040:113"/>
prolong Life: But I answer, The troublesome care of keeping't, is worse than the Disease it self; for the Disease of the Body will take away the Pain in a short time, but a Disease of the Mind dwels with a Man his whole Life.</p>

                  <head>Of Situation for Healths.</head>
                  <p>THose that would choose a Situation for Health, the Soyl is more to be considered than the Air, though Ill Air is bad; but Unwholsome Air comes from Unwholsome Grounds, by the Vapours that arise from the Earth, and the Sun many times clarifies the Air but in part: for many times in Moorish places the Vapours may be too hard for the Sun; and if the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alwaies sufficient to clarisie the Air, how should it purifie the Earth, that is so solid? unless you will say, the Sun is a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist to draw Spirits, and those Spirits subtil to the hurt of the Body; but when the Sun hath that power, as to make the Spirit of Air, as I may call it, being refined to that degree, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Cordial and a Refresher of the Spirits of all things: But when it hath onely so much power as to draw up Vapour, which is the thin and watrish part of the Earth, or as I may say, the Sweat of the Earth, which is sometimes hot, and sometimes cold, having not the power of purifying, but condenseth it, and makes it thicker, and so becomes the Shadow of another Earth, and makes us as if we lived between two Earths, onely the upper is thinner than the undermost: for although the Sun is the Life to all things, out and upon the Earth, by his Light and Heat, yet he is not so to the Bowels of the Earth; for we find by experience, that a thin Wall will keep out the light of the Sun, and the depth of a Cellar shall keep out the heat of the Sun: for in the hottest Day, if one go down into a Vault, he shall be so cold, as he will desire to come into the Sun again: so as we plainly find, that the Sun doth not make Heat in the Earth, but that the Earth hath Heat of her own, and her own Heat, with the moyst Veins that are in her, produceth those numerous Varieties, which, some she casts forth, and some she keeps in: for those Varieties she casts forth, are more of a nature than those she keeps within; for those she bars forth, are Fruits and Plants, and the like, which onely lye skin-deep, as one may say; but those she keeps within her Bowels, are more solid and firm: for by experience of Gold, and other Metals, we find, that she is hottest in her Bowels, for they are alwaies found deep and low; certainly it must be a great Heat that must purifie a Metal to that degree that Gold is: So that Gold, other Metals, and whatsoever else lyes deep within her, are not beholding to the Sun for their Maturities, as Fruits and Plants are: And we see those things cast forth are sickly and fading, and those she keeps in are lasting and durable; which would make one think, the Earth hath a more powerfull Heat than the Sun, because her Effects are greater than the Suns,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50040:114"/>
setting his Light aside. The Sun ripens the Fruit of the Face of the Earth, it agitates and lightens the Air, whereby we see and breath: but the Earth is the Mother of all Vegetables, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and Minerals, and could produce a sufficiency of her self, without the Heat of the Sun. But, as I was saying before, it is the Nature of the Soyl that not onely causeth Ill Airs, but Ill Nourishment; I mean not Ill in it self, but being wrongly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: for a Thick Air to a Sharp Constitution, is wholsomer than a Subtiller and Thinner Air is; so a Glutenous is to a Sharp Constitution better than a Salt and Penetrating Soyl is: So as you may compare the Natures of several Soyls to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of several Humours and Constitutions; as there are some Soyls apt to breed Melancholy, others Choler, some Flegmatick and Gross Humors, and some Sanguin; I mean not only dwelling upon such Soyls, but eating of the Fruits and Meats thereof: for the Sun doth not alwaies mature the Fruits of the Earth to such a degree as to make them wholsom, especially when there is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Nature bred in the Earth: for some Ground is apt to breed the Rot to some kind of Cattel, others the Murrain, and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diseases; and as we see in Low Places, all their Fruit is waterish, and their Meat spungier than in the High-land Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, though the Sun be in equal degrees; and in Islands it is more apt to be, than in the Continents; and therefore some parts of the Earth require much more Heat of the Sun than others do. And again, in some places the Earth hardly requires the Sun at all, unless it be to see the Fruits; and this alteration is not onely in several Regions of the World, but in Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Patches also; as, we shall see one Field very Fruit full, and the next Field to it very Barren, as some Stony, some Clayey, some Chalky, and so sundry others; some are fit to bear Wheat, others Barley, some onely Rye or Oats, some Tares, Branck, and Hemp; some again so barren, as they will bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Broom and Brakes; some Grounds feed great fat and firm Cattle, others great but spungie, some lean and little; and several feedings will give several tasts to one and the same kind of Cattel and Fruit, so as they may be distinguished in what Grounds they grew, or were fed in. But some Cattel or Plants will not thrive upon every Soyl, though rich and good, being not proper to their Natures, or to their Breedings; so it is with Men: for Custome may make that wholsome, which otherwise would shorten Life; and that is good for one Constitution, which would be pernicious to another; so as they must match Grounds to Bodies.</p>

                  <p>A Prince that hath a particular Favourite, or Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller, spins out the life of his Heroick Fame with his Favours: for what Errours soever are committed in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Faults are laid to the Princes charge, as the chief Head and Ruler, and all the Good Actions are attributed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites wise Counselling: for if Money and Arms be raised, they will say it is the Favorites popularity, not the Princes power.</p>
                  <p>If Armies march orderly, pitch methodically, fight succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, they will say it is the Favourites conduct, not the Princes prudence, skill, nor courage.</p>
                  <p>If good and beneficial Laws be made, they will say they were propounded by the Favorite, and onely enacted by the Prince; that they come from the Favorites head, not the Princes heart.</p>
                  <p>If the Virtuous be rewarded, and Offenders reprieved, or pardoned, they will say it is the Favorites policy, not the Princes bounty or clemency.</p>
                  <p>In short, Nothing shall be prudently, justly, valiantly, or wisely done, but shall be thought in the present, and published in the future, that all was done by the counsel of the Favorite, especially if Fortune changes her Countenance from Frowns to Smiles, when he is in Favour.</p>
                  <p>But a Wise Prince makes his own Breast the Cabinet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, his own Thoughts his Privy Counsellers, his own Judgement his Particular Favorite, and his own Arm his Chief Commander: But Good Fortune gives Fame an Applause, and Bad Fortune makes Fame go upon Crutches.</p>

For those of Heroick Spirits take Delight to see their Souldiers in Arms, to view their Fortifications, Forts, and Frontiers, to behold their Stately Architecture, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers, their Safe Havens, Sailing Ships, with their Rich Fraights.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, They delight in Crowns, Scepters, and Thrones, by which they hold Power, and keep up Authority, making Obedience, Fear, and Subjection; making it their Pastime to hear Sutes, to decide Causes, to give Justice. And their Sports like the old Olympick Games.</p>

                  <head>Noble Souls, and Strong Bodies.</head>
                  <p>THough Noble Souls, and great Wits, dwell not constantly, nor are allwaies created in Strong Bodies, yet if Nature did choose her Materials, match her Works, and order her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rightly and Sympathetically, Strong Bodies should have noble Souls, large Capacities, and great Wits; for Weak Bodies many times are a defect in Nature, as much as shallow Wits, or irrational Souls: But surely, if the chief and first Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would work methodically, and not seem as if she wrought at randome, and to produce by Chance, as she doth; if Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Custome, which is a second Nature, had not such a prevalent power to disturb and obstruct her; and though E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and Custome, may and doth somtimes rectify some Defects, and help Life; yet it doth more often puzzle Life, and incumber Natures Works, putting Nature out of the right ways with False Principles, Foolish Customes, and ill Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is the reason natural Wits are many times lost, not having time or leasure to exercise them, or use them (as I may say) or for want of variety of Subjects or Objects to better them; or dull'd by tedious and unprofitable Studies, or quenched out by base Servitude or Subjection: Also clear Understandings are darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, sound and strong Judgments weakened, and false Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given, and vain Conceptions and erroneous Opinions Maintaind or Believed, for want of the True and the Right Waies.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the streught of the Body oftimes is weakened and effeminated by Luxurie, Curiosity, and Idleness; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Noble Souls, Large Capacities, Clear Understandings, Fine Fancies, and Quick Wits to dwell many times, nay most commonly, in weak Bodies; for the better sort have most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more Plenty than Health, the one devouring the other; when the Meaner sort have meager Souls, and barren Brains; Rude Dispositions, and Rough Natures; have strong Limbs, strengthned by Exercise, and maintained by Labour; health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bodies kept in repair by Temperance, caused by scarcity and Poverty; contented minds, bred by Low Fortunes, and Humble Desires; when Wealth and Dignity create Vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Pride: yet many times small Fortunes and great Wits agree best together, but Noble Minds and Great Estates do the most good. But in this Age, although it be the Iron Age, yet those men that have Effeminate Bodies, as tender Youth, loose Limbs, smooth Skins, fair Complexions, fantastical Garbs, affected Phrases, strained Complements, factious Natures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Tongues, mischievous Actions, and the like, are admired, and commended more, or thought wiser than those that have Cenerous Souls, Heroick Spirits, Ingenuous Wits, prudent Fore-cast, Experienced Years, Manly Forms, Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50040:119"/>
Garbes, Edifying Discourses, Temperate Lives, Sober Actions, Noble Natures, and Honest Hearts: but in former years it was otherwaies; for Heroick Spirits in Masculine Forms had double praise, as is expressed in the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Trojan</hi> Warrs; and Princes were bred to labour as much as Pesants; for though their Labour might be different, the one being Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, the other Free, yet the Burthen and pains-taking might be Equal; though they carried not Pedlars Packs, nor Porters Burthens, yet they carried thick and heavy Arms; and if they handled not the Sithe, Pitch-Fork, and Flail, yet they handled the Sword, the Spear, the Dart, the Bow, the Sling, and the like; and if they knew not how to Mow, to Reap, and to Thrash, yet they knew how to Assault, to Defend, and to Fight; and though they digged not the Gold out of the Mines, yet they digged Fortisications out of the Earth; and if they set not Flowers on Banks, or sowed Seeds in Furrows, or ingrafted Slips, or planted Trees to grow, yet they set Armies in battail Array, and sowed Lives in Adventures, ingrafted Honor to the Stock of their Predeceslors, and planted Fame to grow high in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and though they drive not the Asses, yet they mannage the Horses, and if they want the Art to Yoak Oxen, they want not the wisdome to Yoak the Vulgar with strickt Laws; and if they will not drive a Flock of Sheep to the Fold, they can lead a Number of Men to the Warrs; and if they cannot build a House, yet they can storm a City: Thus galiant labours may strengthen the Bodies of Honorable Breed and Noble Minds, freely and industriously, without a Bondage or Slavery; nay they may Row in Gallies, yet not be subject to the Whip or Chains. But as Masculine Bodies and Heroick Souls had a double esteem, so Effeminate Bodies and timorous Spirits, or rather Natures, had a double despising, as witness <hi>Paris</hi> of <hi>Troy;</hi> but most Nations in those Ages, spent their time in usefull Arts, not in vain Dressings; they wore Horse-Tails in Head-pieces for Terrour, not Light Feathers for Shew; their Pride lay in their Arms, not in their Clothes; in their Strength, not in their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in their Victories, not in their Dancings; in their Prudence, not in their Vanities; their Wealth was spent in Hospitality, not in Prodigality; their Discourse was to Instruct, not to make Sport; neither in former years was Old-ages counsel refused for Youths Advice; Age was accounted an Honour, and respect was given to the Silver Hairs, Youth, an Effeminacy, pittying their Follies; And Youth in former Ages learnt with Patience, what Age taught with Judgement; and with Pains, what Skill taught with Industry; As to drive Charriots, ride Horses, bear Arms, hold Shields, throw Darts, to Fence, to wrastle, to Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, to train Men, to pitch Camps, to set Armies, to guide Ships; Not to Dance, to Sing, to Fiddle, to paint, to powder, as many men do now adaies; Youth did then listen with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Grave Instructions, and receive reproofs with Submission,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50040:119"/>
kept silence with sober Countenance obeyed with willing hearts and ready hands, where now adaies Youth is bold and rude, talks loud, speaks Nonsence, slights Age, scorns Councels, laug's at Reproofes, glories in Vices, and hates Virtue. Tis true many will go into the War and kill one another, though many times they run away; but it is rather Rashnes that sights, than true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where Fortune gives the Victory, and not <hi>Pallas,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, for those that run first away lose the day: Thus in former Ages were Bodies and Minds matcht; but I speak of Stength, to shew that Women that are bred, tender, idle and ignorant (as I have been) are not likely to have much Wit; nor is it fit they should be bred up to Masculine Actions, yet it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit and requisit they should be bred up to Masculine Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; it is not fit for Women to practice the behaviour of Men, yet it is fit that Women should practice the Fortitude of Men; But Women now adaies affecting a Masculincy, as despising their own Sex, practise the behaviour of Men, not the spirits of Men; nor their Herroick Behaviour, but their Wilde, Loose, Rude, Rough or foolish attected Behaviour; they practise the Masculine Confidency or Boldness, and forget the Esseminate Modesty; the Masculine Vice, and forget the Esseminate Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; as to talke Impudently, to Swagger, to Swear, to Game, to Drink, to Revell, to make Factions, but they practice not Silence, Sobriety, Reservedness, Abstinency, Patience or the like; they practice the Masculine Cruelty, quitting their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and gentle Natures, their sweet and pleasing Dispositions: But these Actions and Humours are so far from preferring our Sex to a higher Degree, that they do debase and make us worse than other Creatures be; but I beseech my Readers to believe I speak not of Envy or Spight, for I am guilty of neither, but out of a grieved love to my own Sex, nor of any particular Nations, but of the World in general, I mean as much as I have heard of; likewise that my Readers will not mistake me, as to think I belive, that great Giantly Bodies, or strong course Clowns have the greatest Wit and deepest Understanding, for we see to the contrary most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they being the most Ignorant Fools, and Cowardly spirits; but I mean that if they had large strong healthfull bodies, which might be obtained by Heroick Labours and Exersises, and if their spirits were answerable to their bodies, which might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by good Education, they might have a double or treble Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rational Understanding; but most commonly large Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are like populated Kingdomes that are Barren for want of Cultivating, and becomes defensless and open to an Enemy, for want of Fortification, which is Fortitude; for Fortitude is an Overflow, or a Superabounding of Spirits, when Fear is a Scarcity or Contracting thereof; the like of Wit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for from the Quantity and Agilness of the spirits in the Brain produceth Wit, and from the Quantity and Strength of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50040:120"/>
the Spirits in the Brain, produceth Understanding; But if I were to choose a Sex, I had rather be a Pigmy, stuft with rational spirits, than a Giant empty thereof: but a Middle Stature is most becoming, a Little the most Agil, and a Great the most Dreadfull, like a private Family; for a small Family hath the least Expence, a Great Family the most Disorder, a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Family the best Governed: Or like Marriage, a Beautifull Wife Delights most, a Witty Wife pleaseth best, a Chast Wife makes a man the Happiest.</p>
                  <p>So a Valiant Husband is most Esteemed, a Wise Husband best beloved, and an Honest Husband makes a Wife the happiest; when a Coward is scorned, a Fool despised, and an Inconstant Husband hated.</p>
                  <p>The like is a Cholerick Wife, an Unconstant Wife, and a Sluttish Wife.</p>
                  <p>IT is strange to observe the forgetfulness, or the boldness, or the foolishness of many men in the World, that will not only take Learned Mens Opinions and Arguments, and discourse of them as if they were their own, to the very Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, word for word, which shews Ridiculous and Mad; but most times they will gravely write them, as if they were never writ or divulged before, by which Actions one would think they were of Kin to the Jackanapes.</p>
                  <p>Others are as Base as those are Ridiculously Foolish, which will bribe the Printer or Bookseller, to let them see such Copies, and so will steal out their best Phansies, or Opinions, or Arguments, and print them before the others come out; wherefore, it is just in the Readers, to examine the Grounds; for if any have done so unworthy an Act, the Theft will be as easily seen, for it will appear in the Face, lying but skin-deep, but never come neer the Fundamental parts; wherefore all Writers that Strike, Justle, or Imbraee one another, and that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished or Printed in a short space of time of one another, are to be examined, to find out the Right and Truth, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Thief and punish the Crime with Reproach and Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

               <l>When he those watchfull hours, and times should spend</l>
               <l>In thinking which way he should Errors mend;</l>
               <l>For Commonwealths what ere, and Kingdoms, Realm,</l>
               <l>Like Garments, have full many a Stitch and Seam:</l>
               <l>This Publike Garment ost the Prince must view,</l>
               <l>Where it is rent, cause't to be sticht a new,</l>
               <l>Or else it soon wears out, in pieces fall,</l>
               <l>And though they patch, it will not last at all.</l>
               <l>Nor such a Judge, so timorous, lives in fear,</l>
               <l>And durst not, without Guards, walk any where,</l>
               <l>Which starts at every Noise, or Object see,</l>
               <l>If strange and new those Sounds and Objects be;</l>
               <l>Suspects the Light, yet Darkness hates like Hell,</l>
               <l>And thinks Conspiracy in's sleep doth dwell,</l>
               <l>And with this Fear a Tyrant he becomes,</l>
               <l>And then he Massacres, and Martyrdoms</l>
               <l>All his best Subjects, free from factious strife,</l>
               <l>That Loyal are, and wish him longer life,</l>
               <l>But scorn to flatter, or applaud his Crimes,</l>
               <l>But keep up Right, and Honour in their minds,</l>
               <l>Nor are they guilty, in Word, Deed, or Thought,</l>
               <l>But by Suspition judg'd, to Slaughter brought;</l>
               <l>Bnt all the innocent Blood that they do splll,</l>
               <l>Like to a Sea, flows to their Conscience ill;</l>
               <l>And every Thought that moves within their Brain,</l>
               <l>Appears like Ghosts of Men that they have slain;</l>
               <l>And when they dye, into despair they fall,</l>
               <l>Or like a Beast or Stone, no Sense at all.</l>
               <l>Nor such a Judge that is given to the Splrit,</l>
               <l>Or so devout as Heaven he thinks to merit,</l>
               <l>Praies Night and Day, or Beads do number ore</l>
               <l>Upon cold Stones, <hi>Joves</hi> Altar kneels before,</l>
               <l>Unfit in Earthly Government to Reign,</l>
               <l>For Praier seldome doth a Kingdome gain,</l>
               <l>Nor keeps in safety from an Enemy,</l>
               <l>But leaves his People all to Slavery;</l>
               <l>For if he praying be, whilst they do Fight,.</l>
               <l>They'll soon be taken, or be put to flight;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> Courage gives to Man, as well as Zeal,</l>
               <l>And Prudence for to Rule a Commonweal;</l>
               <l>And doing Justice, pleaseth <hi>Jove</hi> far more</l>
               <l>Than lazy Praying, idly to implore</l>
               <l>His great assistance which he seldom gives,</l>
               <l>Unless no hope of Human Help there lives.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50040:121"/>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> gives man Strength, himself for to defend,</l>
               <l>Which, if he useth not, may <hi>Jove</hi> offend.</l>
               <l>But such faint-hearted Prince, is fitter for</l>
               <l>A private life, than Kingdome that's in War;</l>
               <l>And fitter to Obey, than to Command,</l>
               <l>Or Rule and Reign, in Peace, War, Sea or Land;</l>
               <l>And fitter far it were, whilst he doth live,</l>
               <l>That he the Sovereign Power up did give</l>
               <l>Unto a Kinsman, or himself did choose</l>
               <l>A Wise and Valiant man, that Power to use,</l>
               <l>Not but Religious Orders are right meet;</l>
               <l>For why, Religion is the Publicke Feet</l>
               <l>On which the Common-Wealth in safety stands,</l>
               <l>And Ceremonies are the Sacred Hands</l>
               <l>To Consecrate good Custome, Dutious Zeal,</l>
               <l>And make Obedience in a Common-weal.</l>
               <l>The Judge I chuse, his Wisdome shall be such,</l>
               <l>The whole Worlds Government shall seem not much,</l>
               <l>In which of all the Planets there must Reign</l>
               <l>I do not care, I tell my Readers plain.</l>

               <l>OF all my Works, this Work which I have Writ,</l>
               <l>My best Belov'd, and greatest Favorite,</l>
               <l>I look upon it, with a pleasing Eye,</l>
               <l>I Pleasure take in its sweet company,</l>
               <l>I entertain it with a Grave Respect,</l>
               <l>And with my Pen am ready to Protect</l>
               <l>The Life and Safety of it, 'gainst all those</l>
               <l>That will oppose it, or profess its Foes;</l>
               <l>But I am sure there's none Condemn it can,</l>
               <l>Unless some Foolish and unlearned Man,</l>
               <l>That hath not Understanding, Judgement, Wit,</l>
               <l>For to perceive the Reason that's in it.</l>
