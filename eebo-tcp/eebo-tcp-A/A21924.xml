            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And for the better knowledge of the trueth of theſe diſorders, and redreſſe of the inconueniences, the ſayd Iuries ſhall call before them, and ſend for any of the ſeruants of any Inholders, Victuallers, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners, and keepers of ordinarie Tables, and ſuch other that vtter victuals, to examine them vpon their corporall othes, what fleſh ſhall bee, or is any day during the Lent ſeaſon dreſſed, killed, vttered, or eaten in their houſes: which if they ſhall refuſe to doe, then they ſhall commit to priſon the ſayd ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, ſo refuſing vpon their othes to declare the trueth.</p>

            <p>And euery of theſe Butchers, to be ſo licenced, ſhall be firſt bound in the ſumme of two hundred pounds to her Maieſties vſe, and the bonds to bee certified to the Queenes Remembrancer in the Eſchequer) to ſell no fleſh in the time of Lent, but to ſuch perſons as ſhall ſhew them ſpeciall warrant from the Lord Maior vnder his hand, and that the Butchers doe truely keepe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bookes of their dayly ſales, and the names of thoſe to whom they ſhall ſo ſell, with the quantities and the times thereof.</p>

               </gap>eſſe any fleſh in their houſes this Lent time for any reſpect, except it be for ſome ſuch perſon that lieth in their houſe, and that alſo hath licence through ſickneſſe or other neceſſary cauſe, to eate fleſh. Bonds ſhall be taken alſo of the Poulters, not to vtter any Poultry ware, but to ſuch as ſhall be likewiſe licenced to eate fleſh, and that ſuch as wil not giue ſuch bonds, that they be ſecluded from all vtterance of victuall during the Lent ſeaſon: excepting thoſe Poulters that do ordinarily ſerue her Maieſties houſhold, of whom like bonds ſhall be taken by her Maieſties Officers of the Greene cloth.</p>
            <p>And for the Butchers and others that come with victuals of fleſh out of the Countrey to the Citie, the L.Maior ſhal cauſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons, whereof ſome to be named to the L. Maior by the Wardens of the Fiſhmongers, to watch at the gates &amp; other like places in the Suburbes, where fleſh may be brought in, to view and ſearch, and to intercept the ſame. And in caſe the ſame ſhalbe bound to be brought to any perſon not warranted nor licenced to eate it, as it aforeſaid, then the ſame to be forfeited and ſold at the diſcretion of the L. Maior, for the vſe of the poore in the Hoſpitals and priſons in the Citie, and the bringers to be impriſoned. And otherwiſe the Carriers of the ſaid victuals of fleſh to be guided to the perſons houſes that haue licence, with regard therein not to be abuſed. And this watch to be continued daily during the whole time of Lent: and if any of theſe watchmen be found negligent and corrupt in his charge, then he to be committed to priſon, there to continue during the whole Lent.</p>
            <p>And to the end the ſaid Orders may be duly executed, it is thought conuenient, that the L. Maior ſhould ſend for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe Heads of the company of the Fiſhmongers, and ſhal cauſe them to make choiſe of foure or moe wiſe and diſcreete perſons of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and men of good wealth and abilitie, to whom they ſhall commit the charge to make enquirie after ſuch as ſhall be found tranſgreſſors of the ſaid Orders, who in reſpect of their trauel beſtowed in that behalfe, ſhal haue the one moitie of ſuch bonds as ſhall be forfeited by tranſgreſſing of the ſaid Orders, and the other moity to be conuerted vnto godly vſes, by the diſcretion of the Queenes Maieſties High Almner, ſpecially vpon poore and lame ſouldiers, with the priuitie of ſome of the Priuie Councill.</p>
            <p>And that there may be due execution of the ſaid Orders, aſwel without as within the Liberties of the Citie, it is thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that they that haue the chiefe charge ouer the places priuiledged &amp; exempt. where any Leets or Law daies are kept, ſhall authorize vnder their hand and ſeale foure perſons as are aboue mentioned, to make ſearch within the ſaid priuiledged &amp; exempt places for ſuch as ſhal tranſgreſſe the ſaid Orders, and ſhall for their trauell therein emploied, receiue the moitie of the Bonds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, as is aboue mentioned. And for the auoiding of corruption and partialitie in the ſaide perſons, it ſhall be neceſſary of take their others, and giue bond in ſome good &amp; large ſummes, to ſee (as much as in them lieth) a due obſeruation of the ſaid Orders.</p>
            <p>And for that it is to be doubted, that the ſaid Fiſhmongers, vpon the obſeruation of the ſaid Orders, will take occaſion thereby to enhance the priſes aſwel of Freſh as of Sea fiſh: It is thought meete, that the L. Maior ſhall take order with the ſaid Fiſhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that aſwell the Salt as Freſh fiſh ſhalbe vttered at reaſonable priſes.</p>
            <p>And it is ordered, that no Butchers ſhall kill any Beeues, but ſuch as ſhall be ſpecially licenced thereunto, without any fraud, for the furniſhing of ſuch ſhips as ſhall be lawfully employed by Sea, either in the way of traffique, or otherwiſe. And that ſuch Butchers as ſhalbe licenced within the Liberties by the head officers of the Liberties to kill any fleſh, ſhal euery fourteene dayes at the leaſt, giue a true certificat vnto the Lord Maior and head officers of the places exempt, of ſuch numbers of Veales, Lambs, and Muttons, as ſhalbe by them weekely killed: to the end, there may be a true certificat made euery fifteene dayes vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords and others of her Maieſties Priuie Counſell, what numbers of the ſeuerall kindes aboue mentioned ſhalbe killed, either within the Citie, or places exempt.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Orders are expreſſy deuiſed to be executed in the Citie of London, and places neere to the ſame, ſo her Maieſties pleaſure and commandement is, that the execution of theſe or like Orders be performed by the commandement of her Maieſties Lieutenauts to be ſent to the Juſtices of the Peace, in all Shires within their rule, and to all other Officers in Townes corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or in any Liberties, with like order for bonds to be taken to her Maieſties vſe.</p>
