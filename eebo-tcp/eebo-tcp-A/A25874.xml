         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Well, Brother <hi>Darnall,</hi> how is that a Cauſe of Challenge?
You are the Priſoner's Council, let us hear what you ſay to it.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj. Darnall.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, what we have to ſay to it, is this; Here are
ſome Perſons returned upon this Pannel, that were formerly Jurors in a
Cauſe that was try'd for the ſame Species of Treaſon that this Gentleman,
the Priſoner, is charged with in this Indictment; and I think the Witneſſes at
that Tryal did mention in their Evidence my Client, as being preſent at thoſe
very Conſults, about which they gave their Evidence; theſe Gentlemen gave
Credit to thoſe Witneſſes, and found the Verdict againſt the Perſon then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.
We humbly ſubmit it to your Lordſhip and the Court, whether we
may not for this Cauſe challenge this Perſon as not indifferent, it being for
the ſame Cauſe and Conſult, that the other was try'd for.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj. Darnall.</speaker>
               <p>My Client thinks it a very good Objection, That he is
not indifferent, and I deſire he ſhould be ſatisfied in it.</p>

               <p>If he thinks ſo, he may except againſt him, but if he inſiſts
upon it as a cauſe of Challenge, we deſire you would put the Caſe, and my
Lords the Judges determine it.</p>

againſt the Pannel: And made his Motion thus;</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj. Darnall.</speaker>
               <p>IF your Lordſhip pleaſes, I have ſomewhat to offer to you
before you go upon this new Pannel; and I confeſs, I think
it is my Duty to the Court, as well as to the Priſoner, to ſtate the Caſe as it
is, and ſubmit it upon the reaſon of Law, and the Authorities that I ſhall
offer, Whether the Proceedings upon this new Pannel will not be erroneous?
My Lord, the Queſtion is, Whether, as this Caſe is, the Priſoner has had a
Copy of the Pannel of his Jury by which he is to be tried, according as the
<hi>late Law</hi> requires, he had a Copy of the former Pannel, and upon that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
Nine were ſworn, and their Names all entred upon Record, and made
Parcel of the Record. Thereof now the Queſtion is, Whether he can be
tried upon a new Pannel? We are in a Caſe that rarely happens, and in a
Caſe of Life and Death. I know your Lordſhip will be careful not to vary from
the ancient Practice, or to make a new Preſident, becauſe of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
It muſt be agreed in this Caſe, That the old Pannel upon which
the Priſoner took his Challenges, and of which Nine was ſworn, is Parcel of
the Record. Now, my Lord, to add a new Pannel, upon which twelve
more ſhall be ſworn, and all this appear upon Record, and the Priſoner tried
upon the laſt Pannel, will not this be Error? I offer this before the Jury be
called and ſworn, becauſe we deſire to be fairly tried; and we deſign to reſt
upon the Fact in this Caſe. If it ſhould appear, That he is tried upon a
Pannel that is unduly made and return'd, that will be of evil Conſequence
one way or other. And can this be duly made, if another appear upon Record
before it? And can any body ſay it is quaſht or abated? Or can it be ſo?
My Lord, in <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Pleas of the Crown, p. 155. it is ſaid, <hi>If any of the
Pannel dye after the Return, and before their Appearance, ſo that there are not
enough left to make the Jury, yet the Pannel ſhall not be quaſht, nor is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bated,
but it is Cauſe to grant a</hi> Tales. And certainly, my Lord, it is a ſtronger Caſe,
when by reaſon of Challenges, which the Law gives the Priſoner liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make, there are not enough left, that there ſhall not be a new
Pannel, but that a <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall be granted; for if a new Pannel might be
made, it cannot appear who were challenged, or who were admitted. And
if your Lordſhip pleaſes to conſider the Intention of the Law in giving the
Priſoner power to Challenge, is, that he may have an indifferent Jury; but
that would be prevented by ſuch a practice as this; for when it has been
diſcovered upon the old Pannel whom the Priſoner choſe, and whom he
challenged upon the new Pannel, the Perſons challenged may be ſet
firſt, and thoſe that were choſen may be omitted, or ſo poſtponed, that none
of them whom he thought equal to try him, can ſerve upon the Jury. And
truly, my Lord, if I am rightly informed, that is the Caſe upon this
new Pannel, ſome of thoſe that were admitted and ſworn are left out, and
moſt of them, I think, are put laſt in the Pannel whom he thought equal
Men to try him, and all thoſe whom he challenged peremptorily, are the
firſt Men in the Pannel. This, my Lord, is the Caſe before you, and if
this be admitted, the uſe and end of Challenges, which are in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benefit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38574:6"/>
and favour of Life wou'd be defeated. And for Authorities in this Caſe,
beſides the Reaſon and Ground of the Law, many cannot be expected, becauſe
it is a Fact that rarely happens. I find none of the ancient Practicers ever knew
it, but I find that a <hi>Tales</hi> ought to be granted, ſo it is ſaid in ſeveral Books, as
in <hi>Stamford,</hi> 155. 156. when ever upon the principal Pannel, all the Jury does
not appear, or ſo many of them do not, that there are not enough left to make
a Jury, which is our very Caſe; then in ſuch Caſe the Pannel ſhall not be quaſht
or abated; but a <hi>Tales</hi> granted, ſo is 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 7. there the Queſtion was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there ſhould be a greater Number returned upon the <hi>Tales</hi> then were in
the principal Pannel, and there the Difference was inſiſted upon, and agreed,
That where it is between Party and Party, where Life is not concerned, it
ſhall not, but where Life is concerned, and the Priſoner has Power to Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
35 Peremptorily, there the Judge may award as many upon the <hi>Tales</hi>
as he pleaſes, that there may be enough to remain after the Challenges; ſo
that if this old Pannel be not abated, and cou'd not be quaſht, and a <hi>Tales</hi>
might be granted to conſiſt of any Number, I conceive the Priſoner cannot
be Tryed upon this new Pannel, but it will be Erroneous; and I humbly ſubmit
to your Lordſhips, whether you will proceed upon it.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower,</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſes to ſpare me a Word of the ſame ſide,
with Submiſſion. We think there ought to have been an <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> with
a <hi>Tales,</hi> ſuch as had been before Sworn, being to be part of the Jury now,
and that is the proper way to bring the Priſoner to his Tryal in this Caſe; the
Kings Counſel cannot expect we ſhou'd produce many Preſidents, for I believe
this is the ſecond of the kind that ever happened, at leaſt, within Memory,
That a Tryal in Treaſon was put off <hi>pro defectu Juratorum,</hi> though I have a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
that I think is expreſs in the Caſe; but we inſiſt in the firſt place, That
a <hi>Tales</hi> does lie at Common-Law, in the Caſe of Life; and ſo the Book that
Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> cited in <hi>Stamford,</hi> is expreſs; and then we ſay, that the Anſwer
which we expect, that we are now before Juſtices of Goal Delivery, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
becauſe the Juſtices of Goal-Delivery, though they do not uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Proceſs by way of Writ, but before their coming, they Command the
Sheriff to have his County ready there, and ſo in Fact, it is a Parol Precept;
yet when it is return'd, then it is entred upon Record, either <hi>Preceptum eſt
Vice Comiti quod venire faceret;</hi> or, <hi>Ideo veniat Jurata;</hi> and the Jury are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
upon Record: So that take it to be before Juſtices of Goal-Delivery, yet
the Sheriff having returned a Pannel, and that being upon the File, as appears
before your Eyes, in Obedience to your Command, and that Copy of the
Pannel being delivered to us two Days before <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, we humbly ſubmit
it to your Lordſhip, Whether by force of the Common-Law, and of the late
Act of Parliament, we ought not to be Tryed by that Pannel; we inſiſt upon
it, that the Act intends, and expreſly deſigned, that not only the Priſoner ſhou'd
have a Copy of the Pannel that the Sheriff return'd at any time after, but that
he ſhou'd be Tryed by the Pannel that we had a Copy of at firſt; for it is not
ſaid a Copy, <hi>toties quoties</hi> the Court ſhall think fit to award a Precept for a
new Pannel, but the Words of the Act are a Copy of the Jury duly returned
by the Sheriff; now this we had, and your Lordſhip knows it is not a return'd
Pannel till it be in Court, and then it becomes part of the Record: My Lord, I
do agree the Juſtices in ſome Caſes have quaſht and ſet aſide Pannels and Juries,
and ordered new ones; and I confeſs there was an extraordinary Caſe in the
time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, which was upon the Indictment againſt <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi>
where, after the Jury Charged, and Evidence given, the Jury was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
and a new Pannel made the next Seſſions, upon which <hi>Whitebread</hi>
was Tryed and Convicted; how juſt or regular that was, I will not inſiſt upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38574:7"/>
now, but I am ſure there were great Complaints of that Practice, and few Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
can be ſhewn of the like; but beſides the Parties themſelves waved it
there, no Objection being taken againſt it, but we inſiſt upon it in this Caſe,
that this being upon Record, is part of the Record, and ſo appears to the Court;
if the Record indeed were to be made up upon a Writ of Error, perhaps it
wou'd be no Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it may be they wou'd leave it out; but here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
there was a Pannel of Record before you, and this muſt either be quaſht,
or altered, or continued on by Proceſs, you have power to quaſh it, it it be
unduely returned by the Sheriff. If there be any evil Practices for procuring
the Pannel, either by the Proſecutor, or the Priſoner, if there be no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
return'd, or the ſame happen in any other reſpect not to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
done according to the Command or Precept of the Court; but becauſe
there is a Default of appearance of Jurors, no Pannel was ever quaſht upon
that Account; then ſay we, if it be not quaſht, this Pannel muſt continue.
For, what ſhall become of it, why ſhould it not continue? It is not within
the Act of Parliament, that gives the Juſtices Power to make a new Pannel,
as in the Caſe of a grand Jury, when they are guilty of Concealments, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to find Bills upon great Evidence, but we have no ſuch Caſe before you,
nor do I know any ſuch Rule as can reach this; ſo that we take it, there is no
difference between this Caſe, as before Juſtices of Goal-Delivery, and other
Juſtices; that Proceſs does lie againſt the Jury that does not appear even in
Treaſon and Felony, there is no Diſpute, and it is very properly ſo, if it be
before Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> firſt a <hi>Venire facias,</hi> and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Default, a <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> that is the proper way; then take it before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Goal-Delivery, there it is entered upon Record, <hi>Preceptum eſt Vice Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miti.</hi>
&amp;c. And here is a Pannel returned by vertue of this Precept, and ſome
of the Jury do not appear, and ſo there are not enough to Try the Priſoner
after a great many Sworn and Challenged, and this entered upon Record.
What ſhall become of that Pannel, it cannot be quaſht, nor abated? My Lord,
there is a Caſe that does Warrant that Opinion of a <hi>Tales</hi> in a Caſe of Felony;
and if there may be a <hi>Tales,</hi> then there may be an <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> and there
are Directions how the Jurors ſhall be Sworn again, upon their appearance
on the <hi>Habeas Corpora;</hi> and that is <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Telverton,</hi> 23.</p>

               <p>The Law will hold the ſame, in caſe it does appear upon
Record, as well as where it does not; but we ſay, a Pannel return'd in Court
is a Record.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> J. Powell,</speaker>
               <p>No, it will not, becauſe, when a Jury does appear, and the
Twelve are ſworn, then it becomes parcel of the Record; and therefore <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi>'s
Caſe was quite another Caſe, and was indeed held to be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Caſe, but that comes not up to this, for there a full Jury was Sworn,
and Evidence given.</p>

               <p>And Mr. <hi>Serjeant Darnal</hi> has been pleaſed to reflect upon us,
as if we had packt this Jury, by altering the places of the Names, which,

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant was pleaſed to ſay, the excepted men

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> J. Powel.</speaker>
               <p>Really, becauſe it was opened as a Reflection, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the anſwer I give to it, is, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
one that was ſworn laſt time, is now at the very beginning of the
Pannel, and in general they are mixt promiſcuouſly, without any deſign or
ſtudy in the leaſt. He ſayes we have left out thoſe that ſerved before. I
ſolemnly proteſt, I know not one Man Returned upon the laſt Pannel that
is left out, unleſs it appeared that he is no Free-holder, and we had no reaſon
to put in them, that we knew could not ſerve.</p>

               <p>I will not ſay for a particular man, I proteſt, that
I did not know he was left out. If it be ſo, it was by miſtake; for I know

               </speaker>
               <p>It will appear by Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> Challenges, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ser. Darnal.</speaker>
               <p>He was ſworn after we had gone through the Pannel,

               <speaker>Mr. Sher. <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I tell you they ſtand for the moſt part as they did,

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ser. Darnal.</speaker>
               <p>There is but one in threeſcore and ten, that can be
ſworn now, of them that were ſworn before, and there were nine of them
then ſworn.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Attor. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>That is a miſtake. Indeed there are a great many added
to the Pannel, becauſe there was a defect the laſt time, and therefore now
they may perhaps ſtand later.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> J. Rokeby.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, I can't ſee but that the Sheriff hath done like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,

               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>You are to conſider, that this happens, becauſe you run
out as far as your utmoſt Number, that time you challenged thirty five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,
and divers others for Cauſe; ſo as not to leave enough for a Jury,
and from that alone aroſe a neceſſity of increaſing the Number of the
Pannel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj. Darnal,</speaker>
               <p>It was our <hi>Client</hi> that challenged them, we do not adviſe

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> J Rokeby,</speaker>
               <p>But you muſt take the conſequence of it, which cauſes this
addition to the Pannel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L C. J. Treby,</speaker>
               <p>What do you complain of? they that are returned, are put
in the ſame order as they were before; they that were ſworn, were (for the
moſt part) late in the Pannel then, and ſo they are now. I do not find any
thing done to the prejudice of the Priſoner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Serj Darnal,</speaker>
               <p>If the Chriſtian Names had not been miſtaken, there had
been perhaps enough to have been ſworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J Treby,</speaker>
               <p>That's a good Argument for a new Pannel, becauſe the
Chriſtian Names were miſtaken before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> J Powell,</speaker>
               <p>It was by defect of Jurors, and therefore there was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity of a new Pannel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J Treby,</speaker>
               <p>I am of the ſame Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Caſe is well known. It was much cited, as to another Point
in <hi>Buſhel</hi>'s Caſe. It was a Tryal at the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench</hi> Bar at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by a
Jury of <hi>Kent,</hi> upon an Indictment of Murther.</p>
               <p>And I think you ſay the Caſe of <hi>H.</hi> 7. was between party and party in
<hi>Appeal.</hi> And I believe <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Diſcourſe, in the place cited, relates chiefly
to <hi>Appeals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not deny that a <hi>Tales</hi> may poſſibly be upon an <hi>Indictment</hi> before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi> Though 'tis not uſual, nor do you <hi>ſhew,</hi> or our
experienced Clerks <hi>know</hi> any ſuch Preſident. I agree, that in the mentioned
Caſes, a <hi>Tales</hi> was proper. For, in both thoſe Caſes <hi>(viz.</hi> of <hi>Appeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
removed into the King's Bench)</hi> the Proceſs for the Jury was, as it
ought to be, by Writs of <hi>Venire facias,</hi> &amp;c. upon which a full Jury not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
there muſt be a <hi>Tales.</hi> But in proceeding to Tryal before Juſtices
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> on ſuch Indictment as is here, though I will not ſay
but they may proceed by <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Venire facias:</hi> Yet I do ſay, that the more
known Courſe is by <hi>Precept,</hi> in nature of a <hi>Venire facias.</hi> And the uſage is,
that <hi>After</hi> (and never Before) the Priſoner hath pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> there
goes a Precept to the Sheriff under the Seals of the ſaid Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and
<hi>Terminer,</hi> returnable at ſuch day as they ſhall Adjourn to, for returning a
Jury to Try it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Tryal 4. 13.</note> (as was done lately, upon Advice, in the Caſe of <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
&amp;c.) And upon the return of that, if, after Challenges, there are
not enough left to make a Jury, whether thoſe Juſtices ſhall iſſue a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38574:9"/>
in nature of a <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> or <hi>Diſtringas</hi> with a <hi>Tales,</hi> or another
Precept in the ſame form as before, and without taking notice of the former,
is a Queſtion <hi>not</hi> in Judgment before us. For, we are about proceeding to a
Tryal on an Indictment in this Court of <hi>Goal-Delivery,</hi> (which is the Court
wherein generally all capital Crimes are Tryed, as well at this <hi>Place,</hi> as at
the <hi>Aſſizes.)</hi> And, I think, <hi>Here</hi> cannot be a <hi>Tales.</hi> I am ſure it is not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>
For, Firſt, Here is never any Writ of <hi>Venire facias,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly,
Nor ever a Precept for returing a Jury to Try a <hi>particular</hi> Iſſue. But this
Court takes the Pannels of Jurys returned by the Sheriff without any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Precept to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Courſe</hi> of proceeding by vertue of a Commiſſion of <hi>Goal-Delivery,</hi>
which is the <hi>Law</hi> in this caſe, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> There is, Antecedent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Juſtices, a <hi>General</hi> Commandment, or Precept made in Writing, to
the Sheriff by the ſaid Juſtices, to return Juries againſt their coming, for the
Trying of all and ſingular Priſoners in their Goal, whether they have pleaded
before, or ſhall after. And for that purpoſe it requires the Sheriff to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
out of all parts of his County, whence the Priſoners come, a great
Number of Freeholders, not a Kin to the Priſoners, to be at the time and
place appointed for holding the Court. The Sheriff, by vertue of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
previous Precept, ſummoneth many for Jurors, and prepares divers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Pannels</hi> of their Names, either at firſt, or afterwards, as appears neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and returneth and delivereth in one or more of theſe Pannels from time
to time, as the Court does need, and call for any. This, we know, in Fact,
is frequently done where the Seſſions of <hi>Goal-Delivery</hi> laſts ſeveral days, and
there is occaſion. Though, in ſuppoſition of Law, all theſe Pannels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and the Tryals thereupon had the firſt day of the Seſſions; and in
Law it is intended to be but that <hi>one</hi> day only. The return of this Precept
is thus, <hi>viz. Executio iſtius Precepti patet in quibuſdam Pann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llis huic precepto
annexis,</hi> and the Pannels are annexed, and there are often Filed here <hi>divers</hi>
Pannels upon the ſame general Precept, though ſometimes but <hi>One.</hi> Theſe
Pannels are thus delivered into Court, and a Jury taken out of them, as there
is occaſion, only upon a <hi>Parol Award,</hi> that is, barely the Court's calling for
the ſame, without <hi>Writ</hi> or Precept in <hi>Writing,</hi> or giving any <hi>Day</hi> for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. For, this Proceeding is <hi>immediatè,</hi> for the ſpeedy delivery of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and the <hi>Entry</hi> after ſetting forth that the Priſoner being Arraigned,
pleads <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> is <hi>Ideo immediatè veniat inde Jurata;</hi> or <hi>fiat inde Jurata.</hi>
And this Court's being <hi>inſtituted</hi> for the ſpeedy delivery of Priſoners, and
Warnings being given long before, of their coming, are the Cauſes why it
has been always held without <hi>Doubt,</hi> that Juſtices of <hi>Goal-Delivery</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and Try the <hi>ſame</hi> day.</p>
               <p>If it fall out that, by Reaſon of Defaults, Deaths, or Challenges, there
cannot be a full Jury had out of a Pannel, (as here there wanted three)
which is an Accident that the Court cannot know, till they have gone
through the Pannel; I think in this Caſe, that Pannel goes for
nothing, is utterly loſt and void, and to be caſt away or cancelled;
For, it does not anſwer the Award of the Court, which was to have a Jury
to Try the Priſoner <hi>preſently.</hi> It is meant an <hi>effectual</hi> Pannel that ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a full Jury of Twelve unacceptionable Men. And every Pannel that
comes ſhort in this, is to be laid aſide as a void thing. And <hi>then</hi> the Court
takes and makes uſe of another immediately, which may not be deficient,
whereby the Award is obſerved, and the preſent Service diſpatched:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is objected, that the <hi>Old</hi> Pannel is parcel of the <hi>Record</hi> in Court,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38574:9"/>
and, upon that, Nine were ſworn, and their Names are all enter'd upon
that Record; and now to add a <hi>new</hi> Pannel, upon which Twelve ſhall be
ſworn and Try the Priſoner; all <hi>this</hi> appearing upon Record, it will be Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection ſtands upon two <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> both ariſing from not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the difference between Precepts and Pannels, in a Court of <hi>Goal-Delivery,</hi>
and <hi>Venire facias</hi>'s, or Precepts and Pannels in <hi>other</hi> Courts.</p>
               <p>1. It ſuppoſes that here will be two Pannels, which will appear to relate to
the Tryal of this Priſoner Mr. <hi>Cook.</hi> 2. It ſuppoſes that both theſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Records,</hi> or parcel of the <hi>Record</hi> in Court.</p>
               <p>If either of theſe Suppoſitions prove to be a miſtake, it will deſtroy the
Objection. I think <hi>Both</hi> are miſtakes.</p>
               <p>1. Here is not, nor will be, nay, there ought not to be any Pannel
purporting to be returned for the Trying of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> or any <hi>particular</hi> Priſoner
or Priſoners. For, the Precept in this Caſe is (not like a <hi>Venire facias</hi> which
alwaies reſpects a particular Iſſue between Parties therein named, but)
<hi>General,</hi> requiring the Sheriff to return Jurors enough to Try all the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
not naming any. And the Return, which is the Anſwer to it by
a Pannel or Pannels, is <hi>as General;</hi> the Title of every Pannel, being <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina
Jurator ad Triandum pro Domino Rege,</hi> and no more; or <hi>Nomina Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
ad Triandum inter Dom. Regem &amp; Priſonar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Barram,</hi> without
naming any of the Priſoners. And it were abſurd if it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For, the Precept goes to the Sheriff <hi>Before</hi> the Seſſions, and his
Return is ſuppoſed to be made at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Seſſions, when it is
not known who of the Priſoners will be indicted; or, if indicted, who will
plead <hi>not Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Guilty,</hi> or a <hi>Pardon,</hi> or other <hi>Plea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When, for the Tryal of a particular Priſoner (or divers Priſoners that
are thought fit to be put upon Tryal by the ſame Jury) a Jury is about
to be taken out of any Pannel, the Clerk, as he goes along, may take a
Note in Paper of the Name of every one that is ſworn, or he may (and
uſually doth) write, <hi>Jur.</hi> on the ſaid Pannel againſt the Name of every one
ſworn. But this Note or Mark is no part of the Record; it is not <hi>ex Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
Legis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it is but a voluntary <hi>Memorandum,</hi> for the help of his Memory.
If he could ſafely truſt to the ſtrength of his Memory, he need not write
at all on this occaſion; I mean, <hi>not</hi> till a full Jury is ſworn, who Try the
Priſoner. But then, indeed, the Clerk muſt, (from his Notes, or Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
write the Names of all the Twelve, entring them on the Record of the
Indictment, in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> juſt after the <hi>Ideo immediatè veniat inde Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata
coram prefatis Juſtic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. Adding, <hi>Et Juratores Jurate illius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Scil.</hi>
A. B. <hi>&amp;c. Dicunt,</hi> &amp;c. And it is by <hi>this</hi> only, that the Names of thoſe that
are ſworn, come to be of Record; and it is this entry upon the Body of the
Indictment <hi>alone,</hi> that is the Record, that ſhews who were Jurors ſworn, to
Try <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Priſoner, or Priſoners.</p>
               <p>So that, if the old Pannel were Filed, and were a <hi>Record,</hi> as the Priſoner's
Council would ſuppoſe, yet it would not thereby be made appear, that the
ſaid Pannel was returned, or uſed for, or in order to the Tryal of <hi>this</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
               <p>2. The old Pannel is <hi>not</hi> filed among the Records of the Court, nor ought
to be. When ſuch a Pannel does not produce a Jury, the Clerks may and
uſe to throw it by, as a uſeleſs thing. But, however they uſe it, we cannot
allow it to be a Record. It was received <hi>de bene eſſe;</hi> It is abortive and
comes to nothing. And it is not every thing that paſſeth in Court in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38574:10"/>
to a Record, that comes to be ſo. A Frivolous Plea, that is rejected, is
not Recorded. A Preſentment or Bill of Indictment, before it is found, is not
a Record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> be returned upon a Bill of Indictment, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can be a Record. And, thereupon, the Clerks do ſometimes throw it
away, tho ſometimes they keep it and put it on the File, only taking care
to croſs it, but if they do forget to croſs it, yet it is not a Record.</p>
               <p>By all this it is apparent how great the difference is between a Precept
and Pannels in <hi>this</hi> Court, and a <hi>Venire facias</hi> and a Pannel returned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
which is ever iſſued after Iſſue joyned, and doth alwayes mention the
particular Parties and Matter it relates to, and is a Record, and a ground
for an <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Lord, I ſhall not ſtand upon an Exception which I
think I might take to the word <hi>Turmas</hi> in the Indictment, which whether it
be Troops of Men, or Horſes, or what it is does not appear; but, I think,
we have an Exception to the cheif Overt Act laid in the Indictment, and that
we preſume, if my Brief be right, will be ſufficient to ſet aſide this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The Indictment charges, That Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did agree with other Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>ſaid</hi> late King <hi>James,</hi> and King
<hi>Jam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> is never mentioned before in all the Indictment, that is one Exception
that we have, that there is no late K. <hi>James</hi> mentioned in the Indictment before
this, if my Copy be right, if it be otherwiſe, I ſuppoſe, they will find it: it is
laid, that Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did agree to ſend <hi>Cherneck</hi> as a Meſſenger into <hi>France,
eidem nuper Regi Jacobo,</hi> and no <hi>Rex Jacobus</hi> mentioned before. Then there
is another Exception, and that's this, They come and ſay, that whereas there
was a War with <hi>France,</hi> which is only in the Indictment by way of recital or
rehearſal of an Hiſtory, <hi>Quod cum per magnum Tempus ſuit &amp; mode fit,</hi> &amp;c.
Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> the Premiſſes knowing, did compaſs and imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne the Kings death,
and did adhere to the ſaid Kings Enemies ſuch a day. Now, my Lord, I do
think, that this can never be maintained, for that <hi>Cum quoddam Bellum,</hi> &amp;c.
being an Hiſtorical Narrative, is not poſitive enough: For adhereing to the
Kings Enemies, being one of the Treaſons laid in the Charge, there ought
to be a War at the time of the adheſion, and of neceſſity then that ought to
be preſented by the Jury; for tho your Lordſhips can Judicially take notice
of War or Peace, yet you cannot take notice of it at ſuch a particular
time, and the reaſon is from the Notion that is in my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>3d,
Inſtitutes,</hi> Cap. <hi>Treaſon.</hi> That adheſions to Rebels is not adheſion to the
Kings Enemies; for a Rebel is not ſaid to be an Enemy, but it muſt be
adhereing to ſuch an Enemy, as between whom and the King there was
War at that time, and conſequently it ought to be more poſitively averred
in the Indictment, than it here is: but as to the Overt Act of Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi>
conſulting and agreeing to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> over to the ſaid late King <hi>James</hi>
to give him notice of what was agreed upon between them, when King
<hi>James</hi> is not named before, that can never be got over with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</p>

words are put in every other Clauſe of the Indictment, in thoſe Clauſes that

that this Clauſe muſt refer to the next Antecedent, that will not do, for
the next precedent Nominative Caſe is either <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Chernock.</hi> So that

Conſult about this Buſineſs, and yet it is not neceſſarily implied that he
muſt conſent and agree to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> upon which the great

               </speaker>
               <p>Its true there ſhould be no Preſumption, and there is none

Cook</hi> did <hi>meet</hi> with Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and others, and then
and there did conſult with them, and conſent to procure an Invaſion, and joyn
an Inſurrection thereto. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Further with the ſaid Traytors did
<hi>agree</hi> to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> Now, what is the Nominative Caſe to
this Agreement? Is it Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkyns?</hi> That's
impoſſible; for they could not be ſaid properly to meet and conſult with
themſelves, every one of them with his own ſelf and the reſt: And then the
Number, if it had referr'd to them, ſhould have been Plural, but here it is
Singular <hi>[agreavit]</hi> and the ſenſe is no more than this; That then and there
Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did meet with ſuch Perſons, and did conſult with them about ſuch and
ſuch Matters, and further, did agree with them to do thus.</p>

               <p>The meaning is not to be forced and ſtrained by Inference

               <p>Your Objection to this Paragraph is, that it is too long;

               <p>It is not denyed to be a material Objection, but it muſt be

               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Treby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You put it too large, Brother <hi>Daruall,</hi> you may ask upon
a <hi>Voyer Dire,</hi> whether he have any Intereſt in the Cauſe; nor ſhall we deny
you liberty to ask whether he be fitly qualified, according to Law, by having a
Freehold of ſufficient Value; but that you can ask a Juror or a Witneſs every
Queſtion that will not make him criminous, that's too large: Men have been
ask'd whether they have been convicted and pardon'd for Felony, or whether
they have been whipt for Petty Lacinary; but they have not been obliged
to anſwer; for, tho their Anſwer in the affirmative will not make them crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or ſubject them to Puniſhment, yet they are Matters of Infamy; and if
it be an infamous thing, that's enough to preſerve a Man from being bound
to anſwer. A pardon'd Man is not guilty, his Crime is purged; but merely
for the Reproach of it, it ſhall not be put upon him to anſwer a Queſtion
whereon he will be forced to forſwear or diſgrace himſelf. So Perſons have been
excuſed from anſwering whether they have been committed to <hi>Bridewell</hi> as
Pilferers or Vagrants, or to <hi>Newgate</hi> for Clipping or Coining. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet to be
ſuſpected or committed is only a Misfortune and Shame, no Crime. The like
has been obſerved in other Caſes of odious and infamous matters which were not
Crimes indictable. But to keep to our Caſe; 'Tis true, a <hi>Juror</hi> may be challenged
being an <hi>Alien.</hi> or being a <hi>Villain;</hi> but where the Matter apparently carries
Crime or Shame, it ſhould be proved; the Outlawry ſhould be proved, and
ſo ſhould the <hi>being a Villain.</hi> Yet that is no Crime, tho it be an Ignominy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, I take this to be no manner of Infamy
at all, there is nothing of Crime, nor nothing of Reproach, but only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of a Mans Opinion.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Truly, I think otherwiſe; I take it to be at leaſt a ſcandalous
Misbehaviour, and deſervedly ill ſpoken of, for any Man to pre-judge, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in ſuch a heinous matter. I think it is a very ſhameful diſcovery of a Man's
Weakneſs and Raſhneſs; if not Malice, to judge before he hears the Cauſe, and
before the party that is accuſed could be tryed. But, it ſeems, by what the
Priſoner ſays that he would ask all the <hi>Jurors,</hi> whether they have not ſaid, that
he was <hi>guilty,</hi> or that they would <hi>find</hi> him guilty, or that he ſhould be <hi>hanged,</hi>
or the like: Which (preſuming him innocent) is to ask whether they have
not defamed and ſlandered him in the higheſt degree; and to force them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that they have a mortal Hatred to him, and come with a malicious reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to convict him: Which admitting they are not puniſhable by our Law,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38574:12"/>
yet are things ſo deteſtably wicked and ſo ſcandalous as are not fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be diſcloſed by and againſt themſelves,</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, what is more common than for a Man
to ſay, before he is ſummoned to be upon a Jury, when he hears a Fact repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
concerning ſuch a one, to ſay I believe he is guilty, or I am of opinion he
is, and I am ſure he will be hanged, and yet there is no crime in this.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Treby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly, Bro. <hi>Darnall,</hi> I know not how you may approve
of ſuch a Man, but I'll aſſure you I do not. I take the Queſtion <hi>not</hi> to be
concerning a Man's diſcourſing <hi>ſuppoſitively;</hi> as, if upon hearing News, or a
Report of clear Evidence, a Man ſhould ſay, <hi>Suppoſing this to be true, ſuch a
Man is guilty, and I ſhould find him ſo if I were of his Jury.</hi> This might not
be ſufficient to ſet aſide a Juror: for this has been a general Diſcourſe among
the Subjects upon occaſion of this Conſpiracy; and it imports that if Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſhould not be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> he would acquit him. And ſo he is, as he
ſhould be, indifferent. But if a Man, qualified for a Juror, affirm <hi>Poſitively</hi>
that ſuch a Priſoner is guilty, and that he will find him ſo whatever Evidence
or Proof be given or made to the contrary, I think that may be a Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
puniſhable as an owning and encouraging of Falſhood, Perjury and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
and a contempt and ſcandal to the Juſtice of the Kingdom. Tho I
hope and believe that no man hath ſo demeaned himſelf.</p>

               <p>In a Civil Caſe it would be a good Cauſe of Challenge. If
a Man have given his Opinion about the right one way or other, may you
not upon a <hi>Voire dire</hi> ask him whether he hath given his Opinion one way
or other? I believe it may be ask in a Civil Cauſe becauſe he may have been
a Refferree; but if you make it criminal it cannot be askt, becauſe a Man is
not bound to accuſe himſelf; now the Difference lies in the nature of the
Cauſe, it is not Criminal in a Civil Caſe for a Man to ſay he was an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator
in ſuch a Caſe, and, upon what appeared before him, he was of ſuch
an Opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, it is a different Caſe to give an opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Right between Party and Party where a Man has been an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and ſo in the Nature of a Judge, and where a Man is to go upon a Jury
in the Caſe of Life and Death, and before the Evidence given he declares his
Opinion without hearing the Cauſe.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnal.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the Court are of opinion that it is ſuch a Crime that
it cannot be askt, as tending to make a Man accuſe himſelf of an infamous
Crime, then we ſubmit it to you, and I confeſs we muſt not ask it; but we
cannot apprehend that there is either Crime or Infamy in it, tho we think
it is an Objection and a good Cauſe of Challenge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. B. <hi>Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I think, tho it be not ſuch a Crime as infamous upon which
a Man is not to be credited, for that is Infamy in the Eye of the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Man is prejudiced in his Credit; yet however it is a ſhameful thing for
a Man to give his Judgment before he hath heard the Evidence and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think you ought not to ask him it, to make him accuſe himſelf, if it
be an opprobrious matter upon him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly, my Lord, I always took it to be the Rule, if the
the thing asked to the Perſon returned be not criminal nor infamous, the
Party that is askt ought to anſwer to it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I would fain know, if you ſhould ask any of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38574:13"/>
this Queſtion, whether he be guilty of all the Crimes that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Undoubtedly we cannot ask any ſuch Queſtion; no,

               <p>But yet you will force him to diſcover a Crime (if it be

               <speaker>Mr. J. <hi>Powell.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Certainly you go too far, Brother, for no Man is obliged to

<hi>I believe ſuch a one will be hanged,</hi> is of another Conſideration.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it will be no eaſy thing to bring Witneſſes to

               </speaker>
               <p>And it is a very hard matter for a Man to be put upon

               </speaker>
               <p>The Reaſon of your Exception is, that he has declared his
opinion before hand, that the Party would be hanged or would ſuffer, that's
a Reproach and a Reflection upon a Wiſe man ſo to do; and if they can
prove it upon him let them do it: but whether you ſhould ask him ſuch a
Queſtion, Whether he be a Fool or a Knave for the giving an opinion one way
or other, that's the Queſtion before us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we do not offer it to the Court as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But what a Man does utter imprudently may occaſion a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice

               <p>Eſpecially being a Freeholder of <hi>London,</hi> and taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what is done in <hi>London;</hi> and if he does take notice of the Fact, and
does previouſly give his Opinion of a matter which he may be called upon a
Jury to try, this is an Indiſcretion and a Reproach to him, and I think a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I acknowledge it is ill done of him, that is,
indiſcreetly and not wiſely, and we would have Diſcreet and Wiſe men upon

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall</hi> will make it ſo little a thing at laſt
that it will amount to no cauſe of Challenge, if it were even proved againſt
him, which we inſiſt it ought to be, it being their Objection, and the Party
not being bound to prove it againſt himſelf; but truly we think there is more
in it than ſo, becauſe it is an unjuſt prejudging of a Man before he is tryed and
heard, and if ſo, it is a thing that he ought not to accuſe himſelf of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we oppoſe the asking any ſuch Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Our Objection is not becauſe it is an Offence to declare
a Man's opinion upon a Fact reported, but becauſe it ſhews he has a ſettled opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
againſt the Perſon of his Guilt, and ſo he is not ſo equal a Man to try him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Treby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And is that like a Honeſt man and a Freeholder of <hi>London,</hi>
(who ought to be indifferent) to come with a ſettled opinion againſt a Man,
when he is to be one of his Jury?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well, my Lord, we have been heard, and ſubmit it to
the Judgment of the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Treby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly I think it reflects both Diſhoneſty and Diſhonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and therefore theſe Queſtions ought not to be askt. The Queſtion
is <hi>not</hi> whether a Man (if ever ſuch a Man there were) that hath ſo reſolved
and declared ſhall be ſworn? No; he is not fit to ſerve upon a Jury. But the
Queſtion is, How this ſhall be diſcovered, by his own Oath or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proof? I think it ought to be made appear by other Proof, if true. A
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38574:13"/>
Man attainted of Felony, Forgery, Falſe Verdict, or Perjury, ought not to
ſerve on a Jury, yet he ſhall not be examined concerning the ſame on a <hi>Voire
dire.</hi> And if there be in Court a Copy of ſuch Judgment carefully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and kept by himſelf, he ſhall not be forced to Anſwer whether it be a
true Copy; tho his Anſwer could not ſubject him to any further Penalty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I hope no Gentleman of the Jury has done it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Treby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I hope no Freeholder of <hi>London</hi> is ſo indiſcreet or ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.
But if any Man in this Pannel have any particular Diſpleaſure to the
Priſoner, or be unindifferent, or have declared himſelf ſo, I do admoniſh
and deſire him to diſcover ſo much in general; for, it is not fit, nor for the
honour of the King's Juſtice, that ſuch a Man ſhould ſerve on the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>We hope ſo too. We hope that all that are returned
upon the Jury are diſcreet and impartial Men.</p>

               <p>I have a Leaſe for One and fifty Years, my Lord, of my Houſe,

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen that

the Priſoner at the Bar, and the Indictment ſets forth, That whereas
there has been an open and cruel War for a long time, and ſtill is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> and the French King, the Priſoner at

and Deprive the King of the Title, Honour, and Dignity of the

and did adhere to the King's Enemies; and to fulfil theſe Treaſons, he

executed for it, to ſend over to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to perſwade the

laid to be againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, againſt the King's Peace,
Crown and Dignity, and againſt the Form of the Statute in that Caſe
made and provided; to this he had pleaded Not Guilty, and for Tryal

but at preſent this is not the time of Examination; for the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

but when the time comes for the Witneſſes to be called and examined,

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, the Priſoner ſtands Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for High Treaſon, in Compaſſing and Imagining the Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of his Majeſty, and likewiſe in adhering to his Majeſty's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
theſe are the Treaſons ſpecified in the Indictment: the <hi>Overt Acts</hi>
that are laid to prove theſe Treaſons are, That he with ſeveral other Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
named in the Indictment, did Meet and Conſult, and agree to ſend
over <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to invite the French King to make an Invaſion
upon the Kingdom, and did provide Arms for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the nature of the Evidence that you will have produced
to prove the Priſoner Guilty of theſe Treaſons lies thus: It will appear to
you that there has been for ſome time a Conſpiracy carried on by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Traytors, and Wicked Perſons, to ſubvert the eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Kingdom, and deſtroy the Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> by a
Foreign Invaſion of the French. You will hear that this Conſpiracy was
laid wide, and conſiſted of ſeveral parts, one part was that of <hi>Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, and that was to be done firſt, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and Encouragement to the French to invade the Kingdom: the
other part was the inviting the French King to <hi>invade</hi> us, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Bar is accuſed of being concerned in that part that relates to
the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of this Kingdom, by a French Power; and tho' it may be
the other part, that of Aſſaſſinating the King, be the Blackeſt part of
the Conſpiracy, yet if the Priſoner at the Bar has been ingaged in the
inviting a Foreign Power to invade the Kingdom, my Lords, the Judges,
will tell you, in Point of Law, that is as much an Overt Act of the
Compaſſing the Deſtruction of the King and People of <hi>England,</hi> and
the Subverſion of our ancient good Conſtitution, as if he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
immediately in the other part, the Aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:38574:18"/>
But now, Gentlemen, that the Priſoner was ingaged in Inviting the <hi>French</hi>
to Invade us, you will hear proved by ſeveral Witneſſes, that there having
been a Deſign laſt Year, juſt before his Majeſty went to <hi>Flanders,</hi> to expoſe
his own Perſon for our Protection, and the Protection of the Liberties of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
there was a Conſpiracy to Murder him before he went to <hi>Flanders,</hi> which,
it ſeems, they were not ripe for then; but immediately after he was gone to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> you will hear there were formal Meetings of ſeveral Gentlemen and
Perſons of Quality, among whom the Priſoner at the Barr was one: There
was a Meeting in <hi>May,</hi> laſt Year, after the King was gone to <hi>Flanders;</hi> and
this was at the <hi>Old King's Head</hi> in <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet;</hi> and there were preſent,
my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Freind,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> (all which Three laſt have ſuffered the Puniſhment of-the
Law for their Treaſon already;) and there were alſo Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
at the Barr, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman;</hi> theſe Men did meet together'
to conſider of the beſt Ways and Means of Encouraging and Inviting the
<hi>French</hi> King with an Armed Force to Invade this Kingdom; They conſidered
that That was a proper Opportunity, and did treat of ſeveral Arguments that
might perſwade to it: Firſt, that the King was gone to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſo was
not in Perſon here to Defend us; and that the Troops, to make good ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
were in a great meaſure drawn thither, to aſſiſt the Allies againſt the
<hi>French</hi> Power; They did think likewiſe, that at that time there was a great
Diſcontent and Diſſatisfaction in the Nation, though I think in that they were
greatly miſtaken; and I believe and hope they will always find themſelves ſo,
to think that the People of <hi>England</hi> are ſo little ſenſible of that which is the
means of their Preſervation, as to hearken to any Diſcontents to Incourage a
<hi>French</hi> Power to come into <hi>England</hi> to deſtroy our Religion and Liberties;
that indeed they did apprehend, though they were miſtaken, and I believe
they always will, when they go upon that ground.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Theſe Perſons thinking this a proper Opportunity, did agree to
ſend a Meſſenger into <hi>France</hi> upon this Meſſage, To go to the late King <hi>James,</hi>
and perſwade him to deſire and prevail with the <hi>French</hi> King to aſſiſt him with
Ten thouſand Men, 8000 Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him, they promiſed their Aſſiſtance here, as ſoon as he came over;
and undertook, that between them, they could furniſh, and wou'd raiſe 2000
Horſe to meet him at his Landing, and joyn upon ſuch an Invaſion.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, At this Meeting this was agreed upon by all that were there,
whereof the Priſoner was one; and they did agree to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> (who
has ſince been executed, and a principal Incourager of the Deſign, and Actor
in it;) he was the Meſſenger that was appointed to go upon this Errand, and
Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was reſolved to go, but deſired another Meeting of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to know if they continued in their former Reſolution, that he might
have all the Aſſurance that was Reaſonable to give the <hi>French</hi> King Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make the Invaſion: Accordingly another Meeting was had of moſt of
the ſame perſons that were at the Meeting before; particularly the Priſoner at
the Barr was at that ſecond Meeting, which was in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> at one
Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s, who keeps a Tavern next door to Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
there they met upon the ſame Deſign, and upon Conſultation had, and
the Queſtion ask'd, they did agree to continue in the former Reſolution, and
upon that immediately Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> went into <hi>France</hi> to ſollicit Forces from
thence to Invade us; but it happ'ned, as it ſeems, that the <hi>French</hi> King's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were otherwiſe imployed, ſo that he cou'd not ſpare ſo many at that
time; and this Return was brought by <hi>Chernock</hi> to the Gentlemen that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
him; That he had ſpoke with the late King, who gave him that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38574:19"/>
That the <hi>French</hi> King cou'd not ſpare ſo many Men at that time, but he
thank'd them for their Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This will be the nature of Our Evidence, to ſhow, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at the Barr was concerned in that part of the Conſpiracy which relates
to the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion; and if he be guilty of that, in point of Law, he is as
much guilty of the Conſpiracy, to Depoſe and Murder the King, as if he had
been concerned in the other part of Aſſaſſinating his Royal Perſon; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no body can think that thoſe that were to act in the Aſſaſſination, wou'd
have attempted to ingage in ſuch a deſperate Deſign, if it had not been for
the Incouragement of the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion that was to ſecond them afterwards,
if they ſucceeded; ſo that no body can extenuate the Crime of the Invaſion,
becauſe as to the Horridneſs of the Attempt, it is leſs Black than the other;
they are both Crimes of a very high nature, and equally High-Treaſon; and
if we prove the Priſoner Guilty of this part, we hope you will find him
Guilty.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I ask'd Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> what we ſhou'd do after

at that Meeting, becauſe the Jury were interrupted from hearing by Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
buzzing about them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodman.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, When Captain <hi>Porter</hi> brought me up into
the Room, I told you what Gentlemen I found there; after we were ſet
down, there was a Conſultation, that conſidering the <hi>French</hi> King's Wars
Retarded the Affair of ſending back King <hi>James,</hi> and the means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
him to the Crown, it was fit we ſhou'd find out ſome way or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to facilitate his Reſtoration, and it was thought convenient to have
a Meſſenger to ſend over to King <hi>James</hi> with Propoſals for that purpoſe;
to this effect, as near as I remember, That if King <hi>James</hi> cou'd prevail
with the <hi>French</hi> King to furniſh Ten thouſand Men, whereof 8000 to
be Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons, we wou'd endeavour to meet
him at the Head of as many Horſe as we cou'd raiſe, to ſuſtain thoſe
Forces at their Landing: This was Debated, in order to come to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
and much Difficulty there was how many the Number ſhould be;
the Man pitch'd upon to be ſent, was Mr. <hi>Chernock;</hi> and after ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
how many Thouſand Horſe could be raiſed: Says Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi>
Don't let me go over upon a fooliſh Errand, but let me know what I
have to ſay exactly: Thereupon it was concluded by all, that Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe ſhould be the Number we cou'd promiſe, and the King might
depend upon them; and if we brought more, ſo much the better; and
Sir <hi>John Freind</hi> ſaid, I believe he has ſo many Friends here, that if he
came himſelf, he might be welcome; but that we did not think fit to
truſt to; and no body wou'd adviſe any ſuch thing: when the Reſolution
of the Thing and the Number was thus fix'd, Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> ask'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were with all our Conſents? and that he might aſſure the King,
that this was our Reſolution thereupon? we all roſe up, and ſaid to him,
<hi>Yes, you may, yes, you may,</hi> every one particularly; and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
one thing particularly concerning the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> That he
kneel'd upon the Chair when he ſaid <hi>Yes, you may;</hi> and his Elbows were
upon the Table: This is all that I know of that Meeting. There was to
be another Meeting, as Captain <hi>Porter</hi> told me; but I had buſineſs in the
City: but whatſoever he promiſed on my behalf, as to the Quota of
Men, I wou'd be ſure to make it good; and I was not at the ſecond
Meeting.</p>

that he had been with the ſeveral Gentlemen to carry them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>Then, Brother <hi>Darnall,</hi> what ſay you for the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Darnall.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen
of the Jury: I am Counſel, in this Caſe, for the Priſoner at the Bar,
Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> who ſtands Indicted of a very great Offence, no leſs, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
than High-Treaſon; and if he be Guilty, his Puniſhment will be
as great: But becauſe the Puniſhment and the Offence are both very
great, the Law requires exact poſitive Proof, and that by two credible
Witneſſes. There have been two indeed that have been produced to you;
and if you believe both of them, after what we ſhall offer to you againſt
them; and if what they ſwear be true, the Priſoner is Guilty: But if we
ſatisfie you that either of them is not to be credited, ſo that you do not
believe both of them, he muſt be acquitted.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, Gentlemen, but that here has been a Villanous Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Plot; there is no queſtion of it; and it was, as it has been opened,
baſely to Aſſaſſinate one of the braveſt Men living; and to make the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
People in the World, if they know when they are ſo, the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
People upon Earth, by bringing them under <hi>French</hi> Tyranny and
Slavery. Many of the Traytors have been brought to juſt Puniſhment
for this Treaſon; nay, they have own'd the Fact at their Death's, ſo
that there is no queſtion of the Truth of it; And therefore, Gentlemen,
every honeſt Man will endeavour to bring ſuch as are plainly Guilty, of
ſuch an abominable Conſpiracy, to juſt Puniſhment; but yet they will
be as carefull not to let an innocent Man ſuffer; that, Gentlemen, every
honeſt Man will take care of, and eſpecially ſuch as are upon their Oaths:
It concerns a Jury highly to be ſatisfied, that he is not Innocent, whom
they bring in Guilty; for 'tis better that twenty guilty Men ſhou'd eſcape,
than one innocent Man ſuffer.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, if my Brief be true, we ſhall give you ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one of theſe Witneſſes; firſt, as to the Man himſelf; that he is
not a Man to be credited as a Witneſs; and then beſides that, as to the
Evidence he gives in this Caſe; (I ſay, if my Brief be true) it is falſe,
and we ſhall prove it ſo; and when you have heard our Evidence, if you
are ſatisfied that one of theſe Witneſſes is not to be credited, or that what
he ſwears is not true, you are to acquit the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Here has been one Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> produced as a Witneſs,
one that never was produced before at the Tryal of any of thoſe that
have ſuffered, ſo that the truth of their Guilt does not at all depend upon
his Evidence, nor does it give any credit to it. This is this Gentleman's
firſt Entry upon this Stage; and yet (if my Brief be true) this is not the
firſt bloody or cruel Part that he has Acted; for we have a Record of
Conviction againſt him, whereby it will appear to you, that he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
(for Endeavouring to Poiſon two Great Dukes) for giving forty
Guinea's to an <hi>Italian</hi> Emprick, one <hi>Amidei,</hi> and promiſing Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds more when it was effected, to Poiſon the late Duke of <hi>Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and the preſent Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and we ſhall ſhew you,
that he was Convicted of it, and Fined a Thouſand Pound for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
which, conſidering the meanneſs of his Circumſtances at that
time, was as much as Twenty thouſand Pounds; for he could as well
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38574:22"/>
have paid Twenty, as One then; and it appears too, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>
(nay, it will not be denied by him himſelf) was in this Horrid Plot;
and he that wou'd be concern'd to Poiſon two Dukes in a Family, to
which he had ſo many Obligations—</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> be quiet, and ſtay till by and by; you

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Darnall.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, my Lord, he that wou'd be concern'd in ſo
vile an Act, as a Contrivance to take away the Lives of two great Dukes,
(who were, in effect, his young Maſtes,) that he ſhou'd go to Poiſon
them in a Family to which he had been ſo much obliged; and then, he
that wou'd be concerned in ſo Horrid a Plot as this was, to deſtroy his
Country, and take away the Life of the King; ſure it will be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to think that this Man will not ſtick at the little Priſoner's Life
at the Barr, eſpecially when he has ſo great a temptation to it, as to ſave
his own Life by it.</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome of you may doubt whether it is to ſave his own Life
or no: But I believe there are none of you would give any credit to
him, if you thought ſo: Therefore, to ſatisfie you of that Fact, we ſhall
produce you Evidence of his own Opinion of that matter, beſides the
General known Circumſtances he lay under; As, That he was long in
Priſon before he charged the Priſoner with any thing, and the Priſoner
was at Liberty, went every day abroad for a Week after Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s
Tryal, and never abſconded one Minute, but lived publickly, openly and
viſibly to all his Friends, and all Strangers: But beſides, Gentlemen, that
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> knew he muſt dye, and juſtly and deſervedly for this Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Plot and Treaſon himſelf; and had no other way left to ſave his Life,
but to come in thus as an Evidence and an Accuſer, which we think will
ſhake his Credit with you.</p>
               <p>I ſay, beſides all this, (if my Brief be true,) we ſhall prove that he has
ſaid himſelf, That either he muſt Hang <hi>Peter Cook,</hi> or he muſt be Hang'd
himſelf. Thus, Gentlemen, he ſwears to ſave his own Life, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
another's.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, is as to the Man himſelf, that he is not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.
But now further, as to the Evidence that he has given; He tells
you that he came into the Tavern in <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet,</hi> and that there
he found ſuch Company; he owns he came in after Dinner; and that
the other Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> owns too; he ſays there were preſent
at this Meeting, my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
and ſeveral other Gentlemen; but (if my Brief be true) we ſhall prove
by three Witneſſes, that he was not there till they were gone; and that
will make an end of all the pretence of his Evidence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Darn.</speaker>
               <p>I'll aſſure you, Sir, I have the Names of Three Witneſſes in my
Brief, to prove that my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
were gone before he came in, tho' if any, or either of them were gone,
it deſtroys his Teſtimony; and if we prove this to you, I wou'd be loath
to be one of the Jury that ſhould take away the Priſoner's Life upon
this Evidence; no, it he were the vileſt Man alive, and much leſs the Life
of the Priſoner at the Bar; for we ſhall prove (if my Brief be true.) he is a Man
of Morals, a Man of Virtue, one that has a great Love for his Country; and
this we ſhall prove by Evidence undeniable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perſons of Quality in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſuch as ſerve their Country in Parliament, as their Repreſentatives;
we ſhal ſhew it by ſuch Evidence, that there will be no Room to
doubt of it: He is a Man without any Stain or Blot upon him, til this
Accuſation; he is the eldeſt Son of his Father, and Heir to a great Eſtate;
his Father is a great Officer, and a great Getter under this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and can it be imagin'd, or believ'd, that ſuch a Man would be
guilty of the worſt of Treaſons, to deſtroy the Religion he profeſſes, to
over-turn the State, to ruine his own Eſtate, himſelf and his Poſterity,
which muſt be the Conſequence of it? Nay, if two good Witneſſes
cou'd be produc'd to teſtifie it, and if we had not had ſo much to take
off the Credit of <hi>Goodman,</hi> I cou'd hardly believe it of any Man that was
in his right Senſes; he muſt have been a Mad-man if he had done it, one
that ſtood ſo well with the preſent Government, and of a Family never
tainted with Diſloyalty.</p>
               <p>Certainly, Gentlemen, when we make out this to you againſt Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
the Priſoner can be in no Danger of his Life, from Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
tho' he is an unfortunate Man to come under ſuch an Accuſation;
but I cannot believe that any Jury, upon ſuch a Man's Evidence, will brand
an honeſt Family with the fouleſt, vileſt, blackeſt Treaſon that ever was

upon <hi>Thurſday:</hi> I ask'd him whether it was for the Aſſaſſination-Plot, and
he told me, no; for what then, ſaid I, as being concerned in ſending Mr.
<hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France?</hi> Who are the Evidences againſt him, ſaid I? ſaid he,
Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and my ſelf; ſaid I, I believe two Witneſſes will be found
good, or by way of Demonſtration in Law; and I pity the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Caſe. Says he, He ſwore againſt me; how comes it then, ſaid I,

give an account of no body elſe but me, and that was the Reaſon he had no
Pardon; ſaid I to him, who are the Evidences againſt him? ſays he,
Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> and my ſelf, and after this, ſays he, he, or I, muſt periſh,
or he, or I, muſt ſuffer, I believe the word was ſuffer; but, ſays he, 'tis a
fooliſh thing to be hang'd; all that's ſaid of a Man that is hang'd, is, that
he hang'd hanſomly, or he dy'd bravely, that's all the Diſcourſe that I can
remember.</p>

hang my Client, to ſave his own life.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I think it was about four a Clock.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crawford.</speaker>
               <p>I did attend upon them the moſt part of the time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crawford.</speaker>
               <p>I did not ſee him there, to my Remembrance; no body came in
there before they went away, ſaving their own Servants.</p>

one of the Gentlemen that were at your Houſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crawf.</speaker>
               <p>No, not all the while I was not in the Room, but going to and fro.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Darn.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> did not come up till after they

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Attorn. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Juſt now it was ſaid he did not come till they were gone, and

               <p>But, Brother <hi>Darnall,</hi> you open'd it, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> came
after my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was gone, and now you will prove it that he came
not at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir. B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we do not pretend to falſifie his Evidence for any
thing more than is material for the Priſoner; we ſay Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not
in the Room where they din'd till thoſe Perſons went away, if in any particular
we diſprove him. it is ſufficient for us; if we can ſhew that he was not there
till three of thoſe that he had nam'd were gone away, that anſwers our end.
We are not concerned if he came at four, five, or ſix a Clock, and diſcours'd
with <hi>Chernock</hi> till twelve a Clock at Night.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray reſerve your Remarks, but only obſerve now what he
ſays, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> came not at all thither, and that is more than you
pretended to open.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we are not contending now about a Man's come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up without his knowledge, but whether any ſuch Man, as Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi>
came up and ſtaid there, during the Conſultation, and we inſiſt upon it;
there was no body there, till my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crawf.</speaker>

               <p>I cannot remember what time the reſt went away; our Houſe is
fuller at Night than at Noon; and I waited upon other Companies. It
was pretty late before they went away, that I am ſure.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>

               <p>When you went into the Room after Dinner, did you look

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cock.</speaker>
               <p>I did look about the Room ſeveral times, and ſo did my Servants,
to ſee if there were any thing wanting.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cock.</speaker>
               <p>He might come in, and I not ſee him.</p>

               <p>I believe not, Sir; for I came in half a dozen times after Dinner,

               <p>Sir, pray will you tell my Lord and the Jury what you know of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
abroad after the Plot was diſcovered?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Nicholls.</speaker>
               <p>I was ſent down to the Trial, I was preſent and did attend at
two Trials indeed, and I ſuppoſe Mr. Baron <hi>Powis</hi> may remember that I attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at two Trials at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Aſſizes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. B. Powis.</speaker>
               <p>Poſſibly you might, Sir; I can't tell all the Attendance at the
Aſſizes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Nicholls.</speaker>
               <p>And after my return from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Aſſizes, <hi>Mr. Cook</hi> was
with me ſeveral days, both at my Office, and Chamber, and at his Father's
Office; and I remember particularly that he threatned me that I was in trouble
when I was at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and therefore I remember it very well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir.</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholls,</hi> you know Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> very well, pray what are his
Morals?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Nicholls.</speaker>
               <p>Upon occaſion of the Cauſe in Chancery that went to Trial, I
have had the knowledge of <hi>Mr. Cook</hi> five or ſix years, I always believed him to
be as temperate a man as ever I met with. I think in five years time I was not
above once with him in a Tavern.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Did you ever hear him Swear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Nicholls.</speaker>
               <p>No, never, nor vent a Curſe; I believe he drank as little as any
man, and was as godly a man; I never heard him ſpeak a foul word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>How do you know that, Sir, that he was ſo godly a man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Nicholls.</speaker>
               <p>Upon occaſion of this Cauſe I was ſeveral times at Sir <hi>Miles
Cook</hi>'s, and at <hi>Mr. Cook</hi>'s Lodgings there, and we were to go about Buſineſs,
and after he was dreſt, he has made me ſtay while he went into his Cloſet and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38574:28"/>
ſaid his Prayers. And he told me further, that he never went out of his Father's
doors without ſaying his Prayers; and I was forc'd to ſtay at the door while he
perform'd his Devotions, as he told me, and I believe he did.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Now, my Lord, we will call ſome other Witneſſes to prove
his good affection to his Country, how he continually deſired ſucceſs to the Fleet,
and to the Army.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, will you give an account what you know of the
Priſoner, concerning his Judgment, and concerning his Morals?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hamond.</speaker>
               <p>I have been for ſome time acquainted with Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> the Priſoner at
the Bar, and to the beſt of my obſervation, I always took him to be a Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Man, and I have heard him declare great deteſtation of a <hi>French</hi> Force;
and three or four days before he was taken into Cuſtody, I ask'd him what he
heard of Intelligence? he ſaid he heard what was in the publick Prints, and
heard no more, and knew no more; and he had a great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Conſpiracy, and thought it a very monſtrous thing; I never
heard him ſpeak a diſreſpectful word of the King's Perſon or Government in my
life: And I ſay again, I have heard him ſeveral times declare in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
that he had an averſion to a <hi>French</hi> Power, and he had a dread of it.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Darnall.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>What have you heard him ſay about our Fleet, or Army?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hamond.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have heard him very much wiſh Proſperity and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we leave it here; but I muſt beg the favour, that if
they give any new Evidence, and there be occaſion, we may have liberty to
anſwer it. And I have an Obſervation or two to make when the Evidence is
over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if they have done with their Evidence, I beg leave
to obſerve that there is ſomething ariſes upon that Evidence, that will give us
occaſion to call a Witneſs or two more. My Lord, the firſt Witneſs which they
call was <hi>Edwards,</hi> and he is in Cuſtody upon ſuſpicion of High Treaſon in <hi>Newgate,</hi>
and he gives an account of ſome diſcourſe that he had with Mr. <hi>Goodman;</hi> and
for that it will be neceſſary for us to call <hi>Mr. Porter</hi> again, and <hi>Mr. Delarue,</hi> to
ſhew that this <hi>Edwards</hi> the Witneſs, as he is Committed for ſuſpicion of High
Treaſon, ſo he was in the Conſpiracy for the Aſſaſſination; he was one in the
Liſt that was brought back by <hi>Cranburne</hi> from <hi>Mr. Chernock</hi> to Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> as
one of <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Men, and he is in Cuſtody for it. Then as to the other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they have called three Witneſſes to prove that <hi>Mr. Goodman</hi> was not in this
place at this time. The Councel indeed opened it that he was not at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
'till after my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> were gone away,
but their Evidence goes further, that he was not there at all; and the Maſter
of the Houſe ſays, he was not there to his knowledge at any time. So that if
their Evidence prove any thing, they prove that he was not there at all, they
do not remember that they ſaw him there; ſo that the Queſtion will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mr. Goodman</hi> was there at that time, and it will be neceſſary to call <hi>Mr.
Goodman</hi> again, and <hi>Mr. Porter,</hi> to confront theſe Witneſſes, who will tell you
when he came in; and particularly as to my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> that he went with
him to the Stairs-head, and my Lord would not let him go further, but he
went back again when my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> went down ſtairs. We will begin
with the Witneſſes, as to this <hi>Edwards.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Delarue.</speaker>
               <p>He goes by ſeveral Names, I know him by the Name of <hi>Douglas;</hi>
and laſt <hi>Monday</hi> I came into the <hi>Preſs-Yard,</hi> and ſaluted him by the Name of
<hi>Douglas,</hi> and he ſaid he had taken his own Name again, by which he was known

               <p>I know him very well, there he ſtands, that is the Perſon in the

to Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> at the Foot of the Liſt which Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> had ſent to him,
there were other Names written, as I believe, in Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Hand; and
among thoſe Names there was the Name of <hi>Douglas,</hi> which I underſtood to be
this <hi>Mr. Edwards,</hi> as he calls himſelf. And moreover, when <hi>Mr. Porter</hi> went
out of Town, going to Doctor's Commons, I called at <hi>Mr. Chernock</hi>'s and he had
a great deal of Company with him, 4 or 5 Troopers, and among the reſt this
<hi>Edwards</hi> or <hi>Douglas</hi> was there ſitting by him. Here is a Gentleman that I ſee
upon the Bench, I think he is a Scotch-man, that knew him at St. <hi>Germains</hi> as

               <p>You can't ask him the Queſtion; you know it tends to make

in the mean time, till he comes, we'll examine <hi>Mr. Goodman,</hi> becauſe he is here.
<hi>Mr. Goodman,</hi> you were by, and heard what theſe Drawers ſaid concerning your

when you came in, whether you ſaw my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> and what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Porter</hi> brought me up; and when I came in they were all
ſitting; and after Salutation I ſat down: And when they had conſulted ſome
time, they came to a Reſolution, as I have told you already. The Fellows are
ſo far in the right of it, that my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> went
away firſt; for I took my leave of them at the Head of the Stairs. Says my
Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> to me, Pray avoid Ceremony, we will go away privately as
we came, in a Hackney Coach. And as to the Maſter of the Houſe, who ſays,
he does not know me, I have Dined ſeveral times there, four or five times with
Sir <hi>John Friend;</hi> and one particular Day above all the reſt, I remember I was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38574:29"/>
not well, and I went down Stairs to the Bar, and ſaid, I pray can you get me a
little Brandy. He ſaid, Yes, he would help me to ſome of the beſt in <hi>England.</hi>
And he brought me up ſome which I like very well: And thinking he had a
Quantity of it, I askt him what I ſhou'd give him a Gallon for a Parcel. But he
ſaid, He had but a little; and I am ſure he has ſeen me there five or ſix times.</p>

Come, Sir, you hear what <hi>Mr. Goodman</hi> has ſworn, and mind it, you are upon

not well, he askt for ſome Brandy, and you told him, You'd give him ſome of
the beſt in <hi>England.</hi> And he propounded to you then to ſell him ſome of it; but
it ſeems there was no Bargain made. Do you remember any ſuch thing of one

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodman ſent up his Name to me, and I told the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Porter.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Porter.</speaker>
               <p>It was very near two hours after he came in, before they

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> B. Shower.</speaker>
               <p>Then I beg the favour of a word or two, my Lord. May
it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel
in this Caſe for the Priſoner at the Bar, and I muſt beg your Lordſhip's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and your favour, Gentlemen, to make a few Obſervations upon the
Evidence that has been given; for we humbly inſiſt upon it in point of
Law, that here is not ſufficient Evidence before you to Convict the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
You are, Gentlemen, to have reſpect and regard to your Conſciences
and the Oaths which you have now taken to give a Verdict, and make
true Deliverance between the King, and the Priſoner; you are not to go
according to your own private Opinions, nor according to publick Fame,
nor according to common Report, nor according to the Verdicts in other
Caſes, nor according to the Confeſſions or Dying Speeches of Criminals
who have been Executed, <hi>whether made by themſelves, or by others for
them;</hi> but you are to go by the Teſtimony of Credible Witneſſes, and if
you have not the Evidence of two Credible Witneſſes before you, my
Lords the Judges will inform you how the Law ſtands. That by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and the New Statute for Trials of Treaſons, there
muſt be two Witneſſes to prove the Priſoner guilty of the Overt Act of
the Treaſon that is laid in the Indictment; and whether there have been
two Credible Witneſſes produced before you, is the Queſtion that you are
to conſider upon your Oath and Conſcience; that is, whether you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
here be two ſuch as the Law requires. The Queſtion is not meerly
whether Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> be Guilty, but whether in your Conſciences he be <hi>legally</hi>
prov'd Guilty; whether there be Evidence to ſatisfie your Conſciences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of the Land, that he is Guilty; and we inſiſt there is
not; and therefore I beg leave to recapitulate what was been Sworn
againſt him, that we may ſee how far it reaches, and wherein it is
defective.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:38574:30"/>
Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> he Swears that about the beginning or middle of
<hi>May,</hi> he cannot tell which, there was this Meeting at the <hi>Old King's-Head
Tavern</hi> in <hi>Leaden-Hall-Street;</hi> in which, I wou'd obſerve to you, that he
confines himſelf to a certain Month; the Reaſon is very plain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ask'd him whether it was not in <hi>April;</hi> for if he had ſaid it had
been then, there had been no danger to the Priſoner, becauſe of the Act
of Indempnity, therefore he was careful to fix it in <hi>May;</hi> and he wou'd
not lay it in <hi>June,</hi> for the Tenth of <hi>June</hi> is a Famous Day; and then, or
ſoon after, <hi>Newgate</hi> had him; he was Confined there for a Riot on that
Day, and ſo they have reſtrained it to a Month, and the only Month
that he is capable of Swearing to, as to any Act done the laſt year 'till
they came in <hi>January</hi> to the Aſſaſſination Plot, which the Priſoner is not
accuſed to have had any Concern in; but it ſhou'd ſeem he cannot tell
what Day of the Week, or of the Month, but about the beginning or
the middle of <hi>May</hi> eight Perſons Dined at this place, and then after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Mr. Goodman</hi> came in, and they diſcours'd about this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Gentlemen, we inſiſt upon it, that it is very improbable that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Proteſtants of pious Converſation and good Morals, ſhou'd agree, as
he ſays, to ſend ſuch a Meſſage to the late King, to Invite over a <hi>French</hi>
Popiſh Force; we may eaſily ſee the horrid and miſchievous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that wou'd have followed ſuch a practice, ſuch as muſt affect every
Engliſh-man with a Concern, ſo that it is improbable a Man of Vertue
and Piety cou'd engage in ſuch an Enterprize; and if it it be improbable,
you will never believe it, unleſs the Conviction or Proof be irreſiſtable:
And if you have any other Reaſons to diſtruſt this Man's Truth, then
we hope you will go upon the ſide of probability; and not let Popular
Prejudice, Common Fame, or any thing elſe but Legal and Undeniable
Evidence have the Aſcendant over you. If you are not ſatisfied that
<hi>Mr. Cook</hi> did aſſent (as from the Character of the Man it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he ſhou'd) to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to perſwade King <hi>Lewis</hi>
and King <hi>James</hi> to ſend Ten Thouſand Men to Invade our Country, then
he is not Guilty.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Gentlemen, he is not Guilty we ſay in the Eye of
the Law, if they have not two Witneſſes; and for that we ſay you
have but one, or but one that is to be believed; and if you have but
one that is to be believed, that in Law is but one, and conſequently
my Client is not Guilty; ſo the King's Councel agree, that if there be
but one Witneſs, he cannot be Convicted, the Law is plain in the
Caſe. Now to make it out that here is but one Witneſs at moſt, we
have offered you ſeveral Objections, and made them out by Evidence,
againſt the Teſtimony of <hi>Mr. Goodman;</hi> that he is not a Perſon fit to
be believed; and if he be out of the Caſe, then does <hi>Mr. Porter</hi>'s ſtand
alone, and all will amount but to one Witneſs, ſuppoſe it ſhou'd be
granted that his Teſtimony were true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We have read a Record of Conviction againſt him, of a Crime,
one of the greateſt next unto Treaſon, that is known in our or any
other Law. That he hired a Man to Poiſon two Dukes, Branches
of a Noble Family, to which he had ſuch great Obligations, as all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
do know, and he himſelf cannot but acknowledge; and if there
were not that aggravation in it, of his Obligations to that Family, yet to lie
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38574:30"/>
in wait to Murder and Poyſon, is ſuch an Offence as any Age can ſeldom
ſhow the like. And the Objection is not ſo very eaſily anſwer'd as they
would have it; nor can it be ſo ſoon paſſed over as they think, by ſaying
He is a Witneſs of a Confederacy with which the Priſoner is accus'd, a
Crime greater than the thing objected. It is true, none can bear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in ſuch a buſineſs, but he that is a Party: But, we ſay, if theſe
Perſons, who come and ſet up themſelves for Witneſſes, were not <hi>probi Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi>
and did not appear to be perſons of indifferent Credit between
Man and Man, and did not ſtand impartial in the Eye of the World in
other reſpects before, then they are not to be believ'd, as to what they
charge themſelves and others to be guilty of. Now, if Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> ſtand
convicted of ſuch an Offence as this that is alledg'd againſt him, tho' he is
pardon'd by the Act of Parliament, or Satisfaction acknowledg'd upon the
Record, tho' it be even the very next Term, yet that does not purge him
from the Infamy and Diſgrace, or from the Imputation of being concern'd
in ſo Villanous a Deſign. It is impoſſible that he ſhould be a good Witneſs
that wou'd be engag'd in ſuch a matter; eſpecially when we have thoſe
Various Witneſſes, and ſuch a Concurring Teſtimony, that what he has
Sworn is abſolutely Falſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if there were nothing but his own Teſtimony in the Caſe,
there could be no Queſtion at all in it: And as to Captain <hi>Porter</hi>'s Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
about his being there, we have produc'd three Witneſſes, who, if they
be of Credit, then Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> is not to be believ'd, but is falſified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
for, it is not the Queſtion, Whether Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> went away before the
Conſultation and the Reſolution; for, if my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> or my Lord
<hi>Montgomery</hi> went away, Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> is falſify'd in that, and conſequently
you ought not to believe him in the reſt; for he actually Swears, that my
Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> and thoſe other Gentlemen, were
all preſent, and at the Conſult, and did conſent and agree to the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by uſing theſe words; <hi>Yes, you may; Yes, you may.</hi> Now, we ſay, there
are three Witneſſes that ſwear, That my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was gone before
he came there. I do not care whether he came there, or not; that is not
material: If there were no body there when my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was there
but thoſe that were at Dinner, for then Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not there at any
ſuch Conſultation, as they would inſinuate was at that Time, in that Place,
and that Company.</p>
               <p>My Lord, we have prov'd to you Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Abherrence and Declaration,
which, we think, ought to go a great way in ſatisfaction of his Innocence,
at leaſt to induce you to the favourable Side; for, Gentlemen, you are not
brought hither to Convict a Man only, but to Try and Examine him; and
it is your Duty to Acquit, as well as Convict, according as the Evidence
ſtands: It is your Duty to go according to your Conſciences, and to declare
whether he be Guilty, or Not Guilty, upon the Evidence you have before
you: You are to Examine the Truth of the Fact in all its Circumſtances, and
upon your own Conſciences to declare, whether he is Guilty or Not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
now we propoſe it to you, and ſubmit it to your Conſciences, That
here are Three Witneſſes, that ſpeak upon their Oaths, againſt whom there
is no Objection, That ever they were Guilty of lying in wait to Poyſon any
body, nor in any Plot for an Aſſaſſination, nor any Conſpiracy for inviting
an Invaſion from <hi>France,</hi> nor any other Objection againſt them, but they
ſtand upright in the Face of the World, and they Three ſwear, That he
was not there at that time. The Anſwer that we expect, is, That he might
be there, and they not ſee him: And becauſe it was poſſible he might be
there, and they not ſee him, therefore it is no Evidence: But, My Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>it may be ſo,</hi> is no Evidence that <hi>it is ſo;</hi> that's no Objection, for you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38574:31"/>
will take it as the nature of the thing will afford, and the Matter itſelf
allow. Now there can be no better Evidence than this; That they went
in and out continually; the Drawers, and the Maſter of the Houſe five or
ſix times himſelf, were in the Room, and they ſay, There was no ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
there. Why then it is very Improbable, if not Impoſſible, that any
ſuch Man ſhould be there. The one ſwears, He came down from my Lord
of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> juſt before he went away; and another ſays, He follow'd him
out of the Room; and the Maſter ſays, That he met my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi>
at the Stairs-head. All which falſifies Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> in that Particular, That
he was with my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> at the Stairs-head, when he went away.
Theſe are incompatible; and if we falſifie him in any one thing, he is not
to be believ'd in any other.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, we offer to your Conſideration an Anſwer to another
Objection: They ſay, theſe Witneſſes ſeem to ſwear, That he was not there
at all. We are not concern'd whether he was there afterwards, or not: If
you are ſatisfied, that he was not there, as our Witneſſes ſwear, while my
Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was there, that's enough. But then they make an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
How comes the Maſter of the Houſe to remember my Lord of <hi>Ailes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
going away, more than any body elſe? Gentlemen, you know the
nature of the thing ſhows, that not only that it was more probable the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Houſe ſhould make his Obſervations near the time of Dinner,
rather than afterwards at Night, when there is more Hurry: But it is more
probable he ſhould take notice of it from the Quality of the Perſon, from
the Diſcourſe he had with him about the Whitewine, which was a good
<hi>Medium</hi> to refreſh a Vintner's Memory, it being a matter in his own
Trade, and that might make him call it to mind.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Gentlemen, we think theſe three Witneſſes ſtand free and
clear in their Credit; and being ſo, are inconſiſtent with Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s
Teſtimony; and, we hope, in favour of Life, the Credit inclines on their
ſide, eſpecially when the Queſtion is, Whether a Man ſhall be executed for
<hi>Treaſon</hi> who never fled for it, who was never charg'd with any <hi>Treaſon</hi> or
<hi>Treaſonable Practiſes</hi> before; nay, not ſo much as with any particular <hi>Crime.</hi>
or <hi>Immorality:</hi> And, whether Three Witneſſes ſhall be believ'd, againſt whom
there is no Objection, rather than Two, againſt One of which there are ſuch
Objections.</p>
               <p>My Lord, we are not now debating or attacking the Evidence of the <hi>Plot,</hi>
or arraigning the former Judgments againſt the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd;
but, Gentlemen, we are putting you now upon a ſerious Enquiry,
(as GOD and your own Conſciences ſhall incline you) whether our Clyent
be Guilty or Not Guilty upon this Evidence; that is, whether Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>
ſwears true, or not. We hope that we have given you ſufficient Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that upon Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s part the Evidence is inſufficient; and we
hope you will accordingly find our Clyent Not Guilty.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I thank God, I have liv'd a Life, I hope, as good as any
Man, and have often receiv'd the Bleſſed Sacrament; I have done it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
and ſhall do it ſpeedily, by the Grace of God, as ſoon as I can have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38574:31"/>
a Miniſter come to adminiſter it to me. I did offer it to my own Father,
when he came to me, and told me, <hi>If would confeſs this thing I ſhould not
come to Tryal:</hi> I told my Father, I would not for Ten thouſand Worlds take
away the Blood of an Innocent man to ſave mine. I thank God, I am in a
very good way to dye; I have, for at leaſt this laſt Year, frequently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Bleſſed Sacrament; and how I have liv'd, every body in the Court
that knows me can tell my Life and Converſation has been as regular as any
man's, and I am as ready to dye to morrow, if occaſion was for it (I thank
God) as any one; I will receive the Bleſſed Sacrament upon it; and it is
not for Life that I would do any thing that is wrong or unjuſt: I do love
my Nation, and I love the Quiet of the Nation; I never was for diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government that now is; and I ever was againſt Foreign Forces or
an Invaſion, for I never thought of one, or heard of it, but with Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Deteſtation: And I do aſſure faithfully, I ſhou'd be ſorry to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage
Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence, becauſe I would have every body that was
concern'd in that Horrid and Barbarous Crime to ſuffer; in God's Name,
let them all ſuffer. I thank God, I never knew any thing of it, nor of a
<hi>French Invaſion:</hi> And I would ſay more of it, but that I would not hurt
Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence, whoſe Diſcovery of that Bloody Buſineſs has done ſo
much Service. As for Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> as I hope to receive the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and may I periſh when I do it, if I ſpeak an Untruth; I would not
for any thing, no, not for the Good of my Country, have Innocent Blood
ſpilt; I would lay down my Life to ſerve my Country, but I would not
have my Blood be lightly loſt; and how little a Man ſoever I am, my
Blood will lye as heavy upon the Nation as any the weightieſt man's can
do. I do not doubt your Lordſhip's Juſtice, nor the Jury's, but I pray, my
Lord, obſerve; tho' it is uſual not to own things at the Bar, yet I do not
make this Denial as of Courſe, but out of Truth; and I aſſure you, in the
preſence of the whole Court, if I ſhould ſuffer for this, I muſt at my laſt
moments either confeſs or deny ſomething: And, I ſay, I do aſſure, in the
preſence of the whole Court, and I will take the Bleſſed Sacrament upon
it, that I muſt, at my Death, deny this whole matter, and that ever I did
ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> at all there; I do not think I ſaw him; I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I ſaw Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> at all, except once in <hi>Germain-street,</hi> when the Coach
broke, and that muſt be but in paſſing by neither, and he would have hurt
or kill'd the Coachman, and we kept him from it; and I walk'd with him
half the length of <hi>Germain-ſtreet,</hi> before I knew who Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was. If
ever a one of thoſe Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are Men of Credit and Honour, can ſay
I was any ways ſo inclined, or that they ever ſaw me, or knew me, that I
ever bought a Piſtol or a Blunderbuſs, or the like, may God ſink and ſtrike
me dead; and the Bleſſed Sacrament, which I intend to receive, be my Curſe
and Damnation, if I knew of King <hi>James</hi>'s Coming, till after the whole
Town rung of it: I had no hand in the Invaſion; and, beſides my Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of Introducing Foreign Force, I deſire your Lordſhip and the Jury
to conſider the Circumſtances of my Caſe, that I had but a very ſmall
Allowance from my Father, and therefore it is not probable I ſhould take
upon me to joyn with my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi>
and thoſe other Gentlemen, to ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to invite over a
Foreign Force: And I call God to witneſs I had no hand in it. I beg your
Lordſhips Pardon for all this Trouble; I would not hurt Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for the Reaſons that I have told you; but this is for my Life, and
I don't ſo much value that as I do Truth and Sincerity; and I ſhall receive
the Bleſſed Sacrament, if I dye, that I never did do ſo. Indeed, I never
did take the Oaths, nor did I ever refuſe them, becauſe they were never
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38574:32"/>
offer'd me; but I wou'd take the Oaths now if they were offer'd me. My
Lord, I beg your Pardon for this Trouble.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the
Jury, I am of Councel in this Caſe for the King, and I could have been
very glad that this Gentleman's Defence that he has made had been ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than in truth it has been: And I ſhould have been very glad too that
his Councel had been able to have made it better for him; but that he and
they may be ſatisfied as much is done as the Caſe will bear; they have had
all the Liberty in the World to make his Defence they could deſire, nay,
more than in ſtrictneſs could be allow'd them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, our Evidence is very poſitive againſt the Priſoner at the Bar,
and for the <hi>Higheſt Crime</hi> that the King's Subjects can be guilty of, by the
Confeſſion of the Gentleman himſelf, and of his Councel. We have, I ſay,
two poſitive Witneſſes againſt him; they ſay, They are not Legal ones: I
muſt own, if we have not two Witneſſes, we have never an one; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
falſifies Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Teſtimony, falſifies whatſoever Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> has
Sworn. Now, the Evidence that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> has given againſt him, is this:
He ſays, There was to be a Meeting at the <hi>Kings-head Tavern</hi> in <hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi>
and there they conſulted of the Methods to bring back K. <hi>James</hi>
hither; and it was thought the beſt way to ſend to King <hi>James</hi> to invite
the <hi>French</hi> King to ſend 1000 Horſe, 1000 Dragoous, and 8000 Foot, to
land here in this Kingdom, where they would meet him with 2000 Horſe.
They pitch'd upon a very proper Meſſenger, Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> a Perſon that
has been attainted, and has ſuffer'd for <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> he was to be ſent
into <hi>France</hi> upon this Errand; Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, was one
of the Perſons that were there at that time, and he was conſenting to this
Meſſage; and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> gives you a particular Token relating to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
for he remembers the Priſoner did kneel upon the Chair, and lean'd his
Elbows upon the Table when he conſented.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> goes further, and tells you, That Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> would have
another Meeting, to know and ſee whether all the Company were of the
ſame mind they had been; and That afterwards they met at Mrs. <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi>'s
Houſe, and there the Priſoner at the Bar was preſent, and conſenting
to the ſame thing: Thereupon Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> went into <hi>France,</hi> and came
back again, and ſaid, The <hi>French King</hi> could not ſpare ſo much Force.
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> gives the ſame Evidence that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> had given: It's true,
he was not at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Tavern, but he tells you withal, He ſpoke with
Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> when he came back from <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Chernock</hi> return'd him
the ſame Anſwer that he did to Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> That the <hi>French King</hi> could
not ſpare ſo many Forces. This is the Evidence in ſhort, Gentlemen, that
is given againſt the Priſoner; and if this Evidence be true, then is he guilty
of the Crime for which he is indicted.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Witneſſes they have produced, firſt, a Record of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> and that was for hiring one <hi>Amadea</hi> to poyſon the
Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> They have produc'd
the Record, whereby it appears, he was Convicted and Fined <hi>1000 l.</hi> and
was to find Security for the good behaviour during Life; and he was no
lye in Priſon till the Fine paid, and Security given: But it happens, in that
very Record it appears there was Satisfaction acknowledg'd upon that even
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38574:32"/>
the very next Term; and that gives a great deal of Suſpicion to believe, that
the Evidence that was given was not much credited; for, tho' the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
for the Priſoner has ſaid, that it was the Payment of the <hi>1000 l.</hi> that
was the Satisfaction; no, it is not ſo, it is a Satisfaction of the whole
Judgment, for finding Security as well as the Fine. They ſay he was not
able to pay the Fine; and there is nothing appears of the other parts of the
Judgment being complied with, but the whole Judgment is ſet aſide.</p>
               <p>But all this does not make a Man <hi>no Legal</hi> Witneſs; if they thought this
Conviction tended to ſet aſide his Evidence, they would have produc'd it
at another part of the Tryal, than where they did: That is, when Mr.
<hi>Goodman</hi> was firſt call'd to be Sworn as a Witneſs, then they ſhould have
produc'd this Record, and ſaid he had been no Witneſs: But they knew well
enough that that was no Exception againſt the Legality of his Evidence,
but tends only to his Credit, and nothing elſe. Now, tho' it be a black
Crime to endeavour to poyſon another, yet that does not totally deſtroy
any Man's Credit; if it did, then the other Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> has
confeſs'd himſelf Guilty of a greater Crime than that for which Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
is Convicted by this Record; for, he owns himſelf one that was in
that Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King. And Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> owns himſelf too
Guilty of a greater Crime that what's objected to him, which is that of
<hi>High Treaſon;</hi> and, I hope, if he may be believ'd, when he owns himſelf
guilty of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> which is a greater Crime than poyſoning a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Subject; or guilty of ſuch a Deſign as the Aſſaſſination of the King,
which Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> has charg'd himſelf with, and notwithſtanding which
they have not offer'd that as an Exception againſt Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Evidence,
(for they very well know, his Evidence has been Receiv'd and Credited:)
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> may be Credited, tho' Guilty of the Crime objected to him:
And the conſtant Practiſe in all Tryals of this kind hath been, that it does
not take away the Witneſſes Evidence, however it affects his Credit, which
in this Caſe is ſupported by the Concurrent Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Porter.</hi> And
ſo then, I ſay, we have two Legal Witneſſes, (notwithſtanding all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions)
to prove Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> guilty of the Crime for which he is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
               <p>Then they go on further, and produce other Witneſſes: Firſt, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
one <hi>Edwards,</hi> a Perſon that is Committed for <hi>High Treaſon</hi> himſelf,
and under Suſpicion of his being to be one of thoſe that was to have a
hand in the Aſſaſſination; but his Evidence goes no further, than that
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> told him he was to be a Witneſs againſt Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he the Witneſs, or Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> muſt ſuffer; and, That it was a fooliſh
thing to be Hang'd. My Lord, there is nothing at all in this matter that
takes away Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Evidence: It is very plain Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his Life, and muſt do ſomething to ſave it, and I think he could not
do a better Service to entitle himſelf to the King's Mercy, than to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thoſe that were equally guilty with himſelf. 'Twas his Duty to have
done it, if he had not been in Danger; and if he hath done no more than
what was his Duty, I hope that is no Objection againſt his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>They have produced likewiſe a Drawer of the <hi>Kings-head Tavern,</hi> one
<hi>Crawford,</hi> and he ſays, he attended in this Room while this Company was
there. But then he goes a little further than the Councel or the Priſoner
would have had him; for they called him to prove, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was
not there when my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
were there. But when the Drawer comes, he knows nothing of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
being there at all: He ſays, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> was there, but not Mr. <hi>Goodman;</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38574:33"/>
and yet he does acknowledge, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> might be there, and he not
ſee him come up. He acknowledges he attended upon other Company as
well as this; ſo that it is plain in the nature of the thing, and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that <hi>Goodman</hi> might be there. This cannot take off the poſitive
Evidence of Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> who both ſwear, That <hi>Goodman</hi>
was there.</p>
               <p>But then they produce another Drawer, and that is one <hi>Huntley;</hi> and
he gives the ſame Account, only indeed he ſays, He was there all the while
they were at Dinner: But that is nothing, becauſe it is acknowledg'd both
by Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> That he was not there at Dinner-time, but he
might be there after Dinner, and yet <hi>Huntly</hi> could not ſee him at Dinner:
He tells you likewiſe, he paſs'd up and down in the Room afterwards, and
did not ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there; but yet he might be there, and he not ſee
him.</p>
               <p>Then they produce the Maſter of the Houſe, and he gives much the ſame Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in effect which his Servants do, That he did not ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there all
the while; but he ſays ſomething that is a little incredible; He can be poſitive
that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not there while my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was there, but he
cannot be poſitive that he was not there afterwards. He tells you, he met
my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> upon the middle of the Stairs
coming down, and he is ſure Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not in the Room at that
time. Now, is that poſſible that he could be ſure of that, when he owns,
(and cannot but own) That Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> might go into the Room and he not
ſee him? So that he has made a ſtrain in his Evidence that it is very little to be
Credited, which was not deſigned ſo much for the advantage of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> as
for the advantage of ſomebody elſe: And, in itſelf, it is almoſt an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing that it ſhould be true, by what he offers as the Reaſon of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>But then, Gentlemen, you are to conſider, that all theſe three Witneſſes,
if they ſwear true, do falſifie not only Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> who ſwears, That he
was there; but they likewiſe falſifie the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and for that
Reaſon I ask'd Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> the Queſtion, Whether he did not give the ſame
Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Friend?</hi> And if what he ſwears now be not true,
neither was it true when Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was Try'd, for he was the only
Witneſs at that time againſt Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> for this meeting; and therefore
theſe mens Teſtimony tends to overthrow Both Witneſſes as well as One:
And I muſt tell you, that if Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> be not a Legal Witneſs, becauſe he
has ſworn a thing that is not true, then Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> is not a good Witneſs,
who has ſworn the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was there; and then
you ought to acquit the Priſoner, becauſe there is no Witneſs againſt him
at Law; for, there is the ſame Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> that there is
againſt Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> as to this matter.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, as for the Character of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> they ſay he is a good
<hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> I hope he is ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is plain, that <hi>Religion</hi> does not
vary the Caſe: 'Tis within the reach of every man's memory that is here,
that the ſame things have fallen upon other Gentlemen that have had the
ſame Character, particularly Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> who
both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid the ſame things, in the ſame place, That they were <hi>True Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But that is no manner of Evidence that will
be of weight againſt Poſitive Oaths.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, it is fit likewiſe you ſhould reflect upon another thing:
What is it that ſhould engage Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> or invite ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe two Gentlemen to give a Falſe Evidence againſt the Priſoner
at the Bar? It does not appear that there was any Injury done by him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38574:33"/>
to them, to provoke them, to it; ſo that it could be for nothing but for
the ſake of Truth.</p>
               <p>It has been further ſaid on the behalf of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> That he Abhorred
the <hi>French,</hi> and any <hi>Invaſion</hi> upon his Country, and the like: It is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that is eaſily ſaid; and it has been ſaid by others that have been in the
ſame Place where he now ſtands; That they hated all Plots, and they
might puniſh them if ever they caught them. But theſe are only Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and nothing elſe. If there can be any Conſtructions made of the
Evidence given by theſe two Witneſſes, that does not directly prove the
Indictment, then the Priſoner ought to be Acquitted: But if there can be
no other Conſtruction made, but only, That there was a plain Deſign to
ſend <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> to perſwade him to prevail with
the <hi>French King,</hi> to come and Invade us with a Foreign Force: And if
our Witneſſes are Legal Witneſſes, (as, I doubt not, my Lords the Judges
will tell you they are; if there be no Exception to the Credit of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
but only that he was in ſuch a Deſign of Poyſoning the two Dukes,
which is really no Objection of Diſcredit to his Teſtimony;) then, with
Submiſſion, I think there is no room left for you, Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to doubt, but that the Priſoner is as Guilty of this Crime laid to
his charge, as any others that have been Try'd and Condemn'd for the ſame.
And ſo, Gentlemen, I leave it to you.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
ſtands indicted here for <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> there are laid in the Indictment
two ſorts of Treaſon; the one is, Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of
the King; the other is, adhering to the King's Enemies. The Evidence to
prove theſe Treaſons ſeems to be joynt; for, as to that of Compaſſing and
Imagining the King's Death, as well as to the other, the Overt Acts are
meeting and conſulting about the Treaſon, and then agreeing and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to invite and procure an Invaſion from <hi>France,</hi> and to meet that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
with an Inſurrection here. And the Evidence is apply'd <hi>entirely</hi> to
prove theſe <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, that theſe are proper <hi>Overt Acts</hi> of Compaſſing the King's
Death, I need not inform you, the Law is very well known; and the
Priſoner's own Councel do acknowledge, that theſe are ſufficient <hi>Overt
Acts</hi> of Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death: So that all which
they Defend him by is, the Improbability of the Teſtimony given againſt
him.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, you are to conſider and weigh well the Evidence that
has been given. By Law, it is true, as they obſerve, there muſt be <hi>Two</hi>
Witneſſes. Here is no defect of Number; that's acknowledg'd too, here
are two Witneſſes; but the Queſtion is, whether here be two Witneſſes that
deſerve <hi>Credit,</hi> and upon whoſe Teſtimony you can find that the Priſoner
is Guilty. The Witneſſes, Gentlemen, are Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman.</hi>

                  <hi>May</hi> laſt, (which is now juſt a Twelve-month) there was a meeting of
Eight Perſons, that is, my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> the
Priſoner at the Bar, and the Witneſs himſelf Mr. <hi>Porter;</hi> and this was at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38574:34"/>
the <hi>Kings-head Tavern</hi> in <hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> and there theſe Eight dined,
and this was in order to conſult about an Invaſion, together with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
intended to be made for the Reſtoring of the late King. After
Dinner comes in Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> he ſays, and then they purſued this Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and came to a Reſolution, to ſend Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and the
<hi>Meſſage</hi> was agreed upon which he ſhould carry; and he was to go to the
late King, and ſollicite him to obtain 10000 Soldiers from the <hi>French King,</hi>
whereof 8000 ſhould be Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons. Theſe
were to make up the 10000 men to invade this Kingdom. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
alſo, when this Force ſhould land, they ſhould meet and aſſiſt this
Invaſion with a joynt Force, that ſhould conſiſt of 2000 Horſe. And to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
and Aſſure him of this was the <hi>Meſſage.</hi> But, he ſays, That Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>
was very cautious in it, and would not preſently go upon this Errand, but
he would have further Aſſurance that they were in earneſt, and would
make good what they did ſend him to propoſe, therefore he would have a
ſecond meeting; &amp; a ſecond meeting was had, &amp; that was at Mrs. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s
Tavern, and there they did renew the ſame Reſolution, and there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
my Lord of <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Friend,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, and himſelf; he does not
know or remember whether my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was there.
He ſays, Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> did accordingly go into <hi>France,</hi> and he did return and
bring back King <hi>James</hi>'s Thanks to them, but their Deſire could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with; and he had his Share of the Complements.</p>
               <p>Now comes Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> &amp; he ſays, That about the ſame time, <hi>viz. Mid-May,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> acquainted him, there would be a meeting of ſome of K. <hi>James</hi>

                  </gap>s
Friends, at this Tavern in <hi>Leaden-hall ſtreet.</hi> He ſays, That he did tell Mr.
<hi>Porter,</hi> he doubted he ſhould not be there at Dinner, but he would come
as ſoon as he could after Dinner; and according to appointment, he did
come after Dinner, and there was this Conſultation and Reſolution that
Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſpeaks of, and ſays, That Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> afterwards told him, he
had been in <hi>France</hi> with the late King, and brought back the ſame Anſwer
that Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſpeaks of; and he had the Honour of Thanks from the late
King too.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I muſt obſerve one thing to you, which does go very much
towards the confirming what theſe Witneſſes ſay, and that is the Agreement
in their Teſtimonies, tho they were examin'd <hi>Apart</hi> at the Deſire of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner:
You will find they agree in theſe ſeveral Circumſtances, in the Time,
that it was this time twelve-months; in the Place, that it was at this Tavern;
in the Number of Perſons that were there, which was Eight before Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
came in; in the number of Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons that were to be
brought from <hi>France,</hi> and in thoſe Horſe that were to meet them here; and
beſides, in thoſe words of Diſcourſe upon the Conſultation and the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And there is one Circumſtance more in which they do agree, and which
is very particular; That when they came to deliver their Conſent to this
<hi>Meſſage</hi> that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> was to carry, the reſt ſate, and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
did kneel upon the Chair, and lean'd upon the Table. And this both
of them do agree in. And after all the many Queſtions ask'd in their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
examination, I do not find they diſagree in any Part of their Evidence.
So that, Gentlemen, there can remain no Queſtion now, but Whether
theſe two Witneſſes are men of Credit; or, whether there has been oppoſed
to them any ſuch Evidence as will make you believe, that (if not both)
at leaſt one of them has forſworn himſelf. They do produce nothing
againſt Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> whatſoever may have been produc'd at former Tryals
againſt his Credit: Perhaps what has been before, has ſatisfied the Objectors,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38574:34"/>
there is nothing appears againſt his Credit; but he is not only a <hi>Competent</hi> but
a very clear, good, credible, and undoubted Witneſs.</p>
               <p>But againſt Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> they offer ſeveral things which they ſay amount
to a violent Preſumption, that he is not to be look'd upon as a credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
And firſt, they produce a Record of a Conviction upon an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt him, for attempting to poiſon two Noble Dukes: This
he was convicted of, and fin'd <hi>1000 l.</hi> and ordered to find Sureties for
his good Behaviour during his Life. But, to this it is anſwered, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the ſame Record, that Satisfaction was acknowledged of the <hi>1000 l.</hi>
and all the reſt of the Judgment the very next Term, and he was forthwith
diſcharged, and that without paying the Mony, which ('twas obſerv'd) the
Priſoner's Counſel ſaid Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not able to pay at that time, no more
than he could 20000 l. and thereupon the King's Counſel ſay, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was convinc'd that he was wrong'd by a cauſeleſs Proſecution, and
the Evidence againſt him was found not to be credible. And beſides, Mr.
<hi>Goodman</hi> ſtands pardoned by ſeveral Acts of Pardons, as well as other Subjects.</p>
               <p>Then they produce one <hi>Edwards,</hi> who is a Priſoner here, and committed
for Suſpicion of High Treaſon, and for Treaſonable Practices: He is, no
doubt of it, a Witneſs for all that: For that is but an Accuſation upon him,
and does not take away his Credit. He tells you of a Diſcourſe that he had
with Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> and that <hi>Goodman</hi> ask'd him when the Priſoner was to be
try'd; and he told him he wou'd be try'd ſuch a Day; and when it was ask'd
what it was for, it was anſwer'd, not for the Aſſaſſination, but for ſending
Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> into <hi>France?</hi> He ask'd then who were the Witneſſes againſt him?
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and himſelf. And further ſaid, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> had ſworn againſt him (though he would give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of no body elſe) and had no Pardon, and either he muſt hang, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And then he talk'd lightly of the Buſineſs of hanging, and ſaid it was a
fooliſh thing to be hang'd, for all that People wou'd ſay, was, that ſuch an one
hang'd <hi>handſomly,</hi> or dyed <hi>bravely.</hi> This indeed is a ſort of Diſcourſe as if Mr.
<hi>Goodman</hi> did apprehend himſelf in Danger from Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Evidence; and yet
I cannot ſee that it does at all falſifie the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Goodman:</hi> He may
be a true Witneſs, and yet he might ſay he was to give Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
and it was in Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s Power to give Evidence againſt him, and that truly;
and if both were in the Guilt, they were in Danger of one another. But for a
further Anſwer, the King's Counſel have produced Mr. <hi>De-la-rue,</hi> who ſays, that
he knew Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and that he was a Scotch Man, and reputed Chaplain
to the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> that he went formerly by the Name of <hi>Dowglas,</hi>
and by that Name he was ſet down and deſcribed in the Liſt that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>
ſent to Captain <hi>Porter;</hi> and to that Name he anſwer'd in the <hi>Preſs-yard</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Now it is certain, that Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s putting of his Name in that Liſt, is
no Evidence of his being guilty in Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi>'s Treaſon. But his going by
two Names doth juſtly lay him under ſome Suſpicion. But the Evidence
that the Priſoner ſeems to rely upon moſt, is what Evidence has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
againſt Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> in that Point of Fact, by the Maſter and the two
Drawers; the firſt of the Drawer's Name was <hi>Crawford,</hi> and he does tell you,
that about 12 Months ago there was this Company at Dinner there: My Lord
of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> and the Priſoner, though he
did not then know his Name, or the Name of one or two more of them. I
obſerve by the way, that his Teſtimony ſo far does verifie theirs, that there
were eight of them there, but he ſays he did not ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there, nor
any but thoſe that dined there. And my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> went away, as
he thinks, about four a Clock. He cannot ſay that the Priſoner was there,
or was gone at that time before Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> came in; for he did not ſee Mr.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38574:35"/>
                  <hi>Goodman</hi> there at all, he was not in the Room all the time, but he was to and
fro attending till my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> went away
in a Coach that was called, and when they were gone, the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſtaid there a good while; being urged to tell how long, at laſt he ſaid it
was dark, and that agrees with Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> who ſays, it was about nine a-Clock
when they went away. He ſays he was there once or twice after my Lord of
<hi>Aylesbury</hi> went away, but he never ſaw Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> that he remembers at all,
till laſt <hi>Saturday,</hi> in all his Life. As to this the King's Counſel ſay, that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>negative</hi> Evidence, and in which a Man cannot be abſolutely <hi>poſitive,</hi> but
can only ſpeak according to his Obſervation and Memory, which might not
be perfect, and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> might be there in the mean time of his going in
and out: That is poſſible; and ſo it muſt be left to you to conſider of it.</p>
               <p>Then there is <hi>Huntly</hi> the other Drawer, and he ſays my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi>
went away about that time, and that he did not ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there at all,
nor ever in his Life till now; neither does he remember that any body came
to them after Dinner, and if any freſh Man had then come in, he thinks he
ſhould (going often in to them) have known him; and ſays, that he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Company only: And he had ſeen Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns</hi>
there before.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Cock,</hi> the Maſter of the Houſe was produced, and he names all
the eight Perſons that did dine there, and ſo far he confirms the King's Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
He thinks that my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Montgomery</hi> went
away privately (as it ſeems they had come) in a Hackney Coach, and that it
was about 4 a-Clock; and he ſays, he did not ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there, and
he does not know that he ever ſaw him till now: But when he was croſs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the King's Counſel, he does acknowledge that he might poſſibly
come in after Dinner, and before my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> went away, and he
not ſee him, becauſe he was not there all the time; he ſays Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>
uſed to dine at his Houſe, and came to his Houſe once a Week; and he had
ſeen ſome of the reſt, but they did not frequent his Houſe as Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>
did: He ſays, the Company din'd about 2 a-Clock, and the laſt of them ſtaid
till about 8 or 9, and that the Door was ſhut as is uſual when Company is in a
Room, but no body was forbid to come there.</p>
               <p>But to eſtabliſh the Credit of the Evidence on the King's part, they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> again: Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſo far to be true, that my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> went away firſt; but ſays,
that himſelf was not wholly a Stranger to this Houſe, for he had dined there
four or five times with Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and particularly one time, he being
ſick, and asking for ſome Brandy, the Maſter of the Houſe ſaid he would help
him to ſome of the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> would have bought
ſome of him. But the Maſter ſeems not to own that, and ſays, he does not
remember any thing of it.</p>
               <p>But then comes Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> again, and he ſays poſitively, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi>
was there, and that he did ſpeak with the Company, and complemented my
Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> when he went away, and went part of the way towards the
Stairs with him; and he does well remember it by this Token, that when Mr.
<hi>Porter</hi> was told Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was below, he mentioned him in the Company
as a truſty Man, that was fit for the Converſation; and then Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> went and
fetch't him up, and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was there near two Hours, and they diſcours'd
all this matter in that time in the Preſence of the Priſoner and the reſt; and he
ſays it was about ſix a-Clock before my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi>
went away, and then there was Opportunity enough for this Diſcourſe,
and Conſult that they ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner has offered another ſort of Evidence: Firſt, the Confidence
of his own Innocence, that he was abroad three Weeks after this Conſpiracy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38574:35"/>
was diſcovered; and they have produced Mr. <hi>Treganna,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peachy,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Nichols,</hi> who prove that he never abſconded, but was abroad and appeared
openly (for three Weeks after) till ſuch time as he was taken. This the
King's Counſel ſay is no proof that he is not Guilty, and their Evidence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.
They ſay he might have a Confidence, and the rather becauſe he is
not charged with the Aſſaſſination; for, at that time theſe Witneſſes ſpeak of
nothing was diſcovered and publick but the Aſſaſſination; for it was before
Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>'s Trial; and then was the great Diſcovery of the Secret of
the Invaſion.</p>
               <p>Then he ſhews further as to his Converſation, that he is a Man of a very
ſober Life, never was known to Swear, that he Drinks but little, and is a
<hi>Godly</hi> Man, and often ſays his Prayers. As to that, the King's Counſel on
the other ſide tell you, that has been pretended to by other People too;
and the Queſtion is not about <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>this Fact</hi> that you are now to try.
Whether he be ſo Religious or no as he pretends, or whether he be Sincere
in his Devotion, that is not ſo much the matter now, but the Queſtion is,
whether he has offended in this Kind as he ſtands Accuſed. They produce a
Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and he ſays that he is a very Conſciencious
Man, and particularly is a great Lover of his Country; and he has often
heard him declare a Deteſtation of an Invaſion by a French Force, and wiſh
Succeſs to the Fleet; but <hi>that</hi> which he remembers chiefly, was about the
<hi>time</hi> of the Diſcovery of this Plot. The King's Counſel anſwer to this, that
a man may uſe ſuch kind of Expreſſions, perhaps to Cover his Guilt; and in
the Reply to Sir <hi>Barth. Showers</hi> Obſervations it was taken notice of by Mr.
<hi>Solicitor,</hi> (what we all cannot but remember) that the like Evidence was
given as to Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> that he did deteſt an Invaſion, and was preſent
at the Common Prayer when King <hi>William</hi> was pray'd for, and declared
againſt Plots; and that if they catched him in the Corn they might put him
in the Pound. Theſe things a man might ſay, and it is the lighteſt Evidence
that can be given, being Diſcourſes out of Mens own mouths, who will never
proclaim their own Guilt; and therefore it is the weakeſt Defence that can
be offered. But Gentlemen, you are to conſider the other Evidence that
has been produc'd by the Priſoner, given by ſeveral Witneſſes, and who are
upon their Oaths now as well as the King's Witneſſes. And his Counſel ſay
their Witneſſes, but particularly the three upon whom they chiefly rely, have
no Objection made out againſt them; and no man's Teſtimony ought to be
<hi>Preſumed</hi> to be falſe. And it muſt be taken notice of, that they can ſpeak only
according to their Belief, grounded on their Obſervation and Memory, that
they did not ſo far as they obſerved or remember, ſee Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> there, as
'twas moſt probable they ſhould if he had been. But 'tis poſſible they might
overlook or forget; the rather for that they were not of the Company, but
in and out, up and down; and Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was not there at Dinner when
their Attendance was fixt and conſtant.</p>
               <p>It ought to be conſidered alſo, that here are ſeveral Circumſtances, ſome of
which ſeem very pregnant. It is agreed on all hands, that the Priſoner Dined there
with thoſe other ſeven perſons, concerning Four of whom we muſt conclude
nothing; but concerning three of them we in this Court may take notice, they
are Attainted of High Treaſon, and ſo it is evident that the Priſoner was for
a long time a Companion of three Traytors, and had a Converſation with
them. I do not find that he had any Occaſion to be there; nor any of the
reſt of the Company. Concerning my Lord of <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> indeed it is ſaid he
propoſed to treat about a Hogſhead of White Wine. But that ſeems to be
caſual, and not the end of his coming and Dining with this Company there.
But, be that how it will, that relates to his Lordſhip alone. But, for the others,
I do not find they do pretend any Occaſion of meeting there; and therefore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38574:36"/>
it leaves it the more ſuſpicious: And 'tis the more ſo, becauſe it was managed
ſo privately and cautelouſly. They were not attended according to their
Qualities. The Lords went away together in a Hackney-Coach that was
called, as they had come thither in another. The reſt thought fit to ſtay there
till it was dark; and as ſoon as it was ſo, went away. There was ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Cauſe for all this. It did import the Priſoner to ſhew, that it was
for ſome good Cauſe and Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And further, it is obſervable that this Houſe was a place which, as the
Maſter ſays, none of this Company did uſe to reſort to, except Sir <hi>John Friend;</hi>
which makes it probable (this being a Houſe that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> frequented
and none of the others) that <hi>He</hi> beſpoke this place, and brought the reſt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And if it were ſo, that makes it more probable that there was ſuch a
Treaſon there to be hatch'd, as is evidenced by the King's Witneſſes; for you
may remember, and it appears by the Record in this Court, that Sir <hi>John
Friend</hi> was indicted and attainted (not for the Aſſaſſination, but) for the
Treaſon for which the Priſoner is now a trying, an Invaſion that was to be
ſupported with an Inſurrection. Now if Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was chiefly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Houſe, and brought this Company together, it is very probable
it was about this buſineſs which Sir <hi>J. Friend</hi> was ſo concerned in. And that
he is Attainted for it, appears upon the Record before us; which ſhould be
read, but that the Priſoners Counſel admit it, and are ſo far ſatisfied in it,
that they won't Arraign the Verdict; nay, they did acknowledge that there
was a Plot; and there was no doubt of it, there was <hi>ſuch</hi> a Plot.</p>
               <p>Now then Gentlemen, here it is certainly proved by theſe two Witneſſes,
(and not gainſaid by the Priſoners own Witneſſes,) that there was ſuch a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that the Priſoner was there; and they both have poſitively Sworn that
this Treaſon was committed there. You have heard what has been objected
to their Credit; they have delivered their Teſtimony upon their Oaths; and
ſo, Gentlemen, are you upon your Oaths: If you are ſatisfied, and can take it
upon your Conſciences that theſe two Witneſſes are, or any one of them is,
forſworn (if ſuch diſtinction can poſſibly be made in this caſe) then you are
to acquit the Priſoner; but if you are ſatisfied, and think they have ſworn
true, you are to find him Guilty.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J. Treby.</speaker>
               <p>It muſt be ſo, ſince they ſpeak of the ſame joint matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
their being together in Company. If Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> ſays true when he ſwears that
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was there with him and the reſt, Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> muſt ſay true
when he ſwears that he was there with Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and the reſt. There was
one thing that I forgot: Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> obſerved, that it might be an Invention
of Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> becauſe he fixeth it in point of time to the Month of <hi>May,</hi>
that he does not ſay it was in <hi>April;</hi> for that then it would be within the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
which extends to <hi>April</hi> 29. laſt year; nor would he lay it in <hi>June,</hi> for then
he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and others of them were diſperſt by reaſon of a Riot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in <hi>Drury-lane;</hi> and ſo there was no Month left but <hi>May:</hi> And this
Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> alledges, was a piece of Skill and Contrivance. But, really,
this is a piece of Ingenuity in himſelf. For, beſides that the King's Witneſſes
affirm poſitively that it was in <hi>May,</hi> and remember it by a certain token,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it was within a very few days after the King went <hi>beyond Sea,</hi> one
or two of the <hi>Priſoner</hi>'s Witneſſes <hi>(Crawford</hi> I am ſure) did ſay that this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was this time twelve-month, and you know we are now near mid-<hi>May.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>No, not ſo: My Lord ſpeaks only where they concur with
our Evidence. It were ſtrange to expect we ſhould disbelieve or doubt what
the Witneſſes on both ſides affirm to be true: But, I do not think it would be
to the Advantage of the Priſoner, if what his Counſel propoſeth were agreed
to, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Drawers (and their Maſter too) ſhould be believed for <hi>All</hi>
they ſay, provided equally that the King's Witneſſes ſhould, in like manner,
be believ'd for what they ſay. For, the main thing controverted is, whether
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> were at this Meeting. Theſe Witneſſes for the Priſoner ſay,
they did not ſee him there; at leaſt they do not remember it. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> himſelf ſay, he was there. Now, theſe things agreed, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
would make a very conſiſtent clear Evidence, that Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> was
there, though the Maſter and Drawers did not obſerve, or do not remember
his being there.</p>

            <p>Then an Officer was ſworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew to conſider of their

               <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
               <p>I do not underſtand the Law, my Lord, but I have heard the Court

               <p>I declare it, for my part, I know nothing that you can have

have availed you in Arreſt of Judgment, no doubt, they would have laid

            <sp>
               <p>Mr. Cook, I think it uſeful to the publick, and alſo at this time to you, to
obſerve, that the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> was throughout, one intire
Deſign and Project form'd in Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> King, totally to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, which grew ſo apparent to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of theſe Nations, in ſo many Inſtances of fatal Conſequence, manag'd in
ſuch a Method, and advanc'd ſo far, that the People of theſe Kingdoms, of
all Qualities, Ranks, and Degrees, did find it abſolutely neceſſary for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of themſelves and the neighbour Nations now in Alliance with us, to
pray in Aid of the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as a Perſon, not only nearly allied to
this Crown; but alſo intirely in the Intereſt of theſe Kingdoms, and thoſe
neighbouring Princes, and Countries that lay expoſed to the Violence and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Inſults of <hi>France.</hi> And the Love which that noble Prince did bear,
not only to us, but to our Neighbours alſo, diſpoſed him to embrace that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
upon whoſe Arrival here, that <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> from Motives that were
inviſible, declin'd the Kingdom and the Government; and left the People to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38574:37"/>
themſelves; whereupon his preſent Majeſty was neceſſarily and <hi>rightfully</hi>
placed upon that Throne he ſo well deſerv'd: And this is now that King, for
whoſe Preſervation all good People have <hi>aſſociated,</hi> and ſpare neither Lives
nor Treaſure to ſupport and to continue in the Government; and this is that
King whom you have Traiterouſly conſpired, not only to dethrone, but alſo
to deſtroy; and this is that People that you would have to ſwim in Blood,
and loſe their Religion, Liberty, and Property. Theſe Matters need a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to relate at large, I only touch them ſhortly, to move good Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in their Deliverance, and to move you ſeriouſly to reflect upon the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs
of your Crime.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> you are an Engliſh Man, and muſt needs know, that in this Place
we frequently condemn to Death Clippers, Coiners, Thieves and Robbers,
and other ſuch like Criminals, and that juſtly and neceſſarily too, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Innocent, and for the common Good. Of what Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt you, and ſuch as you, be worthy then, who have ſo horridly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
and deſign'd the fatal Ruin and Deſtruction of your own native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to render your fellow Subjects a miſerable Prey, and at the beſt to
become Slaves and Vaſſals to a foreign Prince?</p>
               <p>Let me alſo mind you, That nothing is more ſure, than that after this, you
muſt receive a Judgment in another World; and if that paſs againſt you too,
that Sentence will be moſt terrible, and your Sufferings without End: And
therefore I do adviſe you to imploy the few Days you have yet to live, in
Preparation for your future Happineſs, which cannot be duly done without a
full Confeſſion of this, as well as other Crimes you have been guilty of; I
therefore charge it to you, as your Duty, and leave it with you at your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Peril, that you honeſtly and faithfully diſcover all you know of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
and traiterous Conſpiracy, and all the Perſons that you do know to be
guilty of it: This will be the greateſt Service you can do in this World, and will
be the beſt Preparatory Step that you can take towards a better. And,</p>
               <p>Sir, there now remains no more for me to ſay, but to pronounce that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on you which the Law directs. And that is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat you, <hi>Peter Cook,</hi> be taken hence to the Place from whence you came;
and thence be drawn upon a Hurdle to the Place of Execution, where you are
to be hang'd by the Neck, and cut down before you be dead; that your Bowels be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, and your Privy Members cut from your Body, and both burnt in your Sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That your Head be cut off, and your Body divided into four Quarters, which Head
and Quarters are to be at the King's Diſpoſal; and God Allmighty have Mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Soul.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
               <p>I beg, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, that I may have my Relations and
Friends come to ſee me, and ſome Divines, the better to prepare me for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> if you'll give the Names of thoſe that you would have
come to you, to the Officer, Care ſhall be taken in it; and you will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
any reaſonable Helps that may be had for your Preparation for Eternity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>It is not fit he ſhould be deny'd any reaſonable Help; but in
the mean time there is reaſon for the Government to be cautious, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what has notoriouſly paſt in the Caſe of ſome others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder,</speaker>
               <p>If he give in the Names, it will be conſidered of, and Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that nothing be done, but what is reaſonable, and ſafe.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Priſoner was taken from the Bar, and the Court proceeded to
what was remaining of the Buſineſs of the Seſſions.</p>
