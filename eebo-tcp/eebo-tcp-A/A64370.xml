            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE are the Words of <hi>King David;</hi> and the Saying is the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by reason of the Condition of the Speaker: For, the more Power, Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, Temptation there is to break God's Commandments, the greater is the Vertue of religiously observing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63303:3"/>
This Prince was a Debtor to the <hi>Law,</hi> as one who had enter'd into Covenant with the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> he renew'd this obligation as often as, by the hand of the <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented an Offering to him. When he came to the <hi>Throne,</hi> he understood (no doubt) from the Book of God, to which he was no Stranger, that it was his Duty to write out a <hi>Copy</hi> of <hi>God's</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Law,</hi> and to <hi>keep it by him,</hi> and to <hi>read in it,</hi> at convenient Seasons, <hi>all the days of his life,</hi> in order to his better observing the Contents of it. He was in many <hi>Troubles,</hi> and those Troubles <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. 1. &amp;c.</note> (both Publick and Private) were, also, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great; and he made many Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to that God who could alone support, comfort, and deliver him; and by these he strengthned his Obedience. Of such Holy <hi>Resolutions</hi> he hath given some account in the Words of the Text, Saying, <hi>I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, to keep tby righteous Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Pious Declaration, are contained <hi>Four things</hi> well worthy our notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63303:3"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Herein is taken for granted a <hi>possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of keeping the Law of God.</hi> [That is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measures of a sincere Man, and by the assistance of God's Grace; for without him we can do nothing.] <hi>David</hi> was a Man of better Understanding, then to take an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility upon him; and of greater Piety then to assume to himself a Power of doing that which was righteous, and, in its nature, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without the help of his God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have here supposed the <hi>eternal Equity</hi> of God's Commands, which are called <hi>Righteous Judgments;</hi> they being the Results, not of the <hi>Arbitrariness,</hi> but the <hi>Counsel of his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is further suggested the <hi>Rule</hi> by which Wise and Pious Men go in making Vows. They do not rashly oblige themselves to things either doubtful or unlawful, or if lawful, inexpedient: But they proceed upon sure Grounds, vowing and resolving to perform
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63303:4"/>
such things as God himself has enjoyned in his <hi>Righteous Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Royal <hi>Psalmist</hi> does here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly set forth a most serious and fixed <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of obeying these Possible, these just and reasonable Laws of that God whose Wisdom and Clemency are equal to his Power. <hi>I have sworn, and am stedfastly purposed, to keep thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have chosen the last of these <hi>four Points</hi> for my present Subject, designing to Discourse (by God's assistance) concerning Holy RESOLUTION, and the <hi>strengthening</hi> of our selves by it in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duty. And,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>First place,</hi> I shall inquire into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Resolution.</hi> Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew how useful, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a steadfast Holy Purpose is in the course of our Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63303:4"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall conclude with a Hearty Exhortation to this Practice; endeavouring so to move you to it, that you, being true to your Religious Obligations, may finally obtain the Fruit of the <hi>exceeding great and precious Promises</hi> of that God, and that <hi>Sun of Righteousness, with whom there is no variableness nor shadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For the Nature of <hi>Resolution,</hi> it may be describ'd as an Act or Habit of the Mind, as determined with strength, vigour and steddiness towards some Object, concerning which it was formerly doubtful, or towards which it was either indifferent or averse. It is the Application of the Will to Business, in the Opinion of some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists. It is the <hi>Bent</hi> of the Mind which setteth on work the other Powers. It is, as it were, the Seal of the inclination. St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to describe it as the <hi>fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Soul, in these Words, <hi>forasmuch</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 4.</note> 
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63303:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,</hi> A R M <hi>your selves, likewise, with the same mind;</hi> or, with the like force of Holy Resolution. <hi>Resolution</hi> considered in it self, is neither Good nor Evil; but it is either according to the matter and the degree of it. It is of a like Nature with Zeal, which, so long as it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in a good matter, and with due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is very commendable and useful; but, in a bad Cause, it is a most pernicious Instrument; and, like Fire in an undue place, the more it rageth, it is the more destructive.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Resolution</hi> which I am to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, hath Religion for its <hi>Object,</hi> and Discretion for its <hi>Temper.</hi> To be prem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory in a Trifle is great folly and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; To be resolute in any Brutal way is high Impiety; To be moved by the Reason of the Case is just Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; To be stedfast and unmoveable in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63303:5"/>
our Duty to God, and others and our selves, is Resolution truly and properly so called.</p>
            <p>To such a sort of Resolution there are several Distempers in the Mind, Will and Affections which oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is <hi>Slightness,</hi> Carelesness and Indifferency <hi>of Temper,</hi> which causeth so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to be had to Persons, or Things, even those of the greatest moment, that it neither setteth the Heart upon them or against them. Such was the disposition of <hi>Gallio</hi> the <hi>Deputy of Achaia.</hi> Though <note place="margin">Act. 18. 15.</note> He was a Man in Authority, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Riot of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were guilty in the Case of <hi>Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi> yet he CARED <hi>for none of these Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63303:6"/>
The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>Haesitancie</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness <hi>of Mind,</hi> a kind of <hi>halting betwixt God and Baal;</hi> a Spirit not wrought up to that pitch of Resolution, to which the <hi>Prophet Elijah</hi> would have the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 21.</note> to rise, in his Expostulation with the double minded Men of his Time; <hi>how long halt ye between Two Opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: But, if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Third Opposite,</hi> is <hi>Fickleness</hi> and Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; an humour which abounds where the <hi>Imagination</hi> governs, <hi>That</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleas'd not so much with Things which are really good, as with those which are new. Thus some of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> affected novelty in Worship more than the <hi>Heathen</hi> themselves. This mov'd the Prophet to upbraid them on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>hath a Nation changed their Gods,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63303:6"/>
               <hi>which are yet no Gods? but my People have chang'd their</hi> GLORY <hi>for that which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 2. 11.</note> 
               <hi>doth not profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth Distemper</hi> is <hi>Easiness</hi> of <hi>Disposition,</hi> and <hi>good Nature,</hi> commonly indeed, but very falsly so called. The Persons whom God hath formed out of this softer Clay, go on tolerably well when they are left to Themselves; but they are soon drawn aside by the Ordinary <hi>Persuasions</hi> of Others, and much more by their <hi>Importunities.</hi> Some Gentle Entreaties, and seemingly Kind, but Deceitful Words, bring them off from their Judgments and good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. One of these Easie Persons is the <hi>Simple One</hi> described in the <hi>Seventh Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> The Harlot, <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 7, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>with her much fair Speech, caused him to yield; with the flattering of her Lips she forced him.</hi> And He <hi>went after her</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63303:7"/>
               <hi>straightway, as an Oxe goeth to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth Distemper</hi> which hindreth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, is <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Faintness</hi> of <hi>Purpose,</hi> whence divers express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Phrases of <hi>desire</hi> rather then of <hi>Bent</hi> and <hi>fixedness</hi> of mind. They say, we <hi>wish,</hi> we <hi>would, we would be glad to have it so;</hi> But there are not Nerves strong enough in their Hearts to cause them to protest, (though in a good and necessary matter) that they are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,</hi> and <hi>peremptorily determined. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> is represented, in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> as a Man of such a Temper. <hi>He said unto Paul</hi> (who spake with a <note place="margin">Acts. 26. 28, 29.</note> force of Evidence not to be resisted by a teachable Mind) ALMOST Thou <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadest me to be a Christian.</hi> To whom that Apostle thus dextrously apply'd himself;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63303:7"/>
               <hi>I would to God that not only Thou. but also all that hear me this Day, were both</hi> ALMOST <hi>and</hi> ALTOGETHER <hi>such as I am, except these Bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Nigh to the Nature of the forementioned Evil, is that of <hi>Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Cowardice,</hi> in reference to the Difficulties which Men must go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, if they will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Men, in whom this Passion ruleth, start out of the streight way, as soon as they espy the Cross, though it be at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from them. They do indeed take up a <hi>Resolution,</hi> but it is, to go no further then They shall be attended by Ease and Safety; by Worldly Pleasure, Profit and Honour. <hi>When Persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth by reason of the Word</hi> or Gospel of Christ, <hi>by and by they are offended.</hi> They stumble at the Affliction, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63303:8"/>
a good Cause rather than suffer for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is a Temper, which (it is true) is a pretence to <hi>Resolution,</hi> but it is as different from it as those others which I have named; That is to say, <hi>Wilfulness, Stubbornness</hi> or <hi>Perverseness,</hi> which maintains the same Stiffness, be the matter what it will. This ariseth, <hi>partly</hi> from <hi>Soureness</hi> in the frame of the Body, <hi>partly</hi> from <hi>Ignorance</hi> which first blindeth Men, and then makes them confident in a false way; and <hi>partly</hi> from <hi>Pride</hi> which is very assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Dogmatical, and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Man either to see his Mistake, or, when it is seen by him, to own it. Of this Refractory, Stomackful and Restive Humour were divers <hi>Jews</hi> in the <note place="margin">Jer. 18. 12. c. 44. v. 17.</note> Days of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who were resolute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason, saying, <hi>We will certainly do</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63303:8"/>
               <hi>whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our mouth.</hi> And yet every thing which proceeded out of it was far from being Oracle.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have consider'd the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Resolution;</hi> and those Distempers in the Faculties, Passions, and Tempers of men, which are Enemies to it.</p>
            <p>It is time, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Place,</hi> To bring under our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, the Usefulness and the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of such <hi>Purposes</hi> as are both Wise and Holy, Firm and Stedfast, in the Course of our Lives, in order to the obtaining the <hi>End of our Hopes,</hi> the <hi>Salvation of our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then I lay down these <hi>Two Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> There is great Power and Strength in Resolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63303:9"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have need of all the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that it can possibly give us, towards the performing of <hi>our Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to <hi>That,</hi> there is great Force in the Resolution which is <hi>Natural,</hi> and much more in that which is <hi>Moral and Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> There is great Force in that kind of <hi>Resolution</hi> which is but <hi>Natural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appears from <hi>Experience,</hi> which shews us daily, That the Resolute discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all others; and are by nothing discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged themselves.</p>
            <p>This is also shew'd by the very <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Resolution</hi> before explain'd; for it is the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Mind in executing its Designs; it knitteth those Powers of it, in which, before, there was a luxation. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is great Difficulty often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in resolving, but when we are once resolved, our Trouble is well-nigh over.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63303:9"/>
The main Point is gained when we have gained the Will. The Wall of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 4. 6.</note> (saith the Book of <hi>Nehemiah)</hi> went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, because the People <hi>had a mind to the work.</hi> We are at first like Children who stand trembling upon the brink of a River; they desire to step in, but they fear to do so; and no sooner have they done it, but the Fear vanishes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment and Pleasure succeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Likewise,</hi> The Power of <hi>Natural Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is manifest, from that <hi>Reverence</hi> which every man has naturally for his own Mind; I mean every man who is not become brutish by evil custom, and in whom the very Ruins of Understanding are not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished. An uneasiness arises in the minds of those who deliberately break their own measures, and live in a war with their own Judgments and Purposes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth of the wretchedness of his estate, whilst his Affections and Appetites <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> 
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63303:10"/>
did in such sort overrule the Purposes of his Mind, that <hi>the good which he would do, that he did not, and the evil which he would not do, that he did.</hi> There is naturally more Greatness in the Mind, than to be willing solemnly to give it self the Lye; to make Promises to it self, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to break them. Stedfastness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is many times the effect of Holy Vows and Purposes, because it is Pain and Grief to the Mind to be a daily witness of its own Instability; to blush, as it were, before it self, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by its own Evidence, in its own Tribunal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The Strength of <hi>Natural Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> does in some sort appear from the tender sense men have of their <hi>Reputation.</hi> Their Good Name is dear to them, and a Point of Honour is that on which they naturally insist: Now all Weakness is dishonourable; and to vow and resolve,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63303:10"/>
and by and by to violate such Vows, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues either a Weakness in the Judgment in resolving without good ground, or a Weakness in the Will and Temper, in not prosecuting that which was, on good ground, stedfastly purposed. Where this Infirmity (if I may call it by so soft a name) is understood, it brings a man presently to shame and contempt.</p>
            <p>Now, if there be so much force in the <hi>Resolution which is natural,</hi> there may be much more in that which is <hi>moral and religious.</hi> Even where the Conscience is deprav'd in some degree, but not wholly wasted; such as have made holy Vows, and are willing to break them, would, notwithstanding, not seem to break them, either to themselves, or to the World; they would not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut the knot in sunder, but chuse to untie it, by putting a new sense upon the words, by using some subtile distinction, by having recourse to Equivocation, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reservation, or some other Evasion sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63303:11"/>
by the Sophistry of a deceitful Heart; not being able to endure the sting of a downright Reflection.</p>
            <p>Where the Conscience remains pure and undefiled, Holy Men are still, with more true strength, assisted in their Duty by their Religious Purposes.</p>
            <p>For <hi>first,</hi> Such have a mighty veneration for the Great God, and fear to trifle with so Sacred a Majesty, by taking up his Name in vain, by a frequent change of <hi>yea</hi> into <hi>nay,</hi> by vowing and resolving and then disanulling. Insomuch that the weaker sort of sincere Christians do dread to break a Vow, even because it is a Vow, though hastily made, and with inadvertence, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to be Martyrs to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion, than to depart from that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which they made, in the heat of their Zeal, in the name of him before whom they tremble, the Everlasting God, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Just, <hi>the same to day, yesterday, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63303:11"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Religion is the <hi>highest Principle</hi> by which men can act; there is therefore in holy Resolution the greatest strength. The Religious have for their scope the best and highest <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> the Glory of God, who is the Chief Good, the benefit of all Reasonable Creatures, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Everlasting Happiness of their Persons; and True Religion is a certain way to these blessed Ends. Now, if <hi>they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that will be rich</hi> in this World, decline no Labours, run all manner of Hazards, are not discourag'd by Rocks and Shelves, by Waves and Tempests, or Pirates in effect as dangerous as they; whilst they aim on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at things Temporal, which perish in the using; shall not those have greater Courage and firmer Resolution, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves the obtaining <hi>Treasures</hi> which fade not away, and may fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Promises of God in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and on the Grace of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit for the enabling them to do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63303:12"/>
well, if they are not wanting to the Power already given them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But I expect that it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That all this sort of Reasoning, if it be admitted to be specious, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding false. For (as they may continue to speak) the Purposes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are vain and uncertain. They va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish as the morning dew upon the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a new Temptation. Is it not daily observed, that divers who are in danger of death, and dread to go forth into a vast Eternity, after having lead immoral Lives, do weep and pray, and make many Protestations of becoming new men, if God shall be pleased to spare and restore them? And when God has restor'd them, the World has been convinc'd, that all their Tears, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Promises, were the effects of Fear; and they have return'd at once to their Health, and to their Vices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63303:12"/>
To this it may be answer'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That if Men will not be altogether <note place="margin">Answer.</note> Christians by the help of Holy Purposes, they will be much less such without them. If there is not force enough in them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to amend the Lives of Men, yet, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are some check and restraint to them. And he who says a Cord is strong, does not pretend to say, that it is impossible to be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those Men who are so false to their Vows, and so unstable in their Ways, are to be thought not to have built their <hi>Purposes</hi> upon a right <hi>Foundation.</hi> Perhaps the <hi>Foundation</hi> wanted <hi>Breadth.</hi> It may be, they resolved against many Sins, but not against that which did most <hi>easily beset them,</hi> and was most agreeable to Flesh and Blood. And this One evil Spirit left in possession, may have brought back all the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63303:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Perhaps the <hi>Foundation</hi> wanted <hi>Firmness.</hi> They might take up their Resolutions in the heat of their Affection, which is suddenly kindled, and suddenly dies away.</p>
            <p>But, for such as have hated every Evil way, and, upon the most mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, dedicated themselves, Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to Christ without any reserve, it is not likely that they should be so unsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and so much given to change for the worse. Among the Primitive Christians there were Armies of Martyrs who were faithful to the Death. <hi>Pliny</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Plin. lib. 10. Ep. 97. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieam certè &amp; inflexibilem obstinationem debere puniri non dubitari.</hi>
               </note> reproach'd them as <hi>Obstinate,</hi> but their Perseverance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from the Strength of their Faith, the Heartiness of their Love, their Sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to keep their Baptismal Vow, in despight of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; and (that which made all these effectual) the extraordinary Grace of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63303:13"/>
Now, if there be any Strength in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Resolution, and more in that which is Moral and Religious (and more still there must be when one is added to the other) certainly it is our Wisdom to bind our selves with this double Cord; for we have need of all the Assistance we can possibly get, and that is a <hi>Second Consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come into the World with sensual Inclinations. Our natural Passions are apt to move with intemperate Violence. Our Lusts and Appetites, till Reason and Grace subdue them, are strong and impetuous. Our Mind is, generally speaking, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown very early with the Prejudices and Indiscretions of Youth; we are first accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to Folly and Vanity, before we are acquainted with Christian Piety, and solid Vertue; and to many ill Customs we are united, as the Soul is to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63303:14"/>
Body, with a very intimate Union, though we know not how. Our Senses and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy treasure up many idle, extravagant, and deceitful Images. This World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, hath great Influence upon our Sense and Imagination, whilst <hi>Faith is the Evidence of Things not seen.</hi> All pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abound with evil Men, who live <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World,</hi> and who by hurtful Persuasions, and bad Examples, entice the Unwary into a wicked Confederacy with themselves; and there are Legions of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies,</hi> who envy God the Glory, and Man the Happiness of a <hi>sober, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and godly Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, in so many and so great Perils, amidst which the Frailty of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is apt to supplant our Faith, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to use all manner of good means (and therefore, amongst others that of holy Resolution) that, by God's Blessing upon such Instruments, we may be supported in all Dangers, and carried safe through all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63303:14"/>
Temptations. To the speedy Use, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of a <hi>holy Purpose,</hi> I proceed, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Place,</hi> to exhort you, beseeching you, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> did those of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that, <note place="margin">Acts 11. 25.</note> 
               <hi>with full purpose of heart you would cleave unto the Lord;</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ. It is true, as to the general <hi>End of Man,</hi> which is his Personal Happiness, there is no need of any vehement Persuasive to it; no great need of Deliberation and Resolution of Mind. Nature it self hath fix'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this Point, that it is as necessary to be happy, as it is to be at all <note n="a" place="margin">Andron. Rhod. 1. 6. c. 2. p. 151. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> But Mankind is not so stedfastly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the Means as the End: Divers would be happy hereafter as Angels and Saints, and yet live here as Beasts. But, without a <hi>holy Purpose,</hi> and a sutable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, <hi>no Man shall see the Lord.</hi> Take, therefore, to you Words, and say with <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Joshua, as for Me and my House, we WILL serve the Lord.</hi> Use the Language of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam;</hi> 
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63303:15"/>
but let it proceed out of a more righteous Heart: <q>If any one would give <note place="margin">Numb. 2. 18.</note> me his House full of Silver and Gold, I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.</q> With <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> follow the Lord, <hi>wholly</hi> and you will enter into a better <hi>Land of Promise</hi> than they at first did. <hi>Engage your Hearts to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the Lord,</hi> and he will draw nigh unto you, and make what you do to prosper.</p>
            <p>In purposing on this manner, be pleased to observe these few Directions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> When <hi>Difficulties</hi> in Religion dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you, oppose <hi>Necessity</hi> to them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Jer. 30. 31.</note> Let come on it what will, we <hi>must</hi> serve God, we <hi>must</hi> save our Souls. It must be confessed, that when those who have been enchanted with sinful Pleasures, begin to think of reforming themselves, there is a great strife betwixt the Flesh and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they are ready to think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63303:15"/>
by any means get the Victory, and they cry out with Anxiety, and say, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what shall we do?</hi> What should they do? Doubtless they should encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in God, who is greater than those who are against them, and will come in to their Aid, if they pray to him, and repeat their Holy Vows in sincerity of Heart. It cannot be denied, but that the first Steps in our Ascent towards Christian Perfection are very laborious; but in due time we shall make good Progress if we faint not. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when at first he found his Mind strugling betwixt Grace and Nature, cried out as a Man in great distress, who shall <hi>deliver me</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>from the body of this Death?</hi> Yet at length the Grace of God did carry his Resolution to such a Degree of Power, that he chang'd his Complaint into the Triumph of these Words, <hi>I can do all things through Christ, who</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phiiip. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>strengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all <hi>Temptations</hi> maintain such a Presence of Mind as may enable you to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63303:16"/>
reflect upon the Resolutions which you have formerly taken up against them. Commune with your own Hearts after this manner. Is not this the very Evil which, upon due Consideration, we have so often vow'd to forsake? How can we thus contradict our selves? How shall we do this great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and sin against our Conscience, our Baptismal Engagement, our Righteous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and our Holy, Just God, who keepeth his Promise for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When you have taken a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to lead a more Christian Life, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain, at least for a time, from the familiar <hi>Conversation</hi> of such who account it a Crime not to be dissolute, and endeavour, by mockery, to discourage all Seriousness in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The prophane and scurrilous Breath of such Men, who are of a Party for Vice, may drive back again that Disease, which was coming forth by Confession and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63303:16"/>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Think frequently of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow, Promise and Profession which you made in <hi>Baptism,</hi> and renew it often in the Holy <hi>Communion.</hi> By it all worthy Partakers are <hi>strengthned</hi> and <hi>refresh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly;</hi> Say not, All this we will do, though not now, yet in a <hi>convenient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> It may be that convenient Season will never come; for <hi>who knows what a Day may bring forth?</hi> How foolish are such, and ignorant, who say in effect, We <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> to be good, but not till it be more difficult to be so; not till Custom in Sin hath hardned our Hearts, and stiffned our Necks into Inflexibility? <hi>O ye Sons of Men, how long will ye love Vanity, and seek after Leasing?</hi> Imitate rather Holy <hi>David,</hi> and attend to his Words in the <hi>119th</hi> Psalm; <hi>I thought on my Ways, and turned my Feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 59, 60, 57.</note> 
               <hi>thy Testimonies. I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments. I have said,</hi> [or fully determined] <hi>that I would keep thy Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63303:17"/>
               <hi>Finally;</hi> Let us pray unto Almighty God in some such Words as these; <q>Lord, we believe; Lord, help our weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Lord, we resolve; Lord, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Holy Resolutions. And, as by thy Grace preventing us, thou dost put into our Hearts good Desires and Purposes; so, by thy continual Help, make us able to bring the same to good Effect, through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom, with the Father and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, be all Honour and Glory now and for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
