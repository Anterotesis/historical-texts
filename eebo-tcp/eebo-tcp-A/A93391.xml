            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
PROFESSORS OF RELIGION
Of all Sorts, and likewiſe to
PROPHANE,
In and About this
CITY of CHESTER.</head>
            <p>THis is in my Heart to you, in Defence of that Glorious Truth, which the Lord hath
brought to Light in this our Day, and which ſhall never more be extinguiſhed,
though many Wicked and Ungodly Men have opened their Mouths againſt us, to
deſtroy us, for bearing Witneſs to the ſame; and which hitherto we have believed, born, and
ſtill do bear Witneſs to, <q>That he that believes in the Son of God, hath (<hi>Life, and</hi>) the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in himſelf, which Life is the Light of Men, which lighteth every Man that cometh into
the World, that whoſoever believes in it, follows it, and obeyes it, ſhall not abide in Darkneſs,
but ſhall have the Light of Life; yea, it ſhall take Root, grow, bring forth Fruit, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to the Honour of him, who forth of his Rich Love to Mankind hath ſo manifeſted it.</q>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>Now by Reaſon of ſome in and about this City, which have made a large
Profeſſion of this Truth, and have by their erring from it opened many Mouths,
who are ſaying,</hi> We ſee the ſame Things among you, which you have counted Evil amongſt
us, and denyed and judged us for, and which you once denyed your ſelves; and yet talk of
Perfection, and plead for the Light: In Anſwer to which, I, with thoſe People ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do ſay,</p>
               <p>We have not only denyed you, becauſe of your bad Fruits, but as being out from that (not
believing in the true Light which lighteth every one that cometh into the World) which would
make you bring forth good Fruits; <hi>For make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, the Light: And we do judge our ſelves (<hi>firſt</hi>) and eſpy the Beam in our own Eye;
for being turn'd to the <hi>Light,</hi> which makes manifeſt the leaſt thing that appeareth in us contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereto, is as a Beam, which (whileſt ſtanding) cloudeth and overſpreadeth the pure Preſence
of God; wherefore we are not at Reſt Day or Night, till the Beam be pluckt out: And ſo do
we eſpy and reprove the Faults of others, who either plead for <hi>Sin</hi> as long as they live, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
their own <hi>Iniquity</hi> by others Failings, and yet think themſelves ſafe.</p>
               <p>And this I would have none to be ignorant of, that although we believe <hi>Perfection</hi>
to be attainable in this World; yet we are very ſenſible, that it is not alwayes the
Work of a Day, Month or Year; but that there muſt be much waiting, many a Sigh,
Groan and Tear; a great ſpiritual Combate with the Dragon and his Angels within; a
diligent and expert Exerciſing of the whole Armour of Light, ere ſuch a State be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
But this is our Comfort, that we are truly turned to the true Light, which gives
the Victory in the End; and ſo are not faithleſs, but believing; as alſo that the Lamb's War
is truly begun in us, who fights our Battails for us, while we ſtand ſtill, and behold his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But we never did aſſert our ſelves ſuch, becauſe there was ſuch a Principle in us, by no
means; but that all who are led by it, are ſo far perfect and infallible, and no Jot farther: So
that in Plainneſs, what bad Fruit hath appeared in any gone from us, and once of us, or yet
may appear in or amongſt ſome of us, I would have all to know, that ſuch Fruit is not from
the Light, but from the Enemy of the Light and of the Soul too; and all who give Way to the
Temptations muſt bear their own Burthen: And this I muſt ſay, not only for my ſelf, but
in the Behalf of other Brethren and Friends (in whoſe Defence I have been made willing to
write theſe Lines, to ſtop all perverſe Tongues whatever, and thoſe of all Sorts, who
wait over us with an Eye to ſpy Evil) That there is never an one among us, who are truly and
ſincerely come to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, but do love Judgment; yea, wait for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be brought forth to Victory, even as the <hi>VVatchman</hi> waits for the Morning; and ſo
far are any ſuch from pleading for any one Sin in Thought, VVord or Deed, that it is their Meat
and Drink to do the VVill of the Father; and like Gall and Wormwood to that of God in
them, when it is not anſwered; neither can they be (in the leaſt) content to ſhroud themſelves
under a Profeſſion of Truth, ſo as the more freely to act Deceit thereby, but both deſire and
witneſs a Growth in Truth and Righteouſneſs, as knowing, that not to go forward, is to
go backward: And as for any that have (or ſtill do) come among us, and ſeem to walk
with us, that are otherwiſe minded and conditioned, then I have declared, by the Light they
are judged, and by the Truth denyed, and by the Fan winnowed, and in themſelves condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
wherefore ſtumble not at the Light and Truth, becauſe of Offences; for it cauſeth not
the Offence, but by Degrees gathereth all that believe in it and follow it into its own Nature,
and maketh Fearfulneſs in due Time to ſurprize the Hypocrite: So God is glorified, &amp; his Truth
vindicated thereby: Thus the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, notwithſtanding all perverſe
Tongues and deceitful Spirits againſt the Truth, and us for the Truth's ſake.</p>

                  <hi>And further, to undeceive the ſimple-hearted, who through</hi> Lyes, Slanders,
<hi>and</hi> Forgeries, <hi>have been made to believe, that we</hi> deny the Bodily Appearance of
Chriſt, his Tranſactions at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſhedding of his Blood to be beneficial to us; it
is the Light within only (<hi>ſayes the falſe Accuſer</hi>) we expect to be ſaved by; <hi>and
likewiſe,</hi> that we deny the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p>To theſe do I (on the Behalf of Truth) teſtifie, that the Appearance of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi>
the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit, in that holy Body prepared of the Father for
him, was for the Salvation of the VVorld, who had fallen in the firſt, that whatever he then did
both living and dying had a great Influence for God upon all that believed, and hath ſtill for all
that now believe in him, as he manifeſts himſelf to us by his Light in the Conſcience, for we
do affirm, that to come to that is the readyeſt, nay, the only right VVay to come to true
Faith in Chriſt, as he then appeared, and to receive any Benefit by him: And it is not another
then that Bleſſed <hi>Light, Power, VViſdom</hi> and <hi>Eternal Righteouſneſs,</hi> who then appeared, by
whom we have received any true ſpiritual Benefit; how then can our aſſcribing particular Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this Age to him, who thus now appears to our Souls, render him no Saviour in that, or
invalidate his then Appearance, whoſe Doctrine pierc'd, whoſe Life preach'd, whoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
aſtoniſh'd, whoſe Blood atton'd, and whoſe Death and Reſurrection confirm'd his then
Manifeſtation to be no leſs then God (who is Light) manifeſted in the Fleſh?</p>

they are the Form of ſound VVords; and we believe they ought to be read, believed,

that we may witneſs the fulfilling of them, that God's will may be done in Earth, as it is in
