         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for these Metaphorical, or Mystical resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent stars whose aspect hath been as sadly omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to the foes, as benevolous to the friends of Gods Truth, and true Religion, I hope that I have so kept within the circle of modesty and reason, in the expression of their merits and the accommodation of their due praises, that none but such to whom goodnesse in others seemes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and to whom no blood or condition of estate is acceptable, but those who are stamped with <hi>Caesars</hi> Image (who if there were such a peace concluded as they could wish, were as fit to receive the marke of the Beast as before) can justly repine at it. But to my own judgement I seem rather to have transgressed by diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than enlarging their high deserts by my weake industry. But if it be lawfull and equall to calumniate, slander and disgrace an enemy (which is Cavaliers practise, not my tenet) then by the rule of contraries it is lawfull and equall to praise and commend a friend, especially such friends, who have preferred the life of Religion, Lawes and Liberty before their owne lives, and faire estates. But it is very comicall to consider how prettily the Malignants tearmes of contempt doe jumpe with their contemptible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, for they called that gallant souldier Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Brown</hi> a <hi>Woodmonger,</hi> a tearme very suitable to their sufferings, for they know very well, that this <hi>Woodmonger</hi> hath oftentimes cudgelled their Militia from the <hi>Generalissimo</hi> to the <hi>Corporall,</hi> and made them run almost to

                  <head>Upon the illustrious and right honourable, ROBERT Earle of Essex, sometimes Generall of England, lately deceased. 

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <add>The Earl of Essex was in his friendships just and constant; and would not have practised foully against those he took to be enemies. No man had credit enough with him to corrupt him in point of loyalty to the king, whilst he thought himself wise enough to know what treason was. But the new doctrine and distinction of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of the king's power in and out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the new notions of ordinances, were too hard for him, and did really intoxicate his understanding, and caused him to quit his own to follow theirs, who, he thought, wished as well, and judged better than himself. His vanity dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him to be his Excellency; and his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to believe that he should be the General in the Houses as well as in the field, and be able to govern their councils, and restrain their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as well as to fight their battles; and that by this means, he should become the preserver, and not the destroyer, of the king and kingdom. With this ill-grounded confidence, he launched out into that sea, where he met with nothing but rocks and shelves, and from whence he could never discover any safe port to harbour in. When he took the command of the parliament army, he was better qualified than any man in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for that post; but was soon eclipsed by a new race of soldiers, who, if not his superiors in the art of war, went far beyond him in spirit and enterprise. He died the 14th of September, 1646, and his death helped to open a way for the ambition of Cromwell.#</add>

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <add>Alexander Lesley, earl of Leven, acquired the highest reputation as a soldier, under Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, who appointed him governor of Stralsund, which he bravely and vigilantly defended against the Imperialists. He was also governor of the cities along the coast of the Baltic; and afterward "felt-marshall over the army in Westphalia." He had the supreme command of the Scottish army when it invaded England, and was, upon the cessation of arms betwixt the two kingdoms, created an earl; and about the same time made governor of the castle of Edinburgh. He also commanded the army that marched into England in 1644; and which had so considerable a share in the battle of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston Moor, the greatest that was fought during the civil war. Soon after the defeat of the royal army at this place, general Leven, the earl of Manchester, and Fairfax, with their combined forces, sat down before York, which presently surrendered upon terms. They soon after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their armies; and Leven returning into the North, took the rich town of Newcastle. Zach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Hamilton, preceptor to the Pretender's son, told lord Hailes, that Lesley was a soldier of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that one day on a march in Scotland, he said to an officer, "There is the house where I went to school."—"How, General," answered the officer, "I thought you could not read."—"Pardon me, I got the length of the letter G."#</add>

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <add>The Earl of Warwick, who assisted in the king's council, was not much wondered at for deserting his royal master, whom he had never well served; nor did he look upon himself as obliged by that honour, which he knew was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him in the crowd of those whom his majesty had no esteem of, or ever proposed to trust; so his business was to join with those to whom he was indebted for promotion. He was a man of a pleasant and companionable wit and conversation; of a universal jollity; and such a licence in his words, and in his actions, that a man of less virtue could not be found; so that one might reasonably have believed, that a man so qualified, would not have been able to have contributed much to the overthrow of a nation and kingdom. But with all these faults, he had great authority and credit with those people who, in the beginning of the troubles, did all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and by opening his doors, and making his house the rendezvous of all the silenced ministers, in the time when there was authority to silence them, and spending a good part of his estate, of which he was very prodigal, upon them, and by being present with them at their devotions, and making himself merry with them, he became the head of that party, and got the character of a godly man. When the king revoked the earl of Northumberland's commission of admiral, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted that office from the parliament, and never quitted their service; and when Cromwell dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that parliament, he betook himself to the protection of the Protector, married his heir to his daughter, and lived in so entire a confidence and friendship with him, that when the Protector died, he exceedingly lamented him. The earl of Warwick died April 19, 1659, aged 71, and lies buried in Folstead Church, Essex. He left his estate, which before was subject to a vast debt, more improved and repaired, than any man who trafficked in that desperate commodity of rebellion.#</add>

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <add>Edward earl of Manchester, a nobleman of many great and amiable qualities, was a zealous and no less able patron of liberty; but without enmity to monarchy, or the person of the king. He was one of the avowed patriots in the house of peers, and the only member of that house who was accused by Charles of high-treason together with the five members of the house of commons. In the civil war, he had the charge of seven of the associated counties; and with his usual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and address raised an army of horse, which he commanded in person. Soon after he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon his command, he forced the town of Lynne to submit to the parliament, and defeated the earl of Newcastle's army at Horn Castle. In 1644, he took Lincoln by storm, and had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal share in the victory at Marston Moor. After the battle of Newbury, he was suspected of favouring the king's interest; was even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by Cromwell of neglect of duty, and by the self-denying ordinance deprived of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. He had been bred up in the court under the favour of the duke of Buckingham, a lady of whose family he had married, and had attended upon the prince when he was in Spain; was called to the house of peers in the lifetime of his father, which was a very extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Upon the death of the duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, his wife being likewise dead, he married the daughter of the earl of Warwick, a man in no grace at court, and looked upon as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est patron of the Puritans, because of much the greatest estate of all who favoured them: after this second marriage, lord Manchester totally estranged himself from the court, and entered into all the politics of his father-in-law; but at last, he heartily concurred in the restoration of Charles the Second, who appointed him lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamberlain of his household. He died May 5, 1671, aged sixty-nine.#</add>

                     <add>* James Levingston, earl of Calendar, who descended from the house of Linlithgow, was formed as a soldier, in the wars of Bohemia, Holland, Sweden, and Germany, and acquired a great reputation in his military character. He was a gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles I. who created him lord Levingston of Almont, in 1633, and earl of Calendar, 1641. Upon the eruption of the civil war, he took the side of the parliament, but afterward attached himself to the king. He marched into England, soon after the battle of Marston Moor, with ten thousand men, to assist the earl of Leven in reducing York. He was lieutenant-general of the Scots army that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to rescue Charles from his confinement in the Isle of Wight. His most signal exploit was the taking of Carlisle, in which he found a seasonable supply of arms and ammunition. He freely confessed to Charles I. upon what errors and mistakes he had been corrupted, and by whom, and pretended so deep a sense of what he had done amiss, that it was believed, he would have taken a command in the king's army; which he declined, as it might have been penal to him in Scotland by some clause in the Act of the Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but especially upon pretence it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him from doing him greater service in that kingdom; whither, shortly after the standard was set up, he repaired, with all solemn vows of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, and improving his Majesty's interest in those parts. The earl of Calendar died in Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, 1672.#</add>

He, with part of his brigade, defended Plymouth against the combined force of the enemy, and several times repulsed them to their great loss. He was a leading man in the councils of the patriotic junto, and had afterward a principal hand in the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He had much learning, but it was mixed with the pedantry of the time of James I. and was of a morose and splenetic temper. He was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Charles II. in 1669, in a time of confusion, when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious claims to the estates in that kingdom was to be adjusted. His parts were by no means equal to this government, at so critical a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as he had a genius rather for starting than solving difficulties. He treated the Irish nobility with haughtiness and contempt, and was himself treated with much less ceremony than he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The king found it necessary to remove him from this employment; and, soon after his return to England, appointed him president of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and created him earl of Radnor. He was observed to puzzle business, and retard the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of it, more than any man that had ever been in the great offices which he enjoyed. He died in the year 1685. His daughter, Letitia Isabella, who was first married to Charles, earl of Drogheda, was afterward the wife of Mr. Wycherly, the dramatic poet.#</add>

He, and lord Say, had actually agreed to transport themselves to New England: but the sudden turn of affairs prevented their voyage. Having reduced Warwickshire to the obedience of the parliament, he advanced into Staffordshire. On the festival of St. Chad, to whom the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of Lichfield is dedicated, he ordered his men to storm the adjoining close, whither lord Chesterfield had retired with a body of the king's forces: but before his orders could be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he received a musket-shot in the eye, by the hand of a common soldier, of which he instantly died. It was the opinion of some of the royalists, and especially of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, that the bullet was directed by St. Chad. It is observable, that the same man who was by one party looked upon as a monument of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance, was by the other reverenced as a saint.

Bamford delivered such a message from the fleet as he thought would hasten the duke's journey thither; and told him, "the seamen made great inquiry after the lord Willoughby, and much longed to have him with them;" insinuating to the duke, "that he had much contributed to that good disposition in the seamen, and was privy to their revolt, and had promised speedily to come to them, and that it would be the most acceptable thing his highness could do to carry him with him to the fleet, and make him his vice-admiral." The duke made all imaginable haste to Helvoet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluys, and immediately went on board the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral; where he was received with the usual marks of joy and acclamation.

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <add>Sir Thomas Fairfax was formed as a soldier under Horatio, lord Vere, in the Netherlands, and was at the taking of Bois le Duc from the Spaniards. He was one of the first characters of his time for integrity and military accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but his natural simplicity was so great, that he was ever the dupe of Cromwell, who had only the appearance of it. He was a very useful instrument in the hands of that aspiring man, who quickly reaped the fruit of all his victories. Sir Horace Vere, his master in the art of war, was remarkable for doing great things with few men; and Fairfax, with the loss of few. When the parliament determined to carry the war into Scotland, Fairfax, who had hitherto worn the name of general, declared positively that he would not command the army against that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Presbyterians said, "It was because he thought the war unlawful, in regard it was against those of the same religion;" but his friends would have it believed, that he would no longer fight against the king. Hereupon Cromwell was chosen general; which made no alteration in the army, which he had modelled to his own mind before, and commanded as absolutely. But in all other places he grew more absolute and more imperious; he discountenanced and suppressed the Presbyterians in all places, who had been supported by Fairfax. Sir Thomas (afterward lord Fairfax) has written memorials of himself; and it is much to be wished that every great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had done the same; though he had not, like Caesar, been equally dexterous at using the pen and the sword. He versified the Psalms of David, and other parts of Scripture, but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they were never thought worth print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He died Nov. 12, 1671, aged sixty.#</add>

He was one of the most able and active of the parliament generals, and was for a considerable time vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and therefore called William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. He was defeated at the battle of Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, near Bath, and afterward totally routed at Roundway Down, near the Devizes. Hence, with a little variation, it was called <hi>Runaway Down,</hi> and continues to be called so to this day.

                        <p>The Presbyterians caused sir William Waller to be named for deputy or lieutenant of Ireland; and at first Cromwell did not oppose the motion but consented to it, being very willing to be rid both of Waller and all the officers who were willing to go with him, who he knew were not his friends. But when he saw Waller insist upon great supplies to carry with him, he changed his mind, and set his instruments to cross such a supply of men and money as he had proposed, and caused Lambert to be appointed to that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.—Sir William was author of a book of "Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Meditations," which was published after his decease.

                        <p>Major-general Massey, a Presbyterian, and a soldier of fortune, offered to enter into the king's service before he was retained by the parliament, which he served with a fidelity that was greatly applauded. He was governor of the city of Gloucester, which he held out with invincible resolution against the flower of the royal army, till the earl of Essex could be supplied with a sufficient body of forces to raise the siege. The defence of this city is one of the most signal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of bravery in the whole course of the war. He was set aside by the Independents upon the passing of the self-denying ordinance; and shortly after volunteered his service in the cause of king Charles the Second, who, from the time that he had recovered any authority in Scotland, granted a commission to the duke of Buckingham to raise a regiment, which Massey was to command under him, and to raise another regiment of foot; and the English which should resort thither, of which they expected great numbers, were to list themselves in those regiments. And there were some who had enlisted themselves accordingly; but the discipline the Scots had used to the king, and their adhering to their old principles, even after they seemed united for him, had kept the king's friends in England from repairing to them in Scotland. Massey had got a great name by his defending Gloucester against the late king, and was looked upon as a martyr for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian interest, and so very dear to that party; and therefore as soon as they came within the borders of England, he was sent with some troops before and was always to march at least a day before the army, to the end that he might give notice of the king's coming, and draw the gentry of the counties through which he passed, to be ready to attend upon his majesty.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the night, when Massey was going for Gloucester, a troop of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment army beset the house where he was, and took him prisoner, and putting him before one of the troopers well guarded were proceeding to a place of security. But that tempestuous night had so much good fortune in it to him, that in the darkest part of it, going down a steep hill, with woods on both sides, he, either by his own activity, or the connivance of the soldier, found means to disentangle himself from the man, and to effect his escape into the woods, and got clean off.</p>

courage and gallantrey march towards the said Forrest, and gave them battell, and in a small space had utterly routed them, taken and kild many, Febr. 26. 1644. and not long afterwards having intelligence of a party of the King's horse coming out of Bristoll for the assistance of Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> were met by this noble Generall, and upon a sudden routed, and many taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, March 24. 1644. presently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he marched towards the strong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of Evesham, and besieged it, upon a fierce storme tooke it, with all the ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition therein, May 27. 1645. having thus gallantly performed, not to be parallelled, considering his strength, yet some who were no well-wishers to Honour, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did murmur and complaine of this noble Generall, whose honour will stand to perpetuity upon Glocester walls, and in all true-borne English mens hearts; and although some thought his sudden taking off from that service would have dis-ingaged him from all service, it is well knowne by the West that after he was made there Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, he did most gallantly, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as I may so say) the very wall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Army from the incursions of the enemy, brave <hi>Massey</hi> led brave <hi>Fairfax</hi> the way into the West, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the daily skirmishes he was in for five or six weeks together, beating the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to retreats at least 120. miles, taking and killing many, notwithstanding the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

                        <add>Philip Skippon was sergeant-major-general of the parliament army, major-general of the London militia, and governor of Bristol. After the passing of the self-denying ordinance, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the same post in the army that he held before; to which he was thought justly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled on the ground of his merit. He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the council of war, under the earl of Essex; and, both in the cabinet and the field, approved himself an excellent soldier. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the infantry at the battle of Naseby, where he exerted himself with his usual intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. "Magnanimous Skippon," says May, "was grievously wounded, yet would not forsake the battle; but with all possible endeavours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his part, till the victory was obtained." He was a zealous republican, and indeed went the greatest lengths with that party. His name frequently occurs as a member of the house of commons in the Interregnum. He was also one of Cromwell's council of state. He had 1000<hi>l:</hi> a year in lands of inheritance assigned him by the parliament, for his services. The duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham's estate at Blecheley, in Buckinghamshire, was given to him, on that nobleman's forfeiture; but at the Restoration it reverted to the real owner. Walker says, "he was heretofore wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner to sir Francis Vere;" but if he were a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner, which is extremely improbable, it adds much to the greatness of his character, to have been able to raise himself to such eminent posts in the army and the state, under every disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of education.#</add>

                        <add>Sir John Meldrum, a Scotsman, when he entered into the service of the parliament, joined himself to sir William Waller, and first displayed his military talents in the West, particularly at the taking of Portsmouth. When the earl of Newcastle besieged Hull a second time, he made a bold sally from that fortress, beat the earl and his whole army from their works, and raised the siege. Upon this success, he, with the assistance of sir Thomas Fairfax, took the strong town of Gainsborough, Dec. 20, 1643, and a few weeks after the isle of Axholm. He next defeated a body of forces under the command of the lords Byron and Molineaux, near Ormskirk. The most signal of his actions was the taking of the town and castle of Scarborough. It is said he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in taking this castle; but bishop Kennet informs us, that he received his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wound at Ailresford, in Hampshire, and that he was buried in Westminster Abbey; but his body was, in 1661, taken up, and, with several others, buried in a pit, in St. Margaret's church-yard.#</add>

making most sad lamentation for him, and they alone did not lament his losse, but the Parliament also, and many thousands more in the Kingdome; and although his person be taken from us, yet his name will stand to perpetuity, and our after-Ages will speake to brave <hi>Meldrums</hi> praise.</p>

                        <add>Sir William Balfour, though he had great obligations to the court, made no scruple of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taching himself to its most virulent opponents. He was turned out of his office of the Tower, a little before the breaking out of the civil war, and was succeeded by colonel Lunsford. He afterwards served in the rebel army, as lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-general of horse under the earl of Essex, and commanded the reserve at the battle of Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, with which he charged so vigorously, that he soon dispersed the king's best infantry, and seized his artillery. He also greatly distinguished himself in the taking of Newbury. Shortly after the earl of Essex had relieved Lyme, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his forces into Cornwall, he found it expedient to his safety to quit the army in order to escape to Plymouth; on which occasion sir William Balfour contrived to pass through the whole of the king's army under command of lord Goring, and continue his march even to London, with less loss or trouble than could have been imagined; passing all the king's garrisons in his way, through the supineness and neglect of Goring, who had intelligence of their rout, but received the notice when in one of his jovial exercises, and neglected the opportunity of intercepting the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my till they had passed his quarters, and it was too late to pursue them in any time.

He commanded a large body of the parliament forces, with which he harassed the poor remains of the royal army, after the battle of Naseby. His most signal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit was routing the king's horse at Chester, and killing many gentlemen and officers of note, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the gallant earl of Lichfield, who was the third brother of that illustrious house that sacrificed their lives in the course of the civil war. It has been said, that his views in entering into this war were purely patriotic; and that he was never known to be influenced by covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or ambition, when he had frequent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of amply gratifying these passions.</p>
                        <p>Sir Marmaduke Langdale had intercepted a letter from Pointz, who had marched a much shorter way, after he was informed which way the king was bound, to the commander that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chester, telling him, "that he was come to their rescue, and desiring to have some foot sent to him, to assist him against the king's horse;" and the next morning he appeared, and was charged by sir Marmaduke, and forced to retire with loss; but kept still at such a distance, that the foot from before Chester might come to him. The besiegers began to draw out of the suburbs in such haste, that it was believed in Chester, they were upon their flight; and so most of the horse and foot in the town, had orders to pursue them. But the others haste was to join with Pointz; which they quickly did, and then they charged Langdale; who being overpowered, was routed, and put to flight; and pursued by Pointz, even to the walls of Chester.</p>

                        <add>Oliver Cromwell, whose genius was awakened by the distractions of his country, was looked upon as one of the people, till he was upwards of forty years of age. He is an amazing instance of what ambition, heated by enthusiasm, restrained by judgment, disguised by hypocrisy, and aided by natural vigour of mind, can do. He was never oppressed with the weight, or perplexed with the intricacy of affairs: but his deep penetration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable activity, and invincible resolution, seemed to render him a master of all events. He persuaded without eloquence; and exacted obedience, more from the terror of his name, than the rigour of his administration. He appeared as a powerful instrument in the hand of Providence, and dared to appeal to the decisions of Heaven for the justice of his cause. He knew every man of abilities in the three kingdoms, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avail himself of their respective talents. He has always been regarded by foreigners, and of late years by the generality of his countrymen, as the greatest man this nation ever produced. It has been disputed which he deserved most, "a halter, or a crown;" and there is no less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity betwixt the characters drawn of him, and the reports propagated by his enemies and his friends. Colonel Lindsey affirmed, that he saw him enter into a formal contract with the devil; and Dawbeny has drawn a "parallel betwixt Moses, the man of God, and Oliver the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:" But the story of this contract is explained in Nash's History of Worcestershire, where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been a citizen of Worcester, and not the devil, that had a conference with Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. He died in his bed, on the 3d of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a day which he had long esteemed fortunate, in the year 1658.

                        <add>Richard Brown, an eminent citizen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and a warm advocate for Presbytery, greatly distinguished himself in the field, and had no small influence in the parliament, where he was a representative for the city of London. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the earl of Essex when he first marched against the king, and had a considerable hand in defeating the royalists near Worcester, and at Edge hill. He took Arundel Castle by storm, and seizing on Abingdon, bravely defended it against the whole force of the garrison of Oxford. In a sudden sally from Abingdon, he surprised and took Bellasith-house, which was strongly garrisoned by the royal party, and found in it a good supply of provisions.

this day with griefe of heart, and that it may bee manifest to all, I shall here insert part of those gallant passages and exploits by him performed since these unnaturall uncivill civill warres began: and first when Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands never to bee forgotten, generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Generall, the bewailed, deceased Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> first marched forth, this gallant Commander attended him in his marches from London towards the enemies Quarters, and falling in upon them neere Worcester, they utterly defeated them and put them to flight, in this battell this successefull Major-Generall <hi>Browne</hi> did most excellent service, and afterwards marched after the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96727:81"/>
Kings Forces, who did recruit with much vigorousnesse, but being againe over-taken at Edgehill, were inforced to fight, which both sides did most gallantly, but after a hot dispute the Kings forces gave ground, retreated, and our souldiers kept the field, having won the day, and having thus pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously proceeded, and the winter draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on apace, they came to London the chiefe Garrison of England, and so soon as Forces were able to march, this renowned <hi>Browne</hi> did march forth with a Brigade against Arundell Castle, and by a fierce storme tooke it, with all the Ammunition, and not long after this service marched into Kent, and quel'd the mutineers that had made a great uproare there, afterwards cleared those parts and marched up to Waltham-house, and tooke it with much Ammunition, and from thence marched to Greenland-house and tooke it also, and afterwards took Abbington, and fortified it just under the enemies noses, and defended it most valiantly against all the power the King then had in his chiefe Garrison of Oxford, tooke also an opportunity and marched forth and took the strong Garrison, Ballasith-house, with all the provision, and retreated back to Abbington, and preserved it from all the furious attempts of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: These with many more gallant pieces of service, did this gallant Commander per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and though many proffers of honour, riches, and preferment were made him, yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96727:82"/>
this may be valiant <hi>Brownes</hi> honour, that he did refuse all, and stood for that cause his Covenant had ingaged him unto, and doth persevere to this day, which if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doe to the end, it will be a crowne of honour to religious renowned <hi>Browne</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96727:82"/>
ANd now having briefly recited many of the gallant actions of some of our valiant Commanders, I shal also add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the names of many more, who have been seconders of the former, in gallant performances: and because most of their actions are included with the former, I shall at present only speak to part of the particulars, but for the future (God willing) I do intend to speak more at large: for the first, the truly worshipfull Colonell <hi>Hollis,</hi> his birth and blood speak him to be a man that is free from basenesse, his actions in the field have been valiant, and his ends faithfull, and I dare bouldly say, it was not profit, honor, or preferment did allure that thrice noble hearted <hi>Hollis;</hi> neither was it the Tower of London, in which he was most unjustly imprisoned, did any wayes daunt this valiant-hearted publike-spirited noble descended and religious affected <hi>Denzill Hollis</hi> from prosecuting the designe of God, and his Country: and for many of his valiant actions in the field, I might speak much to his praise, as also of his valiant Regiment (not inferiour to any in England, or that ever was in England since these last trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in England) but at present I forbeare for brevities sake, and for his learned speeches, profound motions, and religious orthodox advice and Councell, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable House of Commons, I could insert somthing to his honour (which is well
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96727:83"/>
knowne) if it were proper for time and place.</p>
               <p>And next in order to religious <hi>Hollis,</hi> I shall speak of faithfull Covenant-keeping Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> somtimes Commisary-Generall to Englands generally beloved Generall the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and as it hath been said of that religious Earle deceased, that when he was alive, there was none like him in a publike Covenant engaged heart, so when he died, he left not his fellow; so I may truly say of the truly worshipfull Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> if without prejudice I may speak it; there is not his fellow-Knight, nor will hee leave his fellow behind him, I wish England were worthy of such men as hee is; I might add to this renowned <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> many gallant things he hath both performed by his sword and his Councell, which are more for his honour then all his enemies I hope can invent for his dishonour, but for me to pretend (as some of the new light-mongers do) to light a candle to the sun, were a master-peece of folly, therefore I shall say no more, but leave brave <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> beclad with wisdome honour and glory as a robe.</p>
               <p>And so I shall descend to speak of valiant Sir <hi>David Lesley,</hi> whose actions do deserve to be written in letters of gold: for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse them, were to mention almost all the victories of that faithfull Army of our true-harted brethren of Scotland; but I shall at present only give religious Sir <hi>David Lesley</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:96727:83"/>
this character, a man noble by birth, noble in mind, and noble in actions; true to his Country, true to his Covenant, and true to his God, as also loyall to his King in all just wayes and proceedings which renders not him only honour, but also that Army which had such, and many such like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Commanders and Souldiers.</p>
               <p>And the next to this religious and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Lesly</hi> is Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> the elder of Cheshire, who when the troubles first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, stood up for his Countrey, exciting his tenants so to do, promising them that had leases of their lands from him, that if any such did suffer in person or goods, he would make them recompence, and if any had Lease by life, and should be slaine, the life of his wife, child or friend, should be put in his stead (a brave religious resolution) if all the Gentry that had adhered to the Parliament had done the like, the warres could never have lasted so long: But this religious brave <hi>Booth</hi> thought it not enough so to doe, but tooke a place of command himselfe, and was verie active and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the preservation of his Countrey, did many gallant exploits, which I hope hereafter to mention at large, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent give him this Character, faithfull, free, grave, godly, brave <hi>Booth,</hi> the flower of Cheshire.</p>
               <p>Another neighbour and associated, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and valiant Commander, is Sir <hi>John Seaton,</hi> a Lancashire Gentleman, for activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96727:84"/>
piety, and constancy, inferiour to few in England, he is the man under God, did pull down the pride, rage, and cruelty of the proud, potent, Papisticall Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> who with his great Army thought to carry all before him; but as we have just cause, so let us blesse God and honour true-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir <hi>John Seaton,</hi> for those great gallant things that have been done in reformed Lancashire, and consequently in all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>And as great honour is due to valiant <hi>Season,</hi> for all his victories performed, which are mentioned in the List of the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, so to valiant, vigilant and religious true-hearted and right honourable Colonell <hi>Harvey,</hi> who when things were at a low condition was willing to doe his Kingdome service, marched forth with a Brigade of the City of London, and with a small party did most valiant things, which I omit for brevities sake. And because I have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more knowledge of him then many, of whom I have and am to speak of, I can without flattery say of true-hearted <hi>Harvey,</hi> thus much, that I ever found him a man of a noble spirit, free from by, private, and base ends, aiming at the good and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Common-wealth; active for the ends contained in the most sacred Nationall League and Covenant: a man most free from the scab of errour, adhering to no fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor party, further then the Covenant, union of the Kingdomes, and truth of God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96727:84"/>
will admit of; and as hee is a Member of that visible Body the Parliament, so also I verily believe him to bee a Member of that invisible Body of Jesus Christ; I wish so much good to England, that all their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Members were such as pious true-hearted <hi>Harvey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with him also valiant victorious Sir <hi>Samuel Luke,</hi> a man who never was knowne to turne his backe upon the Enemy, in most fights of the Army of his Excellency the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> brave Sir <hi>Samuel Luke</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be honoured for his undaunted resolution, and this (I hope) I may truly say, that hee is no turne-coat Knight, nor disobedient Commander, but was at first beginning what (I hope and verily believe) he will be to the end, <hi>viz.</hi> a true-hearted publike ingaged Covenant keeping and vertuous true-hearted English Knight, to whom England may be indebted, and he not indebted to England.</p>
               <p>The next in order, which is little used, which if any shall judge me out, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be excused, because it is the Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Malady at this day, and therefore if any shall conclude it is too high or too low for the right worshipfull Sir <hi>Tho. Middleton,</hi> or any other, I shall leave it unto their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to please themselves, and to doe as it seems just in their owne eyes, as it was when there was no King in Israel, yet I shall (I hope) give satisfaction to this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Commander, as to the rest, in declaring
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96727:85"/>
to the world that he hath been and still is, faithfull in performing most gallant actions in and upon the Borders of Wales, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing many parties of Welch forces, taking many Garrisons both by storm, siege, and stratagem, he hath in most places where he came, gained the love as well of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as others, he conquered not onely by the sword, but also by his good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full carriage, he behaved himselfe like a man of wisdome, a man of honour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is much to be found in one man, I shall for brevities sake descend to speake of religious Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> whose worth is such as speake him to bee a man beloved of his Countrey, and feared by his enemies, valiant in his actions, and faithfull in his ends to promote truth and peace, it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour enough for gallant <hi>Gell</hi> to be Patron of these vertuous parts, of which also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>Hambden</hi> was a man deserves to be put into the same beadrow, for a gallant, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, vertuous Saint, and the taking of that wise States-man away was the great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the Martiall affaires, Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary affaires, and Church-affaires, the taking away from the evil to come the zealous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> the faithfull valiant <hi>Meldrum,</hi> the wise vertuous <hi>Pym,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Covenanted <hi>Hambden,</hi> speakes little prosperity either for Church or State, I feare, I pray it may prove otherwise.</p>
               <p>And so I shall proceed to speake a few words concerning the worshipfull Colonell
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96727:85"/>
                  <hi>West,</hi> Lievtenant of the Tower of London, whose faithfulnesse deserves much of this City, who hath not been biassed by parties and factions, which if he had, London might long ere this have been lain levell with the ground, which is by his faithfull prudence, at this day preserved, and I am confident, all Covenant-engaged Englishmen, more especially Citizens, and such as in some measure know him, will conclude with me, concerning this thrice noble and truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Colonell <hi>West,</hi> Lievtenant of the Tower: That he is a holy Saint, a valiant Souldier, and a loyall Subject, which I hope wil be as a badge of honour to him for after ages to read.</p>
               <p>And for the honour of London, I shall adde to him Collonell <hi>Manwaring,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Horse raised by the City for the defence of it selfe and Parliament, this noble Commander bears about with him the badges of his honour, <hi>viz.</hi> wounds received in battell; I shall conclude what I have to say of him, in that I doe believe concerning him, that he is a man of a vertuous heart, of gallant desert, and a souldier expert.</p>
               <p>And for the honour of Wales, I shall make mention first of Col. <hi>Laugherne,</hi> whose prudence, valour and fidelity, hath preserved those parts, and kept them in good obedience, and by a handfull of men, hee hath encountered great Armies, routed and disperst them, and hath done like an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96727:86"/>
honourable man, a loyall-hearted man, and a faithfull man.</p>
               <p>A seconder of himselfe, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour likewise of Wales is the valiant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Morgan,</hi> Governor of Glocester, who hath the command over that Garrison, that was under God, the preservation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he hath ever (since he was put in the trust therewith) improved himselfe to be faithfull, hath done much service for the Parliament, and that which is the badge of his and also Colonell <hi>Laughorne</hi>'s honour, is that they have stood faithfull to God, their King and Parliament from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and are still the same, according to the Covenant, which (I hope) will be unto them and all the rest of the Covenant-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Commandérs, an eternall honour.</p>
               <p>Amongst whom faithfull and resolute Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> deserveth to be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, for all his gallant actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, especially since the new Modell, he hath not been absent in any materiall piece of service, but done his part, and I could say truly, more then his part, were it not I should procure the emulation of some men: but if I had been silent of him, his actions speake him honour enough, and much more then my pen can expresse, therefore I shall at present, be silent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him.</p>
               <p>And call to minde the noble Colonell <hi>Milton,</hi> whose actions have been many and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96727:86"/>
prosperous, and although his service hath been hard, his Brigade small, and his pay poor, yet hath he hitherto kept himselfe from disobedience, and his souldiers from mutiny, they never yet dared the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor pillaged the Countrey, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies carried themselves like faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their Masters, the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Another of the like faithfull Commanders is loyall-hearted, valiant-minded Col. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> an honourable Member of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conquering Army, who hath left no Garrison unconquered, nor no power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subdued in England; This resolute spirit hath beene in most of these the gallant performances of the Army, and hath in what he undertooke, done little inferiour to any of the most prosperous Commanders in England, as in some kind scars of honour make it to appeare.</p>
               <p>I intend brevity, but must not forget ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the valiant Commanders, Colonell <hi>Whaley,</hi> a man of honour and of trust, who deserves as much from the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as the best of the Commanders in his Excellency <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Army (now resident) onely one excepted, which I shall say more of in my second addition, which at present time will not admit of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall conclude in two or three words apiece to two or three Commanders more.</p>
               <p>As Colonell <hi>D'Albere</hi> who hath beene faithfull alwayes to the Parliament, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96727:87"/>
done them good service, and although he bee not an English-man, yet (I hope) none will be so ungratefull, but acknowledge, he hath done England good service.</p>
               <p>Likewise Vice-Admirall <hi>Batten</hi> hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed most gallant service at Seas, and with the Navy hath been as a Bulwarke to preserve our distracted Kingdome from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, which had (in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) long ere this made us miserable.</p>
               <p>Many valiant things have by him been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as also the valiant Reare-Admirall <hi>Swanley,</hi> whom I designed to bring up the Reare, his actions in Wales, Cornewall, Devonshire, and the Northerne parts of England, can witnesse to bee such, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a History of themselves to be extant to succeeding Generations. And thus much I can say, as most conclude with mee, that there is not his fellow at Sea this day, for valour, and judgement, in the commanding and mannaging a Navy at Sea; I crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in my rude conclusion, and desire to be excused by many, whom I shall hereafter mention, as Sir <hi>Robert Pye,</hi> Colonell Sir <hi>Hardresse Waller,</hi> Colonell Sir <hi>Arthur Hasterig,</hi> Colonell Sir <hi>James Harrington,</hi> Colonell Sir <hi>William Constable,</hi> Colonell Sir <hi>Matthew Boynton,</hi> a man whom Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land owes much honour to, as also those deceased valiant hearted Worthies, who adhered to the Parliament, I have here nominated, as also all others that have beene slaine on the Kings party, with the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96727:87"/>
common souldiers on both sides, as also those that fled out of the Kingdome, all which I hope will bee excepted of without prejudice from him who hath hitherto been and resolveth (by the help of God) for the future to bee the Kingdomes most faithfull servant, in reality, constancy, and sencerity, to serve them,</p>
