            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN reading your Book of that Title, I readily perceived your Deſign, intimated in your Preface, to be therein most indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly and piouſly purſued: So that you have, with full Evidence of Scripture and Reaſon, ſhewed, againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold obſcure and tedious Systems, that the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, neceſſary to conſtitute a Man a true Member of Chriſt's Church, are all comprehended or implied in this plain Propoſition, <hi>That Jeſus is the Meſſiah:</hi> Whereby you have happily provided for the Quiet and Satisfaction of the Minds of the honeſt Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or <hi>Bulk</hi> of Mankind, floating in Doubts and Fears, becauſe either they cannot underſtand, or can find no clear Evidence in Holy Scripture, of thoſe intricate Points requir'd to be explicitly believ'd upon pain of eternal Damnation. You have alſo argued clearly the Reaſonableneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of the Chriſtian Revelation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Atheiſts and Deiſts. Theſe things conſider'd, 'twas no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that the Systematical Men, who gain both their Honour and Profit by the Obſcurity and Multitude of their Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſhould raiſe an Outcry againſt you, like that of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> magnifying their <hi>DIANA.</hi> They have more cauſe for it than <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> had. But that they ſhould traduce your Work as tending to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm or Deiſm, is as ſtrange from Reaſon, as many of their Articles are from Scripture. And that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has done it, and forc'd it in among his <hi>Tendencies to Atheiſm,</hi> is, I think, to be imputed to the Co-incidence of your Book's being publiſh'd, and ſtriking ſtrongly upon his inventive Faculty, juſt when it was in hot purſuit of the Cauſes of Atheiſm, rather than to any the leaſt Colour or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93987:3"/>
that way, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> can ſpy in it in his cool Thoughts: For I am much perſwaded on the contrary, that there is no Atheiſt or Deiſt in <hi>England,</hi> but, if he were ask'd the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would tell Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> that their obſcure and contradictious Fundamentals were one Cauſe or Inducement to his caſting off and disbelief of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>In this Mind I have undertaken to vindicate your Doctrine from the Exceptions of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> againſt it. But whether I have done it as it ought to have been done, I cannot be a competent Judg. If I have miſtaken your Senſe, or us'd weak Reaſonings in your Defence, I crave your Pardon: But my Deſign in this Writing was not to pleaſe you, (whom I know not) nor any Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but only to honour the One God, and vindicate his moſt uſeful Truths. I am,</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT ſeems to me, that Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> printing his <hi>Cauſes of Atheiſm,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſtianity</hi> was newly publiſh'd, was put upon it by his Bookſeller, to add ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt that Treatiſe ſo much noted for its Heterodoxy; that ſo the Sale of his own Tract might be the more promoted: whence it comes to paſs, that his Notes being writ in haſte, are not ſo well digeſted as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Perſon of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ingenuity. In <hi>pag.</hi> 104. he takes notice of A PLAUSIBLE CONCEIT, <hi>which hath been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a conſiderable Time,</hi> &amp;c. but tells not his Reader what that Conceit was, till he hath charged it upon a very <hi>Learned</hi> and famous Author, whom he is pleaſed to call <hi>a wavering Prelate,</hi> and <hi>another of the ſame Order,</hi> and a Third of a lower Degree; but more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, fully and diſtinctly,</hi> upon the late Publiſher of <hi>The Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c. Here at length in his next Page, he tells us, That <hi>this Author gives IT us over and over again, in theſe formal words,</hi> viz. <hi>That nothing is required to be believed by any Chriſtian Man but this, THAT JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S IS THE MESSIAH.</hi> I think if he had not been in haſte, he would have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at leaſt two or three of thoſe Pages, wherein we might find thoſe formal Words, but he has not one, and I do not remember where they are to be found; for I am almoſt in as much haſte as Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and will not ſeek for them. It's true, he ſays, <hi>That all that was to be believed for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, by him that did already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, and worſhip one true God, maker of Heaven and Earth, <hi>was no more than this ſingle Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>was the Chriſt or the</hi> Meſſiah. But then he takes to be included in this <hi>Propoſition,</hi> 1. All ſynonimous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſuch as, the Son of God; The King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> The ſent of God; He that ſhould come, He of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did write; The Teacher come from God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. All ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as ſhew the manner of his being the Chriſt, Meſſiah, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93987:4"/>
Son of God, ſuch as his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Holy Ghoſt and Power of the moſt High; his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anointed with the Holy Ghoſt and Power; his being ſanctified and ſent into the World; his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed from the Dead, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to be a Prince and Saviour after the time he was ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Such Expreſſions as import the great Benefits of his being the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah; as having the Words of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life; his having Power from the Father to remit Sins, to raiſe the Dead, to judg the World; to give eternal Life; to ſend the H. Spirit upon the Apoſtles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might work Miracles, and preach the Light of Life to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the like. For all thoſe Quotations of Scripture which the Author (as Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> obſerves) <hi>has amaſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Goſpels, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, which take up about three quarters of his Book,</hi> for the proof of his Propoſition, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed expoſitory of the meaning of that Propoſition, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it. Not that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that every one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Propoſition, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and have an <hi>explicite</hi> Faith of all thoſe particulars: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Believers during the Life of Chriſt, nor the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtood many of them, no nor preſently after his Death and Reſurrection; for they had ſtill divers erroneous Opinions concerning the Nature of his Kingdom, and the preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and other things. And in the beginning of Chriſt's preaching, though <hi>Philip</hi> believ'd that <hi>Jeſus was the Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of God, the King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet he ſeems to be ignorant of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born of a Virgin, for he calls him the Son of <hi>Joſeph, John</hi> 1. 45. But as he that believes that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> is the true King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. believes enough to make him a good Subject, though he underſtands not all the grounds of his Title, much leſs all his Power and Prerogatives that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him as King: So he that believes upon good Grounds that <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſiah,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſo much of this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as makes him, or may make him a good Subject of Chriſt's Kingdom, though he be ignorant of many things included in that Propoſition, he has all the Faith neceſſary to Salvation, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has abundantly proved.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſays, <hi>This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman forgot, or rather wilfully omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a plain and obvious Paſſage, in one of the Evangeliſts,</hi> GO TEACH ALL NATIONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>From which it is plain</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that all that are adult Members of the Chriſtian Church, muſt be Taught as well as Baptiz'd into the Faith of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and then they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: and conſequently more is required to be believed by Chriſtian Men, than that Jeſus is the Meſſiah.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93987:4"/>
He infers from this, <hi>You ſee it is part of the Evangelical Faith, and ſuch as is neceſſary, abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make one a Member of the Chriſtian Church, to believe a</hi> TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the God-head; or, in plainer Terms, that though God is one as to his Eſſence and Nature, yet there are three Perſons in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, and that theſe three are really the one God.</hi> I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that if Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be good, the Author is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted, three quarters of his Book at leaſt are writ in vain, and the old Syſtems muſt ſtand good; and the <hi>Bulk of Mankind</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be damned, or it will be a wonder if any of them be faved. But give me leave to tell him I do <hi>not ſee,</hi> what he ſays <hi>we do ſee:</hi> that Text will well enough conſiſt with our Author's Propoſition. For I would ask him, whether the Apoſtles follow'd this Commiſſion or not: If they obey'd it, then in Baptizing in the Name of <hi>Jeſus the Meſſiah,</hi> and exhorting thoſe to whom they preached, to be baptiz'd in the Name of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> after their preaching the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to them, they did in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect baptize in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they did not purſue their Commiſſion; for we never find them baptizing in thoſe expreſs Terms, but always in the Name of <hi>Jeſus the Meſſiah,</hi> or the Lord Jeſus, or the Lord, and the like. So that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> muſt either charge the Holy Apoſtles with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance <hi>of,</hi> or Diſobedience <hi>to</hi> their Lord's Command, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that they did really baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, when they did but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptize in the Name of the Son or <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> foraſmuch as all that were ſo baptiz'd, did believe in the Father of that Son of God, as implied in the Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt, as the Anointing of the Son, and which alſo was given to thoſe that were ſo baptiz'd. But as for his Inference, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it's abſolutely neceſſary to believe a Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Godhead;</hi> or <hi>that God is one as to his Eſſence and Nature, yet there are three Perſons in that Divine Eſſence, and that theſe three Perſons are really the one God:</hi> This will condemn not only the Unitarians, and <hi>the Bulk of Mankind,</hi> but the greater part of Trinitarians, the Learned as well as the Vulgar. For all the real Trinitarians do not believe <hi>one Eſſence,</hi> but three Numerical Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences. Here Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Gl.</hi> the late Arch-biſhop, Mr. <hi>H—w,</hi> and all that hold as the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did, with that Council it ſelf, and the whole Church (except ſome Hereticks) for many Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expung'd out of the Catalogue of Chriſtian Believers, and conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to the horrible Portion of Infidels or Hereticks. The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery-men,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93987:5"/>
or <hi>Ignoramus Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they are condemn'd too; for they admit not any Explication, and therefore not Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s. There remains only Dr. <hi>South,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and the Philoſopher <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who (Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſays) <hi>is the great Maſter and Lawgiver of the profeſs'd Atheiſts,</hi> pag. 129. and that Party which have the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary Faith of three Perſons in one Eſſence. But if you ask theſe Men what they mean by three Perſons: Do they mean according to the common ſenſe of Mankind, and eſpecially of the Engliſh Nation, three ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Beings? No, by no means, that is Tritheiſm, they mean three <hi>Modes</hi> in the one God, which may be reſembled to three <hi>Poſtures</hi> in one Man; or three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Relations, as Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Sanctifier; as one Man may be three Perſons, a <hi>Husband,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>a Maſter.</hi> This is that Opinion of Faith, which the Antients made Hereſy, and <hi>Sabellius</hi> the Head of it. Thus it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to make a Man a Chriſtian, that he be a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heretick. But perhaps Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> may be of Mr. <hi>H—w</hi>'s Mind, for he ſays, <hi>Theſe three Perſons are really the one God;</hi> but then, no one of them ſingly is ſo, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one <hi>a Third of God:</hi> If ſo, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is indeed a Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for he gives us one God only; but then he is no Trinitarian, for he has put down the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being God ſingly, and ſo the Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſays of being Baptized into the <hi>Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of none <hi>but the only true God,</hi> that has been anſwer'd a hundred times. He cannot look into any of the Unitarian Books, but he will find a ſufficient Anſwer to that Inference. Were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd into the Worſhip of <hi>Moſes?</hi> but they were <hi>baptized into</hi> Moſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. Or when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſes he might have <hi>baptized in his own Name;</hi> Did he mean that he ſhould have baptized into the Worſhip of himſelf as the moſt high God?</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> minds his Reader, that the Author had left out alſo that famous Teſtimony in Joh. 1. 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word</hi> [Jeſus Chriſt] <hi>and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Whence (ſaith he) we are obliged to yield aſſent to this Article, <hi>That Chriſt the Word is God.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> muſt mean that this is a Fundamental Article, and neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; otherwiſe he ſays nothing againſt his Author, who has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his urging any other Text, not containing a Fundamental, in his Anſwer to the Objection from the Epiſtles and other Scriptures. For (ſaith he) <hi>pag.</hi> 299. <hi>They are Objects of Faith—They are Truths, whereof none that is once known to be ſuch may be disbelieved. But yet a great many of them, every one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93987:5"/>
does, and muſt confeſs a Man may be ignorant of; nay disbelieve, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger to his Salvation: As is evident in thoſe who allowing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, differ in the Interpretation and Meaning of ſeveral Texts.—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs Divine Revelation can mean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it ſelf.</hi> The whole Paragraph ought to be read, which I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged. And if this Text of <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. be not one of thoſe, that by reaſon of its difficulty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Senſes, may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believ'd in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Senſe, then I will be bold to ſay, There's no ſuch Text in the whole Bible. To it I ſay, 1. He dares not truſt his Reader with the clear Text, but thruſts in his own Senſe, <hi>In the beginning was the Word</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt:) and then 2. Makes his Fundamental Article not from the Text, but from what he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the Text thus, <hi>Chriſt the Word is God.</hi> But will Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſtick to that? Is he of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Mind, that by the Word is meant the Man Jeſus Chriſt, born of the Bleſſed Virgin, and anointed with the Holy Ghoſt? I think he is not. Or does he mean that Chriſt was <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation of God,</hi> Rev. 3. 14. <hi>By</hi> whom God made the Worlds, and is therefore <hi>a God?</hi> I think Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> might be call'd an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> if that were his Senſe. What then does he mean? He does not mean that either the Body or Soul, or both united to conſtitute a Man, or the Anointing of the Holy Ghoſt added to that Man, was the <hi>Word;</hi> though by reaſon of thoſe he had the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and by reaſon of this he had the Name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He means by the Word, <hi>a ſecond Perſon or Mode of God.</hi> Now how fairly he calls this ſecond Perſon a Mode of God, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus nor Chriſt, nor any part of him, let his Reader judg. <hi>In the beginning was the Word]</hi> that is, (according to him) before the Beginning, and therefore from Eternity, God in a ſecond Mode or Perſon did exiſt: <hi>and the Word was with God] i. e.</hi> God in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Mode was preſent with God, even himſelf in the firſt Mode or Perſon: <hi>and the Word was God]</hi> i. e. God in his ſecond Mode was <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> or otherwiſe, was the Father himſelf and the Holy Ghoſt; for he tells us before, that the three Perſons [or Modes] <hi>are really the one God:</hi> but if the <hi>Word</hi> is really the one God, as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> underſtands the Term <hi>God</hi> in this Text, then the <hi>Word</hi> is the three Perſons, or elſe he is not really the one God, which the three Perſons only are. Now if this be a clear Text to build an Article neceſſary to Salvation, and the Worſhip of another Almighty and only wiſe Perſon upon, beſides the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; let all that have any reverence for God or his Goſpel judg! Beſides, can he alledg one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93987:6"/>
Text out of all the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or out of the three former Goſpels, where ever by the <hi>WORD</hi> or <hi>Logos</hi> (as they love to ſpeak) is meant any ſuch preexiſtent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Perſon? If there be none ſuch, it ſeems to be no little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Holy Scriptures, that the World ſhould be 4000 Years old, before any part of it heard any thing of a ſecond perſonal God, equal to the Firſt, and who had therefore as much Right to be known and worſhipped as the Firſt: Nay, and that that Perſon, <hi>the Word,</hi> ſhould have no mention made of him in the Goſpels or Sermons of Chriſt or the Apoſtles till above threeſcore Years after the Aſcenſion; for it for it was ſo long (as Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians tell us) before the Goſpel of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> was written, all the Churches and Believers we read of in Scripture, having been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd and converted before.</p>
            <p>Next Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> tells us <hi>(p.</hi> 107.) <hi>there is added</hi> in verſe 14. <hi>another indiſpenſable point of Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> i. e. <hi>That God was incarnate, the ſame with</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would have expected that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> undertaking in ſhort to confute a Propoſition, that the Author had ſpent <hi>three quarters of his Book</hi> (which conſiſts of 300 Pages) in proving; and for which he had alledg'd perhaps an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred clear Texts of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould have produc'd ſome clear Texts againſt him, and not ſuch as need Explanations; and when he has explain'd them, leaves them far more difficult than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We have ſpoken already of the <hi>Word</hi> that was ſaid to be God in the firſt verſe of that Chapter; and now in the <hi>14th</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> muſt ſignify God: but, 1. Are not the ſame Words and Terms taken in different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the ſame Context, and that too, when they come nearer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether than at thirteen verſes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Thus the word <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. ſignifies an imperſonal Thing; but in the 7, 8, and <hi>9th</hi> verſes, it denotes a Perſon, which <hi>John</hi> was not, but Jeſus was, to wit, the Revealer of the Word or Goſpel. 2. The Father was God too, and if God was <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> how will it be avoided that the Father was <hi>Incarnate?</hi> And if it cannot, then Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> will be a <hi>Patripaſſian</hi> Heretick. 3. It muſt be acknowledged, that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> has given a wonderful learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Phraſe<hi>—was made Fleſh;</hi> far more Learned than that of the old Juſtice<hi>—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion is Invaſion.</hi> The Vulgar and Unlearned may underſtand ſomething, when it is ſaid that one Thing is made another Thing, as when <hi>Water was made Wine:</hi> but I doubt they will ſtare and know nothing, when one tells 'em that <hi>a Perſon was Incarnate;</hi> much more when they read Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93987:6"/>
ſaying, That <hi>God was Incarnate,</hi> will they not gladly return from the Explanation to the Text? and then it will run thus, <hi>God was made Fleſh.</hi> But was God indeed turn'd into Fleſh, and <hi>ceaſed to be God,</hi> as the Water turn'd into Wine ceaſed to be Water? I'm ſure Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> never intends to make that an <hi>indiſpenſable Point of Faith,</hi> as he calls this, <hi>That God was Incarnate.</hi> But this is a very hard caſe, that the generality of the World (which <hi>God ſo loved, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life)</hi> their Salvation or Damnation ſhould ſtill depend on the belief of, not only <hi>obſcure</hi> Texts, but of <hi>much more obſcure</hi> Interpretations of thoſe Texts. Whether ſhall we go for the Senſe of <hi>God was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate?</hi> He ſends us to 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> But he might know that that reading of the Word <hi>GOD</hi> in that Text is a Corruption, and that inſtead of <hi>God</hi> was read <hi>which</hi> in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as the accurate Examination againſt Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> has fully prov'd; however allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reading, has given a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Senſe of it. Thus we are ſent for the Senſe of an obſcurer Interpretation of an obſcure Text, to a corrupt One. Whither ſhall we go next? It's very like that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> may next time ſend us to the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> when the Scriptures fail him; That <hi>Creed</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is neceſſary to everlaſting Salvation, that one believe rightly the INCARNATION of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,—</hi>That he <hi>is God and Man—perfect God and perfect Man—One Chriſt, not by Converſion of the Godhead into Fleſh, but by taking of the Manhood into God:</hi> So then the ſenſe of <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> will be this, <hi>God was Incarnate,</hi> that is, not by being made Fleſh or Man, but by taking Man into God; that is, God is now perfect God and Man. Well, but ſince God is a Perſon, and Man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon; perfect God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man muſt unavoidably be two Perſons: but this is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople, An. Dom.</hi> 428. but how ſhall we help it? For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God and Man not to be two Perſons, we directly contradict our Belief of God's being <hi>perfect God</hi> and <hi>perfect Man.</hi> If we ſay with <hi>Apollinarius, An. Dom.</hi> 370. That God and Man are not two Perſons but one, becauſe the Man had no Human Soul or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then we contradict God's being a perfect Man, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to eternal Damnation, as <hi>Apollinarian</hi> Hereticks. And if for ſolving theſe Difficulties, we ſhould think good to hold, that indeed there were two Natures in Chriſt when God was made Fleſh, but upon the Union the Human was ſwallowed up of the Divine, and ſo there was one Nature made of two; then we incur the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93987:7"/>
               <hi>Anathema</hi> of the <hi>Eutichian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And it follows (ſaith Mr. <hi>Edw.)</hi> in the ſame verſe of this firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>this Word is the only begotten of the Father;</hi> whence we are bound to believe the Eternal, tho ineffable, <hi>Generation of the Son of God.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Could Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> be ſo weak as to think any Body but one deeply prejudiced, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of either of his Inferences from that Clauſe? either the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, or that we are bound to believe it as an Article neceſſary to Salvation? Does he not know that Jeſus is the <hi>only Son</hi> of God, by reaſon of that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which befel him in Time? Does he read of any other Son that God generated of a Virgin but Jeſus? See <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. Did God ever <hi>ſanctify and ſend into the World</hi> in ſuch <hi>a Meaſure and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> any that were called Gods or Sons of God, as he did Jeſus our Lord? See <hi>John.</hi> 10. 35, 36, 37, 38. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 34. Did he ever give ſuch Teſtimony to any other? Did God ever beget any other Son by raiſing him from the Dead to an immortal Life <hi>(Acts</hi> 13. 33.) <hi>by anointing him with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows,</hi> Heb. 1. 9. By <hi>ſetting him on his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi> making him <hi>to inherit a more excellent Name than Angels,</hi> even that of <hi>SON</hi> in a more excellent Senſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. By <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> Chriſt, making him <hi>an High-Prieſt,</hi> ſaying unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee?</hi> Is not <hi>Iſaac</hi> call'd the only begotten Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> had other Sons? But for Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Eternal Generation, there is not one Tittle either in this Text, or in all the Bible; and yet he has the Confidence to bind the Belief of it upon Mankind, upon pain of Damnation: I wiſh he would not be ſo raſh, but more reverent in ſo tremendous a Point.</p>
            <p>Next, he finds our Author faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in not <hi>taking notice, that we are commanded to believe the Father and the Son,</hi> John 14. 10, 11. <hi>and that the Son is in the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Son, which expreſſes their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> Wonderful! Did our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor indeed take no notice that we are commanded to believe the Father and the Son? when he all along in his Treatiſe makes the <hi>Meſſiah, Chriſt, Son of God,</hi> terms ſynonimous, and that ſignify the ſame thing; and cites abundance of Texts to that purpoſe; ſo that the belief of the Father &amp; the Son, is required by him in the whole three quarters of his Book, which Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> takes notice he ſpent in proving his Propoſition. Did Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> write theſe Remarks? Or did ſome body elſe add them to his Book <hi>of the Cauſes of Atheiſm?</hi> As for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Father and Son, expreſt</hi> he ſays by theſe words, <hi>The Son is in the Father, and the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93987:7"/>
Father in the Son;</hi> Does he think his Reader never read that Text in John 17. 21. <hi>That they</hi> [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers] <hi>all may be one, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> with <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Or that other Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16. <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him?</hi> But for the word <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> which he uſes, if he means by it any more than a cloſe Union, it implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that two ſhould be one; that a Duality ſhould be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is made an Article of Faith by our Saviour's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and expreſs Command.</hi> He muſt mean, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own ſenſe of that Text is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, elſe he ſays no more of that than the Author allows concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both that and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If he means his own ſenſe, then I think he's an inconſiderate and raſh Man; for I have ſhew'd that his ſenſe is contradictious.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> calls in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſincerity of our Author, and, <hi>pag.</hi> 109. ſays, <q>It is moſt evident to any thinking and conſiderate Perſon, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omits the <hi>Epiſtolary Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of the Apoſtles, becauſe they are fraught with <hi>other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines,</hi> beſides that one which he mentions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not queſtion Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſincerity in what he writes, but I queſtion much his due conſidering what he writes againſt. Does not our Author make in effect the ſame Objection againſt himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 291. and anſwer it in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pages, even to the end of his Book? but Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> takes notice of very little of it. And the moſt of that he does take notice of, he anſwers with a little Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery upon the <hi>Bulk of Mankind,</hi> the <hi>unlearned Multitude,</hi> the <hi>Mob,</hi> and <hi>our Author.</hi> His note upon theſe Phraſes, is, <hi>Surely this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is afraid of Captain</hi> Tom, <hi>and is going to make a Religion for his Myrmidons.—We are come to a fine paſs indeed; the venerable</hi> Mob <hi>muſt be ask'd what we muſt believe.</hi> Thus he ridicules the Doctrine of Faith, on which the Salvation or Damnation of the Multitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and the Grounds of our Author's Deſign; who finding in Holy Scripture, <hi>that God would have all Men to be ſaved, and come to the KNOWLEDG of the Truth; the Goſpel was preach'd to the Poor, and the common People heard Chriſt gladly; that God hath choſen the Poor in this World, rich in Faith;</hi> he concluded (when he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the prejudices of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the contempt of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo) that the Goſpel muſt be a very intelligible and plain Doctrine, <hi>ſuted to Vulgar Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the State of Mankind in this World deſtin'd to Labour and Travel; not ſuch as the Writers and Wranglers in Religion have made it.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> anſwers (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93987:8"/>
what I have noted above) and is forced to agree, <hi>That all Men ought to underſtand their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> but then asks (as of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive thing not to be doubted) <hi>if Men may not underſtand thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith which he had mention'd a little before,</hi> pretended to be found in the Epiſtolary Writings, [which are generally form'd not in Scripture-Terms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which there is ſuch endleſs Contentions] <hi>when they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to them, as well as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Article, Jeſus is the Meſſiah?</hi> Nay he is confident that there is no more Difficulty in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Propoſition <hi>[The Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, are one God or Divine Nature]</hi> than in that other of our Author (ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 120.) when yet the World knows to its Coſt, that this Article has exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd all the greateſt Wits of the Church theſe fourteen or fifteen hundred Years to underſtand the Terms, and take away the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions: and at this Day the Engliſh Trinitarians have moſt fierce Contentions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the meaning of it. The nominal Trinitarians agree with the Unitarians, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts, that hold three real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are Tritheiſts; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts agree with the Unitarians, that the Nominals or Modaliſts deſtroy the <hi>Reality</hi> of the Eternal Son and Holy Ghoſt, and are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripaſſians</hi> or <hi>Sabellians.</hi> Beſides, Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> knows that each of theſe Parties are at vaſt difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; they eaſily find Inconſiſtences or Contradictions in one anothers Explications; ſo that ſuppoſing there be but ten different Trinitarian Hypotheſes, (I think there are more) every one has mine againſt him, all which he looks upon as faulty; and they on the other Hand do all reject his. They reject them I ſay, not, as the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to D. <hi>W. pag.</hi> 56. would paliate Matter, as having <hi>the ſame Acts of Piety and Adoration, though different ways of Explaining, either the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Eſſence, or the Trinity of the Perſons;</hi> but as having <hi>different Acts,</hi> except we can have the ſame Idea's when we worſhip three Gods, as when we worſhip one only; or when we worſhip one all-perfect Perſon, as when we worſhip three ſuch; or when we worſhip one real Perſon, and two nominal Ones, as when we worſhip three Equals; or when we worſhip one ſelf-exiſtent God, and two dependent Gods not ſelf-exiſtent, as when we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip three Self-exiſtents, and the like. Again, Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is <hi>never once</hi> found in Holy Writ; but our Author's <hi>often</hi> expreſly. He uſes Terms in ſuch a Senſe as they are never us'd in Scripture, for <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is never put there for <hi>God;</hi> nor does the word <hi>GOD,</hi> or <hi>one God,</hi> ever ſignify Father, Son and H. Ghoſt, but always one ſingular Perſon;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93987:8"/>
and throughout the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the Beginning to the End, God is ſpoken <hi>of,</hi> and ſpoken <hi>to,</hi> as one only Perſon, and by Terms and Pronouns that ſignify ſingularly, and never otherwiſe. God indeed does twice or thrice ſpeak of himſelf Plurally, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Dignity and Dominion do often. But our Author both his Words in Form, and his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are all taken out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and in the Days of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, there was no difficulty in underſtanding them. The moſt illiterate Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Shepherds, and Women, knew what was meant by <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and what by <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> The only Queſtion was, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſiah,</hi> was to be affirm'd, or denied. But notwithſtanding all this, Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays, <hi>Truly if there be any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is in our Author's Propoſition;</hi> why pray? <hi>For here is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word firſt to be explain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mob can underſtand the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:</hi> But by his favour, the word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is by our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors adopted into the Engliſh Tongue, and the common People, <hi>the Rabble</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> is pleas'd to call them) underſtand it as well as they do <hi>the Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Anointed,</hi> and alſo the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Terms, provided they uſe to read either themſelves, or hear others read the Holy Scriptures. But the word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was in our Saviour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Time moſt common among the Jews: therefore our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor deſigning to repreſent the Preaching and Faith of that Time, choſe to uſe it more frequently than any other Term, ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 30. But I preſume Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> brought in this Objection, only as a <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> If he really think as he ſays, it's a ſharp <hi>Reflection</hi> upon all the Learned Trinitarian Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts upon this Point; except they take it more <hi>candidly</hi> for an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to their Reverences and right Reverences, to come to the moſt Learned Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> to inform their Underſtandings, and ſolve all the Difficulties that make them at ſo great Odds one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And it's to be hoped he will give ſuch a clear Explication of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as will ſatisfy the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men</hi> or Ignoramus-Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that at length they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they now profeſs to believe without Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But to return, for all this will ſeem a Digreſſion except the Reader pleaſe to remember it is for a Vindication of our Author from Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s hard charge, <hi>of purpoſely omitting the Epiſtolary Writings, becauſe fraught with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fundamental Doctrines beſides that one which he mentions:</hi> Among thoſe, Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> reckons chiefly and <hi>more eſpecially—The Doctrine of the ever to be adored Trinity, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently atteſted in thoſe Epiſtles.</hi> This Doctrine he has given us in his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93987:9"/>
Propoſition above diſcourſed, and has attempted to ſhow (againſt Matter of Fact in all Ages, and eſpecially in this preſent Time) that this Fundamental ought not to have been omitted becauſe of its Difficulty or Unintelligibleneſs; for it is (he ſaith) leſs difficult than that of our Author, <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſiah;</hi> but how ſucceſsfully I leave to conſideration. But if it be Unintelligible, or Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, at leaſt to the Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, then it's impoſſible it ſhould be a Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and therefore our Author needed not <hi>purpoſely to omit the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtolary Writings of the Apoſtles,</hi> for fear of finding it there, ſince Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> himſelf cannot find it there, nor in the Bible.</p>
            <p>But what ſays he to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's full Anſwer to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about the Uſefulneſs of the Epiſtles, though <hi>the Belief of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctrines contained in them be not neceſſary to Salvation?</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor anſwers, <q>1. That he that will read the Epiſtles as he ought, muſt obſerve what 'tis in them is principally aim'd at;—for that is the Truth which is to be receiv'd and believ'd, and not ſcatter'd Sentences in Scripture-Language, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to our Notions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.</q> What ſays Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> to that? 2. [for I abridg] <q>There be many Truths in the Bible, which a good Chriſtian may be wholly ignorant of, and ſo not believe; which perhaps ſome lay great ſtreſs on, and call Fundamental Articles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the diſtinguiſhing Points of their Communion.</q> What ſays Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> to this? <q>3. The Epiſtles were writ to thoſe who were in the Faith, and true Chriſtians already; and ſo could not be deſign'd to teach them the Fundamental Articles and Points neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> This he ſhows from the Addreſs of all the Epiſtles, or ſomething noted in them. <q>4. Their reſolving Doubts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Miſtakes, are of great Advantage to our Knowledg and Practice. 5. The great Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith are dropt here and there,</q> [He has cited ſome ſuch Paſſages in the Proof of his Propoſition].—<q>We ſhall find thoſe neceſſary Points beſt in the Preaching of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and the Apoſtles. 6. The Epiſtles, beſides the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of each of them, do in many places explain the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and that wiſely, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Accommodations to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of thoſe they were writ to.</q> Which he ſhows par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and that to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> alſo in the general Epiſtles. At length, <q>Theſe Holy Writers (ſaith he) <hi>inſpir'd from above</hi> writ nothing but Truth; and in moſt places very weighty Truths to us now;—But yet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93987:9"/>
every Sentence of theirs, muſt not be taken up and look'd upon as a Fundamental neceſſary to Salvation, without an <hi>explicite</hi> Belief, whereof no Body could be a Member of Chriſt's Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For (ſaith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 299.) 'tis plain, the contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on one ſide or t'other, are ignorant of, nay, disbelieve the Truths deliver'd in Holy Writ, as I noted before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This little I have tranſcribed out of our Author for the ſake of thoſe, who perhaps have not his Book, but have Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s, and that it may appear how <hi>unfairly</hi> (to ſay no worſe) Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> deals with our Author, ſaying, pag. 111. <hi>He paſſes by theſe inſpired Writings with ſome contempt;</hi> alſo he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts his inſincerity to the Reader. But I have ſeen a Letter from a Gentleman of no ordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſays,—<q>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has not only miſtook Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> but abus'd and belied him: for he ſays, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> cites only the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> but declares (or inſinuates) his contempt of the Epiſtles, as if they were not of like Authority with the Acts or Goſpels; but Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> has no where intimated any ſuch Opinion. His Book <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> ſhows, He has read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with very great Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as Judgment; he ſuffers nothing to eſcape him, that belongs to the Subject he manages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He names our Author Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> which I am aſſured he does by common Fame and Conjecture; he has no other Grounds for it, as neither have I, no more than Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi> Whether we are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken or not in his Name I know not, but I think I have proved that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> is much miſtaken in his Judgment concerning his Book, or has perverſly cenſur'd him and it. He is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the Epiſtles, (as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> accuſes him) that whoever will take the Pains to reckon, he will find he has quoted them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to them near FOURSCORE times. And Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> is no leſs Injurious in his Cenſures upon other Writers: <hi>In the very Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Doctrine it ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there ſeems to be an Atheiſtical Tang.</hi> For proof, he cites the <hi>Conſiderations on the Explications of Doct. of Trin.</hi> pag. 5. Where (ſaith he) <hi>the Self-exiſtence of God, which is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Fundamental, and Eſſential Property—of the Deity, is peremptorily pronounc'd by them to be a CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRADICTION.</hi> It's ſtrange a Man of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, ſhould give forth ſuch a Calumny. His Ldp. of <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſays, <hi>If God was from Eternity, he muſt be from himſelf.</hi> That Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor anſwers, that <hi>that is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing the Cauſe of the Atheiſts,</hi> and he gives this Reaſon; <hi>If God is from Eternity, he muſt be of none; neither of (or from) himſelf, nor from any other; not from himſelf, for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93987:10"/>
then he muſt be before he was; and neither from himſelf, nor from any other, becauſe all Origination of what kind ſoever is inconſiſtent with an Eternal Being.</hi> Is this now pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to pronounce, that the <hi>Self-exiſtence</hi> of God is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? or is it not to vindicate the Self-exiſtence of God from a falſe Notion of it, occaſion'd by the Biſhop's words? But what will Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſay to the Author of the XXVIII Propoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (who, they ſay, is the Biſhop of <hi>Glouc.)</hi> who peremptorily denies, nay ſays, <hi>It is a flat Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſay that the ſecond and third Perſons</hi> (of the Trinity) <hi>are Self-exiſtent?</hi> (Prop. 8.) Conſequently neither of them is <hi>God:</hi> becauſe (as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays) <hi>Self-exiſtence is the Primary, Fundamental, and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Property of God,</hi> which yet neither the Son nor the H. Ghoſt have. I wiſh Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> would either reconcile himſelf to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or the Biſhop to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he charges an <hi>Atheiſtical Tang</hi> upon the Socinian Doctrine, upon account of the denial of God's Self-exiſtence, which he may ſee ſtrongly affirm'd in the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the ſaid Propoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Socinus</hi>'s denying the Praeſcience of Contingencies, I am not, nor is our Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it; but which is more diſhonourable to God, to be the Author of all the Sin and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that ever was, or ever will be in the World; or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Fore-knowledge of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that which is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ſuch an Immenſity of God, which makes him to be eſſentially and wholly in every point of Space; becauſe ſuch Immenſity would take away all Diſtinction between God and Creature, and has indeed an <hi>Atheiſtical Tang;</hi> for the greater part of Atheiſts hold the Univerſe to be God; hence <hi>Lucan, Jupiter eſt quodcun<expan>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> which gives Excellency to all his other Attributes: for were Self-exiſtence, Omniſcience, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity and Spirituality, and all other Attributes common to more than One; where would the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Majeſty of God's Name be?

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93987:10"/>
and Strength, when there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that require it and have as equal right to it as he? But Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> will count himſelf highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, if I charge him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God's Unity: but hold a little, be not angry; If you be, Take heed it be not more for your own ſake, than for God's ſake: Do you not ſay, that <hi>the infinite Nature of God is communicable to three diſtinct Perſons?</hi> pag. 79. <hi>and</hi> pag. 120. <hi>That the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are one God, or Divine Nature?</hi> Are not theſe Terms convertible? namely, That one God is Father, Son and H. Ghoſt, that is, three Perſons? and what are three Almighty and only wiſe Perſons, but three Gods? The Father is one God, the Son is one God diſtinct from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt is one God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father and Son. Thus your Propoſition amounts to this, That one God is three Gods, that the Unity of God is a <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Gods. That <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> or <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is no longer an Attribute of God, but <hi>Trinity</hi> or <hi>Threeneſs.</hi> But we cannot be heard, let us make out your Contradictions never ſo clearly: nay, you impute it to us as a heinous Crime, that we make it an Argument againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of your Trinity, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. You impute to us moſt injuriouſly, that <hi>we are to admit of nothing but what is exactly adjuſted to Nature's and Reaſon's Light,</hi> pag. 68. That <hi>therefore the Trinity is a Doctrine that can't be born, becauſe it can't be underſtood,</hi> pag. 69. and that <hi>the Engliſh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians declare they cannot believe it, becauſe Reaſon does not teach it,</hi> pag. 72. This is a Topick the Trinitarians do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inlarge upon, and urge with a great deal of Pomp in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Ignominy in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, as Perſons that prefer their own Reaſonings before Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation how clear ſoever. And though this Calumny has been anſwer'd and wip'd away, and retorted upon them a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Times, yet Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> will ſtill confidently charge it. He cites the Letter of Reſolution for proof of it, and therefore has read it, but paſſes by the Anſwer to this Imputation, which is to be found in the very firſt Page of it, where thus; <q>Firſt, 'Tis not true, that we prefer Reaſon before Revelation; on the contrary, Revelation being what <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf hath ſaid, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or by inſpired Perſons; 'tis to be preferr'd before the cleareſt Demonſtration of our Reaſon.</q> And in the <hi>Conſider. on Explic. on</hi> 4 <hi>Serm.</hi> and a Sermon of the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Author ſays: <q>He utterly miſtakes in thinking that we deny the Articles of the new Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Athanaſian Religion, becauſe they are Myſteries, or becauſe we do not comprehend them; we have a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93987:11"/>
                  <hi>Perception,</hi> that they are not Myſteries but Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Impoſſibilities, and pure Non-ſenſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now that the Trinitarians do moſt expreſly prefer their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, Conſequences and wire-drawn Deductions before Holy Scripture; beſides that it has been done in the Notes upon the Athanaſian Creed, and other Tracts, I ſhall ſhew further from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but now recited; if at leaſt the Trinitarians will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him for their Orthodox Champion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's manifeſt he means by the one God, not one Divine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Perſon, but three ſuch; but nothing is more evident in Holy Scripture, than that God is one Perſon only. For proof of it, I have referr'd my Reader to the Scriptures from beginning to end, in more than twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Texts, even as often as God is ſpoken of, or to, or ſpeaks of himſelf (except as I have ſaid). But Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays expreſly, that his God is <hi>three diſtinct Divine Perſons,</hi> to wit, the Father of the Son, the Son of the Father, and the H. Ghoſt which proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. 2. He ſays, that <hi>theſe three diſtinct Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> [each of which is God in the moſt perfect Senſe] <hi>is the only true God, or the one God, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</hi> The Propoſition which he advances, as <hi>neceſſary to Salvation, and more eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> than that Jeſus is the Meſſiah, is, <hi>That the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are one God, or Divine Nature.</hi> Whereby it's manifeſt, that by <hi>ONE GOD</hi> he means not <hi>one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but <hi>one Divine Nature;</hi> and by one Divine Nature he means ſuch a Divine Nature as is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to three diſtinct Perſons,</hi> ſee pag. 79. So that his three Perſons which are one God, are <hi>ſo</hi> one God as they communicate in <hi>one Divine Nature;</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are <hi>one Man,</hi> becauſe they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in one Human Nature, as do alſo all the Men in the World. Now I ſhall cite ſome Texts of H. Scripture, which do expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that God is ONE; and that cannot otherwiſe be underſtood than that he is one Perſon, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular intellectual Nature, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Subſtance. Here let me premiſe firſt, How <hi>Equivocally</hi> Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> and the Trinitarians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves in this great and neceſſary Point, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our Eternal Salvation; and whereby the <hi>Bulk of Mankind</hi> (for I think that's a far more decent Phraſe than Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s <hi>Rabble,</hi> or <hi>Captain</hi> Tom <hi>and his Myrmadons,</hi> or <hi>the venerable Mob)</hi> cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape being deluded. He and they confeſs alſo, that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> though three Perſons in that one God; but by <hi>one God</hi> they do not mean (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. <hi>Edw.) one ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93987:11"/>
Nature, Eſſence, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance compleat, for that is a Perſon; and if they did, the Contradiction would preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to every Capacity, to wit, that three Divine Perſons are one Divine Perſon; but they (as Mr. <hi>Edw.)</hi> ſay, <hi>The Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, or the three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are one God, or Divine Nature, Eſſence or Subſtance.</hi> Hereby they conceal from their poor honeſt Reader, thirſting after Truth, that God is one <hi>intellectual</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Nature, Eſſence or Subſtance, and make him believe by that concealment, that though there are three Divine <hi>intellectual</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Natures, yet there is but <hi>one</hi> Divine Nature or <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am alſo willing to premiſe, that the Greciſm of a ſolitary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Maſculine, or Article without a Subſtantive (where the Diſcourſe is of intellectual Beings) doth frequently, if not always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note PERSON; and our Engliſh Tranſlators have in many Texts render'd it <hi>Perſon,</hi> as the clear Senſe of the Greek Text, not as a word ſupplied in another Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to explain the Text, but in the ſame Character as a verbal Tranſlation.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Scriptures do ſo clearly prove, that <hi>God is a Perſon,</hi> or a perfect intellectual Nature or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that he is <hi>only one</hi> ſuch; that to deny either of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, is to me to deny the Truth of Holy Scripture, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome obſcure and doubtful Text, but in the Current of it, and in the chief Fundamental of all Religion. And Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> in aſſerting there are three ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one Divine Nature, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in effect the whole Bible void and uſeleſs for the proof of any Propoſition whatſoever it be. If this, that God is an abſolutely perfect Being, and therefore a Perſon, (for Perſons are the moſt perfect of Beings or Subſtances) and but one ſuch, cannot be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undeniably prov'd from Scripture, it's utterly in vain to attempt to prove any thing. For it's manifeſt that to aſſert THIS, is the chief Aim and Deſign of all the Holy Writers, and that they are moſt zealous and vehement in it. And herein lies the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between the Trinitarians and the Unitarians; we aſſert with the greateſt plainneſs, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93987:13"/>
fulneſs, and clearneſs of Holy Scripture, as ever any thing was or can be expreſt, that God is ONE in the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> ſenſe of Oneneſs, (which is by all Men that underſtand the Word) in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Senſe. But the Trinitarians do on the contrary contend, that God is <hi>not One,</hi> but <hi>Three</hi> in that perſonal Senſe, and One in a leſs perfect Senſe; which is not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, but common to many: Which is a Senſe that dethrones God, and makes him either <hi>a Third</hi> of the one God, or <hi>one of the Three,</hi> that created and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World, and is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd by Men and Angels. For they cannot deny but that in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Father our God, we worſhip one God; But they rage againſt us, becauſe we do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip beſides him, and diſtinct from him, <hi>the Son</hi> as perfectly God as he; as different from him as a real Son is from a real Father, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon as really God as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father, or the Son, and as really different from the Father and Son, as he that is ſent is from him that ſent him. And this is ſo evidently true, that (as I have obſerv'd) almoſt one half of the Trinitarians conſent with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians, in condemning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party of Trinitarians as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of three Gods.</p>
            <p>But that I may give yet fuller Evidence of this Fundamental Truth of the Unity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God againſt the Trinity of Perſons in him, I ſhall in the third place produce ſome Texts that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſome Perfections to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God ſingularly, and with excluſion of all other Perſons in that Senſe and Degree. Such are thoſe, where the Holy Jeſus ſays, <hi>None</hi> [or no Perſon] <hi>is good but one, the God,</hi> which I have urged before: and that in <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. where the Bleſſed Son in his Prayer to God, (wherein it were abſurd to ſay that he pray'd to himſelf) calls him <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>the only true God;</hi> and that in diſtinction from himſelf, whom he deſcribes by the Names of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> him <hi>whom the Father hath ſent.</hi> This Particle <hi>only,</hi> imports ſome Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the Attribute of <hi>true,</hi> which is here given to God his Father, above and with excluſion of all others, or it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Rom. 16. 27. <hi>To God only Wiſe</hi> be Glory <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi> Here again the Attribute of <hi>only Wiſe</hi> is aſcrib'd to the Perſon of God in diſtinction from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Glory which is given to the only Wiſe God. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16. God is called, <hi>the bleſſed and ONLY Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; who ONLY hath Immortality,</hi> &amp;c. which are all perſonal Titles, from which all other Perſons are excluded by the excluſive Particle <hi>only:</hi> for there can be but one Potentate who is King of Kings in the higheſt Senſe, and much more when <hi>only</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93987:13"/>
is added. When Chriſt is called <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, (Rev.</hi> 17. 14. and 19. 16.) it's manifeſt it's to be underſtood in a derivative Senſe, becauſe all Power in Heaven and Earth was given to him as the Lamb that had been ſlain; and therefore he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as clothed with a Veſture dipt in Blood, in that 19 <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Who only hath Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> that is, (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays) <hi>God is Immortal in himſelf,</hi> (not in three Selfs) <hi>and all Immortality of others is derived from him.</hi> In the ſame Senſe is the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty called, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>only Holy,</hi> becauſe he only is Holy of himſelf; and as it is underſtood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>There is none Holy as the Lord.</hi> Now in theſe and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Paſſages of Holy Scripture, the Trinitarians and Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> muſt underſtand by <hi>God</hi> three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; by <hi>Father,</hi> the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; by <hi>Thou,</hi> Ye; by <hi>Him,</hi> Them; by <hi>Himſelf,</hi> Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thoſe Words the Scripture hath in the ſingular Number, muſt be underſtood by them plurally. It's no marvel then that they call their Doctrine a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and that there is ſo much diſſenſion among themſelves concerning it, ſince it cannot be underſtood in any Senſe, which is not either contradictious in it ſelf, or <hi>ſo</hi> to the full Current of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>In like manner, <hi>4thly,</hi> all thoſe Texts (which are not a few) in which God is named <hi>the moſt High, the moſt high God, the Lord the moſt High, God moſt High, the Higheſt;</hi> whether theſe Titles be Subject or Attribute, muſt all be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not of one Perſon, or <hi>a ſingular knowing and willing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> but either of a Subſtance that is not a Perſon, or elſe of three equal Perſons: And all this by virtue of that ſcholaſtic and unreaſonable Diſtinction between <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Eſſence;</hi> or as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> words it, <hi>The infinite Nature of God communicable to three diſtinct Perſons, (Pag.</hi> 79.) which Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being abſurd in it ſelf when underſtood, they obtrude upon the World under the Name of <hi>MYSTERY</hi> and <hi>Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Beſides, that the Holy Scriptures are ſo abundant in thoſe Texts that clearly ſhew him to be <hi>one Perſon only,</hi> as I have fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; yet I may ſtill urge from the ſame Texts and others, that the Father only, whom the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians acknowledg to be but one Perſon, is <hi>that God, that God alone, that one God, that God who is One, the moſt high God,</hi> and no Perſon elſe beſides him. I produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text in <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. to prove that the Perfection of being THE ONLY TRUE GOD, is aſcrib'd to him as being one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only. Now I urge from the ſame Text, that that Perſon is the Father of the Son, in expreſs diſtinction from the Son and all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93987:14"/>
others. Next, that Text in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. <hi>Though there be that are called Gods, whether in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or in Earth, (as there be Gods many, and Lords many); but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom were all things, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> Which words do plainly aſſert, that that Perſon who is the one God of Chriſtians in excluſion of all thoſe that are called <hi>Gods,</hi> (and in ſome Senſe may be ſo) is none but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in diſtinction from the Lord Jeſus, who was made Lord and Chriſt in a moſt excellent manner, after his Reſurrection. This Text muſt be underſtood by the Trinitarians thus; <hi>There is none other God but three Almighty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:—There are Gods many, and Lords many, but unto us [Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans] there is but one God or Divine Nature, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost;</hi> each of which is the <hi>one God of Christians,</hi> and not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only. See next <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Spirit—one Lord—one God and Father of all.</hi> Where the one God and Father of all is clearly differenced from the one Spirit and the one Lord. Now ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>But of that Day and Hour knoweth none</hi> [or no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon] (for of neceſſity it muſt be ſo underſtood) <hi>no not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath it<hi>—neither the Son, but the Father.</hi> Theſe parallel Texts prove, 1. That the Perſon of the Father is the Perſon of God; for none but that Perſon could then know the Day and Hour of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And, 2. that the Father only is that Perſon of God in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all other Perſons, both Angels and Men, and of the Son himſelf. What ſhall we ſay of them, who in flat Contradiction to this Scripture, and the Son him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, aſſert, That the Son knew the Day and Hour of Judgment as well as the Father? Let us next compare that Paſſage in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. (which I cited before) with 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. The former ſaith, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Christ Jeſus.</hi> The latter ſays, <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Christ the Righteous.</hi> By which conſider'd together, it appears that the <hi>one God and the Father</hi> are the ſame Perſon, for only a Perſon is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being interceded to, and the Mediator and Advocate the ſame: So that the Father is the Perſon of God, as well as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate is the Perſon of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But if the Reader deſire to ſee this Point <hi>(viz.</hi> that the Father only is the moſt high God) fully and learnedly argued and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him read <hi>Crellius</hi>'s two Books of <hi>One God the Father,</hi> out of which I have tranſcribed much. In what a many Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Chriſt called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God? In every of which either
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93987:14"/>
God muſt be taken for the Father only, or Chriſt muſt be the Son of himſelf, and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of himſelf, both which are abſurd.</p>
            <p>Again, how many places of Holy Scripture are there, where ſome Prerogative is given to the Father above Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. <hi>My Father is greater than I?</hi> How aſham'd are the more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Trinitarians of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to this Objection againſt the Deity of the Son, which ſays, <hi>The Son was leſs according to his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature?</hi> John 10. 29. <hi>My Father is greater than all.</hi> It's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the Context, that the Son himſelf is included in that word ALL. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>The Head of Chriſt is God.</hi> Chriſt is not the Head of himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father only is God. How often do Chriſt and the Divine Writers call the Father his God? <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. I aſcend to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your Father, to my God and your God. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. he calls the Father <hi>my God</hi> four times. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. and <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 34. he cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> His God was only the Perſon of the Father, and not God the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which according to Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> is common to three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17.—The God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. Where Chriſt is called a God, he is alſo ſaid to have a God, who anointed him. Was he his own God, and the God that anointed him? or was the Father only? <hi>John</hi> 10. 18. <hi>This Commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> He only is God who gives Commandments to the Son. John 12. 49. <hi>The Father that ſent me, he gave me a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi> John 14. 31. <hi>As the Father hath given me Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo I do.</hi> John 15. 10. <hi>As I have kept my Father's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and abide in his Love.</hi> See Chap. 4. 34. and 6. 38. and 8. 29, 55. and 17. 4. and 18. 11. Add thoſe places wherein it's clearly taught that Chriſt obey'd God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>God calleth Chriſt his Servant, Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 5, 6. with <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 47. <hi>Iſa.,</hi> 2. 13. and 53. 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 23, 24. and 37. 24, 25. He is called<hi>—a Miniſter of the Sanctuary,</hi> Heb. 8. 2. All theſe Texts, and a hundred more (ſay the Trinitarians) are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Diſtinction of <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Nature in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or the ſecond Perſon of God his having a Human Nature: So you are to underſtand that this Perſon of God, who is here ſaid to be a Servant, to receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and obey them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is yet as perfectly Great as he, from whom he receiv'd thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who has no Prerogative above him. The Servant is as great as his Lord, and he that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd as he that Commanded, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93987:15"/>
he that is ſent as he that ſent him; yea, the ſame God is Servant and Lord, the Obeyer and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, the Sent and the Sender. When all theſe Prerogatives of the Father above the Son, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently above the Holy Spirit, will not prove the Father only to be the moſt High God; of what uſe can the Holy Scriptures be to us? What ſhall be the Difference between Holy Scriptures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Writings? May not all the Greek Fables of their Gods, be juſtified by the ſame, or ſuch like Diſtinctions? O Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, enlighten their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and remove their Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may no longer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thee the Glory due to thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all!</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be paſſed by, that to the Father only is aſcrib'd in Holy Scripture, the Creation of Heaven and Earth, to Chriſt never; though in a certain way of ſpeaking, common to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers, many things, or all pertaining to the new Covenant or Goſpel, are ſaid to be created (that is, medelled or put into a new and better State) by him. So in that antient Confeſſion of Faith, call'd, <hi>The Apoſtles Creed,</hi> the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Heaven and Earth is appropriated to the Father; and both in thoſe Apoſtolical Times, and to this day, Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are offer'd to the Father through-Chriſt, and the Gift of the Holy Spirit is begg'd of him; which clearly ſhews the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Father above the Son and Holy Spirit; and conſequently that he only is that Perſon, whom we ought to underſtand by the Name of GOD.</p>
            <p>In fine, The God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the God of the Fathers, and the Father of Chriſt, are Deſcriptions of one and the ſame Perſon: So <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 13.<hi>—The God of our Fathers hath glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son Jeſus:</hi> and Heb. 1. 1. <hi>God who—ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath—ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi> So that they who make the Son to be the God of the Fathers, make him to be <hi>his own God</hi> and Father.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I think it may give farther Light and Evidence to this great Point, wherein the Glory of God, even the Father, is ſo much concern'd; I will yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhow from many plain Texts, ſet ſo as they may give Light one to another; that the God of the Fathers, and the God and Father of Chriſtians; or <hi>our</hi> God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the God and Father of our Lord Chriſt; our Heavenly Father and his Heavenly Father; his God and our God, is one and the ſame Perſon. I preſent them by Couples, the firſt ſpeaking of Chriſt, the ſecond of us.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6. That ye may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Thus we ſee there is one God and Father of all <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 4. 6.) both of Chriſt, and Believers the Children of God; the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the God and Father of both. It's abſurd to ſay, that Chriſt the Son is his own Father, or his own God; ſo it's plainly contrary to Scripture to ſay, that any other Perſon is our God or our Father (in the higheſt Senſe) but the ſame who is Chriſt's God and Father. That it is ſo, I appeal to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thoughts of every Man and Woman that reads the Scriptures attentively, without the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Scholaſtick and confus'd Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall further produce you many couples of Scriptures, which prove expreſly, that the Name of GOD (when taken by way of Excellency) and the Name of FATHER (in Chriſt's Goſpel) do ſignify the ſame ſingular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that no one is or can be <hi>God,</hi> who is not alſo the <hi>Father;</hi> which Term is acknowledged to ſignify but one Perſon. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Scripture, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the ſending of Chriſt, or the Son, ſometimes to God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Father, and both fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only that God and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the ſame Perſon, and that the ſame is as plainly diſtinguiſht from our Lord Chriſt, as the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is diſtinct from him that is <hi>ſent;</hi> but that the Son is no more the ſame God that ſent him, than he is the ſame Father that ſent him.</p>
            <p>If Chriſtians will ſtill ſuffer themſelves to be impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under the Notion of <hi>MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERY,</hi> to believe that the Son of God is the ſame numerical God as his Father, who ſent him to do his Will, (not his own) and to be the <hi>Propitiation</hi> (or Mercy-ſeat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 5.) for our Sins; that the <hi>only begotten</hi> or well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, whom the Father (firſt) <hi>ſanctified and</hi> (then) <hi>ſent into the World,</hi> is the ſame God who ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93987:17"/>
and ſent him, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Works which the Son did, did bear witneſs, not that the Father even God had ſent him, but that the Son was that God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhould no longer pretend, that their Faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, in what is neceſſary to eternal Life, is clearly and plainly reveal'd in Holy Scripture, but that they have learnt it by Tradition from their Teachers, which yet they can no more conceive the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, without contradiction to Scripture and Reaſon, than the Papiſts can their Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which they alſo believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Myſtery.</hi> Let none ſay there is a wide Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Faith of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts in theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe Tranſubſtantiation is contradicted by Senſe, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity only by Reaſon; for I appeal to any Man of Senſe, whether we may not be as certain that one Perſon is not three Perſons, nor three Perſons one Perſon, as that Bread is not Fleſh. If Proteſtants think themſelves excuſable in <hi>that,</hi> let them not for ſhame blame the Papiſts in this. And if both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts are faultleſs in theſe Points, I ſee not but the Heathen Polytheiſts will be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſame Charity.</p>
            <p>The New Teſtament Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſo full of thoſe clear Diſtinctions, and oppoſite Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Works of <hi>God,</hi> from the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that a Man muſt in a manner tranſcribe the whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume to preſent them all. I have given my Reader a great number of Texts already; I will yet point him to ſome more, which he may read at his leiſure. See then 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 9 to 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>John</hi> 6. 69. <hi>John</hi> 5. 26, 27. <hi>As the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, and hath given him Authority to execute Judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> The Son of God had not this Life in himſelf, till it was given him by the Living God his Father, not becauſe he was God, but becauſe he was the Son of Man. But what Ears can hear, that Life and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were given by the ſame God the Father, to the very ſame God the Son? Or that any Life and Authority could be given to him that was God, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from all Eternity, all Life and Authority in himſelf, and could never be without it? But I am pointing you to ſome Texts of Scripture. Read alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 3, 29, 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5, 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 21, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 15. Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God [not that he is that God whoſe Son he is] God dwelleth in him and he in God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>John</hi> 5. 18.

2 <hi>John ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 13. Theſe Texts do undeniably prove, that God is one Perſon only, to wit, the Father of the Son; and as the Son cannot be his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo neither that God who is his Father. But I proceed, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 33. and 16. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 1. <hi>John</hi> 1. 34. and 20. 31. Theſe are written that ye may believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have Life through his Name. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> did not write his Goſpel (as ſome pretend) to prove that Jeſus was God, who was his Father, but that he was the Chriſt, or a Man anointed with the Holy Ghoſt and Power, the Son of that God who anointed him; and that ſo believing we might have Life through him. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 22. <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. and 3. 18, 29. and 14. 28. and 15. 10. and 20. 17.</p>
            <p>Againſt all theſe Scriptures, and many more that might be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it's urged that the Son is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called <hi>God</hi> [or rather <hi>a God]</hi> in Scripture. To which I anſwer, that both Angels and Men are called <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Gods,</hi> and Sons of God in Scripture; ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 1.<hi>—I have made thee</hi> [Moſes] <hi>a God to</hi> Pharaoh. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 16. compar'd with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2, 5. an Angel is called <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohim;</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>the Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. <hi>Thou haſt made him</hi> [Man] <hi>a little lower than the Angels;</hi> in Hebrew, <hi>than the Gods.</hi> And Judg. 13. 22. <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaid—We ſhall ſurely die, becauſe we have ſeen <hi>God;</hi> ſo he calls the Angel that appeared to him. But the word <hi>God</hi> taken by way of Eminency for the Father of all, ſignifies alſo <hi>the God of Gods,</hi> Deut. 10. 17. Joſhua 22. 22. Pſal. 136. 2, <hi>&amp;c. The moſt high God,</hi> Gen. 14. 18. Heb. 7. 1. And the Lord Jeſus being ſtoned and charged with Blaſphemy by the Jews, for ſaying, that he and his Father were <hi>one,</hi> as we read <hi>John</hi> 10. 29, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Authority of that Text, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. where it's Divinely written, <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> ſpeaking of the Judges and Princes, who receiv'd their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power from God; <hi>and all of you Sons of the moſt High:</hi> and argues from it thus, <hi>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent into the World, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am THE SON of God?</hi> Which is in effect to ſay, I may with far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er right than they, be called a <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>the Son of God,</hi> who have received from God far greater Authority and Power; being ſanctified to ſuch a Degree, and ſent among Men to preach ſuch a Doctrine and Work, ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Works, as plainly ſhew, that the <hi>Father is in me, and I in him;</hi> that is, there is ſuch a cloſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93987:18"/>
Union between us, as if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwelt in me, and did the Works which I do, (dwelling as it were in him) and which cannot be done by any other Power. Whence I argue, that if in any Text of Scripture, Jeſus is ſaid to be God or a God, (tho he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never ſaid he was God; <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſeipſe Deum dixit,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Lactantius)</hi> it is to be underſtood of that Godlike Power, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Glory, which God his Father has conferr'd upon him; for which he is to be honoured as the Father who ſent him, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him, who raiſed him from the Dead, and ſet him at his own Right Hand. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8, 9. where in the Words ſpoken of <hi>Solomon, Pſal.</hi> 45. he is called <hi>God,</hi> he is ſaid to have a God above him, who anointed him. Let them conſider who ſay, the Son is <hi>God</hi> in the ſame ſenſe as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how they can clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Blaſphemy. Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons look upon the Unitarians with Amazement and Horrour, becauſe they will not take the term <hi>God</hi> in that Senſe as themſelves do: <hi>What! Deny Chriſt to be God, ſo expreſly ſpoken of him in Holy Scripture!</hi> In the mean time, they do not reflect upon themſelves, who make to themſelves (by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Scripture in another Senſe than Chriſt underſtood it in) another God beſides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who only is the true God. The Unitarians acknowledg and celebrate <hi>one God</hi> the Father, the Trinitarians do ſo too, but they alſo acknowledg and celebrate <hi>two other Perſons,</hi> each of which is God in the ſame ſenſe as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither of which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which of us are ſafer, and in leſs danger of being Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and worſhippers of more Gods than one?</p>
            <p>There's nothing more manifeſt in Holy Scripture, than that the only true God hath given to the Son both his Being, and all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that he enjoys; he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him to his Right Hand, given him all Power in Heaven and in Earth, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> exalted <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt; only in the Throne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I be greater than thou.</hi> But the Trinitarians will not ſuffer the Father to enjoy that Privilege; They are aſham'd of that Son of God (and his words) who is not as great as his Father; though he ſaid, <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi> They are aſham'd of his words, who ſaid, <hi>Of that Day and Hour—knoweth none, not the Son, but the Father only:</hi> and ſay in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to him, <hi>The Son did know that Day and Hour as well as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not the Father only.</hi> They are aſham'd of his Words who ſaid, <hi>I can do nothing of my ſelf; I came not to do my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me; my Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me; I—do nothing of my ſelf, but as the Father hath taught me I ſpeak theſe things; I have not ſpoken
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93987:18"/>
of my ſelf, but the Father that ſent me, he gave me a Commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak; The word that I ſpeak, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father that abideth in me he doth the Works.</hi> Theſe and many other Words and Sayings of the ſame kind, they ſeem to be aſham'd of, and ſay, and contend for it, that he could do all things of himſelf, that he came to do his own Will, that his Doctrine was his own, that he had no need of the Father's teaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are aſhamed of thoſe words of Chriſt's; Mat. 19. 17. <hi>Why doſt thou call me good? none is good but one, the God;</hi> and ſay none is good but <hi>Three,</hi> God and God and God, or Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Here let me obſerve to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as I have hinted above) that there is a conſiderable Difference between that particle <hi>one</hi> in this Text, and the ſame particle <hi>one</hi> in that ſuppoſititious Text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. Theſe three are <hi>one;</hi> for here <hi>one</hi> is of the Neuter Gender, as is manifeſt both in the Greek and Latin, and fignifies as the ſame word does in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>He that planteth and he that watereth are one:</hi> but in the Text above, <hi>one</hi> is of the Maſculine Gender, and muſt be underſtood of one Perſon (or intelligent Being) who is good, and none but he, to wit, <hi>the God.</hi> If they were not hinder'd by ſtrong Preiudices, they might eaſily ſee, that whatſoever they attribute to the Son, be it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal neceſſary Exiſtence, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, or Omniſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they take away from the Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not only the Glory of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Divine Excellencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but alſo the Glory of his free Goodneſs, and the Son's, and our Thankfulneſs for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefits both to him and us, as he has been graciouſly pleas'd to give unto the Son, either in begetting him, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him up in Time, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding him both for his and our Good. Nay, they make the Son uncapable of receiving thoſe great and glorious Rewards, of <hi>all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Heaven and Earth</hi> given to him, of an <hi>everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> of a <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> of exaltation <hi>to the Right Hand of God,</hi> and the like, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of: For how could any of theſe Bleſſings be given to him that was God always, even from Eternity? Could God ſit at the Right Hand of God in any ſenſe whatever? Theſe are the abſurd Doctrines, which make the Trinitarians contend ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one with another, and with us. God will judg the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us, <hi>by that Man whom he has ordained to be Judg of the Dead and Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Texts that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for the Son's being called <hi>God;</hi> that in <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. I have ſpoken of already, as alſo that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93987:19"/>
in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. That in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. is read without the word <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Syriac,</hi> and in the Writings of St. <hi>Cyprian, Hilary</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom;</hi> whereby it's probable it was not originally in that Text. But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> acknowledges <hi>that</hi> for a good Reading, which points the Clauſe ſo as to render it a Thankſgiving to the Father thus, <hi>The God over all be bleſſed for ever,</hi> to wit, for his Benefits in raiſing up Chriſt of the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it ſeems to have been ſo read by ſome of the Antients, for they reckon it among the Hereſies to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt was God over all,</hi> as <hi>Origen contr. Celſ.</hi> and others. In 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. The word <hi>God</hi> is not found but in very few Greek Copies; and if it be read there, admits of a good Senſe, without making God to die, who only hath Immortality. As alſo doth that Text in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. which may be render'd, Feed the Church of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> hath purchaſed with the Blood of his own Son; but the truer Reading according to the <hi>Syriac,</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and moſt antient Greek Bibles, is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtead of <hi>God.</hi> Moſt of the Antient Fathers read <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Lord.</hi> Thoſe words in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 21. <hi>This is the true God,</hi> which ſome refer to the Son, are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be refer'd to the Father, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by <hi>him that is true,</hi> through his Son Jeſus. <hi>This</hi> [He that is true] (whoſe Son Chriſt is) <hi>is the true God.</hi> Laſtly, They urge that in <hi>John</hi> 20. 28. where <hi>Thomas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced by the clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Senſes, that Chriſt was riſen from the Dead, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto him, <hi>My Lord and my God:</hi> which words, whether they are words of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, reſpecting God that raiſed him from the Dead, or him that was raiſed to be a Prince and Saviour <hi>(Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31.) a Lord and a God; the term <hi>God</hi> cannot ſignify in this latter ſenſe, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a God or Chriſt, made ſo by Reſurrection. 'Tis a clear Caſe, that the Evangeliſt could not intend by theſe words, to teach us that Jeſus was <hi>God,</hi> when he tells in the laſt Verſe, that they and his whole Book were written, <hi>That we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the SON of God, and that believing we might have Life through his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have inſiſted long upon this Point of the Oneneſs of God, partly becauſe it is a Matter of the higheſt Moment in Religion; partly to ſhew, that if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>had a Deſign</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays he had) <hi>to exclude the Belieſ of the Trinity</hi> (or Threeneſs of God) from being a Point neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, it was a Pious and Chriſtian Deſign; and that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> has been ſo far from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any thing to prove that Faith to be ſo neceſſary, that he has not proved it a true Doctrine; but on the contrary, I have proved it to be falſe, and highly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93987:19"/>
to the ever-bleſſed God and Father of Chriſt, contrary to the clear and full Current of Scripture, obſcuring the true Glory of Chriſt, and very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Peace and Hope of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But after all, whether our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is of my mind in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or whether he believes that the Doctrine of three coequal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Perſons is a Truth, but not Fundamental, I cannot determine: but methinks Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding him <hi>all over Socinianiz'd</hi> in this Point, is done upon ſuch Grounds, as will argue the Holy Evangeliſts to be alſo <hi>Socinians:</hi> for he ſays, <hi>This Writer interprets</hi> the Son of God <hi>to be no more than the Meſſiah:</hi> and I am much perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whoever ſhall read the Goſpels with any attention, will find the Holy Writers to be of the ſame Mind; and our Author has fully prov'd it in his Book, but more particularly from <hi>pag.</hi> 48. to 61. and <hi>pag.</hi> 95. Yea the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Evangeliſts in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of one and the ſame Story alone may do it; for what in <hi>Matthew</hi> is expreſt by, <hi>Thou art the Meſſiah the Son of the Living God,</hi> chap. 16. 16. the ſame is in <hi>Mark,</hi> Chap. 8. 29. <hi>Thou art the Meſſiah;</hi> and in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 18. <hi>The Meſſiah of God.</hi> And if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1. with <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. you will eaſily ſee the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God,</hi> are Terms of the ſame Import. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the very word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Chriſt ſignifying <hi>Anointed,</hi> and ſo interpreted in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>John</hi> 1. 41. is in the <hi>49th verſe,</hi> underſtood by <hi>Nathanael</hi> to be <hi>the Son of God, the King of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. For the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Letter and Type, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Kings by Anointing; hence God is ſaid <hi>to anoint</hi> David <hi>King over</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2. he is called <hi>the Lord's Anointed;</hi> but in <hi>verſe</hi> 7. upon that very account, the Lord ſaid, <hi>Thou art MY SON, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> Now as the firſt and ſecond verſes of this Pſalm, are by the Apoſtles and Believers, applied to God's Holy Child [or Son] Jeſus, who as <hi>David</hi> is called <hi>the Lord's Chriſt,</hi> Acts 4. 25, 26, 27. ſo upon God's raiſing again of Jeſus to be a Prince and a Saviour, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does expreſly apply to him that glorious Proclamation in the <hi>7th</hi> verſe, ſaying, <hi>As it is alſo written in the ſecond</hi> Pſalm, <hi>Thou art MY SON, THIS DAY have I BEGOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEN THEE,</hi> Acts 13. 33. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 1. 4, 5. ſpeaking of the Son's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made better than the Angels,</hi> proves it from this, that <hi>God ſaid not at any time to any of them,</hi> as he did unto Jeſus, [in his Type <hi>David] Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee;</hi> and in his Type <hi>Solomon, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 14. Moreover we have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93987:20"/>
ſeen before, that our Lord vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to himſelf the Name of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by a Text out of the <hi>82d</hi> Pſalm, where the mighty Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Princes are called <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Sons of the moſt High,</hi> John 10.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſider'd, will I think juſtify our Author in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the <hi>Son of God</hi> to be no more than <hi>the Meſſiah,</hi> or will condemn the Divine Writers (if not the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf) in the ſame Crime.</p>
            <p>Another Evidence of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's being <hi>Socinian,</hi> is (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Edw.)</hi> that <hi>he expounds</hi> Joh. 14. 9, &amp;c. <hi>after the Antitrinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Mode, whereas generally Divines underſtand ſome part of thoſe words concerning the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> He ſays,<hi>—generally Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> &amp;c. By this mark thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that do not ſo interpret, muſt be <hi>Socinians:</hi> the <hi>Socinians</hi> owe Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> their thanks, for adding to their Number many Learned and able Divines; but I doubt thoſe Divines will not thank him for it. But Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> has Courage enough to call a moſt Learned and right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Wavering Prelate,</hi> and to bring in his Doctrine about Fundamentals, as favouring the Cauſes of Atheiſm, if he and thoſe other Divines agree not with him in their Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Another mark of Socinianiſm is, that our Author <hi>Makes Chriſt and</hi> Adam, <hi>to be the Sons of God—by their BIRTH, as the Racovians generally do.</hi> That they both make Chriſt to be the Son of God by his Birth, and that truly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Text of <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. cannot I think be denied by any that duly conſiders the Place; but that either the one or the other make <hi>Adam,</hi> who was never born to be <hi>ſo,</hi> in like manner by his <hi>Birth,</hi> is Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Blunder, and not their Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>I have not taken notice of the other Fundamentals which Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> reckons in his Syſtem, (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of which are not found in Holy Scripture, either Name or Thing, expreſly, or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) becauſe he inſiſts chiefly on the Doctrine of the Trinity; which however it is believed by Learned Men, to be in ſome ſenſe or other (they cannot agree in what ſenſe) a Truth; yet ſome of the moſt Learned of them do not believe it a Fundamental and neceſſary Truth, particularly Mr. <hi>Limborch</hi> (than whom this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Learned Age does not afford a more Learned and able Divine) could not defend Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in his moſt famous and weighty Diſputations againſt the Jews, without waving that Point; one of which we have in his <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Collatio cum erudito Judaeo,</hi> &amp;c. the ableſt Jew (I preſume) that ever wrote in Defence of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> againſt Chriſtianity. Another Conference I am informed we may hope ſhortly to ſee, in his Reduction of an eminent Perſon,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93987:20"/>
who was upon the Point of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Chriſtian Religion, and embracing for it that of the Jews at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when firſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Syſtemers had tried their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt skill and could not effect it. Perhaps Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> means him for one, when he ſays, our Author's <hi>Plauſible Conceit</hi> found <hi>reception (if it had not its birth) among ſome Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authors</hi> beſides <hi>Socinians,</hi> pag. 104. Indeed he had cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for Mr. <hi>Limborch</hi> tells the Jew expreſly (in the Book I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Pag.</hi> 218.) <hi>Quando exigitur fides in Jeſum Chriſtum, nuſquam in toto novo Teſtamento exigi ut credamus Jeſum eſſe ipſum Deum, ſed Jeſum eſſe Chriſtum, ſeu Meſſiam olim promiſſum, vel quod idem eſt, eſſe Filium Dei; quoniam appellationes Chriſti &amp; filii Dei inter ſe permutantur.</hi> 
               <q>When we are requir'd to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, we are no where in all the New Teſtament requir'd to believe that Jeſus is the very God, but that Jeſus is the Chriſt or the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was of old promiſed, or which is the ſame, that he is <hi>the Son of God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Appellations of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of <hi>Son of God</hi> are put one for another.</q> So that in Company of Mr. <hi>Limborch</hi> and other eminent Divines, as well as our Engliſh Biſhops and Doctors, our Author may ſtill believe the Doctrine of the Trinity to be a Truth, though not <hi>neceſſary, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to make one a Chriſtian,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p>But why does he make mention of only the Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one Reverend Doctor, and the foreign Divines and <hi>Socinians,</hi> as Favourers of this <hi>Plauſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, of making nothing neceſſary and Fundamental,</hi> but what is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDENTLY contain'd in Holy Scripture as ſuch;</hi> and ſo is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the apprehenſion of the Poor, that hear and read the Scriptures, making them alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ſaved, though they are either ignorant of, or do not believe aright thoſe Truths, which, though deliver'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are yet either hard to be underſtood, or difficultly infer'd, or have no mark of Fundamental, either in themſelves, or in Divine Revelation; and for thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot be made evident to the <hi>deſpiſed</hi> common People, which the Lord Jeſus came to ſave as well as the Learned? He might alſo have charg'd the ſixth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with this <hi>Plauſible Coneeit,</hi> which has ſo much <hi>Evil and Miſchief in it, tending to reduce the Catholick Faith to nothing,</hi> pag. 122. For that Article ſaith thus; <q>Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation, ſo that whatſoever is not <hi>read</hi> therein, nor may be <hi>proved thereby,</hi> is not to be required of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith.</q> Obſerve here,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93987:21"/>
that every neceſſary Article muſt be <hi>read</hi> expreſly, or at leaſt <hi>proved thereby,</hi> and to whom is this Proof to be made? even to the WEAK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST NODDLES of thoſe that are requir'd to believe it. Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is not one Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>venerable Mob,</hi> that (according to Mr. <hi>Edw.)</hi> can be ſaved, becauſe they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have the Article of <hi>the three Perſons that are one</hi> prov'd to them from Scripture; for it's evident the Learned, even of the Clergy, cannot prove it to one another, much leſs to vulgar Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (the ableſt Defender of <hi>the Religion of Proteſtants,</hi> that the Church ever had) ſays (and ingeminates it)<hi>—The BIBLE, the BIBLE, I ſay the BIBLE only is the Religion of Proteſtants; whatſoever elſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve beſides it, and the plain IRRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FRAGABLE and IND<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE Conſequences of it, well may they hold it as a Matter of Opinion, but not as a Matter of Faith or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; neither can they with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to their own Grounds believe it themſelves, nor require the Belief of it from others, without moſt High and moſt Schiſmatical Preſumption,</hi> Ch. 6. N. 56. Will Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſay, His Fundamentals are ſuch irrefragable and indubitable Truths, about which there are among Proteſtants ſuch hot and irreconcileable Contentions? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that moſt judicious Author lays this as the unmoveable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his whole Diſcourſe againſt the Papiſts, viz. <hi>That all things neceſſary to Salvation are</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently <hi>contain'd in Scripture;</hi> as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does, (ſee <hi>Pref. N.</hi> 30.) And he ſhows in the following Paragraphs, to <hi>N.</hi> 38. That all the Jeſuits Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt Proteſtants are confuted by it. But that's not all, the ſame Author after Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> affirms, <hi>That the Apoſtles Creed contains all thoſe points of Belief, which were by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Neceſſity to be preached to all, and believed by all:</hi> And yet he ſays in the ſame Paragraph, <hi>That all Points in the Creed are not thus neceſſary;</hi> See Chap. 4. N. 23. Now what more or leſs hath our Author aſſerted in his whole Book? For I have ſhewed out of him, and it's evident to the Impartial; that his Propoſition, that <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſiah or Chriſt,</hi> does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or clearly imply all the Articles of neceſſary Chriſtian Faith in the Creed. For, though it was ſufficient to conſtitute a Believer during the Life of Chriſt, to believe him to be the Chriſt, although they had no explicite Belief of his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to come; yet afterwards thoſe Articles <hi>were neceſſary, being undoubted Evidences of his being the Meſſiah,</hi> as our Author <hi>pag.</hi> 31. And therefore Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> is very injurious to him, in repreſenting his Propoſition, as if it were only the believing the Man called <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93987:21"/>
to be <hi>the Meſſiah,</hi> an <hi>Hebrew word,</hi> that ſignifies in Engliſh <hi>Anointed,</hi> without underſtanding what is meant by that Term, ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 121.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I expect that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſhould have any regard to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Judgment, and all thoſe, the Vice Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the Divinity-profeſſors, and others that licenſed and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Book, when he has none for the Pious and Learned Biſhop <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> and thoſe others? Nay, when thoſe numerous plain Teſtimonies, which our Author has quoted out of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, do but provoke his Oppoſition and Contempt; though the Divine Writers add theſe Sanctions to the Belief of our Author's Propoſition, or of thoſe Words and Sentences that are of the ſame Import, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it, viz. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> or <hi>ſhall never thirſt,</hi> or <hi>ſhall have eternal Life,</hi> and the like: On the contrary, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be condemned,</hi> or <hi>ſhall die in his Sin,</hi> or <hi>periſh,</hi> and the like. However I doubt not but my impartial Reader will conſider both what my Author, and what my ſelf have ſaid in this Point.</p>
            <p>Having thus made it appear, that the reducing of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtian Faith to a few, or even to one plain Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle deliver'd in Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and often repeated there, and in divers equipollent Phraſes, eaſy to be underſtood by the POOR, and ſtrongly enforcing the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (as is our Author's Propoſition) is far from having any tendency to Atheiſm or Deiſm; I ſhall now retort this charge upon Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> and ſhow that on the contrary, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of ſpeculative and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Articles as neceſſary, which are neither contain'd in Scripture expreſly, nor drawn thence by any clear and evident Conſequence, but are hard to be underſtood, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the <hi>common People,</hi> having no rational Tendency to promote a good Life, but directly to the high Diſhonour of the one God, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſubverſion of the Hope and Peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as I have manifeſted in one and the chief of Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and of other Syſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: This I ſay has been, and is one great Cauſe, or chief occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Atheiſm and Deiſm that is in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> himſelf tells us, That <q>Undue Apprehenſions of a Deity join'd with ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the high road to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 34.—Therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of falſe Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Attributes of God, is very pernicious, for they are deſtructive of his very Being and Nature.</q> But I have ſhew'd that the impoſing of the Doctrine of <hi>three Almighty Perſons,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Gods, is a falſe Doctrine, and deſtroys one of the chief At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes

of God, therefore is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Edw.) deſtructive of his very Being and Nature,</hi> pag. 35. Again, another of Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Fundamentals is, <hi>That full Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made by the Death of Chriſt to the Divine Juſtice;</hi> which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine does clearly deſtroy the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of the <hi>Divine Mercy:</hi> for every one may readily perceive, that full ſatisfaction to Juſtice by Puniſhment, cannot conſiſt with Pardoning Mercy; when a Judg puniſhes according to full Juſtice, he does not at all forgive or ſhew Mercy. But that they may not be ſeen to deſtroy altogether the Mercy of God, they make him to inflict that Puniſhment upon himſelf in a Human Body and Soul. Will not theſe <hi>falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deity expunge at laſt the Belief of the true one?</hi> Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays falſe ones will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly. Another occaſion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſays, <hi>Atheiſts take from our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Broils and Animoſities, from the many Parties and Squadrons of Sects that are in the World, to bid defiance to all Religion.</hi> And is it not manifeſt that thoſe Diviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ariſe chiefly from thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals? I have intimated alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there are many Diviſions of Trinitarians, and how hotly they contend with one another, and upon Unitarian Principles. And whoever ſhall but peep into Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, may ſoon ſee that their <hi>Trinity</hi> has been ſuch a bone of Contention as has exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd the Wits and Pens of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men theſe 1400 Years; for ſo long it is, and longer ſince Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians departed from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Faith, as it was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And now when the Unitarians and our Author would bring Chriſtians back to that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, in which the <hi>Goſpel was preached to the Poor,</hi> and they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it and receiv'd it; this pious Deſign is ridicul'd, and the Salvation of the Bulk of Mankind is ſet at nought; Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> may well conclude that this conduct gives occaſion to Atheiſtical Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> He ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 63. <hi>When Perſons obſerve that the very Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour is toſs'd and torn by rude Pens—what can they think of the other great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Chriſtianity?</hi> But Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> miſtakes, it's not the oppoſition that is made to the ſupreme Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Son of God, but the aſſerting it, that inclines Men to disbelieve Chriſtianity. Had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are now Deiſts, been ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acquainted with the Doctrine of one God even the Father, and of one Man the Mediator between God and Men, it's very probable they would have continued Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for there are ſome that of Deiſts have been reconcil'd to the Chriſtian Faith by the Unitarian Books, and have profeſs'd much Satisfaction therein. But I muſt confeſs it's a very handſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93987:22"/>
Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> gives to his own Party, when he blames the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians, That they have provok'd ſome of them to an undecent ſort of Language concerning theſe Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: ſo that ſome of theſe latter have hurt the Cauſe, it may be almoſt as much by their Defending it, as the others have by their Oppoſing it.</hi> I muſt lay up this for a curious Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in Rhetorick: He cuts ſome dignified Perſons through the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians ſides; and ſo whoever is in Fault, they muſt bear the Blame. But if the Unitarians have <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Truth</hi> on their ſide, then they are not faulty, even as Chriſt and the Apoſtles were not faulty, though they preach'd the Goſpel which ſet <hi>the Son againſt the Father,</hi> &amp;c. and produc'd not <hi>Peace but a Sword:</hi> And the Reformers were not faulty in vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Popiſh Faith, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Blood. But whoever will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſider it, may ſee it's the Nature of the Trinitarian Doctrine, that it cannot be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without being expoſed, ſo that when the moſt Learned of the Party labour to defend it, they neceſſarily run into one Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity or other; which being perceived by the next Learned Man, he expoſes him: and a Third ſees the weakneſs of each of them: and a Fourth Man ſpies Flaws in every of them. This produces various Hypotheſes, and makes them a Scorn to Atheiſts, and enclines others to Deiſm. For the obſcuring of a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction will not take it away. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions are ſtubborn Things, and will never yield to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation whatſoever. God will never be more than One real Perſon, and One Perſon will never be Three real Perſons. And if Trinitarians will (as they do) make that a Fundamental of Religion, which contradicts the beſt Reaſonings of Mankind, whereby they prove the Exiſtence of God and his Unity, <hi>viz. That he is that Being which IS neceſſarily and by himſelf, and ſo conſider'd not in Kind, but in Act; wherefore if you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe more Gods, then you will neceſſarily find nothing in each of them why any of them ſhould be.</hi> Grotius de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Chr. Relig. in initio. And if the Trinitarians cannot explain their Doctrine to one another, ſo as to clear it from introducing more Gods than one, no marvel then that looſe Men (who yet reaſon as the incomparable <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and other Learned Men do) do thence deny there is <hi>any God at all.</hi> The Learned allow there is not neceſſarily any God, if you ſuppoſe more than one: The Trinitarians ſay he is more than <hi>one;</hi> Men who think it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt there ſhould be no God, conclude thence, it's equal in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe there is no God as three. And Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> joins them with his Suffrage in the Point; <hi>I think it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a greater Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that there ſhould be more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93987:23"/>
Gods than one, than that there ſhould be none at all. Reaſon and Relig.</hi> p. 59.</p>
            <p>And if ſome Men take occaſion from ſuch reaſonings as theſe to turn Atheiſts it may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that Men that are more Sober, and find ſtrong and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Reaſons for the Exiſtence and Unity of God, but ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſtians worſhip Three, and beſides that, hold divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſurd Doctrines for Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals; ſuch Men (I ſay) muſt of neceſſity forſake Chriſtianity; and turn Deiſts. Thus it's moſt manifeſt, that the Unitarians take the direct Courſe to prevent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Deiſm, by letting the World ſee, that thoſe Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are no Doctrines of Chriſt; but that the neceſſary Faith of Chriſt is a plain and ſhort Doctrine, eaſy to be underſtood by the Poor, and clearly expreſt in Scripture, moſt reaſonable in it ſelf, and moſt agreeable to the Unity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and other the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in the <hi>4th</hi> Place ſhew how the Obſcurity, Numerouſneſs, and Difficulty of underſtanding Syſtematical Fundamentals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Deiſm, and ſubverts the Chriſtian Faith, and that in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Inſtance. It's matter of Fact, and evident to the whole World, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are a very numerous People, and form'd into a compact Body, in which they exerciſe ſtrict Diſcipline, as to what concerns their Party. They will not own any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Chriſtians or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for <hi>the People of God,</hi> but themſelves <hi>only;</hi> all others are of the World. They utterly diſown the Scriptures as the Rule of Faith; they decry it as <hi>Letter, Carnal, Duſt,</hi> &amp;c. Their Principle is, that their Religion is taught them by Inſpiration or Revelation of a Light within, whereof every Man has a Meaſure, but <hi>they</hi> only hearken to it, and obey it; They give the Scripture the place of bearing witneſs to their inward Light, as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to Chriſt. They turn the Goſpel into an Allegory, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of the Words and Phraſes of the Scripture; as that <hi>Chriſt is the Word, the Light, the Teacher, the Word in the Mouth and Heart; that Chriſt died, and roſe, and aſcended, and is in Heaven,</hi> and the like; but all in a myſtical or ſpiritual Senſe, as they call it. By all which things, and indeed by the whole Tenour of their Books, Preachings and Profeſſions, they appear to be <hi>Deiſts</hi> and not Chriſtians. <hi>George Fox's</hi> Book; titled, <hi>The great Myſtery,</hi> will give full ſatisfaction in this Point. And they have all along been charg'd by other Denominations to be <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> and that <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm is no Chriſtianity.</hi> However retaining ſtill the Words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtian Faith is expreſt, though in an <hi>equivocal</hi> Senſe; and having ſome among them (as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93987:23"/>
               <hi>George Keith</hi> and others) who ſtill believ'd the Goſpel in the proper Senſe, they made a ſhift to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>generally</hi> Chriſtians. And indeed this Conduct of theirs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even many of their own Party, which is manifeſt in <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rogers</hi> of <hi>Briſtol, Francis Bugg, Thomas Criſpe, John Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>George Keith;</hi> who having been a Quaker about 30 Years, yet did not till within theſe three or four Years diſcover the Infidelity of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and true Quakers, who are deſervedly call'd <hi>Foxonians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe holding the Principles of <hi>George Fox</hi> their Author. But <hi>G. Keith</hi> living in <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> (where the Quakers were <hi>Governours,</hi> and might be free to open their Minds plainly) did then perceive they did not believe the Doctrine of <hi>the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> the ſummary of Chriſtian Faith, which made him preach it and contend for it more earneſtly. This provok'd the <hi>Foxonians</hi> ſo far, that it came to a Breach and Separation, and at length to Impeachment, Fines and Impriſonment. Then <hi>G. Keich</hi> returns to <hi>London,</hi> where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Conteſt between him and the <hi>Foxonians</hi> of <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> was taken into Conſideration, and had divers Hearings by the general Annual Meeting of Quakers, 1694, who gave a kind of a Judgment in the Caſe, but no clearer Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the principal Matter concerning <hi>Chriſt within,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> and the other Articles of Chriſtian Faith, than their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>equivocal</hi> Expreſſions. The next Year 1695, at the like Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Meeting, they abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and make this the Ground of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had not given due obſervance to their former Order, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For he had ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to preach frequently <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> as before. See a late Book, titled, <hi>Groſs Error and Hypocriſy detected,</hi> &amp;c. The Reader I hope will excuſe it, that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him in this long Story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neceſſary for me firſt, to prove the Quakers are <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and then to proceed and ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Obſcurity, Ambiguity, and Numerouſneſs of <hi>Syſtematical</hi> Fundamentals, is that which is the chief Cauſe of their being <hi>ſo:</hi> For not being able to ſatisfy themſelves in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and determining the Truth and Certainty of thoſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, for the proof of which Scriptures were alledg'd; but <hi>thoſe</hi> of ſo doubtful a ſenſe, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly interpreted by oppoſite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they readily embrac'd <hi>George Fox</hi>'s only Fundamental of <hi>the Light in every Man;</hi> that is in reality the <hi>natural Light,</hi> whereby we diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil in ordinary; whence it is that (as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) We</hi> (as <hi>the Gentiles) are a Law to our ſelves, and our Thoughts accuſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93987:24"/>
or excuſe,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. Which is in Truth an excellent Doctrine, and has great certainty and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. But <hi>G. Fox</hi> preaches this, not as a natural Principle, but 1. As a ſupernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And 2. Chriſt being call'd in Scripture, <hi>the Light that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Man,</hi> and the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> becauſe be brought the Light of the Goſpel into the World; <hi>George Fox</hi> applies theſe Terms and Phraſes, and almoſt every thing that is ſpoken of Chriſt, to <hi>the Light in every Man,</hi> and ſo turns the plain ſenſe of the Goſpel into a Parabolical or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Senſe, and makes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Scripture to ſpeak nothing but Deiſm. 3. <hi>G. Fox</hi> adds cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Obſervances of giving no reſpect in Word or Geſture, or Title, nor ſpeaking as others ſpeak, nor ſaluting as others ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, nor paying Tithes, nor uſing the Sword, nor ſwearing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all as inſpired Dictates, that ſo the <hi>only People of God</hi> might be ſeparated from all the World, and they ſerve ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably for that purpoſe. Now if you conſider the experimented <hi>certainty</hi> of their Principle, <hi>the Light within,</hi> that accuſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and their Perſwaſion that it was <hi>a Divine Inſpiration,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was confirm'd to them by their giving <hi>obedience</hi> to thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which were ſo contrary and offenſive to the World, and expos'd them to much Suffering; [All ſuffering for Religion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for a clear Revelation from God, confirming the Sufferers in their Perſwaſion:] You may clearly perceive it was the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, Obſcurity, and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of their former Principles, which induced them to embrace <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Religion, which is all dictated by the Spirit of God in every Man. Whence it is, they upbraid other Profeſſors with <hi>Doubtfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Fallibility;</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them counts himſelf <hi>as infallible</hi> as the Papiſts do the <hi>Pope. How can ye but delude Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (ſays <hi>G. Fox)</hi> that <hi>are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi> Myſt. p. 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Obſcurity, Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and Multiplicity of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, is that which has given an Argument to Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, wherewith to ſeduce Proteſtants to Popery. For evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>this,</hi> I ſhall mind you of a Paper written by a Jeſuit, in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s time, titled, <hi>An Addreſs preſented to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Miniſters of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which is, <hi>That all things neceſſary to Salvation are not clearly contained in Scripture,</hi> as Proteſtants hold; becauſe the <hi>Belief of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, one God and three Perſons, is neceſſary to Salvation, but not clearly contain'd in Scripture.</hi> Then he goes about to ſhew, that the Scriptures commonly alledged for the Trinity, admit of another ſenſe. He goes the ſame way in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93987:24"/>
the Article of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Thus ſuppoſing theſe Articles to be neceſſary to Salvation (as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants hold) and not clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture; it follows that the undoubted Certainty of them muſt be found in the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Church; and then that Church which profeſſes <hi>Infallibility</hi> is the only Refuge; and <hi>I believe as the Church believes,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all other Articles. No Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty any where elſe; but Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty muſt be had in theſe Points. Here the making of thoſe Articles Fundamental, which cannot be clearly prov'd from Scripture, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Sufficiency and Clearneſs of Scripture, and ſends poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Infallibility of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith.</p>
            <p>They did ſo glory in the ſtrength of this Argument, that the Jeſuit-Preacher in <hi>Limeſtreet,</hi> read their Paper, and made the ſame Challenge in his Pulpit, where he had a great number of Proteſtants that went out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hear him.</p>
            <p>Having thus (as I preſume) vindicated our Author, and ſhewn the Miſchiefs of Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, I may now take my leave of my Reader. Only I am firſt willing to let Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> know, that I have not undertaken this Defence out of any ambitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of contending with ſo Learned a Man as he is; nor would I have made oppoſition to him in any other Point of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Divinity: but Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals every Man is concern'd in, and ought to know, and to be aſſured that he holds them all. <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> is a greater thing by far than any Empire, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtify and exact our utmoſt Care and Endeavour for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. So that in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of Mr. <hi>Edw</hi>'s Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—I have done my Duty to my ſelf; and that I have publiſh'd them, I am perſwaded I have therein done a great Charity to my Neighbours, <hi>the Poor and Bulk of Mankind,</hi> for whoſe Salvation (I hope) I ſhould not think it too much to lay down my Life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi> ſpeaks ſo ſcoffingly of them, even where their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs or Miſery is deeply concern'd.</p>
