         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Member of Parliament.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Command, I here preſent you with
thoſe Reaſons that oblige me to oppoſe the Reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Preſs, as inconſiſtent with the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and dangerous to the Liberties of the Nation:
Both which I undertake to ſhew. And in order to prove the
firſt, I beg leave to premiſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which makes a Man to differ from a Brute, wholly
uncapable of forming any Notion of Religion, is his Reaſon;
which is the only Light God has given him, not only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
that there is a Religion, but to diſtinguiſh the true from
the many falſe ones. He therefore that employs his Reaſon to
the beſt of his Ability to find out Religious Truths, in order to
practiſe it, does all that God deſires: For God, who will not
command Impoſſibilities, can require no more of him, than that
he impartially ſearches after, and endeavours to diſcover Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Truth, by the uſe of that Reaſon which was given him for
that end. He that does this, may have the ſatisfaction of doing
his Duty as a rational Creature, and may be ſure, tho he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154037:4"/>
Truth, he ſhall not miſs the Reward that is due to him who
obeys his Maker, in following as well as he could, and no
more could be his Duty, the only Guide God has given him to
judge of Truth and Falſhood. On the contrary, he that neglects
to do this, is diſobedient to his Maker, in miſuſing his rational
Faculties; and tho he ſhould light on Truth, the luckineſs of
the Accident will not excuſe his Diſobedience: For God will
judge us as we are accountable (that is, rational) Creatures;
and conſequently our reward from him, whether we hit or
miſs of Truth, will be in an exact proportion to the uſe we make
of our Reaſon: And if God has oblig'd us to uſe it as the only
means to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood, that alone muſt be
the way to find the one, and avoid the other. Now the way
that a Man's Reaſon does this, is by examining thoſe Proofs,
Arguments, or Mediums, that either himſelf or others have
found out, and by comparing them with his common and
ſelf-evident Notions, by means of which he finds out the
agreement or diſagreement of any propoſition with thoſe Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards
and Teſts of Truth.</p>
            <p>Tho this is the only way to diſcover Truth, yet if a Man
was left wholly to himſelf, without any to informe his Judgment,
he would make but a very ſmall Diſcovery in Religious, or any
other Truths: Therefore it's Mens mutual Duty to inform each
other in thoſe Propoſitions they apprehend to be true, and the
Arguments by which they endeavour to prove them; which
cannot be done ſo well as by <hi>Printing</hi> them, ten thouſand Books,
after the Letters are once ſet, being ſooner Printed than one
Tranſcribed: By <hi>the Advantage of which, Men, tho at never ſo
great diſtance, may, with a great deal of Eaſe and little Charge, be
exactly acquainted with each others Sentiments.</hi> And it's wholly
owing to <hi>Printing,</hi> that Knowledge is become, not only much
more diffuſive, but that a great deal of more uſeful Knowledge
has been diſcovered, in a ſhort time ſince that Invention, than
in many Ages before. And if it has not had as great effect
in moſt places with reſpect to Religious as to other Knowledge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154037:4"/>
it can only be, becauſe the Liberty of <hi>Printing,</hi> as to the former,
has been more reſtrained; for Men have the ſame way of
judging of that, as of all other Matters.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, 'tis clear that the <hi>Preſs</hi> ought not to
be reſtrained.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it tends to make Men blindly ſubmit to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
they chance to be educated in: For if 'tis once ſuppos'd
unlawful to publiſh any Arguments againſt that Religion, it
cannot be denied but that 'tis as unlawful to read and examine
thoſe Arguments, that being the ſole Reaſon of forbidding the
<hi>Printing</hi> them; which neceſſarily ſuppoſeth they are to take
their Religion on truſt, without any trial, which is the greateſt
Fault that can be, next to having no Religion at all: For I
cannot ſee any ground a Man has to hope to go to Heaven,
that will not be at the pains to examine what it is that God
requires of him in order to his coming thither.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe it deprives Men of the moſt proper and beſt means
to diſcover Truth, by hindering them from ſeeing and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the different Opinions, and the Arguments alledg'd for them.
I can ſee no Reaſon why 'tis more neceſſary for him that judges
for others, than 'tis for him who judges for himſelf, to ſee the
Arguments on all ſides; this being the only evidence by which
any Man is to judge. The ſuppreſſing the Evidence in a Cauſe
where Mens eternal Happineſs is concerned, is (I take it)
much more criminal than in a Cauſe of a temporal Intereſt. So
that a Law to oblige the Judges to hear the Proofs but of one
ſide, is not as bad as to truſt the Clergy of any one Sect
with the Preſs; who, to be ſure, will ſuffer nothing to be
<hi>printed</hi> but of their own ſide; and who too, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
will miſrepreſent their Adverſaries, and their Opinions,
more than a Pleader will the Party or Cauſe againſt which he is
engaged. And are not the People (for inſtance) amongſt
the Papiſts, where the <hi>Preſs</hi> is effectually reſtrained, as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what can be alledged againſt the Popiſh Doctrines, as
a Judge that has heard but one ſide can be of the Defence the
other is to make?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154037:5"/>
3. Becauſe it hinders Truth from having any great influence on
Mens Minds: which is owing chiefly to Examination, becauſe
the more rational That makes an Opinion appear, the greater
power it will have on the Affections; which are not moved
without ſome ſenſible connexion between the Cauſe and Effect;
for what does not convince the Underſtanding, will have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no effect on the Will: Which is one reaſon why Men are
obliged to <hi>try all things,</hi> becauſe when they ſee the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of any Opinion, it will oblige them to act according to it
more heartily than when they take it on truſt: and nothing
more endears Truth to us, than that its diſcovery is the effect
of our own Induſtry and Obſervation.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe it tends to make us hold the Truth (ſhould we
chance to light on it) guiltily: for that (as I have already
proved) will not be accepted, if it be not the Effect of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Examination; which makes Error it ſelf innocent: for
if any thing in that caſe be a fault, it muſt be the Examination,
becauſe That might have been prevented; but the Opinion that's
cauſed by it could not, That being a neceſſary Conſequence of
the other. Men when they are left to themſelves without any
Clergy at all, are more likely not only to judge for themſelves,
but to make a truer and a more impartial Judgment, than when
they are permitted to know the Sentiments of the Clergy but
of one Sect, who then may impoſe on them what ever out
of Intereſt they think fit.</p>
            <p>5. One Reaſon why God hath ſo formed Mankind, that each
alone without the help of others cannot well ſubſiſt, is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
them to mutual love and kindneſs, and to contribute to one
anothers happineſs. And they want each others aſſiſtance for
things of the Mind as well as of the Body. For a Man would
be in a miſerable ſtate of darkneſs and Ignorance, were it not
for the Light that others afford him: and therefore they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to increaſe as much as they can each others Knowledge,
eſpecially in Religion, which they can no otherwiſe do, than by
communicating to one another what they think is the Truth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154037:5"/>
and the Reaſon by which they endeavour to prove it. To
oblige Men to do this, God has not only implanted in them a
ſtrong deſire to find out Religious Truth, but as great an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to teach others what they apprehend to be ſo; and there
is no Man who believes a Doctrine to be true, but would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad to get it owned by others. Whoſoever therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to hinder Men from communicating their Thoughts,
(as they notoriouſly do that are for reſtraining the Preſs) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the natural Rights of Mankind, and deſtroy the common
Ties of Humanity. If we muſt, <hi>early and late,</hi> according to
the Wiſe Man's direction, <hi>ſeek after Wiſdom as after a hidden
Treaſure;</hi> I cannot ſee how it will become the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to endeavour by a Law to hinder us from knowing more
than the ſcanty Meaſure a Party-Licenſer will afford us.</p>
            <p>Not only the Light of Nature, but the written Word (<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
19. 17. 1 <hi>Theſs. 5. 14. Heb.</hi> 3. 13.) obliges every one, Lay
as well as Clergy, to exhort, warn, rebuke, and uſe all means
poſſible to bring his miſtaken Brother into the right way; which
he can no otherwiſe do, than by firſt judging himſelf what is
right and wrong; and then by uſing Arguments to perſwade
him whom he judges in the wrong, to deſiſt from it. And if, as
the Scripture ſuppoſeth, no Man can neglect to do this without
<hi>hating his Brother;</hi> every one has a right to print his Sentiments
as the beſt, if not the only way to <hi>exhort, rebuke, reprove</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
of Brethren at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, in all Ages the greater Mens Zeal hath been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and the more inflamed their Love to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
the more they have thought it their Duty (tho with the
hazard of their Lives) to communicate to others what they
judged to be the Truth. And all Sects, how different ſo ever
in all other things, do agree in thinking themſelves bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as to the greateſt Act of Charity; and conſequently there
is no Sect that hinders others from publiſhing what they believe
to be Truth, but ſins againſt the natural and revealed Law, and
breaks that golden Rule (the Foundation of all Morality) of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154037:6"/>
as they would be done unto.</hi> For tho they look upon it as
impious and tyrannical for any to hinder them from imparting
to others thoſe Doctrines they judge to be true, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
would hinder all others, who have as much right to
judge for themſelves, and are as much obliged to communicate
to others what they judge to be a Religious Truth.</p>
            <p>What can be more inhumane, as well as ungrateful, than
to puniſh that Perſon who out of love to Truth, and charity
to the Souls of his Brethren, beſtows his Time, perhaps to the
detriment of his Health and Fortune, in publiſhing what he
judges to be for their eternal Good? If this be a juſt Reward
for ſuch an Undertaking, I cannot ſee how the Clergy can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſuch Riches and Honours for doing but the ſame thing;
that is, for inſtructing others in that they judge to be true.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more unbecoming the Dignity of a rational
Nature, than to bar up the way to religious Knowledge and
Wiſdom, which Men have no way to propagate, but by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one another Reaſons and Arguments: And there can be
no Pretence to hinder Men from doing this by reſtraining the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> but what will as ſtrongly forbid them doing it any
other way. In a word, Men have the ſame right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
their Thoughts, as to think themſelves; and where
the one is denied, the other is ſeldom uſed, or to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
For,</p>
            <p>Men as they are more or leſs hindred from communicating
their Thoughts, are more or leſs ſtupid and ignorant, and their
Religion more or leſs corrupted: And this is not only true with
relation to <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> who ſuffer no <hi>Printing</hi> at
all, except the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> (whoſe Knowledge above other Eaſtern
Nations ſeems to be owing to that Art, tho among them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
rude and imperfect) but with reſpect to Chriſtians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom one would think it almoſt impoſſible, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Light and Knowledge the Goſpel brought into the
World, that any ſhould be ſo groſly ignorant and ſuperſtitious
as the Papiſts are, or that the Chriſtian Religion ſhould be ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154037:6"/>
much depraved as it is amongſt them: and what is this ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to, but the denying the People the Liberty of the Preſs, and
all other ways of freely debating matters of Religion? And had
it not been for this Invention, whereby men had ſuch an eaſy
way of communicating their Thoughts, nothing but a ſecond
Revelation could have freed them from that maſs of Ignorance
and Superſtition the Chriſtian World lay under; and which
was every day increaſing, and does ſtill remain in a very high
degree in thoſe Countries that groan under Reſtraint, as <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
Spain, Italy;</hi> which laſt, ſutably to the Freedom once it
enjoyed, abounded with Men eminent in all Learning and
Knowledge, as well as Vertue and Bravery: and that it is ſo
much degenerated now (the Climate and the make of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
being ſtill the ſame) is owing to nothing but that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
which forbids all Freedom; contrary to the practice of
antient <hi>Rome,</hi> where to think on what one had a mind to, and
to ſpeak ones thoughts as freely as to think them, was looked
on as one of the chief Bleſſings of a Free Government.</p>
            <p>It's not only in Popiſh, but in Proteſtant Countries too, that
according to the Reſtraint Men lay under, Ignorance, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Bigotry does more or leſs abound. <hi>Denmark, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and ſeveral other Countries, are undenyable Inſtances of
this; and it cannot be otherwiſe, for there is little difference
between having no Reaſon, and not exerciſing it. And it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
that the Clergy themſelves are not only more knowing,
and reaſon much better, but are much more ſober, careful and
exemplary, where Liberty of Debating is allowed, than
where denied. From what has been urged, I think I may
ſafely conclude, that Men, if they regard the employing their
rational Faculties as God requires, and (the Conſequence of
it) the diſcovery of Truth in Religion, and their being influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by it as they ought to be, are obliged to allow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an entire liberty in communicating their Thoughts, which
was never forbidden but where Intereſt ſupplanted Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

6. There's no medium between Mens judging for themſelves,
and giving up their Judgments to others. If the firſt be their
Duty, the Preſs ought not to be reſtrained, becauſe it debars
them from ſeeing thoſe Allegations by which they are to inform
their Judgments. All the Arguments that are or can be urged
for the regulating the Preſs, have no other Foundation than
that of People's being liable to miſtake, and ſubject to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on by fallacious Arguments and ſpecious Pretences: which
in ſtead of proving what they deſign, only ſhows the greater Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the freedom of the Preſs; for the more apt Men are
to miſtake and to be deceiv'd, the leſs reaſon there is for
their relying on any one Party, but the more to examine with all
care and diligence the Reaſons on all ſides, and conſequently for
the Preſs being open to all Parties, one as well as the other. So
that thoſe that are for allowing Men the liberty of judging for
themſelves (if any ſuch can be for regulating the Preſs) are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unhappy in their Arguments, becauſe they all make againſt
themſelves, and out of their own Mouths they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>But if Men are to give up their Reaſon to the Clergy, of
whatſoever Denomination, there's nothing, I confeſs, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with that blind Obedience than the Liberty of the
Preſs, becauſe it gives them an opportunity to ſee what can be
ſaid againſt that or any other Darling Notion of the Prieſts;
and then it's a great odds but that rational Creatures will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by their own Reaſon, and no longer endure the Clergy
to be Lords of their Faith.</p>
            <p>7. In fine, if it be unlawful to let the Preſs continue free, leſt it
furniſh Men with the Reaſons of one Party as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it muſt be as unlawful to examine thoſe Reaſons: for if
the laſt be a Duty, the firſt cannot be unlawful, becauſe it's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Means to the laſt in providing thoſe Reaſons which Men
are bound to try and examine; except an implicit Belief be a
Duty, which muſt neceſſarily bring Men back again to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
For if it be now unlawful to examine the Reaſons on all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154037:7"/>
ſides, for fear of having other Sentiments than thoſe the Clergy
approves, it was no leſs unlawful at the time of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was wholly built upon this freedom of examining
the Opinions of the Prieſts, and rejecting them if they judged
them falſe. This the brave <hi>Luther</hi> did ſingly and by himſelf
in defiance of the whole Church, and this any Man now hath
the ſame right to do: So that it's evident the Freedom or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of the Preſs depends on this ſingle Queſtion, Whether we
ought to be free, or Slaves in our Underſtandings? or, in other
words, Proteſtants or Papiſts? If the firſt, there cannot be the
leaſt colour for leaving the Conduct of Religion ſo wholly to a
few Prieſts, that nothing ſhall be publiſhed about it but what
they think fit, than which nothing can ſavour more of a Popiſh,
ſlaviſh, and proſtitute Compliance.</p>
            <p>What, <hi>Sir,</hi> could be more ſurprizing to that Honourable
Houſe, whereof you are a moſt worthy Member, than a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this purpoſe; That becauſe making of Laws is a thing of
great Conſequence, and Country Gentlemen are ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
that therefore the Houſe ought to be regulated, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a Licenſer to judge what ſhould be ſpoke in it? As ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
as ſuch a Motion would be, I would willingly know why
'tis not as unacountable to hinder a whole Nation the freedom
of debating Matters of Religion, which (ſince they are not
able, like their Repreſentatives, to aſſemble in one Room)
cannot well be done but by letting the Preſs be open to every
one to publiſh his Reaſons; which ought not to be denied, as long
as every one in the Nation has as much a right, not only to judge
for himſelf in religious, as any Legiſlators can have to judge for
him in Civil Matters, but is as much obliged to uſe all poſſible
means to inform his Judgment; and conſequently there is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reaſon to deny Liberty of debating in one Cauſe as the other.</p>
            <p>8. The Reformation is wholly owing to the Preſs: For tho
there were ſeveral able Men who, before <hi>Printing</hi> was known,
moſt vigorouſly oppoſed the growing Errors of the Weſtern
Church; yet all they could do was to little or no purpoſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154037:8"/>
becauſe they had no eaſy and ready way to communicate their
thoughts to any great Number: But no ſooner was the <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Printing</hi> made uſeful, but a poor Monk who diſcovered
at leaſt the groſſer Cheats of the Prieſthood, was made capable
of imparting thoſe Notions, which drew almoſt a Moiety
from the Romiſh Superſtition, which loſt ground every where,
as the Preſs was either more or leſs free. Therefore it was not
ſtrange that the Popiſh Clergy, ſince they could not confound
the <hi>Art of Printing,</hi> ſhould endeavour to turn it to their own
Advantage, not only by hindring any new Book from being
printed, but by expunging out of old ones whatever did not
ſerve their turn: And herein they acted conſiſtent with their
Principles, which allows no Liberty of examining, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
denies all Freedom of the Preſs, which of all things
does engage Men the moſt to do it. But what Pretence can the
Proteſtants have for reſtraining it, who as they owe their
Religion to its Liberty, ſo they cannot hinder it without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
that Religion which has no other Foundation than that
of every ones having a Right to examine thoſe Reaſons that are
for or againſt any Opinion, in order to make a true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judgment? which can never be Juſtified, if it be unlawful
to permit the Preſs to be open for all Men to propoſe their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to one another, in order to their examining them.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be denied, but that the Proteſtant Clergy, who
are as ambitious for the moſt part as the Papiſts themſelves to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on the Conſciences of the People, have by Perſecution, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of the Preſs, and other ſuch methods, given the Papiſts
(who have ſcarce any thing to plead for themſelves but the
Practice of their Adverſaries) too juſt an occaſion to inſult them,
who are (they ſay) no other than a pack of Hypocrites, in
doing the very ſame things they ſo loudly condemn; and that
it's little leſs than a Demonſtration, that the Principles by which
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey pretend to juſtify their Separation, are very abſurd, ſince
hey are forced to Act contrary to them in every point. And
what was it in truth but theſe ſhameful Practices, that put a ſtop
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154037:8"/>
to the Reformation, which at firſt, like a mighty Torrent, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
all that oppos'd it, but has ever ſince gone back both
in eſteem and intereſt, and at leaſt, if Men do not change their
conduct, will be quite loſt? For how can it be otherwiſe, ſince
that method (Proteſtantiſm and Popery being ſo oppoſite) that
preſerves the one, muſt neceſſarily deſtroy the other?</p>
            <p>The taking a contrary method not only hinder'd the further
ſpreading of the Reformation, but was the cauſe that where it
did prevail it was no more perfect: For tho the Reformers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
juſt Condemnation for what they did, yet being bred up
in ſo much Ignorance and Superſtition, they could not remove
thoſe vaſt loads of Corruptions which had been ſo long a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But if thoſe that ſucceeded them had taken the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in examining theirs, as they did their Predeceſſors Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it's impoſſible but that time muſt have diſcover'd the Truth,
and made them agree at leaſt in all matters of moment. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of this, they became as guilty of a blind Obedience as the
Papiſts; and it was a ſufficient proof of any thing amongſt the
different Sects, if <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſaid ſo:
Nothing more common than that <hi>I ſubmit all to Mother Church,</hi>
and ſuch like Phraſes; which that Men ſhould effectually do,
there were Penal Laws enacted to force them, and no <hi>Printing</hi>
or <hi>Preaching</hi> allow'd to thoſe that durſt ſee further than the firſt
Reformers (whoſe Eyes at the beſt were but half open, tho
they ſaw very well for thoſe times of Darkneſs, and in reſpect
of the Papiſts who may juſtly be reckon'd to be quite blind)
the conſequence of which was, that the Differences between the
ſeveral Sects were widened, and they all run daily farther and
farther into Uncharitableneſs, Ignorance, Superſtition, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm.</p>
            <p>9. Whoſoever obſerves with what Zeal our Divines condemn
the Popiſh Clergy for not ſuffering their Laity to read Proteſtant
Authors, would hardly think it poſſible for them to be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous
as to appoint ſome ſpiritual Dragons to watch the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> leſt any thing ſhould ſteal from thence that's not for their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154037:9"/>
turn. Let us hear only (for they all write after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
the learned Dr. <hi>Clegget,</hi> who in his <hi>Perſuaſive to an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Trial,</hi> p. 28. tells us, <q>They that have a good Cauſe will
not fright Men from conſidering what their Adverſaries ſay by
denouncing Damnation againſt them, nor forbid them to read
their Books, but rather encourage them ſo to do, that they
may ſee the difference between Truth and Error, Reaſon and
Sophiſtry, with their own eyes. This is the effect of a well
grounded confidence in Truth, and there's this ſign of a good
Cauſe apparently diſcernable in the Application of the Clergy
of this Church (of <hi>England</hi>) both to their Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they deſire the one and the other to conſider imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
what is ſaid for us as well as againſt us. And whatſoever
Guides of a Party do otherwiſe, they give juſt cauſe to thoſe
that follow them to examine their Doctrines ſo much the more
carefully, by how much they are unwilling to have them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
It's a bad ſign when Men are loth to have their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſeen in the day, but love Darkneſs more than Light.</q>
If the Church of <hi>England</hi> will own this to be a juſt Character of
them, they ought to be ſo far from endeavouring to obtain a Law
to reſtrain the <hi>Preſs,</hi> that they are obliged, did they apprehend
any ſuch deſign, to oppoſe it to their utmoſt, and to encourage
their Adverſaries to print their Sentiments, and the People to
read them, that they may <hi>ſee the difference between Truth and
Error, Reaſon and Sophiſtry, Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
and Comforming, with their own eyes.</hi> Taking a contrary
method only affords a new Argument for the Liberty of the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> becauſe they give their Followers a juſt Cauſe to <hi>examine
their Doctrines ſo much the more carefully, by how much more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
they are to have them examined. It's a bad ſign,</hi> &amp;c. In a
word, did the Proteſtant Guides act as ſuch, inſtead of fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men from conſidering what their Adverſaries ſay by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Damnation againſt them, they would tell their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
the great ſin of being biaſs'd by them in the choice of their
Opinions, and that the more important any Controverſy is,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154037:9"/>
the more Reaſon there is for the Liberty of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> that
they may examine with all the diligence imaginable the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of their Adverſaries as well as of their Guides; and that
the more they heard the one Party, the more they ſhould read
the other; and that if they ſhould fall into any Error by ſo
doing, they would not be accountable for it. For tho there is
not (as the Papiſts vainly imagine) ſuch a Guide as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
lead every Man into every Truth, yet that every ones
Reaſon as a Guide is infallible, becauſe God that deſigns that all
Men (if it be not their own fault) ſhould be for ever happy,
has given them no other Guide but their Reaſon to bring them
to that Happineſs; and therefore as ſure as God himſelf is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
the following that Guide muſt bring them to that happy
ſtate God deſigned the following it ſhould bring them to. And
on the contrary, that God, who is <hi>the Rewarder of thoſe only that
diligently ſeek him,</hi> would condemn them as unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who inſtead of uſing their Talents to find out his Will,
did abandon themſelves to the uncertain chance of Education and
the Religion in faſhion, which varies with every Age and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Countrey. As thus they ought to preach to the People, ſo
they ſhould as little ſcruple to tell the Magiſtrate, that by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
an entire Liberty, he did nothing but his Duty; but by
a Reſtraint of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> he did not only ſhew himſelf guilty of a
blind Obedience, but did endeavour to make a whole Nation
ſo, and was to anſwer not only for all the Errors, and other ill
Conſequences himſelf cauſed by a Reſtraint, but likewiſe of
abetting all other Magiſtrates that think themſelves in the right
in doing the like; and that tho he ſhould chance to be in the
right himſelf, yet he could not know how many he was the
caufe of being all their Lives in the wrong, who might be ſo
only, becauſe, not having liberty to publiſh the Reaſons they had
to embrace ſuch Opinions, they could not meet with any that
could give them Satisfaction; and in truth, writing againſt any
Opinion where Men have not the liberty to ſhew the Reaſons
why they hold it, is but writing at random, becauſe Mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154037:10"/>
cannot be confuted till they are known. Such Arguments
as theſe a Proteſtant Clergy, that's true to their own Principles,
ought to uſe both to the Prince and People, and not prevaricate
with God and Man, and talk backward and forward juſt as it
ſerves their turns. <hi>If Baal be God, ſerve him; if not, ſerve the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. I can ſee no reaſon why they that are for tying Men to
that Interpretation of Scripture a Licenſer ſhall approve, and
therefore put it in his power to hinder all others from being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
can with any juſtice condemn the Popiſh Clergy for not
licenſing the Bible it ſelf for the Laity to read it. For if the Bible
is to be tranſlated into the vulgar Tongue, to what end is it,
but that the People by reading it may judge what is their Duty
in the moſt obſcure and difficult places? Ought they not then
to ſee the different Tranſlations and Explications? If they are
to be denied this, leſt they apprehend it in a Senſe different from
that of the Licenſer and his Party, the ſame Reaſon will reſtrain
the People from promiſcuouſly reading the Bible, becauſe they
may, and frequently do apprehend it in ſuch a Senſe as their
Guides do not approve; and if that be a Crime, all the means
that are neceſſary to hinder it muſt be a Duty; and therefore
if it cannot be prevented without hindring the Laity from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bible, it's Crime to ſuffer them to read it.</p>
            <p>11. This Reſtraint gives a great handle to thoſe that believe
only Natural Religion to argue againſt the Chriſtian; for, ſay
they, 'tis no ſmall Preſumption that the Clergy themſelves are
conſcious of the Falſeneſs of their Religion, becauſe they dare not
ſuffer it to undergo a fair Trial, but do what they can to ſtifle all
the Reaſons that can be urged againſt it. The Clergy, ſay
they, are ſo learned, and withal ſo numerous, that amongſt
them they could not fail to expoſe and confound any thing that's
writ againſt them, had they but Truth on their ſide, which
they know is, next to the Almighty, ſtrong, and therefore needs
no licenſing Tricks, or Stratagems, to make it victorious:
Theſe are the mean Shifts that Error is forced to uſe againſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154037:10"/>
its Power. Theſe Men further add, That if Chriſt and his
Apoſtles obliged Men to try all things, how can they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be his Succeſſors (did they believe the Scriptures) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a fair Trial of any thing relating to Religion? And can
there be a fair Trial when all Parties have not the liberty to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
their Reaſons, that the People may compare and examine
them by their common Notions, thoſe Teſts and Standards of
all Truths? Has the Proteſtant Religion a fair Trial in <hi>Italy,</hi>
where nothing can be heard in its defence? Thus 'tis that ſome
Men expoſe our Religion on the one hand to the Inſults of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
and on the other of Papiſts; which can never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
but by granting to all Sects an entire Liberty of the Preſs.
All other methods equally ſerve to promote Error as Truth,
and conſequently can never be the way that God ordained to
diſtinguiſh the one from the other.</p>
            <p>12. It may be objected, That by ſuch a latitude as this People
may be ſeduced into falſe Religions, or into Hereſies and Schiſms.
None can profeſs a Religion, but either, becauſe upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he judges it to be true, or, that ſome by Intereſt makes him
do ſo contrary to his Judgment, or elſe, becauſe he takes it on
truſt without examining it. As to the firſt, If two Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
different Religions, one the true, the other a falſe one, yet
if they have been equally ſincere in their examination, they are
equally in the way to Heaven; becauſe in following their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they both have done what God requires; ſo two Men that
equally act againſt their Judgment, the one profeſſing the Truth,
the other not, are alike guilty: ſo alſo are they who equally
take their Religion on truſt; and ſuch perverſe holding of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
whether true or falſe, is Hereſy, as the other is Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy:
and according as Men are more or leſs partial in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they are more or leſs heretical. So that 'tis not <hi>what</hi> a
Man profeſſeth, but <hi>how,</hi> that juſtifies or condemns him before
God. Aud there would be few, either Hereticks or Hypocrites,
were there not Bribes annexed to ſome, and Awes to other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Tenets; for then Men would not be afraid to examine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154037:11"/>
Thoſe for fear of finding them falſe, nor Theſe leſt they ſhould
be true, nor to own or diſown either, according as they
judge them true or falſe. And an entire Liberty of the <hi>Preſs</hi>
would by degrees eſtabliſh religious Truth, becauſe that is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by better, plainer, and more cogent Proofs than any falſe
Opinions are; which are either miſchievous or burdenſome, or
at the leaſt uſeleſs, whilſt the other by its Excellency and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
carries Evidence and Conviction with it.</p>
            <p>As to Schiſms, they are cauſed by Mens impoſing their own
Interpretations, inſtead of the expreſs Word of God, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
terms of Communion: which makes Proteſtant Impoſers
not only Schiſmaticks but Hereticks, becauſe having laid down
as a Fundamental of their Religion, that every one is to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scripture for himſelf, they moſt obſtinately and perverſly
(not to ſay knowingly) act againſt that Fundamental.</p>
            <p>13. The moſt material Objection againſt the Liberty of the
<hi>Preſs</hi> is, That without Licenſers, Atheiſm, Profaneneſs, and
Immorality, as well as Sedition and Treaſon, may be publiſhed.
The Commonwealth has the ſame reaſon to puniſh Men for
thoſe as for theſe, becauſe they are all alike pernicious to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Societies. And 'tis all the reaſon in the world that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
aſſerts any ſuch Notions, whether in Diſcourſe, or from
the Pulpit or Preſs, ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed. But this can
be no more a reaſon to appoint Licenſers for the one than for
the other; nor would it hinder the printing things contrary to
Law, for none will be ſo mad as to deſire an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> for
them: ſo that ſuch Pamphlets, whether there are or are not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſers,
will come out only by ſtealth; and 'tis evident there
were more of them printed when the Law for regulating the
Preſs was in being, than ſince. To make the Laws againſt ſuch
things ſeverer, and to oblige either the Printer or Bookſeller to
ſet his Name to all Books whatever, will take away all pretence
for appointing Licenſers, and will be the moſt effectual way to
prevent publiſhing ſuch Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:154037:11"/>
But before I leave this Head, I cannot but remark that they
are no way guilty of Prophaneneſs who out of Conſcience (to
which Prophane and Atheiſtical Perſons have no pretence) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God after a miſtaken manner, becauſe all the honour Men
are capable of giving an Almighty and Alknowing Being, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the Intention of Deſign; and therefore to puniſh thoſe,
who out of a holy Intention and pious Deſign worſhip God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner they judge acceptable to his Will, as profane
Perſons or Blaſphemers, is the greateſt Crime next to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
becauſe 'tis puniſhing Men for no other reaſon but for
expreſſing their Zeal for the Honour of God, which they can no
otherwiſe do than by worſhipping him as their Reaſon dictates,
which they muſt either do, or not worſhip him at all, or elſe but
with a mock Worſhip. And they that by force are made to
break the ties of Conſcience, tho never ſo erroneous, cannot be
good Subjects neither to God nor King: ſo that Profaneneſs
and Immorality cannot be deſtroy'd but by all Sects doing as
they would be done unto; which muſt eſtabliſh an entire and
univerſal Liberty, ſince they have all the ſame right to judge for
themſelves, and are equally oblig'd to act according to that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to communicate to others what they judge to be true:
which perhaps was the reaſon that the Houſe of Commons ſo
unanimouſly threw out the Bill for reſtraining the Preſs immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before their addreſſing the King againſt Profaneneſs and
Immortality. But to return,</p>
            <p>If it be once thought unlawful to have nothing printed but of
the ſide of the Church in faſhion, the ſame reaſon will at leaſt as
ſtrongly hold againſt any thing being preached but of that ſide;
becauſe if any thing is printed againſt that Church, there are ten
thoufand Clergy (whom one would think a ſufficient Guard
for Truth) to expoſe its Folly and Weakneſs, but 'tis not ſo
eaſy for them to know, and conſequently to apply an Antidote
to what is preached againſt them: wherefore they who are not
for deſtroying that juſt and righteous Law that follows Liberty
of Conſcience, ought to be very careful of the Freedom of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154037:12"/>
Preſs, as the only means to guard and defend the other; and
both being built on the ſame Foundation, cannot (as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved) be deſtroyed but by ſtricking at the Foundation
of the Proteſtant Religion. And,</p>
            <p>Therefore it cannot be ſuppos'd that the chief Support of it,
the Honourable Houſe of Commons, will ever conſent to the
one or the other, eſpecially conſidering how much the Popiſh
Intereſt increaſeth, and what Advantage of late it has got in
<hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And if the Popiſh Princes (as
'tis ſuppos'd) have enter'd into a Confederacy among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to extirpate the Proteſtant Cauſe, ought not all Proteſtants
(and all that are not for a blind Obedience deſerve that Name,
that being the eſſential difference between it and Popery) inſtead
of uſing reſtraint on one another, unite againſt the common
Enemy?</p>
            <p>Beſides, let it be conſider'd, 'tis not certain we ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
bleſt with the Government of a Prince ſo entirely a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
as our Great and Glorious Deliverer. And if the Papiſts
ſhould pervert one, and by that means get the publiſhing their
Doctrines without contradiction, they might by degrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Proteſtant Religion, ſo much weakned already by its
Profeſſors acting ſo inconſiſtently with their own Principles.
But were that Scandal removed, by allowing as intire a Liberty
as the Proteſtant Principles require, there could be no danger
of the prevailing of the Popiſh, or any other Superſtition. And
'tis remarkable, that nothing has been writ in behalf of Popery
ſince the Expiration of the Act of Regulating the Preſs, ſo little is
Liberty a Friend to that Superſtition.</p>
            <p>14. But if, after all, there muſt be ſome appointed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Fate of Religious Books, the Clergy, of all Men,
ought not to be truſted with this Employ, becauſe they (not
content with the Right they have from the Society of exerciſing
the Eccleſiaſtical Function) do claim Power and Government
diſtinct and independent of it, which they pretend is ſounded
in Scripture; and conſequently they have no way, as Clergy,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154037:12"/>
of gaining any Dominion, Power, or Riches, more than what
the Society will give them, but by wreſting the Holy Writ:
And if, beſides the Pulpits, where they may preach what gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Doctrines they pleaſe, without contradiction, they do ſo far
engroſs the Preſs, as to hinder any thing from being printed
but what favours their Deſign; What may not ſuch a body of
Men, (well vers'd in all the Arts of perſwaſion by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Opportunities in diſplaying them, impoſe on the too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
People, eſpecially when all the ways to diſabuſe them are
ſtopt up?</p>
            <p>And if the Clergy in the more eaſie and primitive times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ever ſince they were forbid <hi>to lord it over the Heritage of
God,</hi> have made it their buſineſs to pervert Religion to advance
their own Power; what reaſon is there to imagine that they
would not do the ſame in theſe latter and degenerate Ages?
How, I pray, did the Clergy, who at firſt ſubſiſted by the
Charity of the people, arrive to ſuch immenſe Grandeur and
prodigious Riches, but by a conſtant Confederacy from time
to time, carried on at the Expenſe of Religion? which (as their
own Hiſtorians ſhew) was proportionably corrupted, as they
encreaſed in Power and Riches, the one being made a ſtep to
the other; and 'tis as evident where they are now moſt potent,
their Religion is moſt perverted, and the People moſt enſlaved.</p>
            <p>The chief way they effected this, was by perſwading the
People to a blind Obedience, the conſequence of which was,
that they muſt take the Clergy's own Word for all the Powers
they thought fit to ſay the Scripture had given them, and to
ſubmit to whatever they would determine in their own Cauſe,
and for their own Intereſt. And there never was a Synod, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orthodox or not, but were for impoſing on the Laity,
not only by Excommunicating, Anathematizing, and Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but by making the Magiſtrate uſe violence on all that
would not, contrary to their Conſciences, comply with their
Determinations; by which means they at laſt arrived to ſuch an
exceſs of power over the Magiſtrate as well as the People, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154037:13"/>
one was no better than their Hangman, and the other than their
Slaves. And have not the Proteſtant Clergy (from whom one
ought to expect better things) taken the ſame method to make
People blindly ſubmit to their Determination? Nay, have they
not outdone the Popiſh Clergy, in wreſting the Holy Writ to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, and enſlave the Nation, and in
preaching up the Doctrine of Abſolute Obedience, than which
nothing can be more inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, and
the happineſs of Humane Societies, as knowing the only way to
ſecure Tyranny in the Church was to get it eſtabliſhed in the
State? So that if the Proteſtant Clergy do not keep the People in
as vile a Subjection as the Popiſh do, 'tis not owing to their good
will; and therefore none that have any value for Religion, or
any kindneſs for their Liberties, will truſt thoſe that lie under
ſuch Temptation to pervert the Scripture, with the ſole licenſing
Books of Religion. As we pray not to be led into Temptation,
ſo we ſhould avoid leading others into it, eſpecially ſuch as in all
probability they cannot withſtand.</p>
            <p>15. The Diſcovery of Printing ſeems to have been deſign'd
by Providence to free Men from that Tyranny of the Clergy
they then groan'd under. And ſhall that which was intended by
divine Goodneſs to deliver all from Sacerdotal Slavery, be made
the means of bringing it in again? And if our Anceſtors could
not defend themſelves from more than Egyptian Bondage, which
the Pulpits brought on them, without the aſſiſtance of the Preſs,
it's ſcarce poſſible that we ſhould be able to ſecure our Liberties
againſt both, when by the help of the latter the Clergy have got
better Abilities, as well as Opportunities, to impoſe on the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the People: And when Men are once enſlaved in
their Underſtanding (which of all things ought to be moſt
free) it's ſcarce poſſible to preſerve any other Liberty.</p>
            <p>The truſting not only the Pulpits but the Preſs in the hands of
the Clergy, is cauſing the <hi>Blind to lead the blind,</hi> becauſe the
generality of them are more likely to be guilty of a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than the Laity, ſince they are obliged, as they value their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154037:13"/>
Subſiſtence, right or wrong, to aſſert thoſe Religious Tenets
they find eſtabliſh'd by Law; the truth of which they cannot
any more be preſum'd to have impartially examin'd, than a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Soldier the Juſtice of the Cauſe he is engag'd in; being
ſent by their Friends to the Univerſities not to try the eſtabliſh'd
Religion, whether 'tis right or wrong, but to proſeſs it as a
Trade they are to earn their bread by: and leſt they ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it, they are, even before they are capable, ſhackled with
early Oaths and Subſcriptions. Which is the reaſon that the
Prieſts are wondrous hot in every Countrey for the Opinions
to which their Preferments are annexed; in one place fierce Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,
in another violent Lutherans, in a third bigotted Papiſts;
which could not ſo univerſally happen, did they in the leaſt
examine thoſe Opinions they are engag'd to profeſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be no reaſon to truſt the Preſs in hands of men ſo
biaſs'd and prejudic'd, who cannot but be highly affronted to ſee
the Laity do, what they durſt not, judge for themſelves, and not
be blindly guided by them, who (poor men) are not truſted to
guide themſelves. Yet for all this extraordinary precaution to
keep the Clergy right and tight, and the great diſproportion of
numbers between the Laity and them, 'tis evident that almoſt
all the Errors and wrong Notions in Religion have had their riſe
and chief Support from them. So that upon the whole, if the
Preſs ſhould be truſted with any, it ought to be with Lay-men,
who have no Powers, Prerogatives, or Priviledges to gain by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Scripture, ſince they pretend to none but what they
receive from the Society. Tho I cannot but preſume that our
Legiſlators, were there no other reaſon, yet out of reſpect to
the Clergy, would not enact ſuch a Law as ſuppoſeth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and moſt learned of them not fit to be truſted with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
but a Half-ſheet in Religion without conſent of a Lay Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſer,
who is to have an arbitrary Power over their Works.
And there's no doubt but the Clergy would highly reſent ſuch a
Law; tho I cannot ſee but the appointing Licenſers, whether of
the Laity or Clergy, equally reflects on their Body, becauſe it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154037:14"/>
equally ſuppoſeth they are unfit to be truſted. But if they are
content with that Diſgrace, it muſt be becauſe either they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
defend themſelves againſt their Adverſaries, or that they
have a mind to give themſelves up to Lazineſs and Idleneſs, and
not trouble themſelves with the laborious work of controverſial
Divinity. But I ſhall ſay no more on this Point, having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſufficiently ſhewed how deſtructive the reſtraining the Preſs
is to Religion, which it cannot be without being in general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to Civil Societies, for whoſe good it was inſtituted, but
eſpecially when it is perverted on purpoſe to enſlave them:
and there never was a Nation which loſt their religious Rights
that could long maintain their civil ones, for Prieſtcraft and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
go hand in hand. Therefore I ſhall be the ſhorter on what
I have to ſay on a civil account, eſpecially conſidering that moſt
of thoſe Reaſons that ſhew how deſtructive a Reſtraint of the
Preſs is to Religious, will equally prove it to be ſo in Civil
Affairs.</p>
            <p>16. The greateſt Enjoyment that rational and ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are capable of, is to employ their Thoughts on what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
they pleaſe, and to communicate them to one another as
freely as they think them; and herein conſiſts the Dignity and
Freedom of humane Nature, without which no other Liberty
can be ſecure: for what is it that enables a few Tyrants to keep
almoſt all Mankind in Slavery, but their narrow and wrong
Notions about Government? which is owing to the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they lie under of mutually communicating, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of employing their Thoughts on political matters;
which did they do, 'tis impoſſible that the bulk of Mankind
ſhould have ſuffered themſelves to be enſlaved from Generation
to Generation. But the Arts of State, in moſt Countries, being
to enſlave the People, or to keep them in Slavery, it became a
Crime to talk, much more to write about political Matters:
and ever ſince Printing has been invented, there have been, in
moſt places, State-Licenſers, to hinder men from freely writing
about Government; for which there can be no other Reaſon,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154037:14"/>
but to prevent the Defects of either the Government, or the
Management of it, from being diſcovered and amended.</p>
            <p>17. Fame, Reputation, and Honour, as they are the greateſt
Incentives to all good and vertuous Actions, ſo they as much
terrify Men from committing baſe and unworthy ones. And it
cannot be reaſonably preſumed, conſidering the general Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, but that the rich and powerful would frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppreſs thoſe beneath them, were they not afraid of loſing
their Reputation, and expoſing themſelves either to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or Hatred of the People: for this Law of Reputation (if
I may ſo call it) influences Men more than all other Laws what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
But if there were a Licenſer of the Preſs, he might be
prevailed on not only to hinder the injured from appealing to the
People by publiſhing their Grievances, but to licenſe ſuch Stories
only as mercenary Scriblers would write to juſtify the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
and to condemn the Oppreſt: which, as it would be the
greateſt Encouragement for thoſe Men that are above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Remedies of Law to cruſh whom they pleaſe, ſo it would
be the higheſt Injuſtice to deny the injured the laſt ſatisfaction
of juſtifying their innocence to the World, which would be ſure
to paſs a juſt Cenſure on the Oppreſſors; and this they would the
more dread, becauſe if once they loſe their Credit with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they will be very unfit Inſtruments for a Court to uſe.
Therefore 'tis no wonder if all that make an ill uſe of their Power,
eſpecially thoſe who have cheated the Government as well as
abuſed the People, do endeavour with all their might to have
the Preſs regulated, leſt their Crimes being expoſed in Print,
may not only render them odious to the People, but to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
In a word, All ſorts of Men whoſe Intereſt it is not
to have their Actions expoſed to the Publick (which I am afraid
are no ſmall number) will be for reſtraining the Preſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will add Iniquity to Iniquity, by pretending they do it out
of Conſcience to ſuppreſs Immorality and Profaneneſs.</p>
            <p>18. But this is not the worſt that may happen, becauſe the
Preſs may be ſo managed, as to become a moſt powerful Engine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154037:15"/>
to overturn and ſubvert the very Conſtitution: for ſhould a
Magiſtrate ariſe with Arbitrary Deſigns in his head, no Papers
that plead the Rights and juſt Priviledges of the People would be
ſtamp'd with an <hi>Imprimatur:</hi> Then the Preſs would be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only to extend the Prerogative beyond all bounds, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
the Promoters of Arbitrary Power as the chief Patriots of
their Countrey, and to expoſe and traduce thoſe that were really
ſo; which would be the greateſt Diſcouragement not only to all
brave and vertuous Actions, but would be apt to make the
People miſtake their Friends, when they had not the Liberty to
publiſh a Vindication of their Principles or Actions, for their
Enemies. In a word, if the Pulpits and <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> (as we
have lately ſeen it) ſhould chime in with an Arbitrary Court,
what can warn the People of their Danger, except the Preſs?
But if that too be wholly againſt them, they may eaſily be ſo
blinded as not to ſee the Chains that are preparing for them, till
they are fettered beyond all power of Redemption; for there can
never be wanting a thouſand plauſible Stories, and ſeemingly
fair Pretences, to amuſe and divert them from perceiving their
real Danger. And if we look into the Hiſtory of <hi>Europe,</hi> we
ſhall find more Nations wheedled than forced out of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
tho Force afterward was neceſſary to maintain what was
got at firſt by Fraud.</p>
            <p>19. 'Tis ſo far from being impoſſible, that a People may be
thus impoſed on to their utter ruine; that 'tis probable another
Generation ſeeing nothing but the Royal Prerogative highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
may be bred up with the Opinion of being born Slaves.
And were we not almoſt brought to that paſs in the late Reigns?
when nothing came out with <hi>Allowance</hi> but what was to juſtify
ſuch Opinions; and if ſome good men (not to mention the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s third Declaration) eſpecially about the time
of the Revolution, had not had the Courage privately to print
ſome Treatiſes to undeceive the People, and to make them ſee the
fatal Conſequences of thoſe Doctrines which by the Reſtraint of
the Preſs paſs'd for divine and ſacred Truths; the Nation had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154037:15"/>
tamely ſubmitted to the yoke. And as it cannot be denyed but
that thoſe Papers in a great meaſure opened our eyes, ſo it may
juſtly be hoped that none that ſaw the miſerable Condition that
the Act for regulating the Preſs would have brought us into,
will be inſtrumental in reeſtabliſhing that Law. No, thoſe Men
ſure who ſo much exclaimed againſt it in the late Reigns, will
take all care imaginable to prevent it now. But if theſe very men
who may juſtly be ſaid to be written into their places, and owe
their Preſerments to the freedom of examining thoſe ſlaviſh Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the former Reigns; if theſe Men, I ſay, can ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
themſelves as to be for a Law which till themſelves were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
they thought tended only to inſlave us, there cannot be,
I think, a greater Argument for all others to oppoſe. We are,
God be thanked, bleſt with the Government of the beſt of Kings,
who as he hazarded every thing to reſcue our Liberties when in
the extremeſt Danger, ſo he places the Glory of his Reign in
preſerving them entire, and tranſmitting them ſo to Poſterity.
And therefore none that love his Glory can be for reſtraining the
Preſs, which now as it can ſerve to no other end than to create
Jealouſies in the People, who cannot forget what former Reigns
deſign'd by it, ſo it may hereafter hazard all our Liberties, <hi>Under
a good King we may juſtly expect ſuch Laws as will not expoſe us to,
but ſecure us from the Oppreſſions of an ill one.</hi> The beſt things
when perverted become the very worſt; as Religion it ſelf,
when it degenerates into Superſtition, ſo Printing, which in it
ſelf is no ſmall Advantage to Mankind, when it is abuſed, may
be of moſt fatal conſequence. Secure but the Liberty of the Preſs,
and that will, in all probability, ſecure all other Liberty; but
if that once falls into the hands of ill deſigning Men, nothing
that we hold dear or precious is ſafe. And experience manifeſts,
that whereſoever That of the Preſs is denied, there no other is
preſerved. Moſt Countries in <hi>Europe</hi> maintained their Freedom
tolerably well till the Invention of Printing; but when that was
ſuffered to ſpeak nothing but Court-Language, People were
by degrees gull'd and cheated of their Liberty. Had not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154037:16"/>
the late King tack'd Popery to Slavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might with the
greateſt eaſe imaginable have enſlav'd us; and methinks the
danger we have ſo miraculouſly eſcaped, ſhould fright us from
ever enacting any of thoſe Methods into a Law that ſo much
contributed to that danger.</p>
            <p>20. That which alone would engage me, were I a Senator,
to oppoſe the Reſtraint of the Preſs, is, that a Parliament is to
take cognizance of all ſorts of things which ſome Men of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen-like
Education may not have much conſidered; and
therefore the peruſing what thoſe without doors, who have
made ſuch things their buſineſs, have writ, may be none of the
worſt means of informing themſelves; but a Reſtraint of the
Preſs may in a great meaſure hinder them from receiving this
Satisfaction, becauſe Licenſers might be prevailed on to ſuffer
but one ſide to publiſh their Sentiments even in Matters of the
greateſt Conſequence. I have met with ſome Members who
have frankly owned that the incomparable <hi>Argument againſt
the Standing Army</hi> gave them great <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſight into that grand
Point, which, ſaid they, had not the Preſs been open, would
never have appeared, nor any thing on that ſide, tho a number
of Pamphlets on the other, which, with the noiſe of ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
Perfons, would in all probability have carried things
quite otherwiſe: And ſeeing they could not foreſee how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſuch things might happen, this alone, ſaid they, was
enough to convince them of the neceſſity of the Liberty of the
Preſs, ſince they could not be too ſecure of that ineſtimable
Jewel Liberty, which, if once loſt, was ſcarce ever to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
eſpecially if ſeized by a domeſtick Power.</p>
            <p>21. I doubt not but there are ſeveral well-meaning Men for
regulating the Preſs; who, did they conſider how ſubject all
things are to change, could not be apprehenſive that this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of their own contriving might be turned upon themſelves,
and made to ruin thoſe very Deſigns they thought to promote
by it. For the Preſs (as a witty Gentleman obſerves) is like
a Jackanapes, he who has him in his hands may make him bite
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154037:16"/>
whom he pleaſes, and therefore 'tis their faſeſt way to keep
their Jackanapes in their own hands. And it cannot but ſhew
a great deal of hardineſs to make ſuch a Law as may produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fatal Conſequences even to the Makers themſelves, who
will then deſerve no pity, ſince they are ſcourg'd with Rods of
their own providing; And 'tis the more probable this may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſo hereafter, ſince even at preſent ſuch a Law has but an
untoward Aſpect upon moſt Parties; for one Party, tho he is
pleaſed with it in religious, yet diſlikes it in civil Matters; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinks the contrary to be his Intereſt; a third is ſatisfied
with having ſuch or ſuch Sects reſtrained from Printing, but
would be glad that others had that Liberty; a fourth, who
cares not how all the Sectaries are dealt with, is yet afraid that
if the Preſs be in the hands of moderate Church-men, none
will be ſuffered to write any more Letters to a Convocation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a <hi>Manicipium Eccleſiaſticum,</hi> or ſuch like Books; a
fifth is afraid leſt this power ſhould get into the hands of the
rigid ones, for then the others will be run down as Trimmers,
Latitudinarians and what not. The ſame may be ſaid with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to other Religious Opinions, about which Men of the ſame
Church are divided, and the like may be as well obſerved in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Matters, but I leave every one to make that Remark for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
ſo that if all Parties caſt up their accounts, there are very
few of them but will find a Reſtraint of the Preſs to be againſt
even their preſent Intereſt.</p>
            <p>22. I might add a great number of other Reaſons, becauſe
as many things are worth knowing, ſo many Arguments there
are for the Liberty of the Preſs; what can be more uſeful than
Hiſtory, and the Knowledge of our Anceſtors Actions? A faithful
account of which can ſcarce be expected in a Reign that has a
deſign to diſguiſe Truth, and to keep us in ignorance of thoſe
noble and generous Notions our Anceſtors had of Liberty, and
how they aſſerted theirs upon all occaſions. As for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the preſent time, I ſhall only ſay, that for my own part I
ſhould be glad, eſpecially when at a diſtance from <hi>London,</hi> (and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154037:17"/>
I ſuppoſe other Country Gentlemen may be of the ſame mind)
to divert my ſelf with ſome other New-papers beſides the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette,
which would hardly be permitted if the Preſs were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
As for Books of Philoſophy, and of other Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
I can ſee no reaſon why there ſhould be any Reſtraint on
them, or why the licenſing them ſhould be intruſted with the
Clergy, as by the late Act, except it be to hinder ſuch Books
from being printed as tend moſt to inform Mens Judgment, and
make them reaſon clearly, things very dangerous to a blind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Obedience Beſides, an excellent diſcovery in Nature
may be hindered from being publiſh'd, on pretence that 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with Religion: for the time has been when aſſerting
the <hi>Antipodes</hi> has been no leſs than Hereſie; and the Motion of
the Earth a Crime worthy the Inquiſition, and with as little
Reaſon (not to mention Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s ingenious Tracts) has the
moſt uſeful Book that ever was written in Philoſophy, the <hi>Eſſay
of humane Underſtanding,</hi> been condemned as inconſiſtent with
the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion. As for <hi>Phyſick,</hi> tho the
licenſing Books therein were wholly truſted with ſome of the
Colledge, the moſt uſeful Piece in that Science, either becauſe
the Licenſers were engaged in another Method of Practice, or
becauſe it may take from their Advantage, by preſcribing a
cheaper and eaſier way of Cure, or out of Envy, or a thouſand
other Reaſons, might be hindered from ſeeing the Light, to the
no ſmall detriment not only of the Preſent, but future Ages. As
to <hi>Law,</hi> I ſhall only ſay, If there are any Abuſes crept into it,
the likelieſt way to have them reformed is not by reſtraining
the Preſs.</p>
            <p>23. Were Licenſers unbiaſt, uncorrupt, and infallible, there
might be good Reaſon to truſt them with an Arbitrary Power to
paſs what Sentences they pleas'd on Books: but if we are to
judge of the future by the paſt, they are almoſt as likely to be
one as the other, Men of Senſe, (and others ought not to be
truſted with it) without being reſolved to make the moſt of it,
will not care to be condemned to the drudgery of reading all the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154037:17"/>
Traſh that comes to be printed, nothing but neceſſity will make
ſuch Perſons ſubmit to it, and that neceſſity will make them leſs
able to withſtand Temptation. So that the appointing Licenſers
will be as bad as laying a Tax on Learning, ſince by delaying
to look over Books, eſpecially thoſe that require haſte to be
printed, and by other tricks (for there are Myſteries in all
Trades) they may make People pay what they pleaſe for their
<hi>Allowance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. But this is not the worſt, it will be a great hindrance to
the promoting of Knowledge and Truth, by diſcouraging the
ableſt Men from writing for ſuch Perſons, eſpecially after having
once had the liberty of publiſhing their own Thoughts, will not
be content to have their Works lie at the Mercy of an ignorant,
or at the beſt of an unleiſured Licenſer, who upon a curſory
view may either condemn the whole to perpetual Darkneſs, or
ſtrike out what he pleaſeth, perhaps the moſt material things.
And tho a living Author may ſubject himſelf to this, yet none
will be content that the Labours of a deceaſed Friend ſhould be
ſo ſerved; ſo that the Works of ſuch a Perſon, tho never ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in his Life-time, ſhall be loſt to all Poſterity. Beſides, is
it not intolerable, that every time a Man has a mind to make
any Alteration or Addition between the licenſing of the Copy,
and the printing it off, that he muſt as often hunt after the ſame
Licenſer to obtain his leave, for the Printer could not go beyond
his licenſed Copy, when in the mean time the Preſs, to his no
ſmall damage, muſt ſtand ſtill?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, tho there might ſeem to be ſome reaſon to condemn
a Perſon that upon a fair Trial had been found guilty of writing
immoral things, or againſt the Government, to the Puniſhment
of never writing again but under the Authority of an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner;
yet what reaſon can there be that thoſe that never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
nay that the whole Commonwealth of Learning ſhould
be ſubject to ſo ſevere Uſage, which too is the way to have
none but Fools and Blockheads plague the World with their
Impertinence, and make an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> (as it did formerly)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154037:18"/>
ſignify no more than that ſuch a Book is fooliſh enough to be
printed?</p>
            <p>'Tis objected, that without Licenſers any one may reflect on
whom he has a mind to, ſo as that moſt People ſhall be ſenſible
whom he means, tho he mention but two Letters of his Name,
or uſeth ſome other Deſcription, by which means he is out of
the reach of the Law.</p>
            <p>This may be an Argument for the forbidding all Printing,
but none for appointing Licenſers; for 'tis much more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for all to have the Liberty to vindicate themſelves the ſame
way they chance to be aſperſed, than to let the Licenſer's Party
abuſe all others, and the Preſs not open for them to juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But if any one reflects upon another after this manner,
let him make appear whom it is he means, or elſe let him be
eſteemed in Law to intend that Perſon that takes it to himſelf.</p>
            <p>This I think is all that can be objected as to Civil Matters,
except what relates to Sedition and Treaſon, for an Anſwer to
