         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Strength: Yet, I am told by my

                  <p>In this perplexity, <hi>Madam,</hi> it
pleas'd the Goodness of Heaven to

at last, those sublime and heroick
<hi>Virtues;</hi> whose perfect Conformity

is, alone, capable to convince the

such a degree of Fervor in that
Constancy, cannot possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a luke-warm Probability
<pb facs="tcp:51890:4"/>
in Faith: such frequent Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to intimate Conversations
with Heaven, such Mortifications,
and contempt of Court-Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and (which is yet harder)
such Innocence and Purity amidst
the necessary Admittances of them,
as they all conspire to speak Your
Soul Angelical, so they clearly
prove the vigorous Activity of the

the drowsy Indifferency of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

                  <p>1. He is little acquainted with the paths which
lead to Science who knows not that the
settling the <hi>First Principle</hi> in any Affair, is of
mainest Import towards Satisfaction in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
because if such a Principle be not first
settled, the whole Discourse, as relying on that
Principle for its Certainty, must needs waver
and stagger. Reflecting on this plainest Truth
and withal on the manner how very many (I wish
I might not say most) Controversies are manag'd;
that is, by debating much about diverse Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but very little about the first Principle in
<hi>Controversie,</hi> I cannot wonder if Disputes come
slowly to an <hi>End</hi> when few of them were ever
rightly <hi>begun.</hi> Another mischief and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of entire Satisfaction springs from hence;
that, seeing all Dispute Supposes an Agreement
between the Disputers in some acknowledg'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
I much fear, while things are carry'd on
this fashion, this Requisit is wanting to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Protestant Controvertists; For, neither
doth the Protestant from his heart hold (witness
the Books of their most extold Champions, and
even the 39. Articles, to the contrary) the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Fathers and Councils, Certain and
Convictive; nor even Scripture alwayes as to its
<pb facs="tcp:51890:6"/>
Letter and the Sence they give it, (for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Infallible Certainty of none of these;)
much less does the Catholick agree that private
Interpretations of Scripture, or Citations from
Fathers (not speaking as Witnesses of the
Churches Belief) are of sufficient Authority to settle
the True, or overthrow a False or pretended Faith.
Yet, notwithstanding all this, each Antagonist
permits the other to frame his Discourses upon these
Grounds as if he held the Method were good and
allowable; which not being heartily granted by
either, what satisfaction can we expect but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and fruitless contests, for want of Agreement
in some acknowledg'd Principle, while this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
is follow'd. Nay more, were it suppos'd
that both sides had agreed not to reject in their
Disputes such a Principle; yet still, however one
side might happen to foil the other so far as to
make him contradict himself, yet never so as to
convince his Tenet of falshood, unless the process
were grounded upon some First, that is, Self-evident
Principle, by virtue of whose undoubta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Certainty the Discourse built on it might gain
an establishment. Whence also, the result of this
way of Discourse can be onely the Credit or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
of the Authours; and touches not at all
the Thing; Which, without some Evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to establish or overthrow it, hovers in its pure
neutral condition of being (as to Assent or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
just a bare saying and no more.</p>
                  <p>2. The reason why the First Principle of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51890:6"/>
is not more lookt into and clear'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me evidently this, that our modern Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
from the Church and her Faith seeing
(which is common to Them with all other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of Errours) that to begin with First or self-Evident
Principles is the direct road to Science,
and therefore absolutely destructive of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
avoid as much as in them lies, the laying
any such Principles: and instead of this apply
their whole endeavours to aiery Descants upon
Words, by such means and Arts as are never likely
to give them any determinate Sence; by which
craft (the way of Science, being to proceed from
one piece of <hi>Sence</hi> to another) they carry the war
out of the bounds of Science where solid ground
is to be found to fix ones fool upon, so to
overthrow or be overthrown, and transfer it to a
kind of <hi>Spatium Imaginarium</hi> of Fancy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signifying
Sounds, the proper sphere for Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Discoursers to buz confusedly and make a noise
in; Where the Catholick must either let them
alone, and then they cry <hi>Victory;</hi> or follow them
thither, and so hazard to prejudice his own cause
by seeming to allow their method of discoursing.
Whereas indeed the Catholick is forc't by their
Importunity exciting his Charity towards the
unskilfull, to show how weakly they discourse in
their own shallow way.</p>
                  <p>3. How little faulty the Catholick is in this
will be quickly manifest, if we consider that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis
against his Principles and Involuntary in him to
<pb facs="tcp:51890:7"/>
take this Method: for, he builds not upon those
aiery Skirmishes for his Faith; nor, consequently,
esteems he it conquerable by such attempts: he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Faith from the present Church witnessing
it's delivery from the former Age; to this ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
he sticks; he stands on immemorial Possession,
nor doubts he that Christ'<hi>s</hi> Doctrin is his true and
proper inheritance, while brought down by the test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imony
of so many Christian Nations. As long as this
foundation stands firm, quirks hurt not him; Shake
this, that is, show the Church Essential is Mistress
of falshood, and he must doubt all his Faith; but
yet cannot hold the Protestants, for he must hold
nothing. No Book can secure him, when that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which onely can secure to us Books written
long ago, is insecure it self. Now, on the contrary,
the Protestant builds his Faith by thus hammering
it out of unsenc't Characters, and is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
(would his will give his reason leave to
follow his principles) if another more dexterously
fit the words to a sence inconsistent with his. And
his hopes of standing are not built (as are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks)
on the self evidence of ony <hi>Thing</hi> or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
but indeed on the Inevidence or Ambiguity of
<hi>Words</hi> and his Way to manage them; which is, to
let no Living Authority sence thew, and so they
will more easily change their shape as the ingenious
contrivances of Fancy molds them; and then, if
the discourse seem but a little plausible, Education
and Interest make the Vnderstanding content
with very easiy satisfaction.</p>

4. I am far from blaming the Catholicks prudence
for engaging on this manner; I rather admire
their Charity towards their weaker Brethren, that
at the expence of so much patience and pains, such
excellent Wits will condescend to so laborious a
talk; less sutable both to their own Genius as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
and to the nature of their Cause. How easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might they rest secure upon Immovable Possession,
and demand Evidence and Demonstration from
the Protestant, who denies his right to Christs
Doctrin? How easily might he show their reasons
inconclusive (which method was observ'd by a late
Learned Writer Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> against that Pulpit-vapour
of Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>) especially by discovering
the unsatisfactoriness of the Method they take?
How most easily, that they have never a Principle
or self evident Ground to begin with; That till
they settle such a First Principle all their Discourse
is frivolous; That their rejecting the Churches
Living Voice or Tradition brings all into doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both Sayings of Fathers and Texts of Scripture;
And hence, not to allow them the favour of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>ad hominem</hi> from Scripture or Fathers, by
granting them any thing Certain, but putting them
to prove all; For since they are to object and bring
Evident Reason for changing, it lies on them to
make their reasons Evident; nor has any Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
right to have any thing allow'd him Certain,
who renounces that Principle, which if renounct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all is Vncertain: And, lastly, that he who denies
the First Principle in any Science, deserves not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay
<pb facs="tcp:51890:8"/>
cannot in reason (abstracted from circumstances)
be discourst with at all in that Science, nor They
in <hi>Controversy.</hi> This will force them to lay some
First or self-evident Principle; which cannot fail
to produce these two Advantages; One to the
World, that it shall get into a method of concluding
something with evidence: The other to Catholick
Religion; For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>twill be found Impossible their
Reason strain'd to its utmost, can invent any other
in this matter, but that of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. This will clearly shorten our debates, and
save the laborious transcribing and Printing Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of Testimonies, by bringing <hi>Conrroversy</hi> to
the way of Reason; for the Certainty of <hi>First Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
must needs be manifested by pure Reason.
But who am I that I should attempt such a change
in the method of <hi>Controversy,</hi> or think my self a
fit proposer or presser of it? Far be it from me.
Yet, if I mistake not, Nature her self (whom I
second in this design) is about doing that work.
For, I hear Catholick Writers complain of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
(and justly too) that he puts him to answer
what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> been an hundred times said before; and
I am inform'd an Eminent Protestant now writing
in behalf of <hi>Dr Pierce,</hi> makes the same counter-complaint
of the Catholick, and the Dissuader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
his book with the same resentment: Besides,
I am sure the Best Wits of our Nation are weary of
this Method, seeing tis no more but <hi>reciprocating a
Saw,</hi> or transcribing and re-printing what has
been done before, onely in another Frame; or, if
<pb facs="tcp:51890:8"/>
any new production be made, generally tis nothing
but some note collected from some Historical book
unobserved by others; which, what satisfactory Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
tis like to bring with it, is easy to be ghest.</p>
                  <p>6. Now all this happens through not first settling
and agreeing in some First Principle. Not onely
for the reasons given in the beginning of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
but also, because (as will be shown hereafter)
without thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the validity of any Testimony from
Father or Council cannot be weigh'd, understood,
or prest with force upon the Adversary. For, if
These be but parts of the Living Voice of the Church
Essentiall of their time, that is, of Christian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it will follow that till the force of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be evidenc't, Theirs will not be clearly known.
Again, Tradition once evidenc't wil give principles
to distinguish those Citations by, and to secure (as
far as is needful) and interpret Scriptures Letter:
Whence clear Victory will accrue to Truth, and full
Satisfaction to her ingenuous Seekers Not that I
at all doubt, but that many things in Catholick
Writers of the Testimonial strain, carry 4 strong
force of Conviction with them; but I see th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> while
the solid Testimonies are not distinguisht and
solely insisted on, but run mixt with others of less
force, by such a mixture they weaken their own;
I see also that they want their effect upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
by reason he is not first prest to admit that
Evident Principle on which their strength is built;
and, which once settled, they are irresistable.</p>
                  <p>7. The settling then the First Principle in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
<pb facs="tcp:51890:9"/>
being so supremely important, I have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it. Putting this Dilemma to the Protestant.
Either <hi>Controversy</hi> (or the skill which enables us
to conclude certainly what's Faith,) is a <hi>Science,</hi>
or not; if not, why do we meddle with it; since
without Science or Knowledge, all is meer beating
the ayr and empty ignorant talking. If it be, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
seuse tells us it must be grounded on some first
and self-evident Principle. Let's to work then, and
settle this Principle, that so we may have something
to agree in and proceed upon; that is, be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
together. I have endeavoured to show the
First Principle we Catholicks proceed on establisht
on rational Grounds, and self-evident: Let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
either agree with us in it, or settle some other
able to render his Citations certain, without which
they ought alledge nothing. Nor is it enough for
them to catch at single words, or little parcels of my
Discourse, (as their way is) but, it being connected,
they must overthrow the main of it: nor that; but
they must lay some First Principle of their own, else
they ought affirm nothing, nor speak; for why should
any one say what he <hi>knows not,</hi> or how can he know
without Principles? Especially the Protestant is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to do this, who cannot stand on Possession,
but on his Reasons why he <hi>mov'd</hi> what he found
<hi>settled.</hi> This Principle then they are ty'd by all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Considerations to produce, and till they do so,
I must frankly declare what reason tells ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
man, that those many flashy books of late
against Catholicks, by whomsoever written, deserve
not a word in Answer.</p>

                  <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>s common Reason gives it evident,
that no satisfaction at all can be had
in any point whatever without
knowing first the Meaning of those
Words which express the Thing under debate,
since without this the discoursers must talk of
they know not what; so the Art of Logick assures
us that, the Meaning of those Words exactly
known, a ready way is open'd to a clear decision
of the most perplexing difficulties. For, seeing
<hi>the Meaning of a Word</hi> includes in it self <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Thing</hi> as signified by that Word, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it could not mean <hi>That Thing,</hi> unless it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
meant it of <hi>such a Nature</hi> which constitutes
<hi>that Thing,</hi> so tis plain that, the Meaning of the
Word once known perfectly, the Nature of the
Thing, as signify'd by that word, must be known
likewise. Wherefore, since the Nature of the
Thing bears along with it all those Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Attributes which intrinsecally belong to
such a Nature, and excludes all those which are
incompetent to the same Nature, it acquaints us
with what can be both <hi>said</hi> and <hi>deny'd</hi> of the
Thing, as far as exprest by that word. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge then of the Meaning of the Words
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51890:10"/>
affords us the certain solution of all questions
whether Affirmative or Negative, and is the
most compendious way to settle all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
Let us therefore apply this method to our
present purpose, and examin well what is meant
by those Words which express the thing we are
discussing, namely THE RULE OF FAITH; and
we may with good grounds expect a solid, clear,
and brief satisfaction both of what is not that
Rule, and what is It.</p>
                  <p>2. To begin then with what is most evident;
Seeing a Rule signifies a thing which is able to
<hi>regulate</hi> or guide him who uses it, it must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
have in it all those Qualities by which
it is able to do that it's proper Effect; otherwise
'tis no Rule, that is, 'tis not apt or able to do what
a Rule should do.</p>
                  <p>3. It must then in the first place be <hi>Evident as
to its Existence;</hi> unto the <hi>Sense,</hi> if it be to guide
<hi>it;</hi> or to the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> if it be an <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi>
Rule. For, how should either of these be
guided by what they neither see nor know?</p>
                  <p>4. Whence follows that it must be Evident to
all those who are to be regulated by it, that there
is such a Thing; otherwise it can be to them no
Rule; since, being unknown, it reaches not, or
affects not those persons who are to be ruled by
it; that is, reaches not those things upon which
it is to do its Effect; and so, cannot rule them, or
be a Rule to them.</p>
                  <p>5. Moreover, to those who can raise doubts or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51890:10"/>
can have doubts raisd in them, (that is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all Mankind, even the Rudest Vulgar) it
must be knowable that the Intellectual Rule they
are to be regulated by, has in it self a virtue to
rule or guid their understandings right; That
is, they must be capable to know that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be reli'd on as a Rule. Wherefore, this
must either be evident by its own light, or at
least easily evidenceable by other knowledges or
skills presupposed in those users of Reason, who
are to be guided by that Rule. Otherwise, 'tis
against Sense and Reason to yield over ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to be guided by that which he can
never come to understand that it has in it any
ability or power to guide him.</p>
                  <p>6. And, because nothing can be evident to
be what in reality it is not, it follows that this
Thing pretending to be a Rule, must also be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in it's self,</hi> or establisht on secure Grounds:
For otherwise, 'tis not possible that can in true
sence be call'd a <hi>Rule,</hi> which one may follow and
yet go wrong, or be missed. The Directive
Power then which it has must not be wavering;
Wherefore also the causes which conserve it so
constantly able to perform that Effect must be
established too to that degree as to keep it fitting
to do the effect proper to its Nature; which is,
to be <hi>certain in its self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Thus much is evidently gathered out of the
common Notion or Nature of a <hi>Rule;</hi> That is,
out of the genuin and proper meaning of that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51890:11"/>
single word. We are next to consider the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word FAITH. By which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to give rigorous School-definitions of
either this or the former word; but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on and make use of some Attributes, Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
or Properties; which in the sence of such
who intelligently use those words are apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be involved in or truly appertaining to
their signification. This caution given to avoid
mistake or cavil, let's enquire of what kind of
Nature that thing is which is meant by this
word FAITH, and then reflect what further
qualifications it requires in it's <hi>Rule,</hi> that is, in
the Certain Means which is to guide us to that
Knowledge called <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. FAITH then in the common sence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is the same with <hi>Believing;</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith</hi>
in the sence of the generality of Christians (from
whom, as being the intelligent users of that word,
the true sence of it is taken) <hi>the Believing God in
reveal'd Truths,</hi> which necessarily imports some
kind of <hi>Knowledge of super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atural Things.</hi> Again,
it being evident and held by those Christians that
none can come to Heaven without <hi>knowing</hi> there
is such a thing, or some very great Good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for the next life; nor yet without <hi>loving</hi> it,
(for none is thought to go to Heaven whether he
will or no) which Love, besides the Knowledge
that Heaven <hi>is,</hi> cannot be had without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise that 'tis a Good incomparably great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than any in this life; nor can these Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51890:11"/>
be had by <hi>Mankind</hi> but by <hi>Believing;</hi>
hence, <hi>Belief of Supernatural things,</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> is
conceived <hi>necessary for the salvation of Mankind.</hi>
Nor is this found only in the Judgements the
learneder Faithful make concerning it by their
Discourse, but in the very Meaning of the word
<hi>Faith</hi> as it imports <hi>Knowledge of super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atural
things.</hi> It being then granted by all and in it
self most rational that some at least of the vulgar
are to be saved, that is, are to have <hi>Faith</hi> or
<hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> it follows that the Rule of
Faith or certain means to arrive at Faith must be
appliable to them.</p>
                  <p>9. Moreover, since the ruder or unskilfuller
people are, the lesse capable they are of Science,
and none doubts but some, amongst even the
rudest, may come to be saved, since we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
they have oftentimes well-meaning, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and devout hearts; the Rule or Means to
come to Faith must also be appliable to these;
that is, must be such as even the rudest may be
capable to know there is such a thing.</p>
                  <p>10. The Rule of Faith therefore must be
Knowable as to it's Existence by natural impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon mens Senses, affecting their Souls ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common light of understanding.
For, seeing the rudest are very shallow Reflecters
and Discoursers, and suppos'd to be utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any kind of Skill got by Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Study, the Knowledge of the Rule of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51890:12"/>
Faith's Existence must not need any skill or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
acquir'd by Study, intervening between
the natural power of their Understanding and It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
otherwise it could not be Knowable by them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
be to them a Rule, by parag. 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
                  <p>11. Again, seeing those who are very rude are
yet capable of being put into Doubts concerning
their Faith, either by Sophistry or fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Language,
and at length deserting it; and 'tis most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
there should be no means lest by God
sufficient to settle them; nor can any Means be
sufficient if the Rule of Faith (which is the best
if not only Means to come to the Knowledge of
Faith) be dissatisfactory, or impossible to be
shown worthy to be rely'd on; it follows that
the Rule of Faith must be of such a nature as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
either by its own light evidently secure and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be held a Rule, and this even to the rudest
who can doubt; or else easily evidenceable to
them to be such by intelligent persons who art
vers'd in such reflexions, and this out of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
they are capable of, (as was prov'd parag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) that is, requiring onely common and

them. Otherwise those rude persons would

                     </gap>ast in
their Faith.</p>
                  <p>12. Also, since the Notion of the word <hi>Faith</hi>
bears, that 'tis a perfection of the Soul, or a
Virtue, and so no act of it <hi>irrational,</hi> but on the
contrary, all its Acts rational, and the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51890:12"/>
of onr Understandings exercisd in it <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabile
obsequium,</hi> 'tis evinc't that the Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines
of its Rule, ought not onely to be evident
or easily evidenceable to the rudest Doubters,
as we now prov'd, but also it ought to be so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd,
that the Faithful who yet have no doubts
should do rationally even while they simply or
unreflectingly adhere to it, and that it should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to their common and uncultivated Reason
by a natural way what it wants of reflexion: I
mean, so that the common light of Reason may
tell them, upon solid and true Principles taught
them by the ordinary course of things in the
World, this is to be held or followed, thongh
they dive not into the Grounds or particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their tenets or actions, nor can give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them.</p>
                  <p>13. And, since our Saviour intended those out
of the Church should embrace <hi>Faith,</hi> and those
who are to be converted are Heterodox, that is,
hold contradictorily to the Church, in what they
dissent from her; so that if they change, they
must now hold <hi>is,</hi> indead of <hi>is not,</hi> or <hi>is not</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>is</hi> (there being no middle to hold to)
in those points in which they differ from her, and
no change ought to be in reason or in a rational
Nature (of which Nature those Heterodox are)
without true reason to change, and the change
in our case is to be made not to a meer Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is believing nothing, nor to a middle
between <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> but to a contrary or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Evident to us,</hi> and consequently CERTAIN.</p>
                  <p>14. Moreover, there being many Eminent
Wits in the Chutch vers'd in true Logick &amp; enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Sciences, and true Logick and the course of
Science necessarily telling them that nothing can
in perfect reason be <hi>held</hi> by one who penetrates

or Conclusions necessarily deduced by intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
mediums from those Principles, nor can they
be necessarily deduced without immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
or Identification of the Terms with the
Medium which infers the Identity between
themselves in the Conclusion, and that what is
not seen to be thus connected is <hi>unknown,</hi> and so,
for any thing appears, may be false; and to see a
thing may be false, must needs breed some Fear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51890:13"/>
of being so, or Doubt, if we be concerned in the
Truth or Falsitie of that thing, and none can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
assent or fix their judgment where there
is left some Doubt or wavering of Judgment,
and the Judgement or Assent of Faith must be

(which is the immediate Producer and Cause of
the Assent of Faith) ought to be of that Nature
that it must not onely be plain to the ruder sort,
but also contain in it self Seeds of <hi>perfect evidence</hi>
to satisfy those learned Persons who shall more
narrowly examin it: Otherwise the best and
wisest portion, and as it were the flower of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which guide themselves by perfect reason,
could <hi>hold</hi> nothing or have no Faith; That is the
Church must onely be made up of ignorant and
undiscerning persons; which would make her
little better than a Congregation of Phanaticks.</p>
                  <p>15. Especially the Church having many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
skild in natural Sciences, who will not
stick to oppose her all they can, and conquer her
too, could they take any just advantage against
her; and no greater advantage being possible to
be gained or more deadly wound to be given her
than to prove her Faith <hi>uncertain,</hi> which is done
by showing the Ground of it as far as concerns
our Knowledge, that is the Rule and Means to
come to Faith, possible to be false; For this at
once enervates her Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vilifies her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
weakens all the motives to the love of
Heaven, which she proposes, and by consequence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51890:14"/>
quite enfeebles the vigour of Christian Life;
or rather, this made manifest, by reason of
temptations to the Love of Creatures perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and on all sides besieging us, endangers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
it utterly; and, lastly, makes Christians
the most ridiculous people in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
such high mysteries above their reasons
upon uncertain Grounds: Tis manifest therefore
that the only safeguard and all the strength of
the Church and Christian Religion is placed in
the absolute Certainty of the Rule of Faith: Tis
made therefore and ordained to ascertain Faith;
that it, it has in it what is fit for this end; that is,
it is of its own nature <hi>absolutely certain;</hi> that is,
absolute Certainty is found in the nature and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> or, which is all one, is
signified or meant by those words thoroughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
                  <p>16. And lastly, Faith being a Virtue mainly
conducing to Bliss (as is seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> §. 8.) and its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
towards Bliss (which we call its <hi>Merit</hi>)
consisting in this that it makes us submit our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to the Divine Veracity and by that
means adhere unwaveringly to such Truths as
raise us to Heaven, so that the Divine Authority
apply'd is the Principal Cause or Motive of this
submission, assent or adhesion; and every Cause
producing its effect better and stronglier by how
much the nearer and closer 'tis apply'd, and all
the application of it to us consisting in the Rule
of Faith, whose office it is to derive down to us
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51890:14"/>
those doctrines Christ taught and to assure us
that Christ said them; and the application of a
thing closely to a Judging Power being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>Certifying</hi> it, which makes it <hi>sink</hi> into it
&amp; become an intimate Act of that Power, whereas
Uncertainty can only admit it to swim as it were
upon the surface of the Soul, much after the
manner of a bare Proposal or simple apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or at best as a Probability, not having
weight enough of motive to settle deep into its
solid substance which is Cognoscitive and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
there a fixt Judgement; it follows that the
Virtue of Faith and its Merit are incomparably
advantaged by the absolute Certainty of the
Rule of Faith and very feeble and inefficacious
without it. This Rule then must be <hi>absolutely-Certain</hi>
of its own nature, that is, the notion
of <hi>absolutely-Certain</hi> is involv'd in the Rule of
Faith.</p>
                  <p>17. Summing up then the full account of our
Discourse hitherto it amounts to this that out of
the genuine meaning of the word <hi>Rule</hi> which as
used by us denotes an <hi>Intellectual Rule,</hi> &amp; much
more out of the meaning of the word <hi>Faith</hi> it is
clearly evinced that the Rule of Faith must have
these several conditions; namely, it must be
plain and self-evident as to its Existence to all
(§. 3, 4, 9, &amp; 10.) &amp; Evidenceable as to its Ruling
Power to enquirers even the rude vulgar (§. 5.
&amp; 11.) apt to settle &amp; justify undoubting persons
(§. 12.) to satisfy fully the most Sceptical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51890:15"/>
(§. 13.) and rational Doubters (§. 14.)
and to convince the most obstinate and acute
Adversaries, (§. 15.) built upon unmoveable
Grounds, that is Certain in it self, (§. 6. 15,
16.) and absolutely ascertainable to us (§. 5,
11, 13, 14.)</p>

                  <head type="sub">Showing the two first Properties of the Rule
of Faith utterly incompetent to Scripture.</head>
                  <p>1. HAving attained so clear a Description of
the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> and acquaintance with
it by particular marks, we may with reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
good hopes of knowing it when we meet
it: Especially, not having a great croud from
which we are to single it out, the pretenders to
that title being very few; and, indeed, but two
are owned, namely Tradition and Scripture;
though if we look narrowly into it, the Private
Spirit, Private Reason, Testimonies of Fathers,
or whatsoever else is held the ascertainer of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
sence ought to have a place among the
pretenders to be the Rule of Faith; since tis
those which are thought to give the reliers on
them all the security they have of <hi>Gods sence,</hi> that
is, of Points of Faith, and so are or ought to be
to them a Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51890:15"/>
2. But, to speak to them in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
who say Scripture is their Rule, we must
premise this Note, that they cannot mean by
<hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>Sence</hi> of it, that is, the things to be
known, for those they confess are the very
Points of Faith, of which the Rule of Faith is to
ascertain us: When they say then that <hi>Scripture
is the Rule of Faith,</hi> they can onely mean by the
word SCRIPTURE, that Book not yet senc't or
interpreted, but as yet <hi>to be senc't;</hi> that is, such
and such Characters in a Book with their Aptness
to signifie to them assuredly Gods Mind, or ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them of their Faith: For, abstracting from
the <hi>sence</hi> or <hi>actual signification</hi> of those words,
there is nothing imaginable left but those <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi>
with their <hi>Aptness</hi> to signifie it.</p>
                  <p>This understood, let us apply now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Rule of Faith to Scriptures Letter,
that we may see how they will fit.</p>
                  <p>3. And the first thing that occurrs is its Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
or <hi>An est;</hi> that is, whether those Books pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be Gods Word bee indeed <hi>Scripture,</hi>
that is, written by men divinely inspired; Of
which 'tis most manifest the very rudest sort
cannot be Certain by Self-evidence, nor can it be
easily evidenceable to those Doubters that are
the ordinary sort of the Vulgar by any skill they
are capable of; nor even to more curious and
speculative Scarchers but by so deep an inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the sence of it as shall discover such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
that Philosophy and Human Industry
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51890:16"/>
could never have arrived to. Besides, all the
seeming Contradictions must be solved ere they
can out of the bare nature of the Letter conclude
the Scripture to be of Gods enditing, and so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be a Rule; to solve which literally, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and satisfactorily, the memories of so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which made them clearer to those of the
Age in which they were written and the matter
known, must needs be so worn out by tract of
time, that tis one of the most difficult tasks in the
World. The Scriptures Letter then is not the
Rule of Faith (by § 3, 4, 5, 10, 11. of our former
Discourse) as wanting Self-evidence of its Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
Easie Evidenceableness of its Ruling Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and Power to establish and satisfie at least
unlearned Doubters.</p>
                  <p>4. Secondly, were it known that there are
some Books left written by men divinely inspired,
yet it is unknown how many those Books ought
to be, and which of the many controverted
ones may securely be put in that Catalogue,
which not: Which 'tis most palpable that either
few or at least the rude vulgar and common sort
of Mankind, (especially those who are not yet
Faithful, but looking to come to Faith, which
is done by knowing <hi>the Rule of Faith)</hi> can never
be assured of, either by Self-evidence of the
things themselves, or by other skills they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
possest of. The Scripture's Letter then is
from this Head concluded defective in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Properties necessarily belonging to
the Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51890:16"/>
5. Thirdly, Were the Catalogue of the true
Books known, yet how is it self-evident or easily
evidenceable to the capacities above named (if
to any) that the very Original or a perfectly true
Copy of these Books was preserved indeficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entire, out of which our Translations were
made? Can the ruder sort either know this or be
assured of the skill of others by which they
know it? The former being manifestly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the later equally such; since they have no
knowledges in their heads enabling them to
judge unerringly of the competency of others
skill in such a particular. Wherefore, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Letter faulters still in the primary, most
necessary and essential conditions of a <hi>Rule of
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Fourthly, Were it evident that the right
Original or true Copy of it is preserved indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
yet very few, that is, onely those who are
perfect in those ancient Languages, can arrive to
the understanding so much; The rest, which are
in a manner all Mankind, must come to the
knowledge of it by Translations; and, ere they
can think it is fit to be a Rule, they must know
it is rightly translated; For which, because they
have no skill in those Languages themselves, they
must rely on the Translators skill: Concerning
whose sufficiency of understanding to be able to
translate unerringly right, and honesty of Will
or true intention to do it, themselves, at least
the rudest vulgar, are not qualified enough to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51890:17"/>
jndge assuredly, that they are worthy to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
relied on. So that we are still at a loss
in this pretended Rule of Faith for our first and
fundamental conditions.</p>
                  <p>7. Fifthly, Let us pass by all these defects,
and grant it most truly translated to a tittle (and
indeed to a tittle it should be, else an errour
may slip in instead of a Point of Faith, for any
thing the bare Letter can assure us) yet the
innumerable Copiers before Printing, and since
Printers and Correcters of the Press are still ro be
relyed on: and they onely can have evidence of
the right Letter of Scripture, who stood at their
elbows attentively watching they should not
erre in making it perfectly like a former Copy;
And even then why might they not mistrust their
own eyes and aptness to oversee? Or, were it
granted these men err'd not, nor themselves in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking
them, yet the same difficulty occurrs
concerning the former Printer's care if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Copy were printed, or the Scriveners if
Manuscript, which scapes the view of our now-livers,
except we will examin them again
from Impression to Impression, or from Copy to
Copy by others more ancient; and still let us
run as high as we will the same difficulty pursues
us. To which if we add that the Printers, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recters
or Transcribers might hap to be Knaves;
and either be Hereticks themselves or brib'd by
Hereticks, whose manner it being ever to make
the Letter of the Scripture their weapon, they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51890:17"/>
could wish no greater advantage than to have it
fram'd commodious to their hand, and so would
questionless endeavour it, and History assures us
they did. So that we are still at the same or a
greater loss in our pretended Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>8. Lastly, were all this multitude of Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
pardon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, still we are as far to seek, unless
those who are to be rul'd and guided by the
Scriptures Letter to Faith were Certain of the
true sence of it, which is found out by right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
Now the numerous Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
upon it and infinite disputes about the sence
of it even in most concerning points, as in that
of Christ's Divinity, beat it out so plain to us
that this is not the task of the vulgar (who yet
are capable of salvation, and so of Faith, and
so of the Rule of Faith) that 'tis perfect phrenzy
to deny it.</p>
                  <p>9, It may be alledg'd that some of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
may be provided against by skill in History.
But 'tis quickly reply'd, that then none can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of their Rule of Faith, nor consequently
have Faith, unless skill'd in Histories or knowing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hose men to be so, and withall unbyast, whom

                     </gap>hey converse with; nay, without knowing that
those men knew certainly the Historians whom
they rely'd on had secure Grounds, and not bare
hearsay for what they writ, and that they were
not contradicted by others either extant or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ish't:
now, how few of the unlearned vulgar,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay even of the middle sort of prudent men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51890:18"/>
which make up the generality of the world, I
may say, of very good Scholars, can judge of
these points? And, if they cannot, how then is
their Faith rational or virtuous and not rather an
hair-brain'd opinionative rashness to build their
Assent, Faith and Salvation upon Principles
they can make no Judgement of?</p>
                  <p>10. If necessity make some willing to reply
what their Judgments naturally flowing from
their Principles would not, that <hi>God assists his
Church,</hi> and therefore his Providence will take
care the contingencies their Rule of Faith, the
Scripture's Letter, is subject to, shall be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
'tis ask't, how they are certain, in their way,
of such an Assistance, but by the Letter of the
Scripture? They must first then prove that Certain,
ere they mention the Church or God's Assistance
to her; since this Assistance is, in their Grounds,
founded upon the Truth and Certainty of that
Letter. Besides, a Church is a Congregation of
the Faithful, that is, of such as have <hi>Faith;</hi>
which not being possible to be had without Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
means to come unto it, or the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi>
it follows that the first thing that must be clear'd
is the Certainty of the Rule of Faith; antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to the Notions of <hi>Faith, Faithful</hi> or
<hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. If Testimonies out of <hi>Councils</hi> or Fathers
be alledg'd by them sufficient Interpreters of
Scripture, tis reply'd that if those be needful to
make a Certain Interpretation of Scripture, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51890:18"/>
(which is all one) the Letter of Scripture certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
significative of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s sence; then, First, none
can be capable of the Rule of Faith, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of Faith, but those who are read in
Councils and Fathers: nor yet, unless those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
be held Infallible in such an office;
which none but Catholiks will say; for if they
can erre in such a performance, how shall we be
certain they do not erre in each particular Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
without some other Guide to establish
them and secure us; which Guide must be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in such an affair, else the same question
and doubt returns concerning It: And, if there
be some other infallible Guide whose constant
direction secures them from erring in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Interpretation and ascertains us of the
same, let them name It, not Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
to interpret Scripture by. But the third and
most Fundamental fault is that a <hi>Father,</hi> as the
word is commonly us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, and now taken by us,
signifies not a <hi>Doctor</hi> or learned Deducer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
by human learning, nor a <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi>
upon Scripture, nor a <hi>Preacher</hi> or Homily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
(for so every Doctor, Commentator and
Preacher would be a <hi>Father</hi>) but an <hi>Eminent
and Knowing Witnesser to Posterity of the sence and
Faith of the Church</hi> which he received: The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then of CHURCH is presupposd to the
knowledge of what is meant by the word <hi>Father,</hi>
or to the notion of a Father. Again, a <hi>Council</hi>
signifies a <hi>Representative of the Church,</hi> whence,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51890:19"/>
'tis Relative to what it represents, and so its
meaning cannot be known unless that others to
which it relates be first understood; nor can
it be a true and right Council unless what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
be a true Church. Both <hi>Council</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and <hi>Father</hi> presuppose the notion of <hi>Church;
Church</hi> presupposes the notion of <hi>Faithful;
Faithful</hi> the notion of <hi>Faith; Faith,</hi> of <hi>the Rule
of Faith;</hi> 'Tis most evident then that, in the
way of generating Faith, the knowledge of the
<hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is antecedent to the knowledge of
all these; and so none of these cau help one,
who discourses orderly and rationally, to the
Knowledge of the Rule of Faith, unless acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally;
as it may happen a Father may be a
Doctor or great Schollar; and so by a rational
discours opening the meanings of the words
(or, which is all one, the notion or nature of
the Things) give us insight to know what it is
which has the properties of such a Rule. In
vain therefore do they strive to piece out the
sufficiency of Scripture's Letter to be the Rule
of Faith by those helps; since the being of that
Rule is presuppos'd entire in it self before their
existence, and indeed is that which gives them
all the Being they have.</p>
                  <p>12. Some may reply that Fundamentals are
clear in Scripture. But, first, a certain Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Fundamentals was never given and
agreed to by sufficient Authority; and yet
without this all goes to wrack; since the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51890:19"/>
or not-knowing which be Fundamental
hazards to ruine all: For the discourse grows
ticklish when we talk of <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word importing that any one left out or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
overthrows the whole End of Faith to those
which miscarry in it. Secondly, is it a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
that Christ is God? If so, I ask whether
this be clearer in Scripture than that God has
hands, feet, nostrils and passions like ours?
Seeing then the appearing clearness of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
letter in this later point is certain to lead
vulgar heads into exceeding great Errours, and
that Heresies are as seemingly clear in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
face of it as Fundamental Truths, how
mistaken a Principle do they relie upon for the
main hinge of their salvation, who say that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
are so clear in Scripture's Letter to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
capacity.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the Three next Properties of the Rule
of Faith are utterly Incompetent to Scripture.</head>
                  <p>1. THus much to show that the Letter of
Scripture wants the two first and most
Fundamental Conditions of a Rule of Faith;
being neither Evident as to it's Existence to all,
nor Evidenceable as to its Ruling Power to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Enquirers. Let us proceed to the third
Property, namely, its <hi>Aptness to settle and justify
those unlearned persons who rely undoubtingly
upon it,</hi> such as are the meaner sort of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
who take things by course as they fall, in
a natural kind of way without reflecting upon
them and their reasons.</p>
                  <p>2. Since then no Man or rational Creature can
be justifiable either for Assent or Practice but by
proceeding upon some Principles, and such as,
to his best judgment, he takes to be true ones
and those Principles can be but of two sorts
<hi>viz.</hi> either inbred in him by the ordinary Light
of Nature, call'd <hi>Common Sence,</hi> or got by some
reflexion; and that the persons we speak of are
such as proceed undoubtingly, that is, without
occasion to reflect; 'tis left that what can justify
them must be Principles of <hi>Common Sence.</hi>
Seeing then 'tis both against all Principles of
Common Sence to judge that themselves have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51890:20"/>
any self-assurance of the Scripture's Letter,
knowing themselves utterly ignorant when 'twas
writ, by whom, how brought down, &amp;c. and
equally senceless to <hi>believe</hi> a multitude which
sayes it may possibly erre in what it tells them,
it follows that they are left unjustify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such a Rule; That is, condemn'd by the
best judgments they are Masters and capable
of. This, I say, follows in case this multitude
be truly dealt with, and that the Teachers give
them a sincere account of their own Tenet.
Nay, should these men say they cannot erre in
such a matter, by reason of their great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lership,
as skill in History, Languages, reading
of Fathers, Councils, and such like, yet even
then they could not afford them credit to such a
degree as to build their hopes of salvation on
their word, in regard those learned mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is not of plain Sensations by their Eyes
and Ears which the vulgars experience capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
them to judge of, but of such high skills
as unlearned men know not what to make of,
and even understand not what the very words
which express them mean. The best then they
can do is to hope that perhaps those men may

their uncultivated Reason can give them of the
goodness of Christian Doctrin and its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Bliss. But the main is, when they shall hear
and see many several Professions all pretending
to Scripture, yet all differ, damn and condemn
one another, perhaps persecute one another and
fight about Religion, and themselves unable to
judge which is most to be trusted; what can
common Sense dictate to them but an inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
blunder, and onely clear to them thus
much that that can never be the way which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
follow and yet many must needs be misled:
Their most vulgar reason easily telling them that
there can be but one Truth, that is, that all the
other Professors to follow Scripture do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
believe and speak false. Now these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Scholars of plain down right Nature, &amp; that
of her lowest form too, being unable to judge
which truly follow the Scripture's Letter; and
onely capable to know they all profess it with
Words and Actions expressing the greatest seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the world; are to think that all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mean to follow it to their power. Whence,
their common reason will tell them (though they
cannot express it in our terms, or defend it) that
meerly for want of Light, that is Evidence in the
Directive Power of that Rule, they all but one
party (and perhaps that too as well as the rest)
go most miserably astray. This third Property
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51890:21"/>
then of the Rule of Faith, namely, <hi>to justify the
undoubting vulgar,</hi> is wanting to Scriptures
Letter.</p>
                  <p>3. There follows the fourth Property of the
Rule of Faith, which is that it must be <hi>able</hi> of
its own nature <hi>to satisfy the most Sceptical dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and rational doubters</hi> that the Doctrin it
holds forth came from Christ. To make a true
conceit of what may be judg'd sufficient for this
End, let us reflect on the nature and temper of
such Dissenters and Doubters, and we shall
quickly discover that they are men given to stir
their thoughts by much reflexion and to call
them to a strict account ere they yield them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to Assent: Wherefore, if we suppose them
true to their own thoughts and not to betray the
Light of their Reason to some Passion (in which
case their Faith it self were in them a Vice) we
cannot imagin that any thing under Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can bind and restrain those active and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Souls from fluttering still in Objections and
hovering in doubts when their Eternal Good is
concern'd: Especially, when an Authority is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
scanning, upon whose word they are bound,
after they have approv'd it, to believe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cievable
and unheard of things, above the reach
of human Reason &amp; Apprehension. Let now any
man go about to demonstrate to those great wits
these points, That the Scripture's Letter was
writ by men divinely inspir'd, That there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a real one however there may be many seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51890:22"/>
Contradictions in it, and this to be shown
out of the very Letter it self; That just this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
or number of Books is enough for the
Rule of Faith, and no one Necessary that
was lost, none be abated; or, if so, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
That the Originals out of which the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
were made, were entire and uncorrupted;
That the first Translations were skilfully &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, and afterwards deriv'd down sincere,
notwithstanding the errableness of thousands of
Transcribers, Printers, Correcters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
the malice of antient Hereticks and Jews who
had it in their hands: And, lastly, That this,
and this onely is the true sence of it; to which
is requisite great skill in <hi>Languages</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the meaning of words; in <hi>Grammar,</hi> to
know what meaning they should generally beat
according to its Rules as thus construed or put
together; <hi>Criticism,</hi> to know what a word doe

to avoid equivocation in words, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
which are to be taken properly, which

both Speculative and Moral; which (by
the way) supposes Faith and comes after it, and
so cannot be presuppos'd to the Rule of Faith
which precedes it. Let any man, I say, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to demonstrate all these difficult Points ro
those acute men and will they not smile at his
endeavors? since most of them that concern the
truth of the Letter are such that we want Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to go about to evidence them; and the
rest so obscure that a searching and sincere wit
would still find something to reply to rationally,
or at least maintain his ground of Suspence with
a <hi>Might it not be otherwise?</hi> And, were some
one or two of these points demonstrable, yet who
sees not it is a task of so long study that a great
part of a man's life would be spent in a wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and hopeless endeavour to come to Faith
by this tedious method; which would both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invite
to a pursuit; and even a diligent man may
in likelihood die ere he could rationally embrace
any Faith at all. Faith then being intended for
a man to lead his life by, 'tis necessary it's Rule
and the means to come to it should be easily vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
by reason of it's Certainty and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
over the shock of Doubts or the assaults of
Intellectual Fears. In which the Scripture's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being defective, 'tis plain that 'tis far from the
Nature of a Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>4. The same discourse holds to prove that the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51890:23"/>
Scripture's Letter is not <hi>convictive of the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and acute Adversaries,</hi> which is the fifth
Property of the Rule of Faith. Yet, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this more lively, let us imagin it apply'd to
practice, and that some Text of Scripture were
quoted to convince a <hi>Deist</hi> in some point. He
asks how you are certain that Book is God's
word? You alledge the Excellencies of it; which
indeed are such that eyes already enlighten'd by
true Faith may discern something in it above
nature, and cry, <hi>Digitus D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i est hîc,</hi> though not
his dim sight: He answers that many parts of it
are indeed very excellently good, but that the
Devil can transform himself into an Angel of
Light. On the other side he requites your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
with many strange Absurdities and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
even by your own confession in the open
Letter as it lies, and most unworthy God; as
that he has hands feet and passions like ours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which he is variable. He finds you
direct Text against acknowledg'd Science in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
particulars, and reckons up a multitude of
Contradictions to his Judgment. You answer
that those places are understood according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
apprehension, and are indeed incompetent
to God, but that there are mystical and spiritual
meanings couch't in those sacred Oracles, which
with the help of History would reconcile those
seeming Contradictions. He cries, you quite
abandon your pretended Rule, that since you
confess Heresies are in the open Letter taken as it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51890:23"/>
lies, you must have some Knowledge in your
Head concerning God which makes you decline
the sence of the words as they lie and run to gloss
them; and demands whence you came by those
tenets which oblige you to correct the plain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
challenging your thoughts and carriage as
witnesses that that which imbu'd you antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
with those contrary Tenets, not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's
Letter, was your true Rule of Faith; in
regard you frame It according to the Interest of
those foreheld Tenets. He pressingly therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
whence you had those Tenets or Points of
Faith by which you guide your self in adhering or
not adhering to the Scripture's Letter as it lies?</p>
                  <p>5. If you say, from other places of Scripture
controlling plainly the others; he replies, this
can onely make you acknowledge Scripture's
Letter plainly contradicts it self, and so leaves
you doubtful which side to hold, as far as the
bare Letter carries you; or, if it invites you to
any thing, 'tis to hold both sides of the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
What therefore he still demands is, what
it is which forelaid those Judgements in you by
which you were byast beyond the power of the
Letters Indifferency to hold one side rather than
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he other? Here you are at a loss with your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>retence of the Letter's Authority, being gone
beyond it. If then you recurr to Reason and
Science, teaching you that God is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
a Spirit, &amp;c. he straight replies, Then that
Science taught you that Point whether Scripture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51890:24"/>
had been or no. It therefore was your Rule in
this, (and the same may be said of what-ever
you avail your self to interpret Scriptute by)
not the <hi>Letter.</hi> If you say you rely on the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or Skill of your Parents, Forefathers, and
Pastours, then their skill which ascertaind them
of Gods sence (not Scripture's Letter) was their
Rule, and so is likewise yours; for whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
on any precisely as skilful, relies in very deed
and properly on their skill, and not on the Letter
their skill works upon. Besides, oue not skilful
himself, is a bad Judge how far anothers skill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.
If you say you rely not on their skill,
(fallible perhaps in them, and obscure to you)
but on their Senses enabling them to be knowing
Witnesses of what was delivered them, and free
from the former exceptions, you are driven for
your last refuge to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and still desert your
Letter-Rule. In a word, he challenges the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
of your most inward thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(however in Controversies against others
you quote Scripture, yet) in reading the Letter
for your own Faith, you bring not along with
you some thoughts to interpret it by, which you
are resolved to hold to; and so the Scriptures
Letter lies before you as matter to work on, so as
to preserve it significative of what you judge
sound, and not to frame your Judgements by;
that is, you use it as a thing <hi>ruled,</hi> not as a <hi>Bule.</hi>
Nay more, if you look narrowly into the bottome
of those Thoughts, you shall discover the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51890:24"/>
method of Tradition to have at unawares set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
your Judgements concerning Faith, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
guiding you in the Interpretation, however
when your other Concerns awake design in you,
you protest against it, and seem perhaps to your
unreflecting self to embrace and hold to the
meer guidance of the Letter.</p>
                  <p>6. Again, Waving the insufficiency of the
Scriptures Letter to declare its own sence, he asks
this smart question, how you are certain of the
Truth of the Letter in this very Text; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
your certain proof or demonstration either
either for the Thing, or for the Certainty of the
Authority upon which you hold that any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Text you alledge is truly a part of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
Letter, and not foisted in, or some way
altered in its significativeness: or, how you know
by the diligence of the Letter-examiners, if it be
a negative Proposition, that the particle <hi>not</hi> was
not inserted; if affirmative, not left out. You
alledge Consent of all our Copies: He replies,
first, that this onely argues that those ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
whence ours came were alike (perhaps not
so much) but who knows or can undertake that
they were not alike faulty, or alike Unlike the
true Original? or, that there were not some in
those dayes which never came to our knowledge,
different from ours in the very point between us?
In a word, that all depends on the Truth of the
Copies immediately taken from the Original, or
the very next to them; which, what they were,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51890:25"/>
by whom taken, where and how preserved from
time to time, how narrowly examined when they
were first transcribed, and such like, is so buried
in obscurity and oblivion, and so far from Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
apt to beget Certain Knowledge, that we
must have recourse to Charity to allow it our
Hopes, had we no other Rule of Faith than that
bare Letter. Again, though human diligence
did play its part, yet it is acknowledg'd (sayes
your Deist) that there are almost innumerable
<hi>Variae Lectiones</hi> in it still controverted; nay so
many in the new Testament alone observed by
one man (my Lord <hi>Vsher</hi>) that he durst not print
them for fear of bringing the whole Book into
doubt; and, why may not there have been such
formerly and now blindly determined and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in each Text that concerns our mainest
Points of Faith. If you reply (as Nature will
lead you) that the Faith of Christ believed and
taught from Father to Son was writ in the hearts
of the Faithful; and this made them both able
and willing to (that is, actually did) preserve the
Letter from Errour in any passage that concerned
the Body of Christian Doctrine; he challenges
you to fly your Colours, to desert your own Rule,
and embrace Tradition, the Rule of Roman-Catholikes;
and lastly, that you make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Letter the thing Ruled, not the Rule: Yet
without this recourse, no satisfactory account
can possibly be render'd to a strict Examiner why
Errour might not creep into the Text in substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51890:25"/>
points of Faith as well as in less concerning
passages: which devolves to this, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Letter held forth as a Rule of Faith <hi>can
never convince an obstinate and acute Adversary.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="discourse">
                  <head>FOURTH DISCOURSE,</head>
                  <head type="sub">That the Two last Properties of the Rule of
Faith are clearly incompetent to Scripture.</head>
                  <p>1. THere remain the two last conditions;
<hi>Certainty in its self, and Ascertainable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to us.</hi> That the later is incompetent to
Scripture alone or unassisted by another certain
Rule, that is, incompetent to it as a Rule, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may agree to it as a thing regulated or
ruled, is the Subject in a manner of all our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Discourse; and it so depends upon the
former Property of the two last named, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in it self,</hi> that if it fails, that later is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
Now, as for its <hi>Certainty in its self</hi>
or its being establish't on secure Grounds, we
may consider Scripture's Letter either Materially
as such and such Characters, or Formally as Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative
of a determinate sence suppos'd to be
Christ's; and both of these either in its single
self, or as dependent on other helps or Causes on
foot now in the world according to the course
of things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:51890:26"/>
2. And, as for the meer material Characters
in Books, 'tis evident that they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as liable to be destroy'd as any thing else
in Nature, as burnt, torn, blotted, worn out,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which though it seems a remote and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Exception, yet to one who considers
the wise Dispositions of Divine Providence it will
deserve a deep Consideration. For, seeing the
Salvation of Mankind is the End of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Nature, the means to it should be more
settled, strong and unalterable than any other
piece of Nature whatever; Putting then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Letter to be this Rule, and that all its Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificativeness
of God's Sence, that is all its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Rule, is lost if the material Characters,
its Basis, be destroy'd or alter'd; who sees not
a very disorderly proceeding in laying so weak
means in such immediateness to so main an end;
and concludes not thence that Faith's Rule
ought in right reason have a better Basis than
such perishable and alterable Elements?</p>
                  <p>3. Reflecting next on those material Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
in complexion with the Causes actually
laid in the world to preserve them entire, we
shall find that either those Causes are Material,
and then themselves are also liable to continual
alterations and innumerable Contingencies; or
Spiritual, that is, men's Minds. Now, these
being the noblest pieces in Nature, and freed in
part from Physical mutability by their Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality,
we may with good reason hope for a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51890:26"/>
greater degree of constancy from them than from
any other; and indeed, for a perfect unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
from their Nature, and (this being to
conceive Truth) an Inerrableness, if due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be observ'd; that is, if due propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
be made to beget Certain Knowledge, and
due care us'd to attend to such Proposals: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
their very Createdness and Finitness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them to defectibility, besides their obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to mutation and perpetual alteration
through the alloy of their material Compart.
I call it <hi>due proposal</hi> when it must necessarily
affect the Sense, and so beget <hi>natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
or when unequivocal terms are so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and orderly laid, that the Conclusion
must as necessarily be seen in the Premises as that
the same thing cannot both be and not-be at
once, by a mind inur'd to reflexion and specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and I call that <hi>due care,</hi> which preserves
the Soul in such temper as permits the objects
impression to be heeded and the Mind to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by it.</p>
                  <p>4. This premised we may reflect that the
Rule of Faith as was provd (<hi>Disc.</hi> 1. §. 4, 5, 10,
11.) must be obvious to men of ordinary Sence,
and not onely to Speculators; as also, that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Senses may be of two sorts; Of the
the first are things in Nature, or else simple vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
actions and plain matters of Fact; which, if
oft repeated and familiariz'd, are unmistakable;
and consequently the perceiver inerrable in such
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51890:27"/>
a matter; Of the second are such actions as are
compounded and made up of an innumerable
multitude of several particularities to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
every of which may be mistaken apart,
each being a distinct little action in its single self;
Such as is the transcribing a whole book, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such myriads of words, single Letters,
and Tittles, or Stops, and the several actions of
writing over each of these so short and curso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that it prevents diligence and exceeds hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
care to keep awake and apply distinct at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to every of these distinct actions. And
yet, to do our Opposers right, I doubt not but
each of these failings may possibly be provided
against by oft-repeated Corrections of many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
and sober examiners set apart for that
business, and that the truth of the Letter of an
whole Book might to a very great degree, if not
altogether be ascertain'd to us, were the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners
of each Copy known to be very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
prudent and honest, and each of them
testifying his single examination of it word by
word; For then the difficulty, consisting in the
multiplicity and the variety, is provided against
by the multitude of the preserving Causes; and
their multifariousness made convictive to us by
their well-testify'd consent.</p>
                  <p>5. To apply this discourse to the matter in
hand. If we were Certain there had been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
a multitude of Examiners of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Letter in each Copy taken from the first
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51890:27"/>
Original or the next Copies from these and so
forwards, with the exact care we have defin'd,
the single Examinations of each and the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Copy according to their Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
convincingly testify'd, and that by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
or heavy Ecclesiastical Prohibitions
and Mulcts it had been provided for from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
that none should presume to take a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of it, and that Copy be permitted to be read
or seen till it were thus examined; much might
have been said for the Certainty of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Letter upon these men's Principles: But,
if no such Orders or Exactness was ever heard
of, especially of the New Testament upon the
Truth of whose Letter they build Christian
Faith; If the multitudes of Letters, Commaes,
blottings or illegibleness of the Originals, like-appearance
of Letters and even whole Words in
in the Book, like-sounding in the ear or fancy of
the Transcriber, possibility of misplacing, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
inserting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did administer very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
occasions to human over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight; If, the more
Copies were taken, the more the errours were
like to grow, and the farther from correcting;
If Experience testifies no such exact diligence has
been formerly us'd, by the diverse Readings of
several Copies now extant, and thousands of
Corrections which have lately been made of the
Vulgar Edition, the most universally currant
perhaps of any other; what can we say but that
(for any thing these Principles afford) Scriptures
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51890:28"/>
Letter may be uncertain in every tittle, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the diligence which has <hi>de facto</hi> been
used to preserve it uncorrupted in the way of
those who hold it the onely Rule of Faith? <hi>In
their way,</hi> I say, who will not have the Sence of
Christ's Doctrine writ in Christians hearts the
Rule for the Correcters of the Letter to guide
themselves by, but the meer Letter of a forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
(and God knows, controvertible) Copy, out of
which the Transcription and by which onely the
Examination is made. What Certainty accrues
to Scripture's Letter by the means of Tradition,
or the living voice of the present Church in
each Age, is the Subject of another enquiry.</p>
                  <p>6. Now, as for the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Scripture's
<hi>Significativeness,</hi> which is the other Branch, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more evident than that this is quite lost
to all in the Uncertainty of the Letter; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
evident that 'tis unattainable by the vulgar, that
is the better half of mankind, since they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnisht
of those Arts and Skills, as Languages,
Grammar, Logick, History, Metaphysicks, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
&amp;c. requisit to establish and render certain
the sence they conceive the Letter ought to
bear; without which they can never make such
an Interpretation of it but an acute Scholler
skill'd in those means will be able to blunder
theirs, and make a seeming clearer one of his
own. In a word, if we see eminent Wits of the
Protestants and the Socinians, making use of the
self-same, and, as they conceive, the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51890:28"/>
the Letter gives them, as comparing places
and such like, and availing themselves the best
they can by acquir'd skills, yet differ in so main
points as those of the B. Trinity and Christ's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
what Certainty can we undertakingly
promise to weaker heads, that is, to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Mankind, less able to make such fit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
of places to one another; incapable of
such means as should help them, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had and are very pertinent and proper to
work upon the Letter; And, lastly, who are,
for want of those, unfurnish't of any steady
Principles to settle their Judgements and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
determin their own Interpretation Certain.
Scripture's Letter therefore is not <hi>Certain in it's
self,</hi> that is, has no immovably secure Grounds
enabling it to perform the Office of the Rule of
Faith, or to guide Mankind in their way to
Faith with a rational assuredness.</p>
                  <p>Our Conclusion then is this, that SCRIPTURE'S
LETTER WANTS ALL THE FORE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTIONED
PROPERTIES BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LONGING
TO THE RULE OF
FAITH.</p>
                  <p>7. Lest any should misconstrue my former
Discourse, I declare here once more that, in a
great part of it, I argue <hi>ad hominem;</hi> that is,
I manifest what must follow out of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51890:29"/>
of those who hold the Scripture's Letter the
<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> not out of my own or Catholick
ones. I declare likewise that I with all reverence
acknowledge such Excellencies in those Sacred
Oracles as would task the tongues both of Men
and Angels to lay them forth. I onely contest
that the Scripture's Letter is most improper and
never intended for the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> as is easy
to be evinc't against an unobstinate Adversary by
this, that 'tis known the Apostles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
went not with Books in their hands to
preach and deliver Christ's Doctrin, but Words
in their mouths; and that Primitive Antiquity
learn't their Faith by another Method a long
time before many of those Books were universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spread amongst the vulgar, much less the
Catalogue collected and acknowledg'd; till the
Revolters from that Method and Rule, being
manifestly convinc't of Novelty by it, were for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t
to invent some other, and chose this of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's
Letter for most plausible, as being held
very Sacred: untill, by straining it to an undue
use, and, to please the people, putting it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any distinction of the person, into their hands,
and leaving it to their Interpretation, they have
brought it (as 'tis made use of for a Rule of Faith)
to the vilest degree of contempt; every silly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Heresy fathering it self upon It. Of which
no Nation in the world is so evident an Instance
as our miserable Country, distracted into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sects (all issuing from that Principle,) so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51890:29"/>
to be brought under Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(and even with much ado under Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral)
that 'tis wonderful such proper Effects,
especially so sensible, burthensome, so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
spred, and so continual, should not long
ago have abundantly demonstrated their Proper
Cause, and oblig'd them to renounce that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which is the necessary Parent of such rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and unredressable disorders</p>

do clearly agree to It.</head>
                  <p>1. HAving then quite lost our labour in our last
search, let us see whether we shall have
better success in this second Enquiry; which is,
whether we may hope to find the Properties of
the Rule of Faith meet in that which we call
<hi>or all</hi> or <hi>Practical Tradition.</hi> By which we mean
a Delivery down from hand to hand (by words,
and a constant course of frequent and visible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
conformable to those Words) of the Sence
and Faith of Forefathers.</p>
                  <p>2. But, to make a more express conceit of
<hi>Tradition,</hi> that so we may more perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51890:30"/>
the Nature of that which we treat of
let us first soberly reflect on the manner how
Children learn their own and others names with
whom they live, as also of the rooms and thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

exercise their trades, to write, read, or use civil

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
And, looking into the Thing we shall observe
that they first glean'd notions of those several Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
either meerly through Impressions on their
Senses by the Thing it self alone, or by the help
of having them pointed at, or something practic'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
and afterwards learnt to repeat the same Word
after others, more and more intelligently by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and to practice the same Actions; till a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enjoy'd; and so forwards to succeeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by a natural kind of method, without needing
Books or new Skills meerly to perform this Effect
of continuing and preserving the former Age, as
it were, alive in this. Add now to this that this
Continuation goes not by long leaps from Age to
Age, or from twenty years to twenty, but from
year to year, nay moneth to moneth, &amp; even less;
according as the new Off-spring grows up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51890:30"/>
to a Capacity of understanding and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
and then reflect on this whole Course, and
we shall see the true nature of <hi>Tradition</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Delivery, as exercis'd in Civil matters
and Human Conveniences.</p>
                  <p>3. We want nothing now but to apply this
self-same Method to Spiritual or Ecclesiastical
affairs, and to reflect how it brings down Faith
by Doctrin couch't in Words and exprest in
conformable Practices; and then we shall have
gain'd a compleat and proper notion of <hi>Faith-Tradition,</hi>
which is the Tradition we speak of.</p>
                  <p>4. We may observe then that the Children
of Christians first hear the Sounds, afterwards
by degrees get dim notions of God, Christ, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Heaven, Hell, Virtue, Vice, and such
like; and, according as their capacity increases,
are put on to practice what they have heard,
and made to do some external Actions by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
and Example; which Actions by their
more particularizing nature ripen to a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and familiar conceit those raw Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Judgments which while they stood under
bare words look't as if they hover'd in the
Ayr, and afar off. They are deterr'd from
sins, first from lying and disobeying their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
afterwards others, by reproaches and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
and encourag'd to virtuous actions by
rewards such as their Age bears, to breed in
them a conceit of the badness of sin and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Virtue: They are shown how to say
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51890:31"/>
Grace, say their Prayers, and made do it when
they are able; and to gain them some abstracted
conceit of those Actions, they are inur'd even
while very Infants by certain carriages unusual
at other times, as holding up their hands or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
eyes, kneeling, keeping silence and other
sober postures, to look upon such actions as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ones, when as yet they know no more
of them; which breeds a certain awe in them
before-hand, preparing their minds to more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
for the future. Afterwards, growing
up, they come acquainted with the Creed, the
ten Commandments, the Sacraments, some
common forms of Prayer and other Practices of
Christianity, and are directed to order their lives
accordingly; the Actions or Carriage of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstant
Church and Elder Faithful guiding the
Younger (notwithstanding the difficulty of the
yet-undigested <hi>Metaphor,</hi> in which dialect Faith
is delivered) to frame their lives to several sorts
of Virtues by the doctrine deliver'd in words;
as Faith, Hope, Charity, Prayer, Adoration,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the concomitant or subservient Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
to these; and the more intelligent, whose
Understandings are clear'd by Study and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of conversing with the learneder sort
of Fore-fathers, to do out of Knowledge and
Reflexion, what others do (as it were) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and by meer Belief or guidance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And this goes on by insensible degrees,
till at last the Teachers die, and leave in their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51890:31"/>
room a new Swarm of the same nature with
themselves as to Christian Life; that is, <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
the same external Actions which determin
to a certain degree the sence of the Words they
have been inur'd to; and (since the practice of
those Actions was instill'd from their Infancy,
and serious) <hi>holding</hi> consequently the Principles
of those Actions; that is, the same Points of
Faith with the former Age. And this goes on
not by leaps from an hundred years to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
or from twenty to twenty, but by half-years
to half-years, nay moneths to moneths,
and even less; according as the young brood of
Eaglets, made to see the Sun in his full Glory,
grow up to a capacity of having their tender
eyes acquainted first with the dawning, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with the common day-light of Christian
Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>5. If any should be so dull as to think this
looks like a Speculation onely, and not to see
plainly that 'tis confirm'd by ten thousand Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rements
every day; I desire them to consider
how the Primitive Faithful were inur'd to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
ere the Books of Scripture were writ or
communicated; or how themselves (though
Protestants or Presbyterians) were first imbu'd
with Christian Principles ere they could read,
and they shall finde it was meerly by this way of
Tradition: Nay more, I dare affirm that the
very Presbyterians, much more the Protestants,
still adhere to their Faith, because their Parents
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51890:32"/>
&amp; Pastors taught them it when they were young,
and not upon the Evidence of Scripture's Letter
to their own private Judgement: which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by this, that those who are brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> are apt to follow him, others Mr.
<hi>Pierce,</hi> and all in general hold fixedly to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of others, especially if their Parents be of
the same persuasion. So hard it is to beat down Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by Designe, or not to follow Tradition in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
though at the same time they write and talk
never so vehemently and loud against it. Nay
'tis easie to remark that those who were brought
up Protestants, while they follow'd their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Forefathers in the Traditionary way,
continu'd firmly such; and that none declin'd
from that Profession until they began to use their
own private Judgments in interpreting Scripture;
and that then they ran by whole shoals into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
other Sects. However then they exclaim
against Tradition, yet 'tis evident they owe to It
all the Union and Strength they have, and to the
renouncing It all their Distractions and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>6. What is said hitherto, is onely to explain
the Nature of <hi>Tradition</hi> perfectly, and to settle
a right conceit of it: which done, many Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
will be render'd unnecessary either to be
answerd or mention'd, as those that proceed
against a kind of Prophetical <hi>Afflatus,</hi> which
can have no force against our way, building
upon perfect Evidence of our best Senses: but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51890:32"/>
especially those which take so wrong an aym, that
they dispute against <hi>res traditae,</hi> or the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd,
instead of Tradition it self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
accuse us for holding Human <hi>Traditions,</hi> or
things invented by men for Faith. Whereas, when
we speak of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> we mean by the
word <hi>Tradition</hi> onely the <hi>Method</hi> of publickly
delivering and conveying down Tenets, held to
have come from Christ, in the manner before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
This note premised to avoid mistake and
keep the Reader's mind more steady to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand, let us see now whether <hi>Tradition</hi>
have in it the nature of a <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> which is
done by examining whether the fore-named Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
belong to it or no.</p>
                  <p>7. And first, 'tis already manifest from what is
said, that the First Property of the Rule of
Faith, namely, that it must be <hi>Evident to all as
to its Existence,</hi> absolutely agrees with Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For, <hi>Tradition</hi> being the open conveyance
down of <hi>Practical Doctrines</hi> by our best senses
of Discipline, that is, our Eyes and Ears; and
this by Sounds daily heard and Actions daily seen
and even felt; 'tis as easily appliable to all sorts, or
Evident to them as to its Existence, as it is to see
and hear: So that it can be insinuated into or
affect not onely the rudest vulgar and little. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but in some degree even very Babes, as
was shown.</p>
                  <p>8. The second Condition, which is that its
Ruling Power should be easily Evidenceable to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51890:33"/>
any Enquirer is thus shown to agree to Tradition,
Let the rudest Doubter come and desire to be
certify'd that Tradition is a Rule able if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
to convey down Christ's doctrin to our
very daies; or to the world's end, and let these
plain Interrogatories be put to him. Suppose
all Protestants in <hi>England</hi> were settled in an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Profession of their Faith, and that
their Children without looking farther should
believe and practice as their Fathers had brought
them up, would it not follow in self-evident
terms that those Children while they followed
this method would be Protestants too? Suppose
these, now grown men under those Parents,
should have children too of their own who
should behave themselves in the same manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Fathers by believing and practising
as they taught them, without looking any farther,
would it not be equally evident they would still
be Protestants also? Since to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
thus is to be a Protestant; and, would not
this method if followed carry on that doctrin
still forwards from Generation to Generation to
the very end of the world? 'Tis then most easily
evidenceable to the rudest capacity that this
immediate delivery of Tradition, as above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
is a certain way of deriving down
Christs Doctrin while the world shall last. This
Property therefore of the Rule of Faith is found
evidently to agree to Tradition.</p>
                  <p>9. The third Condition, which is that the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51890:33"/>
Rule of Faith must be apt to justify unreflecting
and unredoubting persons that they proceed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
while they rely on it, is found most exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Tradition. For the common course of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
conversation makes it a madness not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
great multitudes of Knowers, if no possible
consideration can awaken in our reason a doubt
that they conspire to deceive us. Now in the
way of Tradition all deliverers or immediate
Forefathers are Knowers, as appears in those who
immediately heard the Apostles; all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
requisit being of what they were taught,
and practic't accordingly all their lives; of which
'tis impossible the rudest person should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
who ever had any Effect of such a Teaching
wrought upon him. Nor can any, unless their
brains rove wildly or be unsettled even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of madness, suspect deceit where such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
unanimously agree in a matter of fact,
look seriously when they speak, act themselves
and practice accordingly, and show in the whole
course of their carriage that they hope to be
sav'd themselves, and to save others whom they
thus instruct, by relying on this Truth that their
Forefathers thus taught them; which amounts
to this, that Nature or common Reason at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
steals into them a solid apprehension that
Tradition is of a <hi>certain</hi> kind of Nature; and
so, that, while Fathers thus taught Children, it
was ever such, that is, that Tradition is a certain
Rule of conveying down Faith, which is all we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51890:34"/>
study to evince at present. I may add that, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
telling them by their own experiences, that
Parents generally would be apt to teach their
Children what themselves had been taught and
believ'd to be good, and true, &amp; needfull to their
eternal Salvation, their natural thoughts would
lead them by a downright procedure, to judge
that <hi>Tradition</hi> was ever in some considerable Body
of Deliverers who stuck to it and own'd it; and
that those had true Faith, or truly that doctrin
which Christ and the first Planters of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
taught. But of this point more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>10. If it be objected that this multitude of
plain honest-meaning Souls are as much justify'd
for believing Scripture. I answer, that if you
mean their <hi>Faith</hi> conceiv'd to be found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or a <hi>determinate Sence</hi> of Scripture's
Letter, it cannot with any show of reason
be pretended that they are as much justifiable for
believing any, setting aside Tradition's help;
for, without this it totally depends on the inward
Judgments, Fancies or Skills of men which they
are unqualify'd to judge of; not on open verdict
of Senses, to wield the Certainty or Uncertainty
of which lies clearly within the reach of their
common reason. And as for Scripture's Letter
they cannot possibly be justify'd in reason for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
even the Substantial Truth of it without
Tradition's assisting hand and preserving care.
And the reason is the same; because the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
course of human Experience tells them that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51890:34"/>
Judgments or Opinions often disagree, but their
plain Sensations (especially if frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated)
never; Whence a Jury of the plainest
High-shoes would, upon the Evidence of the
sight of six Witnesses, without more ado con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
a Malefactor; but not upon the Judgments
of a thousand men, if a Testimony grounded
on Sense were not brought. Now take away
Tradition and all ground from <hi>Certain Sence</hi>
fails us, either for the meaning or even Letter
of Scripture; and all is left to men's Judgments
built on latent Skills or Fancy, or at least on
Sense liable to great and numerous mistakes, as
hath been shown, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 4. §. 3.) Again,
seeing every one apprehends the most vulgar
have reason enough to believe there was such a
one as K. <hi>Iames</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of which
they are no otherwise ascertain'd but by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
why are not they as much or more justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
for believing points of Faith received down
by the same tenour? whereas if you go about
to pump their common Reason about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Statute-Book or the Truth of its
Letter, you shall find them blunder and at a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oss, being pos'd beyond their sphere of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Nature by a question entrenching upon skill, to
which they can never answer with a steady as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredness
inwardly; and, if they do so out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
'tis manifest that some Passion and not
their Reason breeds that irrational Profession.
The third Condition then of the Rule of Faith,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51890:35"/>
which was <hi>to be apt to settle and justify unreflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and undoubting vulgar,</hi> is manifestly found
agreeing to <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. I put next the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Condition, because the
proof of it evidently proves the fourth, fifth and
seventh; For, what is built on immovable
Grounds or Certain in its self, has in it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to settle and satisfy the most piercing Wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ascertain us absolutely. To prove that Tradition
has Certain and Infallible Grounds it may suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
to note, that, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 1. §. 13, 14, 15.) it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51890:35"/>
must be the Rule of Faith; Yet I foresee more
will be expected from a pretender to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
its Certainty, and that he should frame
his Discourse from intrinsecal <hi>Mediums.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
then on the nature of Tradition as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
explicated, we shall observe that it hath
for its Basis the best Nature in the Universe, that
is, Man's, the Flower and End of all the rest;
and this, not according to his Moral part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible
by reason of Original Corruption; nor
yet his Intellectuals, darkly groping in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Science by <hi>reflected</hi> thoughts or Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
amidst the misty vapours exhal'd by his
Passion predominant over his rational Will;
but according to those faculties in him perfectly
and necessarily subject to the operations and
stroaks of Nature; that is, his Eyes, Ears,
handling, and the <hi>direct</hi> Impressions of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as naturally and necessarily issuing from
the affecting those Senses, as it is to feel he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,
cold, Pain, Pleasure, or any other material
Quality. Again, those Impressions upon the
Sense are not made once but frequently; and,
in most, many times every day. Moreover, to
make these more express and apt to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, their lives are to be fram'd by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
they hear and conformable Examples they
see; so that Faith (I mean the substance of
it, or that solid plain Knowledge as far as 'tis apt
to cause downright Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>) comes
clad in such plain matters of Fact that the most
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51890:36"/>
stupid man living cannot possibly be ignorant of
it. Compare next the certainty each Christian
Forefather has of what he has practic't all his
life with that which a sworn Witness in a Court
has of what he saw or heard but once; which
done, multiply these thus-qualify'd Witnesses
till you equal the vast total of Christianity, and
then invent what force in Nature's Universe is
comparable to this Inerrability of Tradition.
And, if clear Reason evinces to you that 'tis far
more possible to make a man not be than not to
know what is rivetted into his Soul by so-oft-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Sensations; nay if it exceed all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Nature (abstracting from the cases of
Madness and violent disease) to blot Knowledges
thus fixt out of the Soul of one single Believer;
then 'tis as clearly evinc't that sooner may all
Mankind perish than the regulative virtue of
Tradition miscarry: Nay, sooner may the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows
of entire Nature by overstraining crack,
and she lose all her activity and motion, that is,
her self, than one single part of that innumerable
multitude which integrate that vast Testification
we call <hi>Tradition</hi> can possibly be violated. The
virtue then, by which Tradition regulates her
followers to bring down Faith unerringly, is
grounded on a far stronger Basis than all materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Nature; that is, on such a one as was fitting
for Supream Wisdom to lay for <hi>Faith,</hi> being so
neer and necessary a means to bring Mankind to
his Beatitude, which was the end of all this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51890:36"/>
corporeal Architecture. <hi>Its Followers,</hi> I say;
for I onely contest in this present part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that Tradition, if follow'd, is of such a
Nature: whether it was alwayes thus follow'd
or no belongs to another Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>13. Nor must I neglect the reminding in this
place what was produc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t before (§. 8.) to show
the Evidenceableness of Tradition's Ruling Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to the rudest Enquirers; It being as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that while the next Age believes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
as the former Age held and practic't (that
is, while the Rule of Tradition is follow'd)
those of the later Age are still of the same Faith
with the former, as it is that <hi>to believe the same
is to believe the same.</hi> Onely I am forbidden
by my Reason and Logick to call this a Proof or
Argument, because 'tis of the Nature of that
first Principle <hi>Idem est idem sibijpsi,</hi> and onely
an Instance or Particular of it, as these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are, <hi>a stone is a stone, a man is a man;</hi> in
which the two Terms are as neerly laid and as
fast connected as perfect Identity can ciment
them; that is, so close that no <hi>medium</hi> can come
between to make them capable of being argud
or prov'd; that is, 'tis <hi>self-evident:</hi> and so I
had no more to do but by opening the Terms to
explicate the Proposition; which done it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
beyond proof.</p>
                  <p>14. Let now the most rational Doubter or
most Sceptical Dissenter muster all the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes
of Fancy Invention can suggest, and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51890:37"/>
subtlest quirks ingeniously misus'd Logick and
abus'd-into-Sophistry can furnish them with;
Let the most obstinate and acute Adversaries of
Faith whet their wits to that degree of sharpness
as to be able to penetrate with nice distinctions
between the sides of two notions, if in the least
disagreeing, (that is, onely metaphysically divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,)
and lay open their difference; what can
they say in this case? If they will argue against
Tradition, it must be out of some <hi>Knowledges;</hi>
but Knowledge is taken from <hi>Things,</hi> and the
best Thing in this universe, to wit, Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in what he is unalterable, is engag'd for the
Certainty of Tradition. But indeed, their proper
task will be to find a solution for; or to loose
those two notions which perfect Identity binds,
and to blunder that Truth which the noon-day-Sun
of <hi>Self evidence</hi> discovers, and (as it were)
writes with its most lightsome and most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
rayes.</p>
                  <p>15. These four last Conditions then of
the Rule of Faith most fully agree with
Tradition as well as the three first, that is,
'tis Self-evident to all as to it's Existence, §. 7.
and Evidenceable as to it's Ruling Power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vulgar Enquirer, §. 8. apt to settle and justify
undoubting persons, §. 9, 10. to satisfy fully the
most Sceptical dissenters and most rational
doubters, and to convince the most obstinate and
acute Adversaries, built upon unmoveable
Grounds, that is, Certain in it's self and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51890:37"/>
ascertainable to us, §. 11, 12, 13, 14. And
these Properties springing out of the very nature
of the Rule of Faith, and being incompetent to
any Competitor or pretended Rule, as has been
shown, this main Conclusion is made good, that
TRADITION IS THE RULE OF FAITH.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Endeavouring to demonstrate à priori the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibleness
of Tradition.</head>
                  <p>1. ALl this is well, may some say, in case Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had been ever held to; for then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Faith had come down by such an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Testification that the like was never
heard of. But how know we who began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
that Rule, and who ever held to it; or that
it was ever held to by any?</p>
                  <p>2. Now, though the carriage of Protestants
makes this labour needless, while I write against
them; yet I owe to my former discourse a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this likewise. Their <hi>Carriage,</hi> I say; For,
when it is prov'd evidently that Tradition is a
certain Rule and Scripture's Letter not such, they
who reject the former to adhere to the later are
clearly cast in their Cause and condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51890:38"/>
more ado. Indeed, If Protestants faulted
not the Rule but onely pretended that men had
fail'd it, they might yet delude the world with
some colour that they had ever held to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of Ancestours, and onely deserted us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we had deserted Ancestours formerly; but
if they put the fault in the Rule it self, write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, disgrace it and recurr to another,
'tis a certain sign of self-condemnation, and that
they judge in their inmost thoughts that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or immediate delivery ever stood our Friend
and would overthrow them. Nay, did they
think they could manifest satisfactorily that we
had deserted formerly the Faith of our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as they pretend, they had no more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
way to ruine us than to oppose us upon
those Principles laid in this former Discourse;
since Tradition, a little after the Primitive times,
at which time they pretend we fell, had not gone
down many steps, and so the Renouncers of it
would in reason seem to them more easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by its vicinity to the Apostles. Besides,
this Rule being so own'd and stuck to by us it
had been the most efficacious way <hi>ad hominem</hi>
to confute and shame us even by our own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Wherefore it is most evident they think
it not their best play to offer to avail themselves
by Tradition, knowing 'twill be their disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and our gain; that is, they in effect tacitly
yield that (if Tradition be a Certain Rule,
which we have shown self-evident) the doctrin
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51890:38"/>
held by our Church to be of Faith came down
uninterruptedly from the Apostles, that is, was
ever, or is Christ's doctrin, however, they blind
their own Consciences with glances of Fancy
from private Interpretations of God's word, and
deaf their own and others ears with empty sounds
rebounding witth false Ecchoes from those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Oracles.</p>
                  <p>3. Now, though it seem an unreasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
to require that a Rule should not onely
be able to rule those who <hi>would</hi> follow it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
should have power to <hi>oblige</hi> the generality of
those who actually do follow it not to desert it;
yet, such is the Goodness of our Saviour towards
his Church to order that the Rule which brings
down Faith to us should, both out of the Nature
of Man in which it is grafted, and much more
by means of the doctrin it recommends, be of
so wonderful an Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>4. This point therefore of the actual Indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness
of Tradition I shall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
both <hi>à priori</hi> from proper Causes, and
<hi>à posteriori</hi> from a now-adayes experienc't Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>5. To do the former, I say for my Grounds,
First, that Christian doctrin was at first unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
settled by the Apostles in the hearts of
the Faithful disperst in great multitudes over se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of the world. Secondly, that this
doctrin was firmly believed by all those Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be the way to Heaven, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51890:39"/>
or deserting it the way to damnation; so
that the greatest <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> imaginable
were by engaging the Divine Authority strongly
apply'd to the Minds of the First Believers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them to the adhering to that doctrin,
and deterring them from relinquishing it; and
indeed infinitly greater than any other whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
springing from any temporal consideration;
and that this was in all Ages the perswasion of
the Faithful. Thirdly, that Hopes of Goods and
Fears of Harms strongly apply'd are the Causes
of Actual Will. Lastly, that the thing was feisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or within their power, that is, that what
they were bred to was Knowable by them.
This put, it follows as certainly that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or Body of the first Believers and after-Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in each Age, that is from Age to Age, would
continue to hold themselves and teach
their Children as themselves had been taught,
that is, would follow and stick to Tradition, as
it does that a Cause put actually causing produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it's Effect. <hi>Actually,</hi> I say; For, since the
Cause is put, the Application put, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
dispos'd (for our Argument puts this to be
the Minds of true Believers, in regard the first
Renouncers of Tradition must have been <hi>True
Believers</hi> or Holders of it ere they renounc't it)
it follows inevitably that the Cause is put still
<hi>actually causing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. I foresee some will object the Indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Wills of the Believing Parents by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51890:39"/>
of original Corruption. But, supposing I
dispute against those Christians who hold that
Christ's Doctrin was intended to be an Antidote
for that Original malice, and to keep Men's
Wills (already possest with it) right, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the poize of their corrupted Nature and
the temptations of their circumstances; to say
'tis apply'd universally to all several sorts and
tempers, and preserves none good, is to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ's Wisdom, and to doubt whether it be
fit to do the Effect it was meant for. Not to
mind the Objecter how many thousands of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
and Holy Confessors, by the Power of this
Doctrin, overcame this inbred declivity of
their Wills and its disorderly inclinations to the
dearest Goods Life or Nature could bestow. A
great part therefore would be virtuous, and so
(it being easie and obvious, as our former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
proved) would teach their Children what
themselves believ'd in their Consciences to be
Christ's Doctrine, or the doctrine they had been
taught; and so a Body of Traditionary
Christians would still be continu'd to the very
End of the World; nor could that Rule be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
relinquisht by any Stratagem of the Devil
or prevail'd against <hi>by the gates of Hell.</hi> Again,
though Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re incline men to sin or vicious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
yet can it incline them all to this sort of
sin, that is, to teach their Children what they
think will damn them? Or rather does not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
most strongly carry them to the contrary?
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51890:40"/>
Their Original corruption then is no particular
inviter to this kind of sin, to teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
pernicious falshoods, and which themselves
hold such; though themselves be otherwise lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to several sort of particular failings.</p>
                  <p>7. If any object the fickle nature of the Will,
and imagin that this exempts her from the Laws
of Causes; I ask them (without engaging far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into School-disputes, which I industriously
avoid) whether <hi>Good</hi> be not the proper Object
of the <hi>Will,</hi> and so is to affect it when sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply'd or propos'd? If so, then, since an
Object to affect a Power is to put it <hi>in act,</hi> and
the Act of the Power we call the Will is actual
Volition or Willing, Good propos'd makes the
Will to will or desire that Good, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the known means to obtain it; Now, Infinit
Goods and Harms sufficiently propos'd are of
their own nature incomparably more powerful
Causes to carry the Will, than Temporal ones.
Since then, when two Causes are counterpos'd, the
lesser, when it comes to execution, is no Cause,
as to the substance of that Effect (as a heavy
weight, which were otherwise a cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
is no such Cause when overweigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
by an heavier, as not making its scale descend
at all) it follows that there is no Cause to move
the Wills of a World of Believers to be willing
to do that which they judge would lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Posterity Infinit Goods and bring
them Infinit Harms, such strong and main
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51890:40"/>
Hopes and Fears being put in the counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
in case a sufficient <hi>Proposal</hi> or <hi>Application</hi>
be not wanting.</p>
                  <p>8. The last Attempt then of an Objectour is
to fault the <hi>Application</hi> of Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Goods, and to enhance the Proposals of
sensible and Temporal Objects. But, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
with how steady a pursuit and even equal to
that of eye-sight or any other Sense, we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
work for Ends no otherwise propos'd than
by undoubted Authority; as when a King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
for an Expedition against a forrain Country
he never saw, or a Gentleman for a journey to
<hi>Rome</hi> and such like; If we but call to mind
how the greatest Testimony in the world engages
God's supremely-Infallible Veracity for the
truth of the Doctrin, it proposes, which ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
us of those Infinit Goods and Harms spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of; the best Application of a motive to a
truly rational power which can possibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd;
If we but consider how those spiritual
and unseen Goods are made Intelligible to all,
in a fair measure, by most fit and obvious Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors;
Familiar and Sensible, by daily practice
and as it were Experience of them in Christian
Language and Actions, by the venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by the spectable Majesty of outward
Ceremonies, all including our spiritual last End
or intimating it by their order to it; nay, if we
but contemplate even Essential Heaven it self
made the Object of our Senses, to comply with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51890:41"/>
our weakness, by the <hi>Word's being made Flesh
and dwelling amongst us,</hi> his being born, his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
cold, hunger, persecution, banishment
and other inconveniencies in his Life; his curing
our diseased, comforting our afflicted, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our dead, and other miraculous actions;
his being bound, buffetted, scourged, crown'd
with thorns, and lastly crucify'd; and all this
believed to be for our sakes; all of them Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
most sensibly and palpably affecting our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
and thence sliding movingly (and
this by their sensible nature) into our very Wills;
we shall discover that the Infinit Spiritual Good
we spoke of is become through the Provident
Goodness of our God, both as easily appliable
as the most visible and concerning civil Actions
working on the best Sensations of our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the best and amplest Authority in the
world to make their Sensations ours, and the
whole course of our Life, Actions, Sacraments,
and all other outward shows which could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to make such mysteries maniable, can
possibly render them; and that, if after all this
they can be conceiv'd to want any thing of the
Sensibleness, 'tis abundantly supply'd by that
deep Impression which the Sacred Horrour of the
Reverence given to them makes, and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wayes to excite and and preserve that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
All which wayes and objects, thus easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and strongly appliable were frequently and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciously
apply'd by the education of Parents
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51890:41"/>
and by the Discipline and Oeconomy of the
Church, which brings those speculations to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
was ever, and must needs reach the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
In a word, Christianity, urg'd to execution,
gives its Followers a <hi>new Life</hi> and a <hi>new Nature;</hi>
than which a nearer Application cannot be
imagin'd. No <hi>Application</hi> therefore is wanting;
Wherefore, the <hi>Efficient</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> being
proper and fitted to one another, the <hi>Effect</hi> must
still be or continue; that is the delivering down
sincerely and carefully Christian Doctrin first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
must still continue in some great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at least, and this to the end of the world.</p>

Yet notwithstanding, as in the <hi>Civil State,</hi>

that, because 'tis impossible the perfection of
Disciplin should extend it self in so vast a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to every particular, some one or few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by neglect of applying Christian motives to
their Souls, fall into extravagancies of spiritual
Pride, Ambition, Lust, or other vices; and itching
with desire of followers to honour and support
them, they first lay hold on some accidental mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
as foolish opinions or ill lives of some
in the Church, which they aggravate beyond

invent and propose new Tenets to others; which
partly by their plausibleness, partly licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
suting with the curious or passionate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of diverse, if Governours be not vigilant
and prudent, draw them into the same faction
with themselves; especially, if they get the
State on their sides, secure indemnity and hopes
of reward draw the corrupt hearts of many to
bandy with their fellow-revolters against the
former Church. Thus a <hi>Body</hi> is made; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in respect of the whole, which yet is
engag'd by the natural care of self-preservation
to make Head against it. The Church stands
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51890:43"/>
upon the uninterrupted Succession of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
from Christ, grounded on the noon-day
manifestation of the most universal and clear
Attestation in the world: The other's known
newness makes it impossible to human nature
(though most deprau'd) to pretend this recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from immediate Forefathers; the contrary
being so evident to the whole world's eye-sight
that this were to tell an openly to no imaginable

has err'd in Faith, else they condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whence they are oblig'd at next to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and disgrace Tradition or the living
voice of the Church as unfit to be a Rule, which
left in force would presently quash and strangle
all their Attempts. After this a new Rule must
be sought for; either some private Inspiration,

Opponent, presently a Victory is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
with the loudest Trumpet of Fame, and
(vanity being generally their God who place
their honour in such aiery sorts of learning)
blaz'd up and down to the commendation of
themselves and perversion of others. But a
company which makes such a bustle cannot long
want a Name; Wherefore, the Traditionary
Christian having ever enjoyd the Appellation of
<hi>Catholick,</hi> and it being impossible their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
should by any design or craft after the
common Language of Mankind, hopeless to
attain the name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> they are forced to
content themselves (though unwilling) with
some other new one; which, Nature, working
upon their own comportment, determines to be
either from their Authour, as <hi>Lutherans, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliaus;</hi>
or their new Tenet, as <hi>Tritheits, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarians;</hi>
or some combination amongst
themselves, as <hi>Protestants;</hi> or, lastly, some
particular carriage, as <hi>Quakers, Dippers,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. These first Adherents to the upstart Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
being clung into a Body, after a while young
understandings ripening to a capacity of Faith,
things are presently alterd; The pretended Rule
of Scripture's Letter's self-sufficiency is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
thrown by as useless any farther; Design
hath got its end already, and the natural way of
of Tradition begins to take place again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51890:44"/>
its self; nay the Reformers themselves are
forc't to crave help of it to keep their company
together. Children are taught that they are
to believe their Pastours and Fathers; and,
though they are permitted to read the Scripture
when they come at age, yet they are told they
are to guide themselves by the sence their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
and Fathers give it, which is that they
ought to guide themselves by the Faith of their
Parents and Teachers in interpreting Scripture;
the very way Catholicks ever took in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
And, if any company of men though
now mature to judge, presume to follow their
own Judgement in interpreting it, and differ
from those first Reformers, these if they get the
power in their hands will presently fall to oblige
them by force to <hi>act,</hi> that is (if they would have
them do it conscientiously, which else were to
force them to sin) to <hi>hold</hi> as they do, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
or punish them if they do not; whereas
they guide themselves to their best capacity by
the Scripture's Letter which is the very Rule of
Faith their Persecutors taught them and made
use of themselves when they broke from the
Church. Which evidently shows that a new Rule
is introduc't; and that it is not indeed the Letter
of God's word which is now thought fit to guide
the Readers of it to Faith, but those men's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of it. So that the breaking from
Tradition and consequently the Church casts
them most inevitably upon these self-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51890:44"/>
First, to reform npon pretence of the
Scripture's Letter being the Rule of Faith, yet
afterwards in practice to desert that Rule in their
carriage towards others. Secondly, to disallow to
others those Grounds themselves proceed upon.
Thirdly, to pretend first the Scripture's Letter
<hi>clear of it self</hi> without needing the Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it, so to avoid condemnation from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Church; yet afterwards, to judge the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it to their best power to go wrong; that is, to
confess it <hi>obscure,</hi> and to need their new Churches
Interpretation. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. To persecute others for taking
that way, which they held (at least pretended)
meritorious in themselves. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. To oblige others
to relinquish the sole guidance of the Scriptures
Letter and to rule themselves by their Tradition;
and yet at the same time when they write and
dispute against Catholicks, to impugn Tradition
or the doctrin of Forefathers as unfitting to sence
it, and abet onely the self-sufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
Letter. And, lastly, to impute that carriage
to our Church as a fault which themselves pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
upon their own Subjects: And, which is
most material, our Church punishes none but
such as desert the Rule she recommends; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they punish those under them for following
too close that Rule which themselves recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and applauded, as the whole and sole
Bafis of their Reformation.</p>
                  <p>4. Now, what can follow hence but that their
Ecclesiastical Subjects whom Common Sence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51890:45"/>
cannot but make exceeding sensible of such their
unreasonable carriage, in persecuting them pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for following God's word or the Scripture's
Letter to their best power, which themselves
had taught them <hi>might</hi> securely, nay <hi>ought</hi> in
conscience be follow'd, let the Consent of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
and the present Church made up of mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
men say what they would, what follow's, I say,
but that exasperated beyond patience by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
which they will be apt to conceive to be
a most senceless and self-condemning tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Consciences, they will (unless Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
be vigilant,) strive to wreak their malice
against their Persecutors; and if they be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and powerful, endeavour to involve whole
Nations in war and blood; which God of his
mercy avert from our distracted Country. Of so
main consequence it is both for Church and State
that men's Minds be right set in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Grounds of Christianity; and that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
they build Religion on be <hi>Evident,</hi> that is,
apt to unite their Understa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dings and by it their
Affections; not uncertain and vertible, which
must needs lead (if pursu'd by an earnest zeal)
to nothing but diversities in Opinions about
Faith, thence to dissensions and Feuds in the
Will, which upon any great pressure will be apt
to break forth into actions of highest enmity;
and by the irreconcileableness of such Interests,
(neither side being able to yeeld to the other in
what each of rhem holds Sacred, Religious and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51890:45"/>
Conscientious) endless and fiercest bickerings
are apt to succeed, even to utter desolation; as
frequent Histories too lamentably record. Not
that I intend the Justification of those revolting
Sects, who having no certain Grounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
are both self-condemn'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Light of Reason for disobeying a Certain
and Known Legal Authority (which God's Law
and plain Reason commands them to submit to)
to maintain an Uncertainty, that is for any thing
they know an Error; and, were it a known Truth
they held, would be no less condemn'd by the
Law of God and common Reason, nay out the
nature of Religion it self, for making Rebellion
and an unimpower'd Sword the Defence of
Truth which stands firm on a surer Basis. I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mind prudent Considerers on the by how much
it conduces to State-Unity and Peace that the
Principle of conveying Faith to us be built on
<hi>Sensible Evidence</hi> acknowledgable by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
when rightly understood; and not left to
giddy Interpretations of Private Fancies, which
are apt to run so eccentrically to one another,
that we can never expect they shall have any
common point, where to fix and unite men's
Minds and Afflections.</p>
                  <p>5. The usefulness of this Parergon serves to
elucidate as it were ptactically and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
the Certainty of Tradition. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
use we make of it in this present Discourse,
whence we digrest into it, is to conclude (as well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51890:46"/>
as we can of things at a common view, which yet
is no less certain) that the number of the actual
Deserters of the natural way of Tradition have
been but few, to wit the first Revolters, a small
handfull compar'd to all Christianity besides,
and onely occasionally not constantly happening;
that the Descendents of these Revolters were
taught by them to believe Them in the right, in
interpreting Scripture, and not their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that is, follow'd the way of Tradition,
however misplac't: To which if we compare
the numerous contingencies both in man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and other circumstances, hindring Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
every day happening, we shall find
much reason to prefer the multitudes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before this: But if we add to this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the daily decay of innumerable particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
upon whom the Continuation of Mankind
depends, by natural or accidental deaths, and
reflect on the innumerable new Subjects and even
whole Nations into which Tradition hath and
does daily propagate it self, and those unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by new Heresies for whole Ages, that is
without any one Deserter of Tradition among
them; and none of those beholding to Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors
for their Faith but to Externs who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
them, whereas <hi>Propagating their Kind</hi> can
onely be by those of the same race; We shall
find that the Causes laid to propagate &amp; preserve
a Body of <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi> look far more
steadily and less needing a recourse to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51890:46"/>
Providence than those which we can disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid for the keeping on Foot a Body of <hi>Men.</hi>
Whence, if any (as the common fashion is) bring
against the perpetuation of <hi>Tradition</hi> such wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roving
Arguments as would equally strike at the
Certainty of perpetuating <hi>Mankind,</hi> or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
any <hi>Species</hi> in Nature, the readiest answer
is to show they do so; and then to tell them
we intend not Tradition should last longer than
the onely <hi>Species</hi> capable of Faith will; that is,
longer than Mankind is to stand, who onely can
have it or need it.</p>

                  <p>2 Though indeed this seems a needless endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

points of Faith in which we agree came dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
by this way of Tradition. Whence, he is to

                     </gap>
which we agree held in all Ages since Christ by

                     </gap>
points of Faith. Next, he is to be askt, whether
seeing those points were held ever of Faith, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did not actually teach Children so, or the
former Age the later. Common reason will
teach him they did; which devolves into this
that a Protestant must confess those points came
down by Tradition, and that Tradition hath
not faild to bring them down to us. Ask him
next by what virtue Tradition perform'd this
and whether the same virtue were not powerful
to bring down others as well as these had any
such been? And, when he assignes this virtue,
I cannot suspect him negative in so plain a point.
Ask him farther; Is there not a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
and Relation between such a constant
Cause and its formal Effect? So that, if its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Effect be <hi>Those Points received as delivered
ever,</hi> the Proper Cause must be an <hi>ever-delivery,</hi>
whence, we can argue from such an Effect to its
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51890:47"/>
Cause for <hi>any</hi> particular Point, and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for any Point that is in Controversie between
Them and Us, in case it be a Point we held ever
deliver'd: And if so, as manifest Reason evinces
it, our now-held Faith was taught by Christ
and his Apostles, and our dispute is at an end.
But, because I rather suspect the Protestant see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Cause and Interest too deep engag'd and
himself streightned by such strict Connexion of
Terms, will fly of and deny Tradition to be a
<hi>necessary Cause,</hi> notwithstanding its constant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of having wrought this its Effect millions of
times, or from step to step during so many Ages,
and will not care to alledge that all this is pure
Chance and contingency, I shall pursue the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
and Method I at first intended.</p>
                  <p>3. The Effect then we will pitch upon and
avow to be the proper one of such a Cause, is
<hi>The present perswasion of Traditionary-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(or Catholicks,) that their Faith hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from Christ and his Apostles uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,</hi>
which we find most firmly rooted in their
hearts. And the Existence of this Perswasion
we affirm to be Impossible without the Existence
of <hi>Traditions ever-Indeficiency</hi> to beget it.</p>
                  <p>4. To prove this, I lay this first Principle.
<hi>That Age which holds her Faith deliver'd thus from
the Apostles neither can it self have chang'd any
thing in it, nor know or doubt that any Age since
the Apostles had chang'd or innovated any thing
therein.</hi> This Proposition needs no proof to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51890:48"/>
evidence it, but onely an Explication; For,
since no man can <hi>hold</hi> contrary to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or <hi>doubt</hi> of what he <hi>holds,</hi> nor change or
innovate in the case propos'd without <hi>knowing</hi>
he did so; 'tis a manifest Impossibility an whole
Age should fall into an Absurdity so inconsistent
with the Nature of one single man.</p>
                  <p>5. The second Principle shall be this, <hi>No Age
could innovate any thing, and withal deliver that
very thing to Posterity as receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d from Christ by
continual succession.</hi> For, since Man is a rational
Creature, he must have some reason or motive,
good or bad, which he proposes to himself as an
Eud to be atchiev'd by his action; and (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his remote end is) his immediate End in
telling Posterity a late invented thing was held
immediately before, is to make them believe
it; Wherefore, since a seen Impossibility can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a motive to one not frantick, and that
'tis evidently Impossible they should make Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
believe a thing so universally known to be
false as this must needs be; because were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the whole Age should conspire to tell such a
lye, (the <hi>whole,</hi> I say, otherwise the Refusers
would easily discover the cheat) yet 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
Impossible all at age to know the truth
should conspire from so many several and so far
distant places, in the precise time to deceive the
new Off-spring every moneth ripening to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of such knowledges, or blot out all the
Monuments which would evidently undeceive
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51890:48"/>
their abused Posterity: 'Tis then as impossible
this Principle should falter as that the foregoing
Age should conspire to act without a motive
or that the succeeding Age should <hi>believe</hi> what
they <hi>know</hi> to be <hi>otherwise;</hi> that is, should hold
both sides of a Contradiction in a clear matter of
Fact, which is utterly inconsistent with a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or congnoscitive nature.</p>
                  <p>6. These Principles lay'd, we we will advance
to the proof of our main Conclusion on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
that since neither any Age (by our first
Principle) could hold a new introduc't point for
not-new but immediately deliver'd; nor yet any
foregoing Age (by our second) make it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
as not-new by Posterity, it follows that
in no Age could any doctrin changing the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Faith of Fore-fathers or new at that time,
come in or be received under the notion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
deliver'd or not-new at that time.
Wherefore, since nothing can descend or come
down under the notion of not-new, or deliver'd
uninterruptedly, unless it first come in or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
under the notion of not-new or deliver'd
uninterruptedly, nor be held by us as descended
under such a notion unless it did actually descend
to us under such a notion (by the second) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
manifestly that, if we now hold it descended
as such, it did descend as such, and consequently
was received by the deliverers as such; and (the
same reason holding equally in each Age from
Christ,) came down consequently from Christ
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51890:49"/>
and his Apostles. No power then or wit of man
could make our Faith <hi>now held to be so descended,</hi>
but <hi>its having been actually so descended:</hi> that is,
onely the Existence of Tradition's Indeficiency
could have effected this present persuasion of
Traditionary Christians (or Catholicks) that
their Faith descended uninterruptedly from the
Apostles. It being then manifest by Experience
that this Effect or present Persuasion <hi>is,</hi> (for all
Catholiks hold the Church never fail'd in Faith,)
'tis demonstratively Evident that its proper and
onely Cause has been put; that is, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Tradition has ever been held to by a Body
of Men consisting of the Predecessors to those
whom we find actually thus perswaded.</p>

                  <p>1. BUt all this is Nature may some say, and by
this Method an Heathen may by his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wit become a good Christian. By which
word <hi>Nature,</hi> if the Objecter means Reason
wrought upon by motives laid by God's special
goodness to bring Souls to Bliss, I wonder what
else is <hi>Supernaturality</hi> but this which he miscalls
<hi>Nature;</hi> and why Reason, rectify'd by such
Lights and Proposals as the force of Nature
could not have aym'd at much less effected,
ought not to be said to be affected <hi>supernaturally,</hi>
however those very motives be connatural to our
Souls: It being evident that we use even the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power of our Reason in discoursing of things
above our reason; and, on the other side to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no constant way or common path of motives
laid for the Salvation of Mankind, but extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
inspirations for each particular man, unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell's
the Order of God's best Providence, and
is the very notion of Fanatickness. But to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with this point is out of my road otherwise
than to take my rise hence to show how far
Christian Tradition is strengthen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d above the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51890:50"/>
greatest meerly-human Testimony whatever:
And that the Church owes this strength to those
Motives supervening to meer Nature, which we
rightly call <hi>Assistances of the Holy Ghost;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they are built on Perfections of Will in the
Faithful, or on Virtues, the Effects properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to that Divine Person.</p>
                  <p>2. Ere we come to explain what advantage
the Church as thus divinely assisted has over her
self as meerly wrought upon by human motives,
we will compare first her human Authority with
some other vast Body of Testifiers which may
most seem to stand in competition with her. And
an eminent and acute opposer of Tradition has
already pointed us out a choice one; namely,
that of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> for <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Existence:
which we doubt not to have the power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
down the Truth thereof with Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
to the end of the world, if follow'd; not
do we think the most Sceptical Protestant doubts
but it has had the force to make it self be follow'd
hitherto; however at unawares their calm Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
grants that to a Body of Turks which their
Passion makes them question and even deny to
a Church of Christians. Yet, I averr that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
force of Tradition in the Church for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
of the main Body of Christs doctrin far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that of the Turks for <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</p>
                  <p>3. To shew this in brief I note in the first
place and chiefly; that howsoever a report may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51890:50"/>
spread universally from a small beginning in the
quality of a rumour, yet the force of its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility,
if it be a matter of Fact, is founded
on the Quantity and Quality of those who first
saw or perceiv'd it. Putting then the Quality
of the Testifiers in both cases to be equal, so to
bring our Controversy to a smaller compass, and
comparing onely the Quantity or Number of the
original Testifiers on both sides; what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is there between that handful of men about
<hi>Mecha</hi> and some few other places where <hi>Mahomet</hi>
conquer'd and planted his doctrin, and those
vast multitudes whom all the Apostles, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Apostolical men converted by most
powerful miracles in so many distant Nations in
the World? If we lay them together we shall
find that few saw or felt (that is, were witnesses
of) <hi>Mahomets</hi> Existence so much as once, in
comparison of those who were every day imbu'd
with and practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Christian Doctrine. A new
Consideration springs hence that 'tis a thousand
times easier for that single company of <hi>Arabians</hi>
and <hi>Syrians</hi> to conspire to a ly and so deliver
down to us a false <hi>Mahomet,</hi> than it is for such a
multitude of people in so remote Countries as
first suck't in Christianity to conspire in the very
thought of having such a Conspiracy. And,
lastly, it was as easie by oft repeated Sensatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
to know Christian Doctrin at first to that degree
as to govern their actions by it (which is all that
is requisit for the generality) it giving the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51890:51"/>
to the daily practice of their new Life as
they were Christians, as it was for these other
witnesses to be certain of <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Existence;
and much easier, in regard the greater part by
far of those whom we allow Witnesses of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi>
Existence perhaps scarce knew him by
sight; not conversing him daily or very often,
as each of the Primitive Christians did with
those points of Faith they guided their lives
by.</p>
                  <p>4. The human Authority then of the Church
being such as exceeds she Evidence of other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
which yet are such that amongst all
the most extravagant <hi>Opiniastres</hi> none was ever
found so frantick as to doubt them; and should
any do so, all sober Mankind would esteem
them stark mad; which could not be done in
reason unless they renounc't perfect evidence,
that is, unless those Testimonies were perfectly
Evident: This, I say, being so, some may
think it superfluous and a quirk of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
Fancy to contend there is any greater
Evidence to ascertain the conveyance of our
Faith from Christ's time to us. But, whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
on the reason of those words, <hi>Sic Deus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexit
Mundum ut Filium suum Vnigenitum daret,</hi>
John 3. 16. Or for those, <hi>Nunquid de bobus cura
est Deo?</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 9. <hi>Nonne vos magis pluris
estis volatilibus caeli?</hi> Mat. 6. 26. and such
like; or, on what Metaphysicks demonstrate
concerning the perfect methods and wayes of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51890:51"/>
Essential Wisdome, will easily be convinc't
that, if the Salvation of Mankind be the <hi>End</hi> of
this material world's Creation, the Providences
to bring about this End ought in true wisdome
be so particular and so sublimely efficacious that
the means laid for the preservation of any other
<hi>species</hi> in Nature would scarce deserve the name
of a Providence in comparison of the other.
Whence follows, that the means which are
mainly influential to promote Man towards
Bliss (such as is <hi>Faith,</hi> the Rule of that Life by
which he tends to Heaven, and the <hi>Substance of
his Hope</hi> which gives the vigour to that Life)
must be Certain (its Efficacy depending on this
Certainty) beyond any Evidence meer Nature
could compass. Which that great Mèditater on
God's Law day and night well comprehended,
when out of the full sight of this Truth he burst
out into that expression of wonderment, <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia
tua, Domine, credibilia, facta suut ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. We will briefly touch at some of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which those Assistances superadded to
Nature give the Church, and leave them to be
scann'd by the leasurely thoughts of attentive
Considerers.</p>
                  <p>6. First then, we find that 'tis natural to every
Man that his Phantasms should be such as the
Impressions of the Objects are apt to make them,
his Thoughts appropriated to his Phantasms,
and his outward expressions concerning the thing,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51890:52"/>
and amongst them his Words, conformable to his
Thoughts: So that true Words and sincere Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the proper Effects of the other Causes,
and necessarily produc't by them if Designe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not: Which amounts to this, that 'tis Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for every man to speak Truth; and that,
whenever one speaks False wittingly, Artifice
makes him cast about to contrive a ly fittingly
to the end he aims at; whence it is that Fools
and drunken men, who are incapable of such
Artifice, use to tell the plain Truth. If this be
so in Nature, and that Grace is to perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in whatever is good in it, it follows that
one truly Christian heart is far more fixt to Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
than others not imbu'd with those heavenly
Tenets; and consequently that a Multitude of
such incomparably exceed, in point of testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the same number of others unfortify'd by
Christ's Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>7. This will be clearer if we reflect upon the
way by which Original Corruption violates fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in execution this natural Veracity; and
'tis this; that inclining and transporting them to
the undue love of Creatures even to the injuring
known rational Orders laid in the world and
most necessary for the subsistence or Universal
well-being of Mankind (which we call the
Commandments) hence, afraid to own such an
enormous procedure, they cast about to cloak
it with sought pretences. The sum therefore
of Christianity tending to implant in the hearts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51890:52"/>
of the Faithful an over-powering Love of
Supreme spiritual Goods attainable in the next
Life, and by consequence to take off their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
affection to earthly things, it leaves
Man's natural disposition to Truth free to do its
Effect, and renders needless that crafty way of
design, onely which could byass and pervert
the Will from pursuing the way of Nature.</p>
                  <p>8. Compare we now the positive Motives,
<hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> obliging to Veracity,
and we find the Hopes and Fears which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
proposes to make and keep men Good as
infinitly exceeding the Natural ones as Eternity
does a moment, abating the intenseness of the
Goods and Harms hop't for and fear'd, nay held
firmly by all and conceited lively by many to be
beyond all imaginable comparison greater than
the other. Yet experience tells us and none
doubts but that these transitory and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-less
Goods and Harms are sufficient Motives
to oblige Bodies of Men to deliver down Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Natural matters of Fact, as the Existence
of such former Kings (to blunder which truth
there wanted not highest Interests were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
feisible) such Eclipses, Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concievably
more powerful then must the other
motives be to oblige them to Veracity in such
narrations on which the destroying or preserving
those highest concerns depend. And what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
Eternal motives had over Temporal
ones when they came to clash so neer as one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51890:53"/>
must forego one Hope or the other is seen by the
perpetual and constant sufferings of the Martyrs
in all Ages, and the many Persecutions daily
and gladly undergone every day in many places
for Conscience-sake.</p>
                  <p>9. In the Natural Commonwealth there are
multitudes of men deputed particularly to great
Trusts, and some Extraordinary Ceremony done
upon them to make them true to such Trusts,
nay Oaths by things they highly reverence taken,
not onely by those Officers, but sometimes
(though rarely) by the Generality to secure
their Fidelity. But what proportion can those
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> bear being but of human Institution
to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the Church held to have
been instituted by Christ himself; many of
which are common to all Christians; some to
initiate them most solemnly at first, or to rivet
that Initiation with a new military <hi>Tessera;</hi> some
to strengthen and cure the languishing; some to
win to Love by Acts of greatest Bounty; Others
are proper to impower some as Officers to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
the common affairs of Faith; all tending to
strengthen powerfully the Generality not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate
from the Faith held ever truly received
down, and particularly to oblige Governours
not to bely themselves or connive at others gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belying their Forefathers and betraying their
<hi>Depositum.</hi>

more wicked and consequently
disgraceful must that man be, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the motives he had not to do it, as to
his own concerns, full as Infinit; his lye most
Notorious to all about him, and even the whole
World. And, if he be a Pastor, who (besides
other Sacraments implying most obliging vows
not to renounce his Faith) is consecrated by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
one to preach Christ's doctrin truly and to
preserve his Flock sound in Faith to his power,
then to prevaricate from this Duty renders him
a sacrilegious abuser of the most holy state of life,

by our Saviour, has in it. What inconcieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
villany then and consequently discredit must
that man seeingly undergo, who shall misteach
his own Fancies for doctrins deliver'd; and how

                  <p>14. It would require a large volum, to unfold
particularly how each virtue contributes to show
the inerrable Indeficiency of Tradition, and how
the Principles of almost each Science are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in demonstrating its Certainty: <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi>
lends her Numbring and Multiplying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

Strength of Certitude in Christian Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
those Attestations which breed Certainty
in Human affairs; <hi>Logick</hi> her skill to frame and
make us see the Connexions it has with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our Understanding; <hi>Nature</hi> her Laws
of Motion and Action; <hi>Morality,</hi> her first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that nothing is done <hi>gratis</hi> by a Cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Nature, and that the Body of Traditionary
Doctrin is most conformable to Practical Reason:
<hi>Historical Prudence</hi> clears the Impossibility of an
undiscernible revolt from points to descended &amp;
held so Sacred; <hi>Politicks</hi> show this to be the best
way imaginable to convey down such a Law as it
concerns every man to be skilful in: <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>

of <hi>Being</hi> which fixes every Truth; so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing

or Reasons exempt from change or motion: <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:51890:56"/>
demonstrates it most worthy God and
most conducive to bring Mankind to Bliss. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Controversy</hi> evidences the total Uncertainty
of any thing concerning Faith if this can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and makes use of all the rest to establish
the Certainty of this first Principle; and, which
settled, secures Scripture as far as is requisit, and
all things else that can mainly concern Salvation.
To pursue these and many other Testimonies of
Tradition's Infallibleness is not my task at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
I shall content my self with concluding,
that, as we have prov'd it self-evident that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
if ever held to is an inerrable Rule, so
our four last Discourses have shown its ever-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficiency
or rather Indefectibleness, scientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Evident; and as strong as Nature and
Grace strain'd (as we may say) to their utmost
can make it.</p>

                  <p>1. NOne can pretend to have Faith (by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

holders to Tradition. <hi>'Tis prov'd by our Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Tradition is the Rule of Faith, <hi>that is, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Way to arrive at Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>None can with right pretend to be a Church
but the Followers of Tradition.</hi> For, since
<hi>(Corol. 1.)</hi> none can have Faith by the ordinary
course of God's Providence but the holders to
Tradition, and a Church must be a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of persons truly <hi>Faithful,</hi> or who have true
Faith coming to them by ordinary means, (as
we daily experience,) 'tis manifest that none but
the Followers of Tradition can pretend to be a
true Church.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>None can be of the Church or any Church but
Followers</hi> of <hi>Tradition.</hi> For, seeing a Church is
a Congregation of persons who have true Faith
coming to them by ordinary means, and (<hi>Disc.</hi> 5.
§. 15.) Tradition is this means, it follows that none
are of the Church or any Church but they who
have true Faith by this means, that is, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                     <hi>Those who renounce Tradition or Immediate
Delivery, are</hi> ipso facto <hi>cut off from the Root of

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51890:57"/>
seeing that is <hi>to us,</hi> or in the way of reasoning,
the <hi>Root</hi> of any Knowledge whence that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
springs, and Faith is no Knowledge in us,
(<hi>Disc.</hi> 1. 15. and <hi>Corol.</hi> 1.) but by relying on
the Rule of Faith or Tradition as on its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
'tis manifest that they who renounce Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
want the Root of Faith, nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are Faithful nor of the Church, but are Dead
branches or Opiners onely.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>That company of men who follow such Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
as formerly renounc't Tradition or Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Delivery are no less cut off from the Root of
Faith.</hi> For, since (<hi>Corol.</hi> 4.) those Ancestours
renouncing Tradition formerly were by so doing
cut off from the Root of Faith, their Followers
(for how many Generations soever they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue)
must be so likewise, as wanting and not
daring even to pretend to that Faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>causing
Principle of Tradition or uninterrupted Delivery
which their Forefathers had renounc't.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>They who follow such Ancestors as formerly
had manifestly renounc't Tradition (how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
soever) can never claim to be a part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Tradition or deliverers of Faith.</hi> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(<hi>Corol.</hi> 5.) they are cut off from Tradition
and so can be no part of it. Next, because Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Tradition is Indeficient or Uninterrupted,
(<hi>Disc.</hi> 6, 8, and 9.) and so none can lay claim to
it who cannot lay claim to Uninterruptedness;
which those we speak of cannot. The saying then
of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis, Id teneamus quod ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51890:57"/>
quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est,</hi>
and that we must follow <hi>Vniuersality, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>Consent,</hi> can onely be meant within the
verge of those who adhere to Tradition, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Doctrin formerly deliver'd, not of those
who have broke from it; otherwise all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in the world, especially the Primitive ones
might claim to be part of the Church.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>They who pretend themselves Reformers in
Faith, do</hi> ipso facto, <hi>manifest themselves cut off
from the Root of Faith and the Church.</hi> For
since Points of Faith are Truths, and so have no
Degrees in them, but are Indivisible; <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Faith</hi> cannot mean <hi>mending Faith,</hi> but
putting it <hi>anew.</hi> But this presupposes Tradition
Interrupted, wherefore Reformers in Faith must
renounce Uninterruptedness of Delivery, that
is, they must renounce <hi>Tradition;</hi> (<hi>Disc.</hi> 6. 8,
9.) and consequently they are cut off from the
Root of Faith. (<hi>Coroll.</hi> 4.)</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>That Body of men who adhere to Tradition can
evidence clearly and plainly who are truly Faithful,
who not.</hi> For, since (<hi>Coroll.</hi> 4. &amp; 5.) to those men 'tis
all one to renounce Immediate or Uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Delivery, or follow those who renounc't it,
as to be cut off from the Root of Faith; and all
one to be Faithful and to rely on that Principle:
Again, seeing 'tis evident by clear matter of
Fact who rely and proceed upon it, who not;
That Body of men who adhere to Tradition
can evidence clearly and plainly who are truly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51890:58"/>
Faithful, who not; and (if Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be instituted by our Saviour and so a Point
of Faith, and so descended to us by the Rule of
Faith) who are of the Church, who not.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>None else can give any certain account who
are to be held truly Faithful and of the Church,
who not.</hi> For since without Tradition both Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Sence of Scripture is Uncertain (<hi>Disc.</hi> 4.)
and subject to dispute (as we also daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
it follows that all the deniers of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are uncertain who have the right Letter or
Sence of Scripture; that is, whom they are to
esteem Faithful (or sit to be of the Church)
whom not. Again, Tradition being the onely
certain Rule of Faith, if one Revolter from it
may be admitted, all may, so they prosess Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in outward talk which they will easily
do: Wherefore, since the Denier of Tradition
deems some one Revolter from it to be of the
Church, that is, himself; he may, nay ought
judge so of all the rest, provided they talk a few
fine pious words of God and Christ, which what
Hereticks but did?</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>None can rationally punish the Revolters
from their Faith but that Body which adheres to
radition.</hi> For since, setting aside Tradition, both
Letter and Sence of Scripture is Uncertain,
(<hi>Disc.</hi> 4.) the Guilt of those Revolters is also
Uncertain: seeing then none can even pretend
to correct a fault much less punish it upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Grounds, none can rationally go about to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51890:58"/>
punish their Revolters from Faith unless it be
that body which adheres to Tradition; and They
can. For, in regard Tradition's Certainty is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the rudest by common sence, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 5.
§. 8.) and likewise 'tis as evident to Governours
who revolt from it as it is to know when one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledges
and rises against a settled civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the Laws of the Land; 'Tis most
manifest that the Revolter hath both Passion or
Guilt enough to be held punishable, and the
Christian Magistrate evidence enough of his Fact
to go about to punish it. To avoid mistake, I
declare that in this Corollary I onely discourse
what may or may not be done upon a <hi>Church-account,</hi>
what may be fit to be done upon a
<hi>State-account,</hi> I am neither able to judge, nor
do I meddle with it.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>No Company of men hang together like a
Body of a Christian Common-wealth or</hi> CHURCH
<hi>but that which adheres to Tradition.</hi> For, since 'tis
manifest that every external Commonwealth or
Body of men hath some Outward Marks proper
to it, by which the members of it have their
coherence, or consistency and that those are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
tokens to distinguish it from any other; and
as manifest that all the marks proper to a Church
as such depend upon the Rule of Faith, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 1.
§. 15.) and their Certainty on its; and lastly,
that none of the pretended Rules of Faith
(all of them building on Scripture's Letter) are
Certain, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 2. 3, 4.) without Tradition; it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51890:59"/>
follows that no other company have any Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Distinction from others, that is either of
Constitution or self-preservation under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Church,</hi> but that which adheres to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All the loud out-cry then made common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against that Body which adheres to Tradition,

onely the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> and excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

and well-grounded, till it be shown by evident
Discourse that the other Pretenders have some

she proceeds and by which she consists.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>There is no arguing against Tradition out
of Scripture.</hi> For, since (as we have prov'd <hi>Disc.</hi> 4.)
there can be no absolute Certainty of Scripture's
Letter without Tradition, this must first be
suppos'd <hi>Certain</hi> ere the Scripture's Letter can
be rationally held such; and consequently
ought in reason to be held <hi>Vncertain</hi> while Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it to be argu'd against, that
is, while it's Certainty is doubted of. Wherefore
since none can argue solidly upon <hi>uncertain</hi>
Grounds, none ought to argue against Tradition
out of the Letter of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>None can in reason oppose the Authority of
the Church or any Church against Tradition.</hi> First
because in reality <hi>Tradition</hi> (rightly understood)
is the same thing materially with the <hi>living Voic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

and Practice of the whole Church Essential, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Pastors and Layity;</hi> which is so ample that
it includes all imaginable Authority which can
be conceiv'd to be in a <hi>Church.</hi> Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the way of generating Faith Tradition
formally taken is antecedent to, (<hi>Disc. 2. §.</hi> 11.)
and so in the way of Discourse working by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and abstracted notions its notion must be
presuppos'd and its Certainty establish't before
the notion and Certainty of <hi>Faith,</hi> consequently
of <hi>Faithful,</hi> and consequently of Church, which
must necessarily be a congregation of <hi>Faithful.</hi>
Whence they would argue very preposterously
who should go about to oppose <hi>Church</hi> against
<hi>Tradition;</hi> this being the same as to think to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the House by overthrowing the Foundation.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>None can in reason oppose the Authority of
Fathers or Councils against Tradition.</hi> This is
evident by the former, (<hi>Corol.</hi> 13.) in regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these have any Authority but as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
of the Church, or Eminent Members
of the Church: Nor can any determin certainly
what is a Father or Council (<hi>Disc.</hi> 2. §. 11.) till
the notion of <hi>Church,</hi> that is of <hi>Faithful,</hi> that is
of <hi>Faith,</hi> that is of <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> that is of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
be certainly establish't.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>No Disacknowledgers of Tradition are in
Due of reason but in Courtesy onely to be allow'd to
argue out of Scripture's Letter, Father or Council.</hi>
For, since, wanting Tradition they have Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of none of those (as was prov'd, <hi>Disc.</hi> 2. §. 11.)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51890:60"/>
'tis manifest that, disacknowledging Tradition,
while they alledge and talk of these they alledge
and talk of things themselves do not know to be
Certain. Wherefore, 'tis too great a Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and courtesy in Catholiks to let them run
forwards descanting with wordish Discourses on
those Testimonies after their raw manner, since
they might justly take their advantage against
them and show they have no right to make use
of Principles, which their own Grounds can
never make good to them; as was <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
smart and solid way, <hi>de Praescr. Haeret.</hi> c. 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21. denying them the use of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
who deny'd the Church; which would save
many an aiery confus'd discourse about words,
unapt to evidence any thing satisfactorily. Nor
can the right of an Opponent to argue <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
licence them to claim this favour from our
Controvertists; in regard we never held that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
Letter hammer'd upon by Criticisms and
such pretty knacks of human Learning was the
Ground of our Faith nor the way to establish it,
but onely as interpreted by the Language and
Practice of the Church; nor consequently can we
hold it capable to be prejudic't by such endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of private Wits. Though then we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them a Copy of the Letter, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so far a liberty to argue <hi>ad hominem</hi> against us;
yet we never allow'd their method of arguing
from it, as efficacious, either to build or evert
Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, but our learned Controvertists ever held
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51890:60"/>
direct contrary. Whence, in case they clamour
that in not following their wild method we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
Scripture (to avoid which calumny with the
vulgar I conceive one reason our Controvertists
generally were so civil to them as to cope with
them in their fleight way) the unreasonableness
of the Calumny is to be made appear, which is
quicklier done, not their unreasonable expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be satisfy'd.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>No Authority from any History or Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
Writing <hi>is valid against the force of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
For, since Falshood is as easy to be writ
or printed as Truth, 'tis evident those <hi>Books</hi> can
give no Testimony to themselves that what they
express is <hi>certainly true;</hi> and, if we say they are
abetted by the Testimony of other Books, the
same question recurrs concerning them, in what
Age soever they were writ. It remains then that
'tis onely the Acceptation of Men or <hi>Sence</hi> writ
in their <hi>Hearts</hi> and so convey'd down from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Son that these Books are true Histories
and not Fables, which gives them any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
But this has plainly the nature of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
They have therefore no Authority but by
force of Tradition: Therefore they can have
no possible force against Tradition; since, if
Tradition, or the conveying down from hand to
hand sence writ thus universally in men's hearts,
can deceive us, no such Books can have any
Authority at all: Wherefore, not the <hi>Books,</hi> but
the <hi>Sence</hi> writ in men's hearts of the Goodness
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51890:61"/>
and skill of the Authours of those Books (upon
which qualifications the Truth of each passage
contain'd in those Books is built) is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
against Christian Tradition, since 'tis that
Sence which authorizes those Books and gives
Credibility to those passages, and so is stronger
than any <hi>dead</hi> Testimony from the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Which devolves into this, that onely some
great Tradition or <hi>living Testimony</hi> for things
past, can, in point of Authority, be pretended an
equal match to <hi>Christian Tradition</hi> or competent
to be alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d against it.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>No Tradition is alledg'd or alledgeable in
reason against Christian Tradition.</hi> That none
is alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d is Evident from matter of Fact: For,
the Adversaries of Catholick Tradition never
pretend the Consent or constant Sence of great
multitudes deriv'd from age to age by living
voice that at such a time former Tradition was
relinquish't, new Faith introduc't, or the old
Faith chang'd or abolisht; but onely odd ends
or scraps of Histories or other dead Testimonies,
according as they light on some passage which
seems favourable to them, or may be rendred
interpretable that way. Whence, there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as many minds as men about the time when
any change was made; nay, some of their best
Champions, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Powel,</hi> profess
<hi>the time of the Romish Churches change cannot easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be told,</hi> and that they <hi>cannot tell by whom or at
what time the Enemy did sow the Papists Doctrin:</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:51890:61"/>
This, I say, being so, 'tis most Evident they
decline the pretence of any Tradition against
ours, and the very way of deriving down orally
and practically Sence writ in mens Hearts by
matter of Fact working on their Senses; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that, recurr to pittiful shreds and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> words, utterly unauthoriz'd if the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for that Books Goodness can fail: And, if
Catholick Tradition, which in its source was so
largely extended, visible and practicable by all
can faulter, ten thousand times more easily may
the Tradition for any particular Book, which in
comparison of the other can be but of a very
obscure Original, fail and deceive us.</p>
                  <p>Now, that no Tradition is alledgeable against
us by Protestants appears hence, that their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Forefathers little more than an 100.
Years ago being Catholicks; that is, holders of
their Faith no Novelty but uninterruptedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
could never conspire to deliver to
them any such sence that the Roman Church
had alter'd her Faith, since they had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
sence writ in the Tables of their hearts.
Nor can they have recourse to the Greek Church
for a Tradition opposit to ours for any points of
Faith in which they differ from us, for they will
find none such. Nor is the Greek Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours
to them here in <hi>England,</hi> nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
can they derive traditionarily from
them.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>No solid Argument from Reason or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51890:62"/>
Principles is producible against Christian
Tradition.</hi> For, since Arguments, if solid, are
taken from Things or Nature, and the Certainty
of Christian Tradition is built on the <hi>best</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, <hi>Man's;</hi> not according to what is
alterable in it, but what is (abstracting from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease)
absolutely unalterable; that is, on Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
imprinted by natural Sensations; and this
Knowledge strengthen'd and made most lively
by the oft-repeatedness of those Sensations, and
the import of the Things known: Also, since
most efficacious Causes actually appli'd, that
is, impossible not to do the Effect, and Effects
impossible to be without such a Cause's Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
are engag'd for the ever-continuance or
Uninterruptedness of Tradition (as hath been
shown, <hi>Disc.</hi> 6. &amp; 8.) and the force of those
preserving Causes strengthen'd by the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
assistances of the Holy Ghost, (<hi>Disc.</hi> 9.)
or by best Graces superadded to best Nature;
'Tis impossible any solid Argument from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be brought against Tradition.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>The arguing by way of some few Instances</hi>
(as the manner is) <hi>can have no force against Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition's
Certainty and Indefectiveness.</hi> For, seeing
a pretended Instance of Tradition's failing is a
particular action presumed to be long ago past,
and particulars out of the very nature of being
particulars are surrounded by a thousand indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duating
circumstances or rather constituted by
them, that is, are plac't in the proper sphere of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51890:62"/>
Contingency: and that particular Action is put
to be long ago past, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o affects not our Senses
by Experience (in which is founded the force of
Instances, in regard Experimental Knowledge is
a necessary Effect of the Things being such as it
is known) Nor have we, or can we have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tradition, any certain knowledge (<hi>Coroll.</hi>
16.) that the Points of Faith pretended to have
miscarried or to have been alter'd then, or else
the manner of expressing them, were not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
then or misrepresented to us now; nor
that Interest (for example) of one party pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
between both, ambiguity of words, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or confusedness of report grounding the
Historians narration, rashness of belief in him,
corruption of his Books since they were writ, and
innumerable other chances apt to occasion mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
did not intervene; any of which would
render the Instance uncertain, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from it Inconclusive. Again, seeing we
can have certainty of our own meaning of our
words when we demonstrate, and also of our
consequence, it follows that the way for a solid
man to answer Traditions pretended demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
must be to show the incoherence of the
Terms, and not to bring some old story against
it; which were to produce Uncertainty known
to be such, against pretended Certainty and not
yet known to be other than such; nay whose
Evidence we cannot in reason deny till we can
solve the connexion of Terms drawn from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51890:63"/>
intrinsecal Mediums, on which 'tis built.</p>
                  <p>20. <hi>The denying Tradition is a proper and
necessary disposition to Fanatickness.</hi> For, since
no Argument taken from any <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>written</hi>
Testimony, (<hi>Coroll.</hi> 12. 14. 16.) nor <hi>living</hi>
Testimony of <hi>Tradition,</hi> (<hi>Coroll.</hi> 13. 17.) nor
from any thing in Nature, <hi>Coroll.</hi> 18.) that is,
from any thing <hi>without</hi> us which is a second
<hi>Cause,</hi> is valid against Tradition: It follows that
Tradition cannot be denied but by pretending
some Light or Knowledge <hi>within us</hi> deriv'd from
the immediate Influence of the <hi>First Cause.</hi> To
which pretence helps its difficulty to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
in regard 'tis easie to stand stiff in this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
that they see clearly such Truths by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Light, and that therefore it were a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to go about to confute their own manifest
Experience; whereas, were Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc-t
openly, they and their confutations might
be publisht together, and the Truth would lie
expos'd to the scanning and decision of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
part of the world, and be clear'd by a
few Replies if a right method of discourse be
taken. Wherefore, since Nature will easily
teach the obstinate deniers of any Principle to
avail themselves by the best plea they can to
escape confuting, 'tis manifest that Nature will
connaturally carry the deniers of Tradition to
Fanatick Pranciples, and that men are so long
and no longer preserv'd from Fanatickness than
they follow Tradition or the openly declar'd
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51890:63"/>
Sence of Forefathers either in our Church or some
other Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Again, Tradition being the way of coming to
Faith by the open use of our Senses, the denying
it must drive the deniers to deny that way, and
to recurr to Knowledge had some other way;
Not to Knowledge acquir'd by human skill, (the
Knowledge of such high mysteries being confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
more than human) therefore to infus'd
Knowledge; and this not infus'd by ordinary
wayes, as preaching, teaching of Forefathers and
such like (as we experience such Knowledges to
be infus'd into us) for this again falls into the way
of Tradition; therefore they can onely have refuge
to inward Light or Knowledge infus'd extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
or without connatural means; to make
which the common road of receiving Heaven's
Influences is the very definition of Fanatickness.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Fanatick Principles can have no force against
Tradition, though unconfutable but by it.</hi> For,
since they pretend for their ground a Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
imprinted on such a manner as manifests God
the Authour, that is, an Effect which onely
themselves know and are conscious of, and on
the other side nothing appears why such a kind
of Impression is impossible, nay 'tis granted possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
'tis clear none can argue against that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Light's existence out of the nature of that
inward perswasion Fanaticks have, in regard 'tis
latent and unknown. It follows then that the
way to conclude against it is to show out of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51890:64"/>
Principles the contrary to these Inspiration
to be Truth: None therefore (as plain matter
of Fact testifies) taking the way of arguing from
<hi>Principles</hi> absolutely <hi>evident,</hi> or demonstrating,
but Catholiks or the followers of Tradition, and
they effecting this by virtue of Tradition, <hi>Disc.</hi> 5,
6, 8.) it follows that they and onely they are able
to confute Fanaticks and conclude their inward
Light delusive. Again, since a Fanatick builds
on conceited experience of Divine Inspiration,
there is no hopes to convince his Judgment
without producing Demonstration for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
a task onely performable in the way of
Tradition. Which is enforc't and strengthen'd
by this Consideration, that the Basis of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is natural Knowledge directly imprinted
by his Senses, in which Knowledges he is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable;
and these Sensations or Knowledges
are daily repeated, not on one private temper
but on innumerable millions conspiring in the
same, that is, Tradition is built on almost Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,
daily and most manifest Experiences; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the conceited Effect of Inspiration, or his strong
persuasion that God speaks thus inwardly is
found with consent of tenets in a few onely; and
liable to deceit by depending upon Fancy, not
Sense; as appears in diseased or mad persons, and
the Fanaticks contradicting one another though
both proceeding on the same Principle. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tradition's help then 'tis very hard (if not
impossible) to confute Fanaticks, (as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51890:64"/>
also testifies by Protestants being forc't to
recurr to Tradidion in disputes with them)
though very easy with it, or by means of it.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>There is no arguing against Tradition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
questioning the Constancy of every species
in Nature, that is the Certainty of whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
For, seeing Man's Nature is as necessarily
fit to receive the direct Impressions of Objects on
his Soul, that is Natural Knowledges, and as
necessarily determin'd to work for a motive or
reason good or bad, as Fire is to heat or water to
wet, and this absolutely and alwayes abstracting
from disease incapacitating him to use his senses
or his Fancy, and both these spring out of the
very Substance of his Nature as Rational or of
such a <hi>species,</hi> which Original Corruption hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not; it follows that he is as fit for those O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
and consequently will as frequently
perform them as Fire burn, water wet, fruit-trees
bear fruit, or any other <hi>species</hi> in Nature
do its ptoper Effect; that is generally, and onely
rarely and contingently fail, unless the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of Nature order the whole course of
it worse for Man than for other things, which
were blasphemy to say, and contrary to
Experience; since we find a course of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturals
on foot, and that they comfort and
strengthen man's true nature as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
declared. Less liable then is the human
<hi>Species</hi> to contingency in those its natural ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
than any other kind is. Wherefore,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51890:65"/>
seeing Traditions Certainty is grounded upon
direct natural Knowledges, and its Indefective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on Mankind's Incapableness to act without
some motive; to argue against It were to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
These, that is, the constancy of the best
and best-supported <hi>Species</hi> in Nature, and a
<hi>fortiori</hi> the Constancy of the rest.</p>
                  <p>Note here, that all the Arguments brought
by witty Reasoners against Tradition are fetcht
from the Contingency of some one or some few
Particulars, whence by a wild kind of roving
way they would conclude the defectibleness of
the Generality or of the entire <hi>Species:</hi> But,
because it looks too palpably inconsequent in
Logicall form to say, <hi>a few can err,</hi> ergo <hi>all,</hi>
therefore they use to bring it in with a <hi>why not.</hi>
So that all the arguers against Tradition from
natural reason oppose directly any Constancy in
the <hi>Species</hi> or Generality, and so are destroyers
of natural Certainty and of their own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to boot.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>There is no possibility of arguing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Tradition rightly understood, or the living
voice of the Catholick Church with any
show of reason.</hi> For, since 'tis evident that
Scripture's Copy or Letter is in the whole and
every tittle Uncertain (<hi>Disc.</hi> 2, and 4.) without
Tradition; as also that the writings of Fathers,
Councils, History, and of any written or <hi>dead</hi>
Testimony whatever, (<hi>Corol.</hi> 14, and 16.) are

what is fetcht from Authority living or dead,

those Authorities, or from proper Effects or

or from extraordinary private and unseen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51890:66"/>
Effects of the first Cause; and none of
these bearing any show against Tradition; 'Tis
evident <hi>There is no possibility of arguing against
Tradition rightly understood, or the living voice
of the Catholick Church, with any show of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Tradition is the First Principle in the way
of Authority as it engages for matter of Fact long
ago past.</hi> For, seeing that is the first Principle
in any Knowledge into which all Knowledges
in that kind are resolv'd to establish their Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and all ptetended Authorities for any
matter of Fact long ago past (<hi>Corol.</hi> 16.) and
consequently all Knowledges caus'd by the
means of them, are resolv'd finally into Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and depend on it for their Certainty; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that Tradition is the very first Principle in
the way of Authority as it undertakes for the
truth of matters of Fact long ago past.</p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Tradition, in the matter of Tradition (that
is, in matter of Fact before our time) is Self-evident
to all those who can need the Knowledge
of such things, that is, to all Mankind who use
common Reason.</hi> This is evident from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
For, first Principles are to be Self-evident
to all those who are to use them and proceed
upon them, which in our case is the most ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vulgar.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>The Certainty of Tradition being establisht
the whole Body of the Faithful</hi> (by which I mean
<hi>Catholicks</hi>) <hi>or the Church Essential, is, by rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51890:66"/>
on it, infallibly certain that it is in possession
of Christ's true doctrin.</hi> For, since Tradition is
Self-evidently a Certain way if followd (<hi>Disc.</hi> 5.
§. 8. &amp; 13.) and both best Nature and best Grace
in this world are engaged that it hath been and
shall be ever followed. (<hi>Disc.</hi> 6. and 9.) Again,
since the Certainty of what Faith was formerly
taught must needs descend to us as matter of Fact
formerly past, that is whose Certainty depends
on Authority, and Tradition is the first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in way of Authority as it engages for matters
of Fact formerly past (<hi>Corol.</hi> 24.) and Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the proceeders on it (<hi>Corol.</hi> 25.) that is
to the Body of Catholicks: Lastly, since Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Tradition rightly understood is nothing but
the living voice of the Catholick Church Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
as <hi>delivering,</hi> 'tis manifestly and manifoldly
evident that that Body which relies on It, that
is the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church or (<hi>Corol.</hi> 6. &amp; 11.) the
whole Church Essential, is infallibly Certain
that she is in secure possession of Christs true
Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>27. <hi>Tradition once establisht, General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and even Provincial ones, nay particular
Churches are Infallible by proceeding upon It.</hi>
For the same reason; in regard that proceeding
on it they proceed upon a Certain and Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Principle; (<hi>Corol.</hi> 24. &amp; 25.) that is such
a one as neither they can mistake nor it mislead
them.</p>
                  <p>28. <hi>The Roman See with its Head are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51890:67"/>
Infallible by the same means.</hi> For, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
a more vigorous Cause put at first is apt to
produce a greater Effect, and the Coresidence,
Joynt-endeavours, Preaching, Miracles, and
lastly Martyrdome of the two Chief Apostles
working upon that City which commanded the
greatest part of the world were more vigorous
Causes to imprint Christs Doctrin at first and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to the next age than was found any
where else; it follows that the stream of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in its source and first putting into motion
was more particularly vigorous here than in any
other See. Again, since uninterrupted publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of professing Faith makes a greater visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith, which is a manifest advantage to
Tradition, and no Patriarchal See but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
hath continued ever from the Primitive
times in a publick Profession of Christs Faith,
being held under by <hi>Barbarians;</hi> hence the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
See (and inclusively their Pastours and most
their chief Pastour) have a particular title to
Infallibility built on Tradition above any other
See or Pastour whatsoever. Not to mention
and dilate on the particular Assistances to the
Clergy of that See, and most particular to its
Bishop, springing out of their divinely consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
office, in regard 'tis a position unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by Adversaries against whom I am
discoursing.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Tradition establisht, the Church is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of a certain and Infallible Rule to preserve a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51890:67"/>
Copy of the Scripture's Letter truly significative of
Christs sence, as far as it is coincident with the main
Body of Christian doctrin preacht at first.</hi> For,
since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis certain the Apostles taught the same

                     </gap>tis manifest the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
Letter was at first (for what of it was intended
to signify Points of Faith) significative of Faith
or Sence writ by miracles, preaching and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in the hearts of the first Faithful: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since the same sence that was preacht at
first was preserv'd all along unalterably by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
(<hi>Disc.</hi> 6. &amp; 8.) and the same sence in
mens hearts can easily guide them to correct the
alteration of the outward Letter, so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it significative of the sence first delivered;
Therefore Tradition establisht the Church is
provided of a certain and Infallible Rule to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Copy of the Scripture's Letter truly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative
of Christ's sence, as far as Scripture is
coincident with the main body of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
preacht at first.</p>
                  <p>30. <hi>Tradition establisht the Church is provided
of a certain and Infallible Rule to interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's
Letter by, so as to arrive certainly at Christ's
Sence, as far as that Letter concerns the Body of
Christian Doctrin preacht at first or points requisit
to Salvation.</hi> For, since (<hi>Disc.</hi> 6. &amp; 8.) Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
preserves the first deliver'd sence alive in
mens hearts sent down by way of living voice
and Christian practice; and these were in the

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51890:68"/>
the Sence of the Letter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis evident that

&amp; 8. &amp; <hi>Corol.</hi> 24, &amp; 25.) Tradition is self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
a certain method of conveying down
matters of Fact as they were found, it follows
that, Tradition establish't, points <hi>not held ever</hi>
must be convey'd down such as they were found,
that is as <hi>not held ever</hi> and consequently not as
held from the first or ever.</p>
                  <p>32. <hi>Tradition establish't 'tis impossible any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
against</hi> Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>s Faith should bee received by
the Church; that is no Errour contradicting Faith
can be received as of Faith.</hi> For, since to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as of Faith is (<hi>Disc.</hi> 6. &amp; 8.) to Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Christians the same as to be received as
held ever or from Christs time, and (<hi>Corol.</hi> 31.)
no point at all, though disparate or indifferent,
<hi>not-held-ever</hi> can be received as <hi>held-ever,</hi> 'tis
evident that much less can an erroneous point
contradicting what was held ever be received
as held-ever.</p>
                  <p>33. <hi>Notwithstanding Tradition, Erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and (their proper Effects) absurd Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may creep into the Church and spread there
for a while.</hi> For, since, notwithstanding the
Certainty of Tradition, the Church is still, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Saviour, a Congregation made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51890:68"/>
up of good and bad, and the Bad will do like
themselves, that is be glad to invent and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
such Principles as shall make for their own
Ends or for Vices, that is, Erroneous ones; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
since it cannot be expected but that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
even of good men in the Church should
in using their private reasons be liable to Errour
in divers particular points or Cases, and that the
remoteness of Christian Principles or Points of
Faith from the Principles of particular Actions
or Cases is apt to make the opposition between
them not easily nor clearly discoverable at first,
nay the ambiguity in wording them may make
them appear at first sight fairly reconcilable till
the Terms be distinguisht and clear'd from equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
'tis very evident that Tradition's Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
hinders not but Erroneous Opinions, and
(their proper Effects) absurd Practices may
creep into the Church and spread there for a
while.</p>
                  <p>34. <hi>Erroneous Opinions can never gain any
solid footing in the Church.</hi> For, since (<hi>Disc.</hi> 5.
§. 15. <hi>Corol.</hi> 11.) the Church is a Body of men
relying on <hi>Tradition</hi> or the Authority of attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forefathers, not on the Authority of Opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
these Opinions can never have any firmness
in her by means of Authority; and, on the other
side, being Erroneous, they can never gain any
depth of adhesion by being demonstrably true;
nor (Errour being necessarily opposit to Truth)
can they even maintain their quiet posture by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51890:69"/>
being evidently not opposit to Faith; It follows
that neither upon the score of Reason nor
Authority can they sink deep into the minds of
the Faithful (at least the intelligent party of
them) or gain any solid footing in the Church;
but are subject to be contradicted or have their
verity disputed by the searching and unsatisfy'd
wits of Opposers.</p>
                  <p>35. <hi>The Prudence requisit in Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is one Cause why Erroneous Opinions are not
immediately but after some long time perhaps to
be declared against by the Authority of the whole
Church.</hi> For, since a Church is a most vast and
sacred Common-wealth, and so of the greatest
gravity and Authority imaginable, she is not
in prudence to engage it trivially in sleight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
nor rashly when the point is unevident.
Wherefore, seeing an Erroneous Opinion, while
held but by few, is of sleight concern, and so
onely fit to be taken notice of by inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
when universally held is of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
amongst the multitude; she is in Prudence
to suspend till its Opposition to Faith be clear'd
by the Science of Divinity, and this satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to a great part of the Opinatours; lest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she should in stead of tares pluck up wheat,
or use her Authority more to destruction than
edification by a too hasty decision.</p>
                  <p>36. <hi>No Erroneous Opinion in Divinity, if
Vniversal and Practical, can be very long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Church.</hi> For since (<hi>Corol.</hi> 31.) a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51890:69"/>
meer Opinion can never gain the Authority of a
Traditionary point, 'tis manifest it can never
subsist when it is shown to clash with any of the
said Points: Wherefore, since it is liable to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion,
and men are naturally of different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Interests, and the variety and Nature
of worldly Interest is such that if any thing
makes for the Interest of some 'tis for that very
reason against the Interest of another, it will
excite them to discussion and sifting its Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
or Disconformity to Christian Principles,
which is the way to clear the Terms and make
it appear. But, especially, seeing absurd or
irrational Practices are the proper Effects of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Principles, and that our natural Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
inclines men to follow such Practices till
they be checkt by regard to something held
Sacred, that is by being shown opposit to Faith;
it follows that, till this opposition be shown, they
will infallibly grow on still more and more, till
they come to such an height of absurdity that
they need now no skill to discover them: Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
teaching us that the most palpable and
evident method to try the Truth of any Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is to put it into matter and bring it into
Practice. Those irrational Practices therefore
must needs after some time discover themselves
opposit to Christian behaviour, and consequently
confess the Principle which begot them opposit
to Christian Faith; which done, it presently
loses its credit, and is quasht by the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51890:70"/>
more powerful force and all over-bearing
Authority of Tradition.</p>
                  <p>37. <hi>Erroneous Opinions and the irrational
Practices issuing from them (though suppos'd Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and of long continuance) can never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
substantially the Iudgments or Wills of the
Faithful.</hi> For, since (<hi>Corol.</hi> 31.) nothing not
held ever or not coming from Christ can possibly
be accepted as held ever or coming from Christ,
'tis evident no Erroneous Opinion can come to
gain the sacredness and repute of a Traditionary
point, nor their proper practices the Esteem of
Christian Practice; Wherefore, Traditionary
Points being the Principles which absolutely
possess the Judgmenrs and govern the lives of the
Faithful as Christians, it follows that no Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can ever be held by them but in a conciev'd
subordination to Traditionary points or points
of Faith, nor practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t by them but with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivd
subordination and conformity to those
Practices which spring from undoubtedly-known
Christian Tenets or Traditionary points. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then what is not held and practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t but as
conceivd subordinate to other Tenets and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
must needs be less held than those others,
nay not held at all otherwise than conditionally
or upon supposal of such a subordination, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tis
clearly consequent that Traditions Certainty is
so powerful an Antidote that bad Opinions and
Practices can never corrupt substantially and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51890:70"/>
absolutely the Judgments or wills of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>38. <hi>No Erroneous Opinion or its proper Practice is
imputable to the Church properly and formally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
For, since the Church, formally as such, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
on Christian Tradition, no such Opinion
nor consequently Practice is imputable to the
Church properly and formally taken, but onely
to some men in the Church (materially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd)
as left to the contingent force of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Discourses: that is, indeed, to the Schools
not the Church.</p>
                  <p>39. <hi>'Tis exceedingly weak and senceless to
think to impugn the Church by objecting to her such
Opinions and Practices.</hi> For, since they concern
her not, nor are imputable to her as <hi>Church,</hi> or
to her Members as <hi>Faithful,</hi> the wise Objection
can onely signify thus much, that the Church
has men in her who are fallible in their private
Discourses or School-disputes; that is, she has
men in her who are <hi>men.</hi> A heavy imputation!</p>
                  <p>40. <hi>The Knowledge of Tradition's Certainty is the
first Knowledge or Principle in Controversial Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that is, without which nothing is known or
knowable in that Science.</hi> For, since Controversy or
the Science which establishes the Certainty of
Faith depends on these two Propositions, <hi>Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God said is true,</hi> and <hi>God said this,</hi> the former
of which is out of Controversy as we now handle
it with our modern Dissenters, and onely the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51890:71"/>
later is the subject of our debate: Seeing also
(as hath been largely and manifoldly evident)
nothing can ascertain us of this but Tradition, nor
It unless its Certainty be known, it follows that
the Knowledge of Tradition's Certainty is the
first Knowledge or Principle in Controversial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
                  <p>41. <hi>Christ's promise to his Church (however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to the Faithful) can bear no part in the
notion of the Rule of Faith, nor be the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of a Controversial Divine.</hi> For, since Christ's
promise to his Church is held as a point of Faith,
that is, receiv'd upon the Rule of Faith, that is,
subsequent to that Rule, 'tis manifest that it can
be no part of that Rule nor first Principle in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.
Again, the Rule of Faith (<hi>Disc.</hi> 1. §. 4,
and 9.) must be so evident as to its Existence that
no other Knowledge must intervene between the
natural power of Understanding and It, and this
in the meanest vulgar; but, that Christ promist
his Church Infallibility is not thus self-evident
but needs other Knowledges to evidence it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we will make all come by Inspiration. Besides,
if God's Providence laid in second Causes for
Tradition's Indeficiency be not Certain in its self,
(abstracting from Christ's promise to his Faithful)
Tradition can never convey certainly that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to us; It must then be assur'd to us by
Scripture's Letter ascertain'd onely by imagin'd
diligence from Copy to Copy, not by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51890:71"/>
that is, that Letter could not be certain
its self, and so fit to ascertain others, till Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
Certainty be establish't antecedently: And,
were it suppos'd a true Letter, this Letter (Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
being as yet suppos'd unknown to be able
to convey down certainly Christs sence) must be
interpreted onely by private skills; and so, all
the Churches Veracity, that is, all Mankinds Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
must be built on that private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Private,</hi> I say; for in that supposition, till
the Scripture's Letter for that point be Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certainly truly, the Churches veracity or
power to interpret it truly is not yet known:
which, besides the common Rule that no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is of private Interpretation, is particularly
and highly faulty in this case, that it would
make our Fundamental of Fundamentals, the
Certainty of our Rule of Faith, rely on such a
private Interpretation. Moreover, to say Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church is Certain because Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
it, puts it to be believ'd not seen; and is the
same in Controversy as it is in Nature to say in
common, such an Effect is wrought <hi>because 'tis
God's will;</hi> which gives no account of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Effect, but onely sayes something in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
Wherefore, since the Certainty of the
Rule of Faith (it being antecedent to Faith)
must be seen not believ'd, a Controversial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ought to make it <hi>seen;</hi> that is, ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
its Certainty and Indeficiency by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51890:72"/>
mediums or dependence on proper
Causes. It signisies therefore no more in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Controversy to say <hi>Christ promist,</hi> than
in Natural Science to answer to every Question, in
stead of showing a proper Cause, that <hi>God wills
it;</hi> which is a good saying for a Christian, as is also
the other; but neither of them a competent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
either for Philosopher or Controvertist.</p>

                  <head type="sub">To the substance of the foregoing Discourses.</head>
                  <p>1. THus far Reason: Let's see how 'tis seconded
by Authority: And first by the Scriptures.
2. For the <hi>Self-evidence</hi> of the Way to Faith,
or (which is all one) The Rule of Faith, see the
Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> c. 35. v. 8. <hi>This shall be to you a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
way, so that Fools cannot err in it.</hi> That is,
<hi>evident to the rudest Vulgar,</hi> or <hi>self-evident;</hi> else
Fools might possibly err in it, in case it needed
any Skill of Discourse and were not obvious to
Common Sense.</p>
                  <p>3. Now, what this Self-evident Rule is, is most
expressively declar'd by the same Prophet c. 59.
v. 21. speaking of God's favour intended to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51890:72"/>
Gentiles; that is, of the Law of Grace. <hi>This is
my Covenant with them, saith the Lord, my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which is in thee, and my words which I have
put in thy Mouth, shall not depart from thy mouth,
and from the mouth of thy Seed, and from the
mouth of thy Seed's Seed from henceforth for ever.</hi>
Here we see God's promise to perpetuate Christ's
Doctrin; and on what manner; that is, by
Oral Tradition, or Delivering it from Father
to Son by <hi>word of Mouth</hi> or Teaching; not
by scanning a Book put in their hands. We see
it promist also that this Tradition shall be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible
or <hi>Vninterrupted;</hi> and, Lastly, that his
Spirit (or Sanctity) is both in the Church, and
will continue ever with her; which being so, she
must needs be supernaturally assisted by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost (that is, incomparably above the power
of Nature) to this Effect of perpetuating Christ's
doctrin by Tradition.</p>
                  <p>4. As pithy and home is that of the Prophet
<hi>Ieremiah,</hi> c. 31. <hi>I will give my Law in their
Bowels, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> their Hearts will I write it;</hi> and
still more that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> contradistinguishing
the Law of Grace from <hi>Moses</hi> his Law by this,
that the later was writ <hi>in Tables of Stone,</hi> the
former <hi>in the fleshy Tables of mens Hearts.</hi> Both
as express as can be imagined to send us for our
Faith to living Sence in <hi>the hearts</hi> of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
not to meer <hi>dead Letters</hi> in a <hi>Book;</hi> that is,
recommending to us Tradition, which is the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51890:73"/>
perfectest and naturalest way imaginable to write
them there, as hath been shown. Note the
word <hi>Hearts,</hi> which in the Metaphorical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is the Principle of Action; not of mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Speculative Knowledge, as is the word <hi>Brain:</hi>
Which intimates the <hi>Practical</hi> nature of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, that it imprints Christs Law, and
conveys it down by Christian Carriage and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
not by <hi>Speculative</hi> scanning the significative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Characters in a Book. Note also, the
word <hi>Fleshy;</hi> which signifies, that the manner
of writing Christ's Law is through the affecting
the Soul by her Inferiour part (considering her
as she is a virtue of understanding;) that is, by
Sensations which make strong and plain Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Mankind according to their material part,
and so force into them Natural Knowledge:
Whence, things thus imprinted are apt to settle
themselves solidly and even sink deeply into the
most material, gross and vulgar understandings.
Quite contrary to which in all regards is the way
of beginning with reading, and labouring to
understand certainly, Letters in a Book; which,
is a kind of Speculation, and so belongs to the
Superiour part of the Soul as she is understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
being Artificial, both in the very <hi>Nature</hi>
of such Characters, the skill in <hi>Reading,</hi> and
highest skills requisit to <hi>Sence</hi> them with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p>5. After Scripture-verdict succeed next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51890:73"/>
those of Councils. I will onely mention
three in several Ages, leaving multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The first Synod of <hi>Lateran. We all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
unanimously and consequently, with one heart
and mouth, the Tenets and sayings of the Holy
Fathers; adding nothing, subtracting nothing
of those things which are DELIVER<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>D VS</hi> (quae
<hi>TRADITA</hi> sunt nobis) <hi>by them: and we believe
so as the Fathers have believed, we preach so as
they have TAVGHT.</hi> The Council of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
in its Encyclical sent to all Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
<hi>We, have received this Doctrin, we have
been taught so, we hold this Catholick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Faith and Confession.</hi> And the seventh
General Council in its second Act. <hi>We imbu'd
with the precepts of the Fathers, have so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and do confess;</hi> In the Third, <hi>we receive
and venerate the Apostolical Traditions of
the Church.</hi> And in the seventh Act, giving
their final determination, they, declare the
Grounds on which they proceed in these words.
<hi>We, walking in the King's-high-way</hi> (Regiam
viam incedentes) <hi>and relying on the Doctrin of
our holy and divine Fathers, and observing the
TRADITION of the Catholick Church, define,</hi>
&amp;c. where we see General Councils (that is,
the greatest Authority in the Catholick Church)
relying on the <hi>Teaching</hi> of Fathers or foregoing
Church, and on the Churches <hi>Tradition</hi> as on
their <hi>Rule</hi> and the <hi>High-way to Faith;</hi> whence
they repute Catholick Tradition, and Faith,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51890:74"/>
the same thing. We see also the Amplitude of
this Rule, recommending to us <hi>all</hi> Faith, so that
nothing ought be added to it. And how empty
a pretence the Fathers in this Council judg'd it
to disallow this Rule under pretext of being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
to Scripture is seen by these words in their
First Session. <hi>They who contemn the Teachings of
the Holy Fathers and TRADITION of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and bring for their excuse and
inculcate the words of</hi> Arius, Nestorius, Eutyches,
<hi>and</hi> Dioscorus, <hi>saying, Vnless we were sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instructed out of the Old and New Testament,
we would follow the Doctrins of the Fathers, of the
six holy Synods, and the Traditions of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, Let him be accursed.</hi> So that
they held private Instruction from Scripture
<hi>insufficient</hi> to build Faith on, or (which is all
one) to be <hi>a Rule of Faith;</hi> Also, that it was
ever the common pretence of the most execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hereticks of old to decline Tradition, and
pretend to <hi>sufficient Light</hi> from Scripture's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and, lastly, that since the Sence of Scripture
in points of Faith is not attainable sufficiently, or
with Certainty, by the bare Letter of Scripture,
and with Certainty by Tradition, and that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
brings us down determinate Sence; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is to sence Scripture's Letter; and so that
Letter no Rule but by virtue of Tradition; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Faith being Sence, and Points of Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Sences, Faith's Rule must bring us to
such determinate Sences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51890:74"/>
6. After antient Councils, let us give a glance
at Fathers, and see what they say to this Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celestin,</hi> Saint and Pope to the Fathers of the
<hi>Ephesin</hi> Council; <hi>Agendum igitur nunc</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now
therefore we must act with a common endeavour
to preserve things believed, and retain'd to this
very time by SVCCESSION FROM THE
APOSTLES.</hi> Ireneus <hi>cap. 4. Quid autem</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>But what if the Apostles had not left us the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
ought we not to follow the Order of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they had deliver'd to those to whom they
committed the Churches. To which Ordination
assent many Natiens of those Barbarians who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ, having Salvation writ by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in their hearts without characters and Ink,
and diligently keeping the Ancient TRADITION.</hi>
In the former we have it told a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
what their proper task is; namely to keep or
hold fast what was believ'd and kept; and how?
<hi>by Succession from the Apostles,</hi> or from hand to
hand. In the second, that the Apostles when
they gave Bishops their Charge, ordained or
made it their Duty to <hi>observe Tradition;</hi> that
this Way of Tradition was sufficient to receive
Faith upon; that is, sufficient to be a Rule of
Faith <hi>without Scripture;</hi> and that <hi>de facto</hi> it did
perform that office to <hi>many Nations</hi> without
Scripture. Lastly, he calls this delivery from
Father to Son <hi>the writing it in their hearts by
the Spirit;</hi> that is, the work of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
or <hi>Supernatural,</hi> however it connaturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51890:75"/>
and seems to counterpose this to writing
by <hi>characters or Ink;</hi> as if this were not (so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
at least) the Holy Ghosts work; In
regard (as plain reason tells us) the Sence of
those Letters, or Faith, must either be had by
those Inward Characters writ in the Readers
hearts by God's Spirit; and so It, not the Ink
writes it there; or else by human or Natural
Skills, which are not attributable to our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>7. The same Father (<hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 3.) For
though there be diverse Tongues in the world,
<hi>yet the virtue of Tradition is one and the same.
The preaching of the Church is true and firm, in
which one and the same way of Salvation is shown
over the whole world.</hi> Here we have but one Rule
of Faith, or way to Faith, &amp; this the <hi>preaching</hi> or
living voice of the Church; which is not onely
said to be <hi>true</hi> but also <hi>firm;</hi> that is the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its Truth is built on <hi>solid Grounds,</hi> or
founded in the nature of things order'd by God's
special Providence to that end. To show which
hath been the aim of my present endeavours.</p>
                  <p>8. Origen <hi>is more express.</hi> 1. Periarchôn, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur
verò <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let the Churches preaching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
from the Apostles by order of Succession,
and remaining in the Church to this present be
preserv'd. That onely Truth is to be believ'd,
which differs in nothing from the Churches
Tradition. <hi>And 29. in</hi> Matth. We ought
not to believe otherwise than as the Churches
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51890:75"/>
of God have deliver'd us by Succession. <hi>Where
he directly makes Tradition the Rule to judge
what's sound, what not; that is,</hi> the Rule of
Faith.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Tertullian</hi> lib. <hi>de carne Christi. If thou
beest but a Christian, believe what is</hi> (traditum)
<hi>deliver'd.</hi> And, speaking to an Heretick; <hi>By
renouncing what thou hast believ'd thou provest
that, before thou didst renounce it, what thou
believedst was otherwise: It was then deliver'd
otherwise: Moreover, what was Deliver'd, that
was True, as deliver'd by those to whom it belong'd
to deliver; Wherefore, renouncing what was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd,
thou hast renounc't what's True.</hi> So that
in this Father's Judgment a <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of Tradition</hi> are the same, and that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
what comes by <hi>Tradition</hi> is to renounce
<hi>Truth;</hi> which amounts to this, that Tradition
is the Test of Christianity, and <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
Also he intimates that it belongs to some to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,</hi>
to some not; and, if to any, to whom but
those who lay claim and adhere to Tradition or
<hi>Delivery,</hi> and are in possession of it? not to those
who are known to have broken from Tradition
and impugn its Certainty.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Athanasius</hi> (in lib. <hi>de Synodis.</hi>) <hi>They
have declar'd themselves to be Vnbelievers by
Seeking what they have not; All therefore that
are Seekers of Faith are Vnbelievers. They one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to whom Faith comes down from their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
that is, from Christ by Fathers, do not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51890:76"/>
seek, and therefore they onely have Faith. If
thou comest to Faith by Seeking, thou wast before
an Vnbeliever.</hi> And, in his Discourse against
<hi>Paulus Samosatenus de Incarnatione. He that
searches after those things which are beyond his
strength stands upon a precipice; but he that sticks
to Tradition, stands out of danger. Wherefore we
persuade you, which also we persuade our selves,
that you retain the Faith Deliver'd</hi> (Traditam
Fidem) <hi>and avoid prophane words of Novelty.</hi>
I wish the Protestants would seriously weigh the
import of these Sayings of this Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what it was which sustain'd him who was a
Pillar of Faith in his dayes; and then, applying
it, see whether it fits to Catholicks or Them.
They would plainly discern that which they
prize themselves most for, that is for taking their
Faith out of Judgment, by finding and seeking
it in the Scriptures, is alone enough to show
them not to be truly Faithful; That God has
promised a perfectly <hi>secure</hi> way to give them
true Faith, that is, by <hi>believing Ancestours.</hi>
That they who do not so <hi>stand upon a precipice,
seeking what's beyond their power;</hi> that is, to
hammer a certain Faith out of Scripture's Letter
by their private Wit. Which reflected on, a
little reason, enlightned by so plain and manifold
Experiences, will easily tell them that 'tis the
shallowness of their Grounds, unable to satisfy
Rational Nature, which makes so many of theirs
take upon them to seek for Faith, and so leave
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51890:76"/>
them; and the solid secureness, connaturalness,
and satisfactoriness of ours which makes few or
none leave us; and those who do, 'tis easie to
discover the motives of their revolting.</p>
                  <p>11. Yet one more from this Illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as one whom by reason of his Famous
Contrasts with the impious <hi>Arians,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to be more express in inculcating and stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the true Rule of Faith. He writing to
<hi>Epictetus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth. 'Tis to be answer'd</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to those things, which alone of it self
suffices, that those are uot of the Orthodox
Church, and that our Ancestours never held so.</hi>
So that the living Voice of the Church, <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or belief of Ancestours, is held by him a
sole-sufficient Rule of Faith, and the onely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to be given why we reject points from
Faith, or admit them into It; that is, an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
Reason for such a carriage; for otherwise
another Answer would be requisit.</p>
                  <p>12. We will be shorter in the rest. <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus Stromatôn</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>As if one of a
man becomes a beast, like those infected by Circes
poyson, so he hath forfeited his being a man-of-God
and Faithful to our Lord, who spurns against
the Churches Tradition, and leaps into Opinions
of human Elections. Basil</hi> against <hi>Eunomius:
Wouldst thou have us all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perswaded by thee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your Conceits before the Tradition of Faith,
which perpetually hath conquer'd under so many
holy men.</hi> And, speaking against two other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51890:77"/>
                     <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Arius; Let TRADITION
bridle thee: Our Lord taught thus, the Apostles
preach't it, the Fathers conserv'd it, our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
confirm'd it; be content to say as thou art
taught.</hi> We have it clear then that the Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of Tradition is none of the Faithful, that is
cut off from the Root of Faith (see <hi>Corol.</hi> 4.)
that all is men's <hi>Conceits</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Opinions</hi>
(which the word <hi>Heresie</hi> imports) that is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
to <hi>Tradition.</hi> We have, lastly, the whole
course of our Faith's descent from Christ to us;
yet not a word of descending by Scripture or
Letters in Books, but by the way of Preaching
and Teaching, that is, <hi>Oral delivery</hi> and Sence
writ in men's hearts.</p>
                  <p>13. I omit many other Fathers, but I must
not S. <hi>Austin. Ea potius credam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will
rather believe</hi> (saith he, <hi>contra Epistolam Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenti)
those things which are celebrated now
by the consent of learned and unlearned; and
are confirmed throughout all Nations by most
grave Authority.</hi> And, again; <hi>'Tis manifest
that the Authority of the Catholick Church is of
force to cause Faith and Assurance. Which</hi> (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)
<hi>from the best establisht Seats of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
even to this very day, is strengthened by the
Series of Bishops succeeding them, and by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of so many Nations.</hi> In both places he
he makes the consent of <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Vnlearned,</hi>
Bishops and conspiring people, continu'd down
to these dayes (that is, the living voice of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51890:77"/>
Church Essential, or <hi>Tradition</hi>) the most grave
Authority, apt to <hi>ascertain</hi> us and cause <hi>Faith;</hi>
that is, he makes Tradition the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi>
and builds its strength (as we also do) on the
multitude and consent of the Asserters or Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers
of its descent. Also in his 58. Epistle, <hi>The
Faithful</hi> (saith he) <hi>do possess perseveringly a
RVLE OF FAITH common to little and great
in the Church.</hi> Where every word is Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
That the Churches voice is the Rule of
Faith: That this Rule is common to <hi>Learued</hi>
and <hi>Vnlearned;</hi> that is, able to satisfie the acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Discoursers and yet understandable by the
rudest vulgar: Lastly, that they hold it, and
that perseveringly or unshakenly; which shews
it self-evident; else both, the unlearned at least,
might come to doubt of it. (See <hi>Disc.</hi> 5. §.
8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>14. Thus much for the credit of Tradition;
its being the Rule of Faith, Certain, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted.
But how shall we know who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
this Tradition, or what points have been
handed down by it from the beginning? Must
we not run to Private Expositions of Scripture
to be assur'd of this, or at least to Libraries of
Books writ in all former Ages to see if perhaps
their Authours might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>have dream'd of our now
difficulties, and then prophesi'd us a satisfaction
so express and ample, that no cavil can avoid it?
No, we have manifest Certainty of it other
wayes, if we may trust the Fathers. We will
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51890:78"/>
onely alledge two, both very Antient, and great
Masters of Controversy against the Hereticks of
their times. S. <hi>Ireneus lib. 1. cap. 3. All
those who will hear Truth may at present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
discern</hi> (adest perspicere) <hi>in the Church
the Tradition of the Apostles, manifest in the
whole World.</hi> That is, the Doctrin of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church (proceeding upon or adhering to
Tradition) is a <hi>manifest</hi> Argument, that what
it teaches <hi>now</hi> was <hi>delivered</hi> by the Apostles.
And <hi>Tertullian contra Marcionem. That is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
True which is First, that First which is from
the beginning, that from the beginning which is
from the Apostles. In like manner that will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
appear to have been delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
which shall be establisht as Sacred in the
Churches of the Apostles.</hi> Where first he ascends,
and confounds Novelty or Heresie, by shewing
that the <hi>Priority</hi> of what they left, argues it to
have been <hi>ever</hi> or from the Apostles, and so
<hi>True;</hi> and then proves, and <hi>manifestly</hi> too,
that that was delivered from the Apostles which
is found <hi>establisht</hi> (that is held to be receiv'd, as
all his former Doctrine runs) as sacred in the
Churches at present, which were founded by
the Apostles. But he is yet more express in his
first Book against the same Heretick, <hi>nothing is
to be acknowledg'd a Tradition of the Apostles, but
what is at this present day profest</hi> (for such) <hi>in
their Churches.</hi> So that he sends us not to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of Histories and other Writers (which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51890:78"/>
if Tradition can'fail, are of no Authority) to
find what was the Antient or Primitive Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or what the Apostles taught or <hi>delivered,</hi>
but onely to the living Voice of the present
Churches; which had been but a weak proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
in case their holding now a thing <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi>
were not argumentative that it was <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
ever;</hi> which is the substance of my proof
<hi>a posteriori,</hi> for the Indefectiveness of Tradition.
And, least it should be imagin'd that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
loses its force by tract of time, or the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance
of the Church, <hi>Peter Chrysolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
in his 85. Sermon, secures us from that
danger. <hi>A Christian mind knows not how to
bring into dispute those things which are streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
by Tradition of the Fathers, and even</hi>
(ipsis temporibus) <hi>by Time it self.</hi> To omit
here that he makes it the very temper of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
mind not to question Tradition, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
Continuance of Time, to be so far from
weakening the Certainty of Traditionary points,
that it contributes to strengthen them more.
And the reason is, because the Churches Doctrin
spreads by Time, and so the sway of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
descent is ampler; besides that every new
Degree of Continuance establishes its Title to
Possession, and makes it hainouser to revolt from
it. And, Effects show our discourse true; for,
there were more variety of Heresies, that is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncers
of Tradition, in the first 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Apostles, than we read of in any 400
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51890:79"/>
years since; Nor (that we may use a familiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in Human Tradition) does (I conceive)
any man living more doubt now of <hi>Mahomets</hi>
or <hi>Iulius Caesar's</hi> existence, than within an 100
years after they liv'd.</p>
                  <p>15. A few Notes, well weigh'd, will strengthen
the force of these Allegations; which even at
first sight seem to look very favourably on our
Cause. I mind my Reader then,</p>
                  <p>First, That almost every Citation alledg'd is
of Councils or Fathers speaking directly against
Hereticks; that is, in such Circumstances as
put them to declare what fixt them Catholicks,
and what made the other Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That though some Fathers and
Councils speak highly of Scripture, as that it
contains all Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis first to be markt
whether they speak of Scripture <hi>Senc't,</hi> or as yet
<hi>to be Senc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t;</hi> and, if the later, by whom; or
whether any Fathers say that Scripture wrought
upon by private Interpretation and Human Wit
is apt to <hi>ascertain</hi> Faith (or be the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi>)
which is the true point between the Renouncers
of Tradition and us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They shall observe it frequent in
Fathers to force Hereticks to accept the Sence of
Scripture from those who gave them the Letter
of Scripture; and very frequent to Sence that
Letter (even when dark) by Tradition; but
never to bend Tradition to the outward show
the Scripture's Letter seems to bear as interpreted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51890:79"/>
by human Skills; or to say Universal Tradition
is insufficient or uncertain, unless the Scripture's
Letter thus interpreted came to clear or assist it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, 'tis impossible they should hold Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
thus interpretable the Rule of Faith; it
being notorious that most Hereticks against
whom they writ, held it theirs; And so had
they held Scripture thus interpreted the Rule of
Faith, they could not have held them Hereticks,
since they adher'd stiffly to that Rule or Root of
Faith, however they might err in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Tenets. Not to repeat how all the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Rule of Faith are urterly incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to Scripture's Letter.</p>
                  <p>This done, all the Testimonies for Scripture
against Tradition lose their edge. That is (if my
discourse also hold the test) it will appear by
way of <hi>Fact,</hi> as it did before by Argument that
there is neither Reason nor Authority against
Tradition. So that I have no more to do but to
show that our Church at present grounds her faith
on Tradition as formerly; which done it follows
all the Substance of my foregoing Discourses is
but an Explication of our Churches Sence.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>To know our Churches Sence in this
point, we will not fetch our Testimony from
private Authours (as is the Protestants mode
when they would affix any thing upon her)

of the like strain are found in this Session.
And, to close up all, in their Acclamation they

                  </p>
                  <p>17. First, That the Council in every Session,

                  </p>

of our Faith's descent <hi>uninterruptedly</hi> is
deeply and unanimously rooted in the heart of
the whole Catholick Church. Which strengthens

See Sess. 6. <hi>Decreto de Iustificatione,</hi> Sess.
13. <hi>de SS. Euchar. Sacramento,</hi> and many other
places. The very point I went about to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in my 9. Discourse.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. 'Tis observable that though it mentions
the Holy Scriptures also with Tradition, yet this
is both very rarely, and when it does so It onely
expresses that Faith is <hi>contain'd</hi> in them; but
when it brings Places of Scripture to ground De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
upon, It perpetually professes to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them by Tradition; Which is most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
both by its decreeing this in common.

also by several Instances; Sess. 5. §. 4. Sess. 14.

in that most remarkable pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Unction, the Council subjoins, <hi>In which words,
as the Church hath learn'd by Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
received down by hands, be teaches,</hi> &amp;c.
Where <hi>Tradition</hi> is most evidently made the
Rule which instructs and guides the Church in
interpreting Scripture: And 'tis observable that
the Council no where grounds any definition on
Scripture, but at the same time she grounds her
Interpretation of Scripture on Tradition; which
devolves into this that the Council makes Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
her onely Rule to know <hi>Certainly</hi> Christ's
Sence, or Points of Faith; that is, (in proper
speaking) <hi>the onely Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. But why then is the Holy Scripture made
use of at all by the Council, and that so solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nay, and (which is to be noted) constantly
put before Tradition? To satisfy fully this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
'tis not the proper season at present; yet,
being a good point and worth clearing, I will
not totally neglect it. We may observe then
that when we read any Book writ by an
Authour we much esteem, but yet such a Book
as requires studying, (<hi>Aristotle's</hi> for Example,
or some other such whom we hold Scientifical,)
we sometimes hope well (as it were) when we
apply our own Industry to find out his meaning,
and have a kind of respect for what we conceive
to be his Sence; yet his Authority takes not full
hold of our Understanding, by reason the way
we take is not evidently convictive that this is
his Certain Sence; But if the Point he writes on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51890:82"/>
be first clear'd to us through a Scientifical
discourse by word of mouth, made by some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
vers'd in his Doctrin and perfectly
acquainted with his meaning, we have as it
were new Eyes given us to look deeply and
thoroughly into his Sence; and, by this Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of arriving at it, his Authority (in case we
highly esteem'd it) has now its full force upon
us to strengthen our Assent, according to the
degree of power it had upon our Understanding.
Now, what a well-skill'd and insighted Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
or scientifical Explicater of the point is to
such an Author, the same is <hi>Tradition</hi> to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
For, This bringing down Certainly
Christ's Sence in every Point of Faith, It easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and securely guides us to the true meaning of
Scripture in those passages which concern such
a point; whereas, the wordish way of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
and Criticism being evident by Principles
to be ambiguous, and by Experience to lead
men into different Sences, it can never satisfy
us thoroughly that the Sence we arrive at by this
method is infallibly the true one or Christs, and
so never engages certainly the Authority of
GOD'S WORD. And, hence it is that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
thus interpreted is of sleight force, and at
best good onely for Ecclesiastical Rhetorick or
Sermons; where the concern is not much if
the Preacher misses in this particular passage so
the Substance of the Point he preaches on, or
his Text, be truly Christ's doctrin; nor is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51890:83"/>
thus interpreted even a competent proof
in the Science of <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> as being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and so unapt to beget Science; whence,
Intelligent Divines quoting and building on
Scripture are to be suppos'd to judge the Sence
they build on to be the Churches, and so they
are presum'd to go to work as Faithful, or parts
of <hi>Ecclesia docens;</hi> or else they lay true Science
first, which is ever agreeable to Faith; and so,
when any Text concerns a demonstrated point,
they know by Science what the true Sence of
that Point must be. Much less is Scripture
wordishly interpreted apt to build Faith on;
the unwaveringness of which kind of Assent must
be grounded and secure in the Principles which
beget, it and not meerly actually such as it were
by accident; whereas Interpretations thus made
(Faith's Principles in this case) are liable to
possible if not probable mistake. This will be
clearer by a parallel made by a learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
worth inserting, because it strengthens
our Discourse by a new Consideration. Let
a Critick and a skill'd <hi>Carpenter</hi> read <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
his Book of Architecture, the Critick has
but a dim, dry and uncertain conceit of what
he reads as to the truth of the thing; but
the <hi>Carpenter</hi> or Architect, by reason of some
Principles and Practice he has already of
those matters, understands him more thoroug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hly,
and makes lively and firm conceits of the
truth and excellency of what he writes; Such
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51890:83"/>
is the Practical way of knowing Christs Sence,
or Tradition, to the interpreting Scripture, us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
by the Catholick Church; in comparison of
the Critical Method affected by others. In a
word, Tradition gives us <hi>Christs Sence,</hi> that
is, the <hi>Life</hi> of the Letter ascertaind to our
hands, which therefore must needs move the
Letter, its Body, naturally; The other way
takes the dead Letter, and endeavours to move
it Artificially to counterfeit that Life which
it truly wants.</p>
                  <p>19. To apply this Discourse to our matter in
hand. Tradition securing to us the Scripture's
Letter truly significative of Christ's Sence, and
also the true Sence of that Letter in Points of
Faith <hi>deliver'd,</hi> (See <hi>Coroll.</hi> 29. &amp; 30) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that Scripture alledged by the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on Tradition for its Rule, engages certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully the very Authority of the Divinely
inspir'd Writer himself; and gives that Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
the whole Effect upon our understanding,
which that Sacred. Writers Authority deserves
to have given it. No wonder then the Council,
proceeding upon Traditionary Interpretation
as it constantly declares it self to do, honours
Scripture-Testimony so as to put it before Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or the delivery of Christs Doctrin from
hand to hand: Scripture, thus alledg'd and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd,
having the same force as if the Apostle or
Evangelist himself should sit in the Council, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51890:84"/>
by way of living voice declar'd his own Sence in
the matter; to whom, thus present, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
the Council would have given is obvious
to be imagin'd. Hence, also, the Protestant
may see what high esteem our Church gives to
<hi>Gods Word,</hi> truly so calld; that is, having
Gods Sence certainly-known to be such, in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that 'tis onely the outward Letter as us'd to
hammer a Faith out of by wordish skills, that
is, indeed, their Method of interpreting it (which,
by reason of its Uncertainty falls short of enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Sacred Authority of <hi>Gods Word</hi>) we
fleight and scorn: And most justly, since 'tis
the having no better way to work on Scripture,
which has brought Scripture it self, thus us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
to scorn and contempt; as appears in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of our <hi>Bedlam</hi> of new Sects in <hi>England.</hi>
I expect here some mighty man of talk, but very
weak Speculator, should object that this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way to bring all into our Churches hands.
But till he can prove that both Letter &amp; Sence of
Scripture are knowable, with such a Certainty as
to build on them that most firm Assent call'd
Faith, by any other way than this of Tradition,
I can neither hinder my Inferences nor will he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to confute my discourse.</p>
                  <p>20. Thus much to show evidently that the
Substance of the Doctrin we have given in our
former Discourses, is the very Sence of our
Church at present; and that her present Sence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51890:84"/>
in this matter is agreeable to the Judgment of
Antient Fathers and Councils. I have no more
to do now but to show that at the very time of
the Breach here in <hi>England,</hi> the Catholick was
found adhering fast to this Rule of <hi>Tradition,</hi>
renounc't by the Protestant. This is evident
by the Protestants own confession; For, as
oft as you hear them alledge that <hi>England</hi>
was formerly overgrown with Popery, that
the new Light of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

it self, that they reform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d in Faith, that
the former Church errd, and such like expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which naturally must burst out from them,
so oft you hear them acknowledge themselves
Deserters of Tradition and Innovators. Which
Expressions of theirs (by the way) easily mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

                     </gap>tis
that hath renounct Tradition; whence, it being
also easily evidenceable to the rudest capacity
that Tradition is a most certain way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down Faith (<hi>Disc.</hi> 5. §. 8.) the most vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Soul is capable of knowing which Profession
it is to follow. For the two former points being
known, they are Certain by motives within
their own Ken, that Protestants have renounct
the Certain way to bring down Faith; but that
we renounct Tradition of old is unacknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us, disputable, and onely knowable by
skills they are not Masters of. Common Sense
then teaching them they must guide themselves
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51890:85"/>
by reasons they are capable of, and not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of which they know nothing, and that God
requires no more at their hands than they can
do, Gods goodness has provided for those
weak people, out of the very Confessions of

APPENDIXES.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have finisht my Discourse: how dexterously
must be determin'd by the Iudgment of my
Readers, and Confutation from m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
But I account those onely my proper Iudges
&amp; competent Adversaries who lay their Principles
ere they discourse, and weigh the efficaciousness of
their Testimonies in the Scales of Reason ere they
alledge them. If I find a man laying no Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his own, but supposing them, and making
account all men must admit them out of respect to
him or his party, and yet bend all his endeavours
to cavil at Principles laid by others to ascertain
and establish the Groundwork of Christianity; If
I find one ignorant of or resolv'd against the onely-Certain
method and Rule of Discourse, which is,
that No Position deserves Assent unless the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of its Terms be <hi>Evident,</hi> which must either
be when they are Evidently connected of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(of which nature ought to be all First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
or made evidently-connected by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of some other, which we call Evident-by-consequence
or Deduction: Lastly, if I find a man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51890:88"/>
wedded to Parrat-talk of Ayr and Sounds that
he thinks it a rare thing to load margents with
Citations, without first distinguishing them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what strength each ought to have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to rational Principles; I decline such an
empty Soul for my Iudge, and sleight him as
mine Adversary. And lest any should impute this
carriage to me for fastidiousness I offer my Reason
for it. For, to cavil at Principles and yet go about
to lay none himself, is the method of a Sceptick;
and from him indeed I must suffer it, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him to hold his tongue: But, that one
who pretends himself a <hi>Christian,</hi> that is an
<hi>Holder of Christ's Law,</hi> that is (if he goes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently)
a Relier upon some First or Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Principle for <hi>holding</hi> that Christ said thus
or thus, should be permitted to impugn Principles
brought to ascertain fundamentally that point,
and yet himself lay none to do that Effect (as is
the Custome of the Impugners of Tradition)
is to let him behave himself like a Renouncer
of Christianity, and to fight against any assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redness
of Christianity; that is, to contradict
himself and all his own positions as he is Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
which permission is unreasonable according
to Maxims of Common Sence, and illegal by
the Rules of true Logick. <hi>Again,</hi> if the clear
light of Vnderstanding gives it manifest, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be seen intellectually but what is either
Evident by its own Light or by Deduction in the
manner declared, tis as Evident that to frame
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51890:88"/>
Discourses in another method than this, or at
least loose Discourses that have no Connexion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volu'd
in them, enabling them to bear the Test of
this Method, can be onely to talk Vncertainties,
that is, of we know not what: Which is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a <hi>Man,</hi> much more a Scholler. And, lastly,
Since it is evident by Reason that every sleight
Authority is not comparable to that of God's
Church, 'tis Evident likewise that Reason is to
weigh what is due to Authorities; and that, <hi>No
Authority deserves any Assent further than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
gives it to deserve.</hi> Now, this being so, to
alledge Authorities undistinguishingly, whereas
there is such diversity of degrees in them that
perhaps there are no two to be found perfectly
alike in merit, is such a wild proceeding hand
over head, such a careless saying any thing to no
imaginable purpose but purely to talk, that no
sober Discourser can think it fit to spend time in
combating such an aiery Adversary.</p>
                  <p>2. I make it my request to my intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(for I write to none but such) that he would
reflect back on the Method I have taken in my
short Discouse; and he will see that (however
my Performance speeds) I pursue the <hi>Way</hi> of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and aim at least at perfect Science of the
point in hand. He will see I take my rise at the
meaning of the words <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> this known,
I establish my first Principles in this present mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be these, <hi>a Rule is a Rule, Faith is Faith;</hi>
hence I proceed to discover diverse Attributes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51890:89"/>
connext with what is meant by those two
words; and if, to avoid witty cavil, I decline the
pretence of rigorous Definitions of either word,
without pressing the Essentialness of any of those
Attributes to the Natures of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> I
hope I shall merit both pardon and thanks from
those who look for satisfaction; For, as long as
those Attributes must necessarily accompany the
Rule of Faith, I do my work without engaging
into nicer disquisitions. Those Attributes being
shown necessarily connected with the notion of <hi>Rule
of Faith,</hi> I apply'd them to my matter in hand
by means of these two Propositions, bearing a
necessity of Truth in their very Terms; <hi>That is not
the Rule of Faith to which Attributes necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belonging to the Rule of Faith belong not;</hi>
and, <hi>That is the Rule of Faith to which Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
belonging onely to such a Rule do belong.</hi>
Hence I reject <hi>Scripture's Letter</hi> from being that
Rule, and assert <hi>Tradition</hi> to be it. And this was
enough perhaps for me to do if I onely minded
opposition to those who adhere to Scripture's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their Rule, in contradistinction and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Traditions being such.</p>
                  <p>3. But, intending to avail my self and my
Cause by the strength of Truth and Reason not the
Weakness and Passion of others, I went forwards
(having first shown it clearly Self-evident that
Tradition was a most Certain Rule, if follow'd)
endeavouring to demonstrate the Indefectiveness
of Tradition, or that it was ever follow'd; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51890:89"/>
this I attempted by those means. I took the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
Definition of <hi>Man</hi> (the Subject of the Effect
I was to show,) which was to be a <hi>Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
I found the proper Agent or Efficient to
work upon him as such to be <hi>Motives</hi> or <hi>Reasons;</hi>
and, from the impossibility of any such Motives to
make him prevaricate from openly-deliver'd
Faith, nay the necessity of seeing he must destroy
his Credit without any possibility of compassing his
End, I endeavour'd to conclude that Faith thus
descended was never prevaricated from. Then, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the way of demonstrating the same <hi>a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iori,</hi>
I took an Effect I conceiv'd Impossible to be
introduc't into a Knowing Nature without the
Existence of Tradition's ever-Indeficiency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft
it there, or rather to imbue Souls with it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
and, as it were, <hi>ex traduce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Seeing by this time that my Discourse, by
stooping from my First Principles while I apply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
them to my business, seem'd immerst in matter; and,
by the blunder of many more and more particular
Terms than were in the meer Principle forci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, began to look with a contingent Face (though
indeed I still perch't upon the specifical natures of
Things, and so never flaggd below the Sphere of
Science) therefore to comfort the Readers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
apt to grow turbid by my approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Practice, I consider'd Tradition practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
and open'd the nature of it, by reflecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
how the Revolt from it which we call
<hi>Heresy</hi> comes to be originiz'd. For the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51890:90"/>
I compar'd the Human force of Christian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with another vast Tradition meerly human;
&amp; then touching at some Divine Assistances, show'd
how the Author of Nature had establish't the best
piece of it, Man's Nature, by particular means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
her own native strength, to this Effect of
preserving the descent of Christ's doctrin unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and uninterrupted; that is, I show'd Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
most Certain and most Indefective, and far
beyond the establishment of any other piece of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Science whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>5. Lastly, observing that my Discourse by process
(as the custom is in all Discourses, however evident,
if not bound to Syllogistical form) began to look
dishevel'd, I added diverse Corollaries; In some
of which I made many several ends of it meet in a
closer frame; in others I advanc't forwards to
show that the Churches Vnity, power to oblige and
govern her Subjects as Faithful, and her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the whole and several parts of her was
founded in Tradition; nay that by means of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
She enjoyes a wonderful Sacredness of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
being not onely unexpugnable but also
unimpugnable without destroying all kinds of
Certainty; that is, without highest nonsence in
the Opposer. And hence I seat TRADITION on
her Throne; demonstrating her they the <hi>First,</hi> and
consequently <hi>self-evident,</hi> Principle in affairs of
this Nature; and therefore that the Knowledge
of her Certainty is the <hi>First Principle in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Controversy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:51890:90"/>
6. This tenour of my Discourse briefly reflected
on, I beg of my intelligent Reader to regard it
once more in the bulk, and he will see that I begin
with Self-evident Principles; That my Principles
are antecedent to Authorities, and so are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
means to judge Authorities by; that I studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
avoid wordish ambiguity, which Rhetorical
Discoursers ly open to, holding rigorously to the
notion or meaning of the words; that I lay but
the meaning of two familiar words, <hi>Rule</hi> and
<hi>Faith,</hi> for the <hi>basis</hi> of all my Discourse; that I
endeavour to pursue my Principles by very obvious
and immediate connexions; that all the way I
attend heedfully to and build upon the Natures of
the Things; which, in short, devolves to this, that
it may be hop't (at least by my method) that
there needs nothing but Time and Industry to
frame and make up in rigorous demonstrative form,
that sence which I have here deliver'd in a way
more sutable to the temper of the World and ease of
my Readers; who may see Evidence in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
without being oblig'd to bend their
brains to study my Book with that severity as they
would do an <hi>Euclid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. When this is done, let my Reader reflect on
all the Discourses concerning Faith made by any
Protestant, and see how far they are short from
(I will not say any such performance, but) even
an Attempt of Evidence. First Principles they lay
none; and consequently Evidence of Deduction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected from them: for, wanting First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51890:91"/>
'tis nonsence and folly to talk of deducing.
Again, For want of such Principles, they want
Certainty of any Text of Scripture to justify it
against an Atheist or Deist. They want Self-evident
Principles to guide them in interpreting their Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Letter, and so confute other Sects which
differ from their Church; and the method they take
to do it is evidently quite of another nature than
Scientifical. They have nothing upon account of
Living Teachers which ascertain Sence; so that
you must to find your Faith not build upon the
sence of two or a few familiar words, but of an
whole large Book; that is, on millions of words,
and those too not onely unsenc't, but also very
abstruse and mysterious. They suppose all which
is antecedent to Faith, that is all Principles
which are to induce Faith and so make no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the Grounds of Christianity against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Atheists: The Natures of Things they are
so far from proceeding upon, that they not so
much as mind or think of them, nor I doubt fancy
or value that method when set before their eyes.
Principles to weigh each Testimony by they lay
none, and so quote at randome. Certainty they
seek not, nor care for; for they quote the Fathers
and Scripture as by themselves interpreted, and
yet neither hold the Testimony of Fathers Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nor yet themselves in interpreting Scripture;
yet plainest reason tells us, that unless the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
or themselves were Infallible <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi>
in this saying or interpretation, they were <hi>hic &amp;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51890:91"/>
nunc</hi> Fallible; that is, all built on that Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Interpretation is contingent and Vncertain:
yet of such Citations no better authoriz'd, cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
perhaps in some fine words, the Books of their best
Champions are made up. So that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't
not to study Things, but Words; that is, not
to be Scholars or Knowers, but Empty Talkers;
and so the effect of their endeavours can never be
satisfaction to an intelligent soul, but onely tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Ear or pleasing the Fancy.</p>
                  <p>9. As I have shown this Vngrounded proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Protestants by Principles, so I intend
to do the same by Instances: but ere I go about
this undertaking, I think fit to meet with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
obvious to many Readers. 'Tis this; that,
'Tis strange all Catholicks do not take this way,
it being so conclusive, as well as I.</p>
                  <p>10. I answer, that all Truths being connected, 'tis
evident each Truth, even for being such, is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
several wayes; especially Supreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
concerning ones: Amongst which wayes, some
are sutable to some capacities, others to others.
Wherefore Catholick Controvertists esteeming
themselves Debtors both <hi>Sapientibus,</hi> or to those
who judg of things <hi>per altissimas causas;</hi> and Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientibus,
or those who do not so nor fly higher than
a prudential pitch: and the later of these being
the Generality; hereupon the Charity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of those learned Opposers of Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> (and
very many others) have thought fit to address to
These by answering his Testimonies particularly;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51890:92"/>
leaving me the way of Reason and Principles;
though in danger to receive much disadvantage by
my imperfect delivery, and securer under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery
of their abler heads and pens. I declare
therefore that I intend no confutation of any of
those Authours, nor to share in the victory of
those excellent Champions of Truth: It being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
needless to the Generality (however very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to examining Wits) to confute that in
Common which is already confuted by Retail. I
write more against their Way than their Books. Yet,
if any will be so charitable as to judge my short
hints to bear the force of a solid Confutation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they radically and fundamentally overthrow
all their Arguments and very Method of arguing,
if it be Truth's advantage, I shall give God thanks
for it and be glad of it. But the main is, it imports
not in maintaining Truth what others do or do
not; but, if it be shown that Catholick Principles
(I mean the living voice of the Catholick Church,
or Tradition, our Rule of Faith) can bear such a
rigorous test of Reason, and appear more lustrous
and bright by so severe a trial; and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that the Principles of the Revolters from
her are so little solid, so volatil and meerly made
up of Fancy, that they evaporate into ayr and even
shrink into nothing when set in the mid-da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> beams
of Truth, the Rules of Evidence; I desire no higher
an honour to the Catholick Church, nor deeper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
to her Adversaries.</p>

D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pierce's Sermon.</head>
                     <p>1. LOoking about for Instances of Protestants
Books most proper to be confuted by my
former Doctrin, my thoughts pitcht naturally
on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Whitby</hi>'s, where he goes about to settle
rationally his Rule of Faith, and on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet's,</hi>
where he opposes the way of Reason, and
the Certainty of Tradition. But it seem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to take to task also some Adversary who
insisted on Testimonies, and bring him to
Grounds; because, in the way of Reason which
brings Testimonies to Grounds, to confute one is
in a manner to confute all. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hamond</hi> seem'd
proper; but his Book is now out of vogue, if it
were ever in it; for I never heard past two or
three persons speak of it: and, I am sure, the best
Protestant Wits of our Nation never valued him
as a smart and efficacious Writer. Besides, the
Notes I have lately given upon the Fathers Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
leave little in him to be reply'd to, and
my <hi>Discourses</hi> have left nothing at all. Amongst
late Adversaries then, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Dentons</hi> folly seem'd
so <hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> that it was not worth a serious
thought; and 'tis wholly answer'd by declaring
that he begins and grounds his whole Book on so
knavish a Calumny, that, could the Universality
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51890:93"/>
of Catholicks have the same Law against him,
that a private Protestant, though the meanest in
the Kingdome, might freely have, he would
lose his Ears for Libelling. The <hi>Dissuader</hi> for
his plausibleness (not for his strength of sence)
seem'd to require a larger Answer than was sutable
to the design of an Appendix. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Pierce</hi>
was of highest vogue, and short; but he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
so doubly overthrown by two Learned
Opposers, that it seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d unhandsome and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to strike a man when he was down; his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
making him rather an Object of Pity
than Victory. Yet his Pulpit-alarum to excite
all <hi>England</hi> to persecute Catholicks was so full
of malice, and so monstrously cry'd up, that I
judg'd it above all others deserving to be made
an Example of ungrounded Talk. Though I
shall do it with that compassion as not so much
to confute him, as by laying a few Notes as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
to him, to open his Understanding and
enable him to look into the force of his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and so to guide himself better the next
time he goes about to quote Authors; a point I
doubt he as yet never thinks on. They may also
give his Defender (now, as I hear, writing) some
light to strengthen his Testimonies against us. I
am sure they will tend to clear Truth, not to
blunder it; and so all ingenuous seekers of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
will thank me for them. To begin then,</p>
                     <p>2. The whole scope of his Sermon exprest in
the Title of it, <hi>The Primitive Rule of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51890:93"/>
causes my first Admonition. For, since we
both agree that the Primitive Faith is to be held
to, and only differ about the <hi>Certain means</hi> to
come to know what that Faith was; we holding
to Tradition and to Fathers and Councils (which
are, taken properly, parts of Tradition) as Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
means to know that Faith; The Protestants
to private Interpretations of Scripture, and to
Citations quoted on any fashion; The way to
confute us Catholicks is to demonstrate the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the <hi>way</hi> they take to prove their Faith
the same with the Primitive; otherwise, let them
talk and write as long as they will, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the neerer their Conclusion. Now, if plain
Experience tells us the <hi>Sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and writ against Episcopacy by quoting Fathers
and Scripture, let D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Pierce</hi> show us what his
way of Talking has above theirs which gives it a
virtue of ascertaining or perfectly settling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
or confess theirs (and so his too)
is fallible and frivolous. To <hi>demonstrate</hi> then
against us, and so confute us, he ought rather
have insisted on a <hi>derivative</hi> Rule, or a Rule
able to derive down to them Christ's Faith with
Certainty; so to make out their <hi>present</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which alone can justifie their present or
late Action of <hi>Reforming;</hi> and not run afar off
to a Primitive Rule or Faith, which is nothing
to the Protestants, unless they can prove Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they follow it. When D. <hi>Pierce</hi> makes a
Sermon at Court upon the Certainty of such a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51890:94"/>
Rule, we will all become Auditours, so he will
promise to begin with first Principles, and bring
Evidence of what he sayes: Till then let him
take heed of bragging in print of <hi>Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
until he knows what the word means: that
is, till he reflects how a Demonstration is a Proof
which obliges the Uudersta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ding, and considers
or studies wherein the virtue by which it performs
this, consists. Such bold and careless talk has cost
his Credit dear already; and when it comes to
be scann'd by Principles and Science, will leave
it quite bankrupt.</p>
                     <p>3. We have seen the End and Scope of D.
<hi>Pierce</hi>'s Performance, which is, to over-leap all
that concern'd him to prove, if he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with Certainty against us: Now, <hi>the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
part of his whole performance,</hi> as he sayes
in his Dedication, are his <hi>Citations,</hi> as being the
<hi>Evide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ce and Warrant of all the rest;</hi> which
therefore (if any thing) deserve to be consider'd.</p>
                     <p>Their faults distinguish them into so many
forts.</p>
                     <p>Of the first sort are those which are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our (or indeed to any) purpose, but to
make a noise or vaporing show.</p>
                     <p>Of the second, those which are raw or unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
and onely say somthing in common which
never comes home to the point.</p>
                     <p>Of the third, those which are levell'd blindly
at none knows what, or at a question unstated;
and so are shot at rovers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:51890:94"/>
Of the fourth, Those which impugn a Word
for a Thing; or some Circumstance or Manner
for the Substance.</p>
                     <p>Of the fifth, Negative Testimonies.</p>
                     <p>Of the sixth, A private Authours saying
against the torrent of a contrary consent; which,
of it self, is liable to innumerable contingencies
of passion, mistake or ignorance; but, thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
signifies less than nothing. The like is to
quote a Schoolman or two for a point which
others freely contradict.</p>
                     <p>Of the seventh, those which are false, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
not the thing they are expresly quoted for.</p>
                     <p>Of the eighth, those which labour of obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by an evidently ambiguous word.</p>
                     <p>Of the ninth, Sayings of those on his own
side.</p>
                     <p>Of the tenth, a few fragments of Scripture,
senc't by Fancy.</p>
                     <p>4. I intend not to muster up one by one all
his Citations and then rank them under their
respective Heads, the brevity of an Appendix
not permitting it: But, I make this fair proffer
to his Vindicater or himself, that if they please
to pitch upon any Testimonie of his which falls
not under some one (perhaps many) of these
Faulty Common-places, I will yeild them all
valid and conclusive, and make him publick
satisfaction for the Injurie.</p>
                     <p>Having thus given my bond for the Truth
y charge, and under so great a penaltie
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51890:95"/>
upon failure of being so, I have Title to free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to suppose my charge good, (which will
also appear shortly in common by my §. 9.) and
accordingly to apply my reason to consider his
Citations. I discourse then thus, and Note.</p>
                     <p>6. First, That Citations are of two sorts;
the one alledges the Testifiers Knowledge by
Eye-sight or Infallible Sense; the other his
Judgment or Opinion. Now this later, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
mens Judgments or Opinions depend on
Reasons, is not properly that Authours Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
nor he a Witness (who ought to proceed
upon Evidence had by Senses) but a Schollar
or Relier on his Reasons; and, so, his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself in the words found in such a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has no Authority further than his Reason
gives him; which Reason therefore and not his
Saying ought to be alledg'd: in regard it was
meerly by vertue of his Reason he <hi>knew</hi> this;
and so the whole vertue of his Authority (which
follows and goes paralel to <hi>Knowledge</hi>) consists
in that Reason. None therefore are properly
Testimonies, but those which relie on Sensitive
Knowledge: and those are of Certain Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if the sincerity of the Testator be unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
and the conveyance of his sincerely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant
Knowledge to us be Evident; not
otherwise.</p>
                     <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Note secondly, that, for the reason given,
Citations from Adversaries, and Opinators sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing; also those whose words presumed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51890:95"/>
to express the Witnessers sence are Ambiguous, or
otherwise-interpretable; or else their very Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Uncertain; as all are, if the way of Tradition
be held fallible.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in common of Citations as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Considering them next as made use of
by D. <hi>Pierce,</hi> we finde he relies on them as on
his <hi>Principles</hi> to <hi>conclude</hi> against us, or as he
(good man) unfortunately calls it, <hi>Demonstrate.</hi>
Hence.</p>
                     <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> They must not be <hi>Negative;</hi> for such can
conclude nothing.</p>
                     <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> They must not be false or evidently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
another thing than they are produc't for,
nor impertinent; for then they are in both cases
quite besides the purpose.</p>
                     <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> They must be express and home to the
point; for, Principles must need nothing but
themselves (besides the Application) to infer the
Conclusion pretended to spring from them.</p>
                     <p>9<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> They must be void of ambiguity. For,
Principles must be either self-evident, or at least
made evident, ere they can deserve to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
or admitted as such.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Principles are <hi>Sence,</hi> not <hi>Sounds</hi> or
<hi>Characters;</hi> and so their <hi>Sence</hi> ought to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable.</p>
                     <p>7. The first Note evacuates at once all his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from Authours that concern any point
between us. For he brings no Certainty of any
knowledge exprest to be built on Sense; that is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51890:96"/>
no Citation against us, which, in proper speech,
deserves to be call'd a <hi>Testimony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Note particularly invalidates those
of the eighth and ninth sorth.</p>
                     <p>The third, those of the fifth sort.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, those of the first and seventh.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, those of the five first sorts, and also
those of the seventh.</p>
                     <p>The sixth, those of the second, third, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the eighth.</p>
                     <p>The last Note enervates the tenth, and indeed
almost all the rest. It being evident that our
learned Controvertists give other Sences to those
Citations than what Protestants assigne them,
and maintain still those sences to be better than
theirs.</p>
                     <p>8. In a word, seeing all Testimonial Authority
supposes Knowledge in the Authour, and all
Knowledge is either from Sense (call'd <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>)
or else from evident connexion of Terms
(or Reason) and that this later knowledge is apt
to make a Master, that is, one fit to convince
and teach another rationally by Intrinsecal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums
or to cause <hi>Science</hi> in him, and so is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for <hi>Testifying:</hi> And the former kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
onely is fit to be an Extrinsecal Medium
or apt to beget Belief of the Witnesses word (in
regard any person, unacquainted otherwise with
the Truth of the Point, knows by ordinary
Experience and common reason that mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
may err, but their Sences rightly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51890:96"/>
circumstanc't, cannot;) it follows that no Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in proper speech deserves the name nor has
the force or virtue of a Testimony but those
which are built on Sence or Experience. This
weigh'd, reflecting on the main, I find not one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ress Testimony against any point of our

                        </gap>aith, engaging Sense; that is, not one which
merits the name of a Testimony or to be esteem'd
a part of Tradition. That of S. <hi>Austin</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
Infants has the true nature of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
in it, and deserv'd a more elaborate
Answer, had its Sence been unquestionable and
the Words cited from the Father himself; but
the Sence of it being Disputable (his Expositors
explicating S. <hi>Austin</hi> by himself in another place

                        </gap>ly which is done by Baptism) and withall
cited as a private Authours Sence concerning
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> it falls under the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Head
of faulty or inconclusive Citations, and so is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
answer'd.</p>
                     <p>9. This is the upshot of that famous Sermon:
And now I would gladly know what, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an intelligent person who examins things
by Grounds, Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> hath perform'd in this
so highly extoll'd piece of his more than his dear
Brother and fellow-champion against the Pope,
Mr. HENRY WHISTLER? Onely he hath clad
his little Nothings in some kind of mock-Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;
which, like Fig-leaves, cover after a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner the Nakedness of his empty Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51890:97"/>
Yet, were even his Rhetorick examin'd
by the substantial Rules of that Art, I doubt it
would come of as ill as his Proofs. For 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to observe that the beginning of his Sermon
is <hi>a-la-mode</hi> a School-boy's Theme, and that his
Style is far from even or spun on one thread; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Thunder &amp; Lightning of strong and
sententious Sence astonishing and moving the
Auditors reason by the advantageous smartness
and Majesty of the Expression; he gives us a
peal of Ordinance charg'd with ayr, a volly of
thunder-thumping bombast, able to make a
solid man's Reason nauseate; and this most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificially
plac't at the very entrance of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
§. 2. Or else loud Pulpit-beating invectives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and railings. He makes huge account of little
quirking Observations out of Human Authours;
which have no imaginable force or purpose but
to make an ostentation of the uncouthness of
his reading; the Gallantry of his third para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.
For ingenious surprizes of Reason,
erecting and taking the Understanding, we have
wordish Quibbles, Quirks, and Paranomasias:
and those most evidently (contrary to Art)
studiously and industriously affected. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ident
sayings without Proof make up half his
Sermon; and his Ironies and Sarcasms are the
sauce to make all this windy meat go down.</p>
                     <p>10. I will close with noting his excellent Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in quoting Scripture: To do which when the
place is worth looking, as being brought to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51890:97"/>
some passage we are about, is grave and to
some purpose; but, when no occasion or need
invites, upon the naming any two or three words
which hap to be in Scripture, to be still quoting
and tricking the Margent with <hi>Book, Chapter</hi> and
<hi>Verse</hi> and relating <hi>Stars</hi> or <hi>little Letters,</hi> is a
very empty piece of Pageantrie, and most sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
Pedantical. Now, our Dr. cannot talk of
<hi>Faith,</hi> but he must add (though most unsutably
to his Reformers in <hi>England,</hi> to whom 'tis most
notorious no body <hi>deliver'd</hi> it) <hi>which was once
deliver'd to the Saints,</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> 3. shall ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. He cannot name the words, <hi>which was
from the beginning,</hi> but the margent shall direct
you to <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. The two words <hi>Spending</hi>
and <hi>being Spent</hi> oblige him to let you know
where to find them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. At the very
naming <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>All sufficient,</hi> (two good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
words, which might have been spoke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture had been or not) he cannot for
his heart hold, but alledges you for it, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 27. And will needs (though indeed very
needlesly to us) prove himself a <hi>weak Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
by a plain Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. The obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and common words <hi>condemn'd out of their
mouths,</hi> must have a Star of the First magnitude
to light you to a lesser one in the margent, and
that to <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 22. And <hi>David's</hi> cutting of
<hi>Goliah's</hi> Head with his own Sword, a story
known undoubtedly by all that were like to
read his Sermon, shall be secured from being
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51890:98"/>
thought a piece of a Romance or Knight-erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by a punctual Citation in the open margent,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 51. And, to omit diverse of the
like pleasant strain, lest any Unbeliever should be
so impious as to doubt that his <hi>THEOPNEVST
AHOLIAB</hi> was an <hi>Embroiderer,</hi> you shall
see it as plain as the nose on a man's face in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 30. 34.</p>
                     <p>11. But why insist I thus on so poor a foolery in a
Book I design'd for solid? or what advantage
can I gain to my cause by so sleight an Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
I'answer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>Tis my temper when I see an
odd action done without reason, to trace it to its
Original, and to search after its proper Cause:
And, upon consideration, I finde none so proper
for this Effect, as a certain kinde of humour of
quoting in D. <hi>Pierce</hi> and others of his Brethren,
so strongly possessing them, and even naturaliz'd
into them, that, so they be quoting, they matter
not much whether it be to purpose or not: This
I have shown in the whole bead-roll of his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(<hi>the usefullest part</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>of his whole
performance</hi>) and that not one of those which he
call <hi>Evidences,</hi> is <hi>conclusive;</hi> that is, worth a
straw, or to purpose: But, because every one
will not be capable to see it in those Citations
he brings for Proofs, I let them see it in those
his late quotations of Scriptures: In which he
so pittifully betraies his silly and vain humour of
quoting to no imaginable end but to satisfy
his customary habit or Fancy; and, as in his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51890:98"/>
Citations, so in these, <hi>imagins</hi> the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them to his Cause in stead of showing it,
that I conceive no Universitie-wit but will see
in this carriage of his, that Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s head is
not too Scienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. I Beg pardon of my Reader for my late Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
and Children's play with aiery bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Feathers. Both D. <hi>Pierce's</hi> manner
of writing and his Carriage towards Catholicks
merited this kind of return. I hope the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> I have design'd to answer,
will give me occasion to speak more solidly:
And, that they may do so, I will pick out those
which aim at some point of Concernment. I
have a particular respect for the person, and am
sorry his growing hopefulness receiv'd a foil by
his Book against Mr. <hi>S. C.</hi> and this though a
threefold disadvantage; the badness of his
Cause, the Patronage of Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s malice,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51890:99"/>
and his <hi>impar congressus</hi> with so learned an
Antagonist.</p>
                     <p>2. My Designe leads me to take notice espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of that passage, <hi>p. 93. Sect.</hi> 4. where he
begins a discourse about the Soveraignty of
Reason, and explicates (rather than proves it
ought to be so) what is his Rule and Guide to
Faith. Which, because it look't plausibly,
yet was prudently neglected by Mr. <hi>S C.</hi> who
hearing of more Eminent Antagonists writing
against him, judg'd it wisest to reserve himself
to answer the Protestanrs second and best
Thoughts in Them, in case they were found to
deserve it; and, because on the other side the
<hi>Challenge</hi> was made to <hi>all the Romanists in the
World,</hi> and many passages in it light cross to the
Grounds I had laid, I took leave to consider
and examin it my way. In a great part of it,
especially at the beginning the discourse is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made; but in other places he confounds
Guide with Rule, Power with Motive, and, by
straining a word in Mr. <hi>S. C.</hi> beyond its necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
signification, imposes on us a false Tenet
which he mainly builds upon. So that I am
forc't to begin my answer by putting down our
true one, which gives Faith and Reason both
their due. This done, his Superstructutes on that
Supposition will fall of themselves.</p>
                     <p>3. Our Tenet then is that <hi>Faith</hi> is the same
with <hi>Belief,</hi> that <hi>Belief</hi> relies on <hi>Authority,</hi> and
Divine Faith or Belief on the Divine Authority
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51890:99"/>
as its <hi>Motive,</hi> and on the Churche's as on the
<hi>Applier</hi> of the other to my Understanding. At
next, I hold that no Authority deserves Assent
further than true Reason gives it to deserve; and,
hence, the Divine Authority, being Essential
Truth deserves in true Reason, if possible, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
intense Assent or adhesion to its sayings
from me; and the Churches Authority being
found by my Reason to be <hi>Certain,</hi> it applies
with Certainty (that is <hi>closely</hi>) the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to my Understanding; and so obliges it
absolutely to believe the Truths God has told,
and to submit whatever reasons I may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Object reveal'd to this all-overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Authority of Essential Truth; This being
the First Cause of all those things, whence my
particular Reasons are taken. Nay, farther,
hence it is that I adhere more heartily and firmly
to a point of Faith than to any Conclusion of any
Science whatever; because a more efficacious
Cause equally closely apply'd is apt to produce a
greater Effect, and no Cause is or can be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

come to have that Judgment because Those,
as Objects, wrought upon my Apprehension and
imprinted a conceit of them there as they were
in themselves, and so oblig'd my Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and my Judgment to hold them such as
they were. This Rational Assent establishes my
Faith against the assaulds of any doubts from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reasons; resting assur'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

thwart my Faith unless He can contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is impossible. Hence, if I have true

to It, as being a Child of the same Parent, <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential

                        </gap>d her part in
bringing me to Faith, deserts me not yet while
I act in it, nor I her: my Acts of Belief are still
<hi>rational,</hi> because it was rational to believe at
first, and my Grounds why I then believ'd rest
still unchang'd, nay are unchangeable. But
yet, Reason acts much differently now then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51890:100"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ormerly; Before I came at Faith she acted about
her own Objects, Motives or Maxims, by which
she scand the Authorities we spoke of: But, in
Acts of Faith she hath nothing to do with the
Objects of those Acts or Points of Faith; She
is like a dimsighted man who us'd his Reason to
find a trusty Friend to lead him in the twi-light,
and then reli'd on his guidance rationally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
using his own Reason at all about the Way
it self. To make this clearer we may distinguish
two sences in the word <hi>Reason;</hi> one, as 'tis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for that natural Faculty which constitutes
<hi>Man;</hi> which Faculty never deserts or ought to
desert us in any action that is <hi>Manly</hi> or virtuous,
The other as 'tis taken for that Power wrought
upon by motives under its own ken; in the same
sence we call it <hi>human Reason;</hi> by which is not
meant the natural Power unactuated or abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly,
for then the word <hi>human</hi> were a Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
but Reason as conversant with such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or inform'd by such knowledges as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
found within the sphere of our natural
condition as Men, such as are those which beget
Science: And this leaves us when we have once
found the Authority now spoken of; the Objects
of Faith, formally speaking, being out of her
reach; nor is she (thus understood) the motive
of our Assent to the verity of the <hi>Point of Faith,</hi>
but <hi>AVTHORITY</hi> onely. Wherefore into
<hi>Authority</hi> onely, <hi>Faith</hi> (as such) is resolvd fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;
though, if you go about to resolve the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51890:101"/>
Rationalness of assenting to the Authority it self,
it will light into those Evident Reasons, which
your naturall power of reason, as yet uninform'd
by Faith but by motives or maxims within its
own sphere, was capable to wield.</p>
                     <p>5. Reason therefore taken for my natural Power
is my Eye or interiour <hi>sight;</hi> as inform'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles or Maxims antecedent to Faith,
my <hi>Guid</hi> to bring me to believe Authority; and
those motives or Maxims are the <hi>Rules</hi> to my
Reason, by attending to which, she hath virtue or
skill to set her own thoughts <hi>right,</hi> that is to <hi>guid</hi>
me in my way to Faith: but, when I have once
come to beleeve Authority, that is, come to Faith,
not Reason but <hi>Authority</hi> is my Guid; for I follow
Authority and not my Reason in judging what
is Faith, what not; and, though the Light of
that naturall power never deserts me, yet Reason,
as rul'd by her own natural maxims, is useless to
me as a <hi>Guid,</hi> or those Maxims as a <hi>Rule;</hi> for I
apply neither of these to the mysteries of Faith
to scan their verity or falsity by, but purely rely
upon <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>beleeve</hi> them. Authority
then is my Guid; and in the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of that
Authority, consists the power or virtue it has to
guide me <hi>right,</hi> that is to regulate or <hi>rule</hi> me, as
one of the Faithfull, or as one who must have
such Certain Grounds of my Assent, as I may
securely build my Salvation on. This Authority
then, as it is <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>allible,</hi> is also my <hi>Rule</hi> in my
<hi>beleeving,</hi> or the <hi>Rule</hi> of my <hi>Faith.</hi> This of my
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51890:101"/>
Rule of Faith in Common, against Adversaries
of Faith in common. But, with Protestants, who
grant Christ to be God, and consequently his
words or doctrine true, the onely Rule and Guid
we need, is to lead us into the Knowledge of
what he said and assure it to us. We affirm then,
that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is the <hi>Guid</hi> we follow,
and her <hi>Infallibility</hi> (consisting in Tradition)
our <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Hence all Catholicks profess
her doctrin uninterruptedly succeeding from the
Apostles time, and so to continue to the end of
the World; hence with one voice they lay claim
to Christs gracious Assistance to her, in defending
her from over-growing Errors against Faith, or
Heresies; hence all profess to hear and follow
her, and pledge undoubtingly even the security
of their salvation, by relying on the Certainty of
her Living Voice for their Tenets, and on her
Disciplin for the Practice of their Faith. And
though some Schoolmen make Scripture a partial
Rule of Faith, yet they can mean onely materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
not formally, that is, that some part of Faith
is signifi'd by Scripture's Letter, not that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Letter alone is sufficient securely to signify
it to private understandings so as to beget that
most strong &amp; firm Assent found in Divine Faith;
as is evident by this, that all hold no Scripture is
of private Interpretation; all hold the living
voice of the Church and her constant Practice
are the best Interpreters of Scripture. Now, Faith
being <hi>Tenets</hi> and <hi>Sence,</hi> that must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:51890:102"/>
the Rule of Faith, which ascertains us of Christs
Sence; not the materiall Characters which that
Certain Interpreter we call the Church works
upon, and by her Practicall Tradition inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis high time now to look back upon
Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> and his party, how justly they deal
with us, and how mistakingly they discourse
when they come to the Grounds of their Faith.</p>
                     <p>7. First, by the tenour of his discourse he
would seem to obtrude upon us a Tenet, which
none but perfect mad-men could hold; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we profess we have no reason why we
believe the Church; which devolves to this
that we must profess we have as much reason
to believe an old wife's dream as our Faith,
since there can be no less reason than none at all.
And hence he will needs assure the Reader, that
therefore, the <hi>Enthusiastick Sectaries are in part
Romish Proselytes,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed upon so gross
a calumny layd down for his principle and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Truth, what might he not conclude? with
equal reason he might have inferr'd that all <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>
were Catholicks, and that to turn <hi>mad</hi>
were to turn a <hi>Romanist.</hi> But his carriage to
put this upon Mr. <hi>S. C.</hi> is <hi>strangely</hi> unjust; since he
knows and hints it, that he writ a Book upon
his declaring himself Catholick, entitled, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of his Conversion;</hi> does he think the word
<hi>Motives</hi> does not signify <hi>Reasons,</hi> or, that to
write an whole Book of Reasons why he adhea'd
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51890:102"/>
to the Catholick Church signifies that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
all reason why he believ'd her?</p>
                     <p>8. Next, as for his own tenet, he layes this
for his Ground, that, <hi>Reason alone is Iudge in
all cases.</hi> I will propose him one case, and 'tis
the Existence of a <hi>Trinity.</hi> To work now with
your Reason about this object, and see how
you evince it. I doubt your best reasons will
crack ere you make all ends meet. But, you
mean you must have Reason to <hi>believe</hi>
it; I conceive (speaking properly) you should
rather say you must have Reason to believe the
<hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to believe It; for <hi>Belief</hi>
is as properly relative to <hi>Authority</hi> as <hi>Science</hi> is
to an Act of true Reason or <hi>Evidence.</hi> Whence
'tis as incongruous to say I must have Reason to
believe such a Point, as to say I know such a
point Scientifically by Authority. Again, for
God's love who ever deny'd they ought to
have reason to believe the Churches Authority;
Is any thing more frequent in our Controvertists
and Divines treating of the Ground of Faith
than large Discourses concerning Motives of
Credibility?</p>
                     <p>9. Thirdly, he saies that disputing with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
whether Scripture be the sole Rule, he
means tis so <hi>limitedly,</hi> that is between Christians,
<hi>who have already acknowledged Scripture a Rule
of Faith.</hi> By which I see Mr <hi>Whitby</hi> guides him
self by <hi>sounds,</hi> though he must need; know (if
he knows any thing of Catholick Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>) our
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51890:103"/>
                        <hi>sence</hi> is quite different. I beseech you, Sir, deal
fairly with us: Is not that, speaking formally and
properly, <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi> which gives us Christs
<hi>sence;</hi> and does not that give us the Sence of
Scripture which regulates us in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it? Did ever Catholick then hold that
Scripture interpreted on any fashion, much
less on your fashion by private Judgments or
reasons regulated by Grammatical skill, Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms
and such like verbal knowledges, is a
Rule of Faith; nay do not we constantly abhor
this way as the Source of Heresy? Take us right
then we hold not Scripture's Letter alone a
Rule, but Scripture interpreted by the <hi>Church;</hi>
that is, indeed, the Church formally speaking;
and so you see you mistake our Principle. Yet
upon our joint-agreement in this your Discourse
against us proceeds. Retrive it then, you see
your Errour. Again, you tell us Scripture is your
<hi>new Rule,</hi> but forget quite in your discourse to
tell us that your Reason assures you Scripture is
to be the onely Rule, or why it should be so;
since (besides what I have demonstrated to the
Contrary in my former Discourses) 'tis evident
Christian Religion had descended many steps
ere the Scripture's parts were much scatter'd,
much less the Whole collected; and no less
clear that, that can never be a Rule or Way to
Faith, which many follow yet their thoughts
straggle into many several Judgments; not in
indifferent points, but in that of the <hi>Trinity</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:51890:103"/>
amongst the rest, as your self profess of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
that <hi>he rejects not the Trinity in the first
place, because it seems a contradiction, but because
'tis not clearly discover'd in Scripture;</hi> by which
you see he adheres firm to your Rule, and so
ought to be acknowledg'd one of your Church;
since, though he hap to differ in some points, yet
he holds fast the Rule common to both; which is
the substantiallest Principle of a Church as such,
being the Ground of all Faith. And, indeed,
your Kindness to him here, and your tender
care not to displease him, shows you have a true
brotherly affection for him. Though I fear he
he will con you small thanks for making his
Principle run thus, <hi>That which is not clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

in Scripture and is coniradictory ti reason
is not to be believ'd;</hi> which seems to imply, that
were it clear in Scripture, yet contradictory to
Reason, then he would notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
it. An over-strain of Piety no <hi>Socinian</hi> was
ever guilty of, and I can assure you no learned
Catholick Divine I ever heard of ever made
such an Act of Faith. But 'tis another case if
it onely <hi>seems contradictory,</hi> and is not judg'd
by him to be evidently such; for then there is
room left in his mind for the contrary Assent
of Faith to settle there.</p>
                     <p>10. You say <hi>you prescribe not the doctrin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the Socinians, because it makes Reason
the Iudge of Faith, but the Rule of Faith.</hi> Pray
take pains to consider what you say. He that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51890:104"/>
                        <hi>judges</hi> must have some Principles in his head by
which he is <hi>regulated</hi> in making such a Judgment;
those Principles then must be his <hi>Rule</hi> in that
Action; and, if that Judgment be an adhesion
to a point of Faith, those Principles are his
RULE OF FAITH. Examin now well
your own thoughts, whether your Principles, by
which you find out certainly by interpreting
Scripture this is God's sence or a point of
Faith, be not Maxims of your human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
I am sure in disputes against us you
prove and defend your Faith by such skills; as
Languages, History and other Knowledges got
by Human Learning; and consequently hold It
your selves upon the tenour of those skills, which
therefore are your Rule of Faith, and not upon
the bare Letter. You, I know, will deny it.
But I beg your second thoughts to reflect that a
<hi>Rule</hi> to such an Effect is the immediate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the Power as conversant about that
Effect; and that, if another intervene, it regulates
the former; which thereupon becomes the thing
<hi>ruled,</hi> not the <hi>Rule.</hi> Do then these skills clear
the Letter of Scripture, that is, make known
Gods Sence to you? If so, since their Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
effect is to <hi>clear it,</hi> 'tis impossible to deny but
they are at least part of the Revelation; for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing</hi>
is <hi>clearing,</hi> and God's Sence was not <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed</hi> but by those means, that is by <hi>human
maxims;</hi> and so they are at least the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
part of your Rule of Faith. Again, I ask
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51890:104"/>
might you not have mistaken the true Sence
without those Human Maxims? If so, then
They, and not Scripture's Letter, were your
Rule. If not, then onely common Sence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
to understand clearly what's <hi>reveal'd</hi> in
Scripture; and then, either your Brother Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
or you want Common Sence, which I think
you'l scarce say.</p>
                     <p>11. But, will you see you still hold <hi>Reason</hi> your
Rule, notwithstanding you cry up the Written
word? Find you not there expresly that God
has hands, feet, nostrils and passions like ours, and
this in clear terms? Why is it not then a point
of Faith? You will not answer sure it is against
Maxims of Reason; you renounc't them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
(<hi>p.</hi> 94.) when you had found out your

obliges you to admit it: You that can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
an <hi>Infinit extension of space</hi> (when <hi>you say
all the world besides</hi> does so too, sure you thought
all the World was in your Fancy) may also
hold <hi>Materia ab aeterno,</hi> and that it is onely a
part of Gods Nature, as (if I mistake not) <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
Bemen</hi> does; and then <hi>secundum hanc par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
of <hi>illam</hi> will do the work, and gives a true
sence to both sides of the contradiction. You
should do any thing which could by any means
make it seem possible, rather than question a
<hi>plain Divine Revelation:</hi> Nay, perhaps you do
not think you can demonstrate the contrary to
the solution I have helpt you out with, at least
that your Demonstration is but a <hi>seeming</hi> one;
and then I challenge your candour to own your
sayings, and demand why you are not bound to
use this shift and a thousand others rather than
violate your avow'd Rule of Faith, and deny
and hold against the clear Letter of Scripture.
If you alledge you have perfect Science of the
contrary by Metaphysicks; then, though I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
not this from you, your Science rules your
Rule of Faith; glossing or rather violently wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the plain Letter, and so is so absolutely your
Rule of Faith that it controls and even baffles
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51890:105"/>
the other though <hi>clearly revealing:</hi> Or, if to be
in express terms in Scripture be not to be <hi>clearly
revealed,</hi> I would fain know what those words
<hi>clearly revealed in Scripture</hi> signifie.</p>
                     <p>12. Perhaps you I say, that notwithstanding your
<hi>new Rule,</hi> Reason must be your <hi>GVID</hi> still even
in Faith, though not your <hi>Rule.</hi> But I ask, if
your Reason must guide you sometimes so as to
deny the clear Letter of Scripture, since a Guid
in any thing must be regulated by some Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in that Affair, by what Principles or
Knowledges Reason is to regulate it self while it
guides you in that particular now in question?
By Principles of Faith? How can that be in
your Grounds antecedently to the known Sence
of the Scripture? By Principles of <hi>Human Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi>
Then those Principles of Human Science
give you the certain Sence of the Written Word
when it self is insufficient, and therefore are still
truly your Rule of Faith; and so you are forc't
to fly back for refuge to the old Rule, <hi>Human
Reason,</hi> which you seemingly renounc't when
you had found your <hi>new Rule</hi> of the Scripture.
'Tis Evident then that some Maxims of your
Reason are your Rule and not Scripture's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And this is what we reprehend in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian
and you too; that, chusing a wrong Rule
of Faith so to avoid the Church, you both gloss
it as seems best to your Reason regulating her
self by her own, and those fallible, Maxims. They
by certain acute and ingenious Sophistries proper
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51890:106"/>
to themselves, you by the more school-boy way
of Grammar and Dictionary Learning; and so
both of you make your <hi>Rule</hi> the <hi>thing Ruled.</hi> Nor
think to retort any part of this Discourse upon
our Rule of Faith; For, this being the living
voice of the Church, delivers us a Determinate
Sence of the Points we are to profess, whereas
Yours needs skils and helps of studious Reason to
tell you what it would say; Ours is alive, and in
the Breast and Actions of the Faithful; yours is
dead characters, waxen-natur'd, and pliable to,
the Dedalean fancies of the ingenious molders of
new Opinions; and so, alone, can satisfie no man
as you handle it.</p>
                     <p>13. No wonder now, if, having no certainer a
Ground or Rule of Faith for her self, your
Church is shamefast of obliging others to believe
her: Man's nature could scarce own or permit so
irrational a tyrannie. Yet whether she does or
does not, we must not know from your words;
which run so backwards and forwards, that none
can tell which is the true face of the <hi>Ianus.</hi> First
p. 99. you seem to deny it stoutly from the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of your Convocations and Bishops, and from
your own Tenets: Yet afterwards you seem to
grant they do <hi>require a positive assent</hi> somtimes,
and justifie them as not doing it <hi>upon pretence of
any Infallibility, but because the thing determin'd
is so Evident in Scripture, that all denying it must
be wilful.</hi> A rare Discourse, and worthy a deep
consideration! Pray who must be Judge it is so
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51890:106"/>
Evident in Scripture as to render the Dissenters
guilty of flat Wilfulness? The Bishops, or your
Church? Nothing less: In the beginning of this
Discourse (p. 93.) you plainly deny'd them to be
Judges of Faith. Now in your sence to be <hi>clearly
reveal'd</hi> or evident in Scripture, and to be <hi>of
Faith</hi> is all one; so that they must not be Judges
of <hi>what is evident in Scripture,</hi> lest by necessary
consequence they become Judges of <hi>Faith;</hi> and
yet without having power to judge what is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Scripture, they must have power to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
assent to Points as evident in Scripture;</hi> nay
and <hi>punish</hi> the dissenters too: For 'tis a madness
for Governours to <hi>require</hi> any thing of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
without having Rewards and Punishments
in their hands to make what they require to be
duely observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d. Nay p. 93. you absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to admit them as <hi>Guides of your Faith.</hi> A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
word and less than to be a <hi>Iudge!</hi> Which
signifies they may have <hi>power to require our Assents</hi>
in matters in which they have <hi>no power to guide
us;</hi> that is, they may have power to <hi>require us to
go wrong</hi> for any thing we or they know. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
honour for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
her Champions profess in Print her Supreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
have no power at all to guide their Flock in
their Faith, or to it when they are out of it! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I would ask whether the <hi>Trinity</hi> be not
<hi>Evident in Scripture,</hi> and the Socinians <hi>wilful</hi> for
denying it? Why are they then so kindly dealt
with? Or what could be reply'd to a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:51890:107"/>
answering, when his Assent to the Trinity were
required, that he humbly submitted to Scripture,
that he us'd all the means he could, but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
it not so evident there; and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
that you obtruded upon his equally-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
party your own conceit or opinion for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Evidences?
What therefore you alledge
here, as in your Churches behalf, that she <hi>requires
not a positive assent upon pretence of any Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
more condemns Her; seeing tis most absurd
and irrational that one should require any man
to assent to any point or proposition whatever, as
evident in Scripture, without Infallible Certainty
(at least imagin'd and pretended) that it is thus
evident there; for, should it happen to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
how ridiculous were his Authority, how
damnable and diabolical his Tyrannie to oblige
men to the hazard of falshoods in matters of
Faith, that is in matters belonging to his eternal
Salvation; and in the mean time profess himself
Ignorant whether they be false or no.</p>
                     <p>14. Now our Church goes another way; which
ere I declare, I would let your party see, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Assent may be required by Governours
lawfully and rationally, which your Principles
can never make sence of. Suppose a thousand
witnesses from several places each of them held
alwayes men of good consciences should swear in
open Court that they had seen such and such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
done by such a man, or that they had seen,
spoken or converst with such a person, were not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51890:107"/>
he <hi>mad</hi> that is a renouncor of Reason or Man's
Nature who should not believe them. You see
then these Witnesses have power to propose
such an Object as can <hi>oblige to Belief?</hi> You see
the Dissenters are Irrational, that their act of
dissenting springs from some Passion or Vice,
and Vice is punishable; and so is the Effects of
that Dissent, if it be in such a matter as is highly
pernicious to Mankind's best concerns. Now
our Church makes account she is able to propose
an Authority incomparably more ample than
the Attestation now spoken of, for the true
Descent of her Faith; and judges such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
founded on the eye-sight of all those Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
to be able to oblige to interiour Assent in
such a degree as to render them most highly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
vicious and irrational who should disbelieve
it; hence (the crime intrenching upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to mankind's Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the highest concern
imaginable,) both to edify those dissenters by
correcting their vice, and the circumstant Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
by breeding a conceit in them, through the
punishment of the others, of the sacredness of
Faith and its Rule, and the hainousness of Pride
of understanding the ready way to all Heresies,
they may nay ought punish their Interiour Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
Not out of an height of Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motives, as Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> conceits, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Authority is her self such a motive
to Belief, that onely irrational vicious and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully-blind
persons can recede from it by disbelief:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51890:108"/>
And hence our Churches procedure is rational,
natural, sweet and charitable, tending to amend
an enormity of Will not bred from a rationally
but passionate dissatisfy'd Understanding. Nay,
Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s discourse justifies Our Churches
procedure; who seems to allow his Church a
power to require a positive Assent, when the
case comes to be such that the denier of it
must needs be held <hi>wilfull;</hi> and our Church
neither sayes nor acts otherwise.</p>
                     <p>15. By this Discourse I would not have M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
imagin that I am about proving our Churches
Infallibility in this place; but onely showing
that, holding She can evidence her Authority,
She goes rationally to work and consonantly to
her self in requiring Assent to her Proposals;
whereas Theirs, confessing her self fallible even in
interpreting Scripture, upon which all, both
her <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> as a Church, depends,
were self-condemn'd, irrational and tyrannical
if She should go about to require any such Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Assent. Now, though he in big words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
this to be her carriage, asking <hi>when did they</hi>
(meaning Bishops, Convocations or Parliaments)
<hi>challenge any power over our minds and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
and alledges the consent of their Divines
for it, yet I wonder what he thinks of the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy, made by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Parliament; is there no obligation there
to <hi>hold</hi> any thing? Yes, as strong as Oath can
tye it. And, which is worse, 'tis more Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51890:108"/>
to go about to bind Our Assents who are not
of their Church, than to bind their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
This in practice is perform'd towards all;
but so imprincipled a procedure that their
Church waves it when it comes to a rational
scanning in a Dispute and Controversy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
so their want of Grounds to make
it good. Which shows that the Authority of
their Church sprang from the Parliament or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
State, in regard She professes her self very
heartily content with external Obedience, let
the Interiour Assent goes where it will; most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the Church settled by the Wisdome of the
Eternal Father, and constituted <hi>the Pillar and
Ground of Truth;</hi> who provided in the first
place for the Churches Power to <hi>hold</hi> us to the
same <hi>Tenets</hi> (which are the Principles of our
Actions) knowing that, unless the Root of Faith
be sound, the Actions, its branches, must needs
be rotten and unconscientious; and, that no
Congregation could long hold together, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
longer than the plain force of the Secular
Sword aw'd them, unless by power to evidence
its Authority it had power to oblige men's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
connaturally to an Unity in the
same Faith; which done, all else would follow,
And hence we may see confessedly in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Principles the reason of their present and
past distractions, and divine of the future; for,
men's Fancies being naturally various, and no
power in her to keep them in an Union, they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51890:109"/>
must needs ramble into multitudes of dissenting
Sects; which to strive to unite into one were to
force both Nature and Conscience too. <hi>Nature,</hi> in
striving to unite their Understandings in Faith,
without offering them <hi>Evidence of Authority;
Conscience,</hi> in binding them to <hi>Act</hi> as Protestants
do, whereas they are ready to stake their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon it that their best reasons working
upon the very Rule of Faith Protestants recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
obliges them to the contrary, and that
to force them to <hi>act with Them</hi> is to force them
to <hi>sin;</hi> So that the Protestants at once profess
they will not or cannot oblige their <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and yet at the same time contend by force
to oblige their <hi>Wills,</hi> without, nay against their
Understandings.</p>
                     <p>16. In a word, let Protestants write, talk &amp; quote
words as long as they will, Plainest Common
Sence tells them and every man who considers it,
that unless they settle some undisputable Method
of arriving at Christ's Sence or Faith, that is, some
<hi>self-evident</hi> (and so <hi>all-obliging</hi>) <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
the Protestant Church can never hope for Power
to reduce their Dissenters, nor to hold together or
govern efficaciously their own Subjects; that is,
they can never hope for Unity within themselves;
nor, lastly, Union with them that have it, and
charitably endeavour they may have it too.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Animadversions
On
Some Passages in Mr. Stillingfleet.</head>
                     <p>1. THe loud Fame of Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Book
preventing its Publication, and withall
the report of his good parts coming from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Judicious Persons, bred in me a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
to see something of his other Writings,
that so I might have more solid Ground to build
my Expectation on than common rumour or
commendation of acquaintances. A Protestant
Friend show'd me a little Treatise of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Excommunication. I perus'd the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of it, and immediately told him Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>
was a very ingenious person, and writ
the best I ever yet saw any Protestant: For he
settled first his notion or the true nature of the
Thing, and thence attempted by intrinsecal
<hi>mediums</hi> to draw immediate Consequences,
which show'd that his head lay right for Science.
But, withal, I assur'd my Friend 'twas impossible
he could write against us, and take that method;
the nature of his Cause not enduring so severe a
Test. His Book coming forth, and bearing in
its Title <hi>a Rational Account of the Grounds of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51890:110"/>
Protestant Religion,</hi> my Expectation was more
erected; and, till my self could get leasure to
peruse it, I told diverse both Catholicks and
Protestants that they might expect from Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s
Wit the most that could be said ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the later or against the former. But,
coming to over-look cursorily his <hi>Infallibility of
Tradition,</hi> Part 1. Cap. 6. and <hi>The. Protestants
Way of resolving Faith,</hi> Cap. 7. I had quite lost
Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> and, instead of him, had found
a Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> or a <hi>Dissuader;</hi> who
talk not out of Nature or Things, but Words &amp;
Imagination. I plainly discover'd there was not
one proposition in those two Discourses which
could be a solid Ground for a rational under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(that would be true to it self) to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and rely on; and was desirous to show it,
had it not been uncivil to put my sickle into
another man's harvest, and crop the victory due
to another's Learning and Industry: Victory, I
say; For he that defends his Cause no better,
in effect yields it lost. Yet I beg leave of the
judicious Authour of <hi>Labyrinthus Cantuariensis</hi>
to maintain one Breach where I find my self
more directly assaulted; Oral Tradition being the
Post I have taken upon me to explicate further
&amp; defend, because I conceive it the solid Ground
on which the Church, or all Catholicks both
Learned and Unlearned, rely as <hi>Faithful:</hi>
however some School-men, <hi>abounding in their
own Sence,</hi> ground also their Explication of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51890:110"/>
the Churches Infallibility on somthing besides.</p>
                     <p>2. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> then Part 3. Chap. 5. § 4,
&amp; 5. sets himself to oppose <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> whose
Infallibility he opposes to <hi>Doctrinal Infallibility
in Pope or Councils.</hi> Where, if by <hi>Doctrinal Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
he means that which they have as Doctors
or Schollers, he may reflect that no Catholick
makes such an Infallibility <hi>proper</hi> to the Church
or Church-Governours, as such; however it may
be somtimes <hi>necessary</hi> to proceed upon it in some
signal occasions. Now, take away this Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
there is none left but the Infallibility of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
perform'd by Testifying: It being Evident
that we have but two wayes of ordinary Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
by Acts of our Soul, or Operations on
our Body; that is, by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi>
the former of which belongs to Speculaters or
Doctors; the second to <hi>Deliverers</hi> of what was
receiv'd, or, to Testifiers. Whence M. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>
may see he stumbles at the very threshold
by counterposing <hi>Doctrinal Infallibility</hi> to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary;</hi>
since that which we call <hi>Ecclesia docens</hi>
professes constantly to ground her self on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
witness the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in every Session
where she defines Faith.</p>
                     <p>3. No wonder then, if grounding on this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> declares himself unsatisfi'd.
He asks therefore <hi>whether he is bound to believe
what the present Church delivers to be Infallible?</hi> I
understand him not: Had he instead of the word
<hi>Infallible,</hi> put <hi>receiv'd as deliver'd ever,</hi> or <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51890:111"/>
true,</hi> I had; for Fallibility and Infallibility
belong to the Knowing Power or the Persons
that have it, not to the Object; The Object being
neither <hi>deceiv'd</hi> nor <hi>not deceiv'd,</hi> but <hi>we:</hi> Well,
but suppose he means by it <hi>deliver'd ever,</hi> or
(which is equivalent) <hi>certainly true,</hi> for what
came from Christ must be so; In that case we
answer Affirmatively: He asks again, <hi>on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
is he <hi>bound to believe it?</hi> And he makes our
Answer to be, <hi>Because the present Church cannot
be deceiv'd in what the Church of the former Age
believ'd, nor That in the precedent, and so up till
Christ.</hi> This is indeed part of our Answer: The
other part is, that <hi>the Church in no Age could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
against her Knowledge to deceive that Age
immediately following in matter of Fact evident in
a manner to the whole World.</hi> Upon this, he falls
into two new Demands which take up this whole
paragraph.</p>
                     <p>4. The first is, <hi>how we can assure him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church obliges him to believe nothing but onely
what and so far as it receiv'd from the former
Church?</hi> I answer, by her manifest Practice; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
refusing Communion to any man that could
approve himself to believe all the former Age did.
I could here distinguish the word <hi>Believe,</hi> but I
refer it till I come to speak of <hi>de fide.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.
<hi>What Evidence can you bring to convince
me both that the Church alwayes observ'd this Rule,
and could never be deceiv'd in it?</hi> For the later, I
hope I need bring no greater Evidence than this,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51890:111"/>
that men in all Ages had Eyes, Ears, and other
Senses, also common Reason, and as much memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as to remember their own names and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-inculcated
Actions. If you disprove this, I
doubt we have lost <hi>mankind,</hi> the subject we are
speaking of. And, till you disprove it, neither
I nor any man in his wits can doubt that this Rule
depending on Testifying, that is <hi>Sence</hi> or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
can possibly permit men to be <hi>deceivable.</hi>
The former part I shall speak to when I come
to show the Obligation not to vary from Faith.
His Scruple springs hence, that he <hi>sees the Roman
Church asserts things to be</hi> de fide <hi>in one age which
were not in another,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>this is the common
Doctrin</hi> and the <hi>deniers</hi> ill-look't on. I beg leave
to distinguish the words <hi>de fide;</hi> which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mean <hi>Christian Faith</hi> or Points of Faith
<hi>taught by Christ;</hi> and then you see 'tis nonsence
to say they can be in one Age and not in another;
for what Christ has taught he has taught, and
the preteritness of the Thing has so fixt its Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
to its proper time, that 'tis not now obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
to variation; <hi>Quod factum est infectum fieri
non potest.</hi> Or, <hi>de fide</hi> may mean <hi>obligatory to be
believ'd.</hi> In this later sence none (I think) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
things may be <hi>de fide</hi> in one Age, and not
in another; in the former sence none holds it.
What's now become of your difficulty? I believe
you are in some wonderment, and think I elude
it rather then answer it: I shall endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplex
you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:51890:112"/>
5. Christianity ayms not to make us <hi>Beasts</hi>
but more perfectly <hi>Men;</hi> and the perfection of
our Manhood consists in using our Reasons. Since
then natural Consequences are apt to spring from
natural Principles by the operation of Reason,
and we cannot but think that the Consequences
apt to flow from Supernatural Principles or
Points of Faith deliver'd down from Christ
(onely which are <hi>de fide</hi> in the former Sence)
are of incomparably greater Excellency than
Natural Truths, it follows that Christianity or
Christian Faith is so far from hindring the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
from deducing out of them, that both out
of their nature as Supream Truths or Principles,
and out of their high Excellency they invite and
prompt most strongly to it. Now these Points
deduct out of Principles of Faith are of two
sorts; The former those which need no more
but Common Sence or the ordinary natural
Light of Reason to discover their arising thence,
nor any piece of Skill or Science to infer them,
but are seen by the bare Principle of Faith, or
rather <hi>in</hi> it; being indeed but a Branch or Part
of that Principle. The later are those which
need, besides, the Maxims of some Science got
by Speculation to infer them. An Example
of the former sort is that against the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
of Christ's having an <hi>Human Will;</hi> for, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Experience tells the most vulgar that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man has a Principle in him impelling him to
Act, which we agree to call a <hi>Will.</hi> Such like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51890:112"/>
are all Propositions of this Nature which
the Church uses upon occasion of some emergent
Heresie to explain her self and put the point of
Faith out of danger of being <hi>equivocated.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the later sort are Theological Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
in which a Natural Truth is one of the
Premises, joyning with the Supernatural one to
infer them. To omit this, as little to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at present; Of the former sort the Church
is necessitated to make use upon occasion; that
is, when any Heretick questions Those, and
<hi>eâdem operâ</hi> the whole point of Faith it self of
which they were a part. Upon occasion I say;
For what concern'd its the Faithful or who ever
heard much noise of this Proposition, <hi>Christ has
two Wills,</hi> thus singled out and exprest apart,
till the <hi>Monothelite</hi> granting him but one, forc't
the Church, that she might preserve the main
Tenet of Christ's having two Natures, or being
God and Man, to maintain, publish and define
that other.</p>
                     <p>6. To apply this then; since none can have
Obligation to <hi>believe</hi> what they have not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to <hi>think of,</hi> and, that in some Age the
<hi>Generality</hi> of the Faithful have no Occasion nor
consequently Obligation to minde, reflect or
<hi>think on</hi> those Propositions involvd in the main
stock of Faith, and truly parts of it, that is
indeed <hi>It;</hi> It follows that a Thing may be <hi>de
fide</hi> or obligatory to be believ'd in one Age and
not in another. Perhaps Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> may
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51890:113"/>
ask how the Church can have Power to oblige
the Generality to Belief of such a point. I answer,
she obliges them to believe the main Point of
Faith by virtue of Tradition's being a Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Rule, and these Imply'd Points by virtue
of their being self-evidently-connected with
those main and perpetually-us'd Points, so that
the vulgar can be rationally and connaturally
made capable of this their Obligation. Whence
the Government of our Church is still justify'd
to be sweet and according to right Nature, and
yet forcible and Efficacious to hold her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in a strict Union. Not to mention how
these Points also descended by a kind of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for I doubt not but the Apostles had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
in explaining Faith to speak of These;
however the no Necessity brought them not so
much into play, but left them unreflected on by
the Generality.</p>
                     <p>7. But to return to Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who acts
here like a Politician and would <hi>conquer</hi> us by
first <hi>dividing</hi> us, and making odious Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
between two parties of Divines. But he
may please to reflect how we all hold firmly the
same divinely-constituted Church-Government,
and the same self-evident Rule of Faith to give
our understandings the same principles as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and so our wills the same Actions: And
those are firmly rooted in all our hearts to have
been recommended to us by the wisdom of the
Eternal Father: Whence 'tis Impossible for all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51890:113"/>
the Wit of Man or even Malice of Hell to disunite
us as we are <hi>Faithful:</hi> As private Discoursers, our
different Natures and Circumstances must needs
distinguish us. Every one <hi>believes</hi> the same; but,
coming to <hi>explicate</hi> this Belief, they vary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the several degrees of perfection in their
understanding Powers. And yet M. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
is not aware how little we differ even as Divines:
For, though some Speculaters attribute to the
Church a power of <hi>defining</hi> things <hi>not held before,</hi>
yet few will say she has <hi>New Revelations,</hi> or <hi>New
Articles</hi> of Faith, &amp; those only some Lawyers who
talk <hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> no Divines that I know of;
and none, that Christ was not a perfect Law-giver;
which are necessary Consequents (or rather in a
manner Identical) to the other. And, when it
comes to the point, those men explain themselves
that all was <hi>deliver'd Faith,</hi> either <hi>Explicitly</hi> or
<hi>Implicitly;</hi> which I have shown to bear a very
good Sence, in my Explication of <hi>de fide.</hi> He
tells us Popes and Councils challenge a power to
make things <hi>de fide</hi> in one Age which was not in
another: he speaks onely in common and proves
it not: Had he brought Instances, it might have
been better clear'd. In the mean time I have
shown him how, take them right, this is both
perfectly innocent and unavoidably necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a Church. What would avail him is, if a
Pope and Council should define a <hi>new Thing,</hi> and
declare they ground themselves on <hi>new Lights,</hi> as
did their first Reformers in <hi>England.</hi> But he will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51890:114"/>
finde no such fopperies in Faith-definitions made
by the Catholick Church. He tells us that this is
<hi>the common Doctrin maintain'd;</hi> By which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he is at an end of his Argument against our
<hi>Church;</hi> there being no evidenter signe of it, than
to leave off assaulting Her; confound her with
the <hi>Schools,</hi> or some private Opinaters, and
then carp at these mens Tenets. Whereas M. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>
wants not Wit to know, that no sober
Catholick holds <hi>Human deductions</hi> the <hi>Rule of
our Faith,</hi> Schoolmen <hi>Definers</hi> of it, nor the
<hi>Schools</hi> the <hi>Tribunal</hi> whence to propose it autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively
and obligingly to the Generality of the
Faithful; much less a few Divines, which are far
from reaching the Authority of the Schools. Yet
how much of his Book would need no Answer,
were this Impertinent Topick laid aside? But
well; Let Schools and Church be all one, that
is, let every master of divinity be a Bishop, what
means he to conclude from the words <hi>common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin?</hi>
Does he make account every School-Doctrin
must be <hi>equally</hi> in vogue, or that an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion's
being <hi>Common</hi> defines it Faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
the other for Heretical. Where's his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
The direct contrary follows from its being
<hi>Common;</hi> and, that 'tis not Faith which others,
though not so many, may contradict; and he is
but meanly vers't in our Schools if he sees not
very many publikely maintain that there are no
new Revelations without dreading <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or being held <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>seditious:</hi> So
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51890:114"/>
they grant the Church power (as they ought) by
new Propositions and new but expressive Words,
(yet, both the same in <hi>sence</hi> and so not new in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>)
to meet with the new blundering Cavils of
Innovators.</p>
                     <p>8. Yet all this while M. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> cannot see
how to <hi>satisfie himself of the Sence of our Church
as to this particular.</hi> Nor ever will, while he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
looks the wrong way, that is, towards some
particular Schoolmen or Divines, not towards
the Universality of the Faithful or Church. What
need he counterfeit this puzzle? Did he never
hear of such a thing as the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Or
is it so hard to finde it? Again, does not he know
all the Catholick Church allow more a thousand
times to It than to all the Schoolmen in the
World? Yes very well; How comes it then that
he runs to some Schoolmen, and neglects the
Church speaking in her Representative? Because
he may finde there a clear Solution of his doubt,
by the constant procedure of that most grave Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
in its definitions: where he will hear of no
such Toyes as <hi>New Revelations,</hi> but directly the
contrary; Every Session where Faith was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
professing to build on <hi>Tradition, Teaching</hi>
and <hi>Preaching,</hi> that is, <hi>Oral Tradition; ever, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. that is not-<hi>new,</hi>
but the <hi>old</hi>-and-<hi>ever</hi>-Faith. If you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
our Church, here you have her; fall to work:
But you find some Schoolmen opining also Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in some other means besides Tradition, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51890:115"/>
judging this Tenet easilier confuted, you level
your blowes at it, because the other is out of your
reach; and would make this Tenet the Sence of
the Catholick Church, and so seem to oppose the
Church her self. You would disgrace this Way
of Tradition as maintain'd but by a few, and
those blemisht persons. How far are you wide
of the Truth? 'Tis the way every Catholick
in the whole Church, none excepted, holds
and follows. For my part, I disavow the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any Point or affecting any way which is
not assented to by all; and this, not as Opinion,
but deeply rooted in their hearts as Infallibly
Certain. Schoolmen at Liberty question Personal
Infallibility of the Pope, some grant it not to
him and his <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, some question that
of a Provincial Synod; nay some, whose Books
are extant and yet uncensur'd, maintain even a
General Council may possibly err; but not one
I have heard or read of affirms that <hi>Tradition,</hi> or
the Living voice of the Church Essential, could
err; For in doing so, he call'd all his Faith in
question, and so ceast to be a Christian.</p>
                     <p>9. This then being held by <hi>all;</hi> held <hi>firmly;</hi> and
that it is <hi>absolutely Infallible</hi> so that in no case it
can err, the others only by <hi>some,</hi> &amp; <hi>faintly</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
(as appears by the Faithful's permitting
them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o be question'd) nay, not held at all Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
but upon Supposal of certain Conditions to
be observ'd, in which also Divines differ, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>
and other Protestant Writers may see
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51890:115"/>
what they have to do if they will candidly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
the Catholick Church, and not trifle away
time in wrangling with some private Opinators.
I have set them a fair mark in my Discourses, if
they will speak to the Point; and the end of my
Preface has told them how to do it. If they
overthrow this, all the other Infallibilities now
spoken of will fall with It; If not, not onely
This of Universal Tradition will stand, but also
all the other Infallibilities will in Virtue of it be
establisht on a firmer basis, than any who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
not with and settles the First Principle in
<hi>Controversy</hi> could ever give them. This Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
then they must either subvert, or they
may fear the Papists will build such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures
on it as will reach to Heaven. It rises
apace, and has advanc't many Stories in a small
time.</p>
                     <p>10. By this Discourse all Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet's If's</hi>
which follow, have their Answer; and he will
see the knot easily loos'd in distinguishing the
word <hi>other;</hi> by which if he means <hi>disparate,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected
or unimply'd Points of Faith: No Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of any number or account hold they can
be <hi>de novo,</hi> much less our <hi>Church;</hi> If involv'd
or <hi>imply'd</hi> in the main Point, he must show 'tis
<hi>absolutely</hi> Another, and not rather a piece or
part of the <hi>Implying</hi> one; as, <hi>Homo est Animal,</hi>
is a part of <hi>Homo est Animal rationale.</hi> In the
mean time let him consider what Logick tells us,
that <hi>The Conclusion is in the Premises,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51890:116"/>
will much unblunder his Thoughts; and
withall, that 'tis most unreasonable to deny the
Church the Liberty to take asunder her own
Thoughts, and clear them, upon occasion; by
representing their Parts distinctly or in many
Propositions, which were invol'd before in some
one. A priviledge Nature grants all Mankind as a
necessary Conseqent to their working by abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Notions; this being no more than to regard
or view the same thing`now on one side, then on
the other.</p>
                     <p>11. His Second Chief Demand is, <hi>What security
is there that in no Age of the Church any Practices
should come in which were not in the Precedent.</hi>
I answer, Our <hi>Practices</hi> spring from our <hi>Tenets;</hi>
If then he means <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Practices, that is,
such as spring from Ecclesiastical Constitutions,
there is no security at all; for these <hi>are</hi> to come
in anew as oft as the necessity of Disciplin or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
requires it: If he mean such Practices,
as spring from Points of Faith taught by Christ,
there is the same security no such new Practices
can be introduct as there is that no <hi>new</hi> Christian
<hi>Tenets</hi> can come in. Now these later Practices
are those we make use of in Tradition, as making
Faith visible, being as it were its <hi>Body:</hi> He must
mean then of These Practices to do his Discourse
any service; and, so, of these he questions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Descendents <hi>held themselves bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably
to observe what their Forefathers did;</hi>
otherwise to <hi>know</hi> barely <hi>what they</hi> did, was not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51890:116"/>
enough to make them <hi>follow</hi> it. He argues well.
To smooth as many rubs as I can, that so we
may have no difficulty but our main one, I
would reflect on the signification of the word
<hi>unalterably.</hi> For to introduce new Practices
<hi>consequent</hi> to the former is to propagate, enlarge,
extend and so strengthen them, not to <hi>alter</hi>
them; in the same manner as to discourse <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently</hi>
to a Principle or <hi>Tenet,</hi> is so far from
<hi>altering</hi> it, that by the contexture of other
Truths with it, it corroborates and establishes
it more <hi>unalterably</hi> its self. They must then be
Practices not of a <hi>subordinate</hi> but an <hi>opposit</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to Christian ones which can be fear'd to
<hi>alter</hi> Christian <hi>Practices.</hi> The Question then is
whether Children or the Succeeding Age held
themselves still bound not to bring in Practices
and Tenets <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrin and Practice
of the Precedent Age. And, the Affirmative
is most Evident, in case they held those Tenets
which Principled those Actions, <hi>True,</hi> taught
by Christ, and commanded by him as the Way
to bring them to Heaven; and those Practices
<hi>Consequent.</hi> If then they held the <hi>deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
Christ's,</hi> they could not but hold themselves
oblig'd not to <hi>alter</hi> it, nor consequently its
Practices. So that our Question is restrain'd to
to a narrower compass, and the onely Difficulty
now is whether they held the Doctrin of Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be the Doctrin of <hi>Christ,</hi> or no.</p>
                     <p>12. I am heartily glad so acute an Adversary
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51890:117"/>
as Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and one chosen out (if I am
inform'd right) as a person conceiv'd the ablest
to write against Catholicks, has so candidly
confest here, <hi>p.</hi> 629. That <hi>the onely thing to be
prov'd</hi> in this case, is, <hi>That every Age in the
Church and all persons in it looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as oblig'd not to vary in any thing from the
Doctrin and Practice of the Precedent Age.</hi> He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
me my choice of three wayes to prove it: I
accept of the way of Reason. He presses for a
<hi>demonstrative medium</hi> to prove it; yet seems to
dislike our pretence to <hi>Demonstrations</hi> for the
Ground of our Faith. Not to note the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy
of this carriage, I shall yeild him the
honour of professing he has <hi>no</hi> Demonstration
but onely <hi>Probability</hi> for the Ground of <hi>his;</hi>
and to make this serious protestation for my self,
that I should esteem my self very dishonest did
I assert and press on others any Argument for
the Ground of my Faith which I judge not <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
that is, <hi>Demonstrative.</hi> This, I hope,
will secure the Honesty of my Intentions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my Weakness may permit me to fail in my
performance. After this he endeavours to
forestal my Reason for the Point in these words;
<hi>They have understandings of another mould from
others, who can conceive it Impossible that men
should not think themselves oblig'd to believe
and do all just as their Predecessours did.</hi> Which
words I desire the Reader to review and note,
for thence my Discourse takes its rise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:51890:117"/>
13. What is it then that we affirm the later
Ages <hi>oblig'd</hi> to hold and act as their Forefathers
held and acted? Wearing their clothes, or
building their houses? No; For, both, those
matters of their own nature are of trivial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
and the fashion of both depend on Fancy
which is too sleight a Principle to oblige to a
Constancy. What is it then? To manage their
Estates thus or thus; no, for the Inconvenience
or Convenience of the different wayes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
held not very material, and the judging
which was best depended upon Prudential Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which are of their own nature variable
and accommodable to circumstances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not obliging them to think and Act as their
Forefathers did. Let us proceed? Was it some
piece of Skill or a Speculative Opinion depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Goodness or Badness of the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
knowledge? No: For, experience teaching
that men differ in such Judgments and are erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it could never oblige posterity to believe
Unalterably as They did. Is it then some Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
passage or matter of Fact, of great note,
and as such apt to strike their Fancy strongly,
yet still such as the succeeding Age was not
highly concern'd whether it were true or no; for
example, that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquest of <hi>Asia</hi>
to the Asian and Grecian off-spring of the next
age after. No; Yet Experience tells us the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of this is fresh and lively (even amongst Us
who are not the immediate descendents of those
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51890:118"/>
where he conquer'd) though some thousands of
years since.</p>
                     <p>14. Before we go any further, let's examin how
this History comes to obtain so firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken
a Beleef from the whole World to this
very day. And, first, he must be a very weak
Speculater that can think the universal and strong
Perswasion of this matter of Fact was caus'd by
Books, <hi>Curtius</hi> his History for Example; For,
since all Mankind knows naturally that Falshoods
may as easily be charactered in Letters as Truths;
'tis evidently the continu'd Beleef of the <hi>Thing</hi>
or <hi>Sence</hi> in mens hearts of it's Truth, that is <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tradition,</hi> which gives that Book all its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and secures its strange Contents from
being held Romanical; which the very <hi>being-writ</hi>
could never have done. Let's see next
whence this Human Tradition had its force to
continue hitherto so settled and unalterable a
Persuasion of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Conquests. And, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Thing for Proper Causes, that is, the
best <hi>demonstrative mediums,</hi> we shall find the
Object it self was very Universall, strange, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
and held of concern to the then livers;
which made their Hearts and Fancies full of it,
and so oblig'd them to burst out into Expressions
of it, and relate it to their Off-spring of the next
Age. I but, what <hi>oblig'd</hi> the Off-spring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
their Forefathers telling it, and to act (or
talk of it again to <hi>their</hi> Children) as the Fathers
did; without which obligation it could not have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51890:118"/>
descended to us. Regarding once more the
Thing, we shall discover that it was imprinted
into the Off-spring by the Forefathers <hi>Testifying</hi>
what their senses had told them; which put,
Common Sense inform'd them the thing was
Infallibly-true, and as Certain as if they had seen
it with their own eyes. For, no reach of Reason
but onely Extravagance of Madness could have
furnish't them with any imaginable motive, why
the whole world should conspire to deceive
them, or be decievable in their Sensations. By
this means the Conceit of the Thing or matter
of Fact (as to the <hi>main,</hi> for circumstantial Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
were not so evident to all at first, and
so could not be universally deliver'd as ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by Sence) was in the same degree of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Certainty rivetted into the Hearts of
next Age; and, so, there being necessarily in the
Rational part of the World some curious persons,
whom Nature her self could not but incline to
an Inquisitiveness of what was done formerly,
and others too naturally inclin'd to tell it Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
who were capable of it and delighted with
hearing such strange-true Stories; It went
down continuing by the way of Tradition to our
very dayes.</p>
                     <p>15. But we have over-shot our mark. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is of the Obligation not to believe contrary
to Forefathers from Age to Age. And, tis already
evident, that the second Age after <hi>Alexander</hi>
was oblig'd to beleeve the First, because They
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51890:119"/>
saw with their eyes what was done; But how
could those in the Third Age be <hi>oblig'd</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Second who saw it not? To answer
this, we must ask whether the third Age could be
Certain that the second could not be deceiv'd
in what the first Age told them (and the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Thing, being no speculation but
a plain matter of Fact, secures that:) or conspire to
bely the second Ages Authority; and, common
reason satisfying them, by the circumstances, of
the honesty of the persons, their Consent and the
disinteressedness of the position, that they could
not thus conspire, even the rudest have a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
the second Age truly testifi'd what the
First said; and so those of the third Age have
the first Ages Authority certainly apply'd to
them; and, by means of its Authority, its Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
too, and perfect knowledge of the Thing
springing from that Experimential Perception;
which therefore must needs work the same Effect
upon the third Age, as it did upon the second.
And by virtue of the same Argument upon the
the fourth, fifth, and five hundredth, while it is
known to have come down by the way of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and this is known by its being receiv'd
in the five-hundredth Age <hi>as testify'd;</hi> For, if
the second Age could not tell the third it was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify'd
by the first unless it had been so testify'd,
the same reason I have assign'd for the Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of that will hold for each Age to the End
of the world, that is, 'twill follow no Age could
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51890:119"/>
say a former Age testifyd so, unless they did so;
whence nothing can come in <hi>as Testify'd</hi> by a
former Age, unless thus Testifyd. If therefore
the five-hundredth Age receiv'd a thing as testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
(supposing the notoreity of it secur'd the
thing from mistakableness) it follow'd, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
it <hi>was</hi> testify'd; and, (to come close
to our purpose) that the descendents in each
age, to the very end of the world, had the same
Obligation to believe their immediate Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
saying it was testify'd by the former, as
those of the third Age to believe the second, or
the second the first.</p>
                     <p>16. Who ever looks into Rational Nature, with
even that ordinary Knowledge with which the
rudest person almost that lives does upon <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
natures,</hi> would discern the same Necessity
or Obligation of continuing down by the way of
Testifying notorious and Important matters of
Fact, fixt at first in the minds and fancies of an
Universality by the Existence of the Thing
working on their Senses, as that in a long chain
of Iron, one link drawn should draw all the rest;
or, that the turning the First wheel, should move
a thousand distant ones depending on its motion.
Nor doubt I but it will be made full as Evident,
when rational Souls come to set themselves to
reflect seriously on their own nature and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to Action; a speculation few Protestants
are acquainted with; Bookishness and much
reading being onely in Vogue with the talking
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51890:120"/>
Tribe amongst them. In the mean time Mr.
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi> may see in the Instance now put,
that is, in the strong Persuasion of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Victories yet continuing by Tradition, that there
is an Obligation in one Age to believe another
when they proceed as Witnesses; and this, not
onely of what they saw, but of what others told
them <hi>They</hi> saw, and of what some affirm'd they
were told by others that the Age before
Them saw; and so downwards; and that, as the
Impulsive force is communicated from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
hand to the farthest-distant-wheel by the
Application of the intermediate ones, the solid or
Inflexible nature of the matter obliging the next
wheel to propagate its motion; So the <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi>
of the Thing mov'd the First Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Percievers of it; and That solid Notion,
which fixes every Truth, was the virtue which
run thorough and gave force to all the rest;
being apply'd by Universal Witnessing a plain
matter of Fact (or others Testimonies) from
each Age to the other; as great a Ty to Assent
as Human Nature was capable of by natural
means. For, that <hi>Existence</hi> of the Thing was the
virtue which made this Persuasion so solid and
firm, besides what's said, is seen by this; that,
were it deliver'd onely as an Opinion of the
Things being so, its strong conveyance had not
been able to elevate it beyond Opinion; for,
the stronger That had been, the more perfectly
it had been held Opinion still. The Existence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51890:120"/>
then of the Thing had virtue to <hi>oblige</hi> to a full
persuasion the thing <hi>was so,</hi> when <hi>Apply'd</hi> with
Certainty; The Testification of the precedent
Age is a Certain Applier of it, and Undoubtable,
that is <hi>Obliging to Belief;</hi> therefore the next Age
is (in such matters convey'd down this way) as
strongly <hi>oblig'd to believe</hi> the foregoing as Reason
can oblige it; that is, by seen <hi>Effects</hi> impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>be</hi> without the Existence of foregoing
Testifications, nor they, finally, without the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the <hi>Thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. I expect now what Mr <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> will reply
to this discourse. Will he say there were no
Causes layd to <hi>oblige</hi> the After-comers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Fore-goer, that <hi>Alexander</hi> conquer'd
<hi>Asia,</hi> but that it happen'd so by Chance? What
will he say then to thousand other such matters
of Fact, and indeed all that were done long ago;
all which must either be held obligingly this
way or none; (see <hi>Cowll.</hi> 24.) Besides, the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
proper to work on a <hi>rationall Nature</hi> are
Reasons: To say then there are no Causes able
to make us believe <hi>Alexander</hi> thus conquer'd, is
to say there is no Reason for it; and (Chance
being nothing but a Cause unforeseen by us) to
say all believe it by Chance, signifies <hi>none</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
any reason why they believe it; which makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
the world Asses; Or have I not hit on the right
Causes? I shall thank Mr <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to help
me out; and in the mean time assure him
that whatever Causes he assignes, obliging po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterity,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51890:121"/>
to believe Ancestours in this, shall
strengthen Tradition. Perhaps he will say, they
may be oblig'd to believe such <hi>Histories</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
yet not deliver'd <hi>Points of Faith.</hi> I shall
wonder at the position; but, because I foresee
he is like to recurr to this (for he must be forc't
to say either this or what's worse) I shall prepare
against it, by parallelling the Obligation to
believe this deliver'd History to the Obligation
to believe Christian Faith deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>18. To do this more amply we will consider
Christ's Doctrin according to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of Circumstances exprest in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Verse,
<q>Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo,
quando.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quis?</hi> Who was the Authour and Subject
of this Faith thus to be deliver'd; Not a poor
mortal, but the Wisdome of the Eternal Father;
not an ambitious self-extolling Man, but a self-humbled
God, come down from his Heaven to
be the World's Saviour and Master; every of
whose Words and Actions were infinitely to be
admir'd; and, consequently, requiring to be had
in perpetual remembrance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quid?</hi> What thing was it which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
or Testify'd? A Doctrin containing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the new Life they were to lead as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and so Practical, notwithstanding the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51890:121"/>
Majesty of its abstruseness; a Doctrin Conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and sutable to Reason, Man's true Nature,
and so apt to sink into him &amp; not be easily relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishable;
A Doctrin which bears in its very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be a Guid towards Eternal Bliss, and
consequently that to forsake it is the way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
misery, which therefore oblig'd Fathers to
teach it, and Children to esteem themselves
bound to learn it and hold to it. Lastly, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
all made up of most astonishing miracle and
wonder; and, so, apt to strike a deep sence of
reverence into hearts already imbu'd with it.
Such was the nature of the Thing we call Christ's
Doctrin, imprinted on the Sensarions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
Age of Christians; not a pittifull story of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
or <hi>Caesar;</hi> of Sleight concern, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p>19. <hi>Vbi?</hi> When was this matter of Fact or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this doctrin performed? In all, even the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
parts of the world, and not onely in a peece
of <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>Asia;</hi> and this openly: Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>Rome</hi> the world's <hi>Metropolis,</hi> whence it
could easily and effectually spread into the rest.
Nay in the very face of Tyrants; which things
gave it a perfect Visibility; and, lastly, in every
private Family it was taught and put in practice;
which made it beyond dispute Sensible and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
as far as it conduces to Christian Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:51890:122"/>
                        <hi>Quibus auxiliis?</hi> By what helps or means? By
most stupendious miracles, powerful preaching
and heavenly Living conformably to those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
which made those Principles or <hi>Faith</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and evident. Not by three or four Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
imputable perhaps to Chance; at least in
which nothing Divine discovered it self engaged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cur?</hi> Why was this doctrin of Christs taught
and practic't? not to satisfy the vain humour of
impotent Ambition, but to deliver mankind from
the Devils slavery and-hell fire its reward, and
to bring him to everlasting Salvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quomodo?</hi> By what manner? By writing it in
the fleshy Tables of the hearts of the First Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and, afterwards, continuing it by the way
of <hi>Testifying;</hi> the most connatural way to oblige
the Generality to Beleef of matters of Fact, that
Nature knows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quando? When?</hi> In the First Christians when
they were now at Age to judge of the miracles,
and multitudes of Motives spoken of; which
aw'd, overpower'd and subdu'd their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
to a firm Beleef and an high Reverence to
the doctrin thus attested to be Gods: In the after-Christians
when they were yet scarce able to speak
much less to judge; and taught by nature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Parents. Hence a lively and reverential
conceit was bred in their Hearts, by others seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
teaching and their own practising, of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credness
and consequently Unalterableness, of
that doctrin; ere they came to that Ripeness as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51890:122"/>
to use their own Judgment; Nay, that doctrin
was so deeply naturaliz'd into them by Christian
Life ere they came to maturity of Understanding
that it became Unnatural and exceedingly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for them to act and beleeve contrary to what
Fathers had taught. Whereas the story of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
was not proper to be told Children till
they were at Age and fit for some kind of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lership;
and then, it was so little practical that
nothing was to be acted about it, but talking of
it again; so that it lookt like a meer piece of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
and totally unconcerning them. I add,
that this delivery by attestation or teaching went
on linking the former Age to the later, by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
it into new Subjects, not all at one time,
but from year to year, moneth to moneth, and
even less; according as the Understandings and
even Bodies of Children budded into a Capacity
of knowing saying or doing something which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to Christianity; which still-continu'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweaving
the former Age with the later, after
a wonderful manner strengthens the sway of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and secures it both against Mistake and
Deceit; neither of them having any possible place
where the whole business is carry'd on by such
immediate Steps.</p>

thus. If the conceited Sacredness, Concern,
Necessity, Unalterableness, miraculously-attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51890:123"/>
also if the Visibleness, Practicalness with
extent to every particular, connaturalness &amp;c.
found in the notion and nature of Christs doctrin
or manifestly connected with it, render'd it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
recommendable in every respect
above the Story of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests, and
that plainest nature or Common Sense and daily
Experience teaches us that, by how much more a
thing is recommendable or deserving to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd
and practic't, by so much more 'tis obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to be believ'd and practic't; and that we
find in unconcerning Stories a continu'd Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
layd in Nature for the Children to believe
Parents (else such stories could never have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
with an hearty perswasion of their Truth
hitherto) it follows that incomparably and in a
manner infinitely greater must the Obligation be
to believe Christ's Doctrin than <hi>Alexander</hi>'s or
<hi>William</hi> the Conquerors Victories; or any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the like nature whatever.</p>
                     <p>21. I have been much longer in such a point
than the matter requir'd; it needed no more
but to manifest that Common Sense tells us Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
obliges every man to believe those he takes
to be <hi>honest;</hi> much more children Fathers: (or
the next Age those of the former;) still more, if
what they tell them be no Speculation depending
on Fancy or private Judgment, but matter of
Fact depending onely on Sense; that is, if they
tell it them as <hi>Witnesses:</hi> But most of all, if they
see we conspire in the same; For then the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51890:123"/>
is so necessary, that I cannot conceive
that from the beginning of the world there was
ever found one single person so unreasonable as
not to yeild to it. Whence also we can show eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first Beginner of an Heresie is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or
<hi>self-condemn'd;</hi> that is, conscious to himself that
out of Pride or some Passion he goes against Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Authority. Now, in Tradition all is
carry'd on this manner. So that, if the Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Tradition have not made provision for this
point, 'tis because they thought there could not
be found a Considerer so unreasonable as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it. Yet, because Mr <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> puts the
whole stress of his Objection against. Tradition
in this, I shall (to give him further satisfaction)
consider it practically.</p>
                     <p>22. Let us conceive then that the Apostles, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Apostolical men, taught the first Age
Christ's Doctrin (qualifi'd in the manner before
declar'd) and recommended it as such (that is as
Sacred, Unalterable, the way to Bliss. Taught by
Christ <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by Miracles and other Supernatural
means; 'tis plain They had Obligation to believe
Christ taught it. Well, they receiving it as such,
that is, as Christ's, and, so, Unalterable; were
bound to recommend it for such to the next Age.
Nor does Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> question this: But,
were their Children oblig'd to believe them?
While they were young tis plain they could do no
other neither out of Reason nor Passion. But what
were they oblig'd to when they were grown up to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51890:124"/>
ripeness of Judgement? 'Tis plain, that, were
that Doctrin deliver'd as an Invention of then
Forefathers, or some Collection of their Reason
that it was Christ's, it was obvious for them to
make this Discourse; We have natural Wit as
well as our Parents had, and perhaps as good
Circumstances to apply that wit, and why then
should not we cast about and consider whether
that be indeed Christ's Doctrin, and taught by
the Apostles, which they would persuade us is so?
But, in case it were deliver'd as ascertain'd by
their Senses, to have been taught by the Apostles,
what imaginable reason can they have of doubt?
Can they think all their Fathers and Neighbours
a pack of impudent Knaves, that conspire to abuse
their posterity purposely to damn them, or that
they could be mistaken in a Doctrin they were so
highly concern'd to learn right, and had led their
lives by ever since they were Christian? The
third Age succeeds, whose Immediate Ancestours
the Second Age told them they had been taught
and brought up thus by the First. Nor have they
more reason to doubt the Second Ages Attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the First Ages Doctrin and Life (it being an
unmistakable matter of Fact) than the Second
had the First's; that is, they were <hi>oblig'd</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. And, since each foregoing Ages Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
is a plain matter of Fact, it follows that
each succeeding Age has still equal obligation to
believe the foregoing: Especially in a matter car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
along with it such powerful Recommends,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51890:124"/>
and this out of its very Nature, as that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
and holding to it would bring them Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
Goods, and the altering it Infinit Harms. Thus
it goes on; and while it goes on thus, that is,
while this Rule is follow'd, 'tis self-evident no
Heresie could ever be. (Disc. 5. § 8.) Whence
by the way, if this be the onely difficulty in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
(that is, in case the next Age were <hi>oblig'd</hi>
to believe the former, Tradition would still be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
and so it would be self-evident no Heretick
could be) then it needs no proof they have such an
<hi>Obligation;</hi> for 'tis questionless there is an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
for men not to be Hereticks.</p>
                     <p>23. Well, but an acute Wit or great Scholar ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
who begins to question this way. Let's see if
he have a good reason, if not he is still <hi>oblig'd.</hi>
Can he bring an ampler or Certainer living Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for the contrary? Where shall he have it?
For all the Christian world is against him, if he
be the first (and so onely) denier of this way of
Tradition. Will he bring Demonstration against
the Point? How can he against a Truth; for our
case puts the point truly deliver'd, and onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
into the obligation of believing Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
in such a Delivery; and he must not hope
a <hi>seeming</hi> Demonstration can free him from his
Obligation of believing Ancestours. For, whence
hapned it that it <hi>seem'd</hi> so to him when it was
not such? From Perfection in Science in that
particular? No surely; for then he had not
miscarry'd: From the Imperfectness of his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51890:125"/>
Then he ought the more to have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd:</hi>
From Precipitancy? Then he ought not
have been passionate. But, perhaps he will build
on Dead Testimony, or some Book granted to be
Sacred. In that case I ask, how knows he with
such a Certainty as to build Faith and his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the whole Church upon it (which ought be
no less than a Demonstration) that he has the
right Letter and Sence of that Book. Can he
Demonstrate the exact conformity of its Letter
from Copy to Copy, and Translation to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
and this up to the very Original? He may
as well measure the back-side of Heaven. Will
he recur to Traditions help? Tradition could
onely perform this either by the way of diligent
Examiners continu'd along and securely testifi'd,
which (as was said) is impossible to show; Or
by continu'd Sence in Christian Hearts, and then
'tis plain if their Sence preserv'd the Letter right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
significative, he ought to take the Sence of the
Letter from them too, as the Fathers use to press
upon ancient Hereticks. 'Tis left then that he
must pretend he will demonstrate some former
Age has err'd; How I wonder? We have exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him Scripture, the nature of the Points, and
Authority of living men. It may be he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Testimonies of Historians, or Fathers. But,
first, <hi>Fathers,</hi> taken as such, are not meerly great
Scholars, but Eminent Parts of <hi>Ecclesia docens</hi>
or Witnessers of the Doctrin <hi>deliver'd;</hi> Take
away then the Certainty of <hi>Delivery</hi> or Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51890:125"/>
there's no Certainty of Doctrin <hi>deliver'd,</hi>
nor consequently of <hi>Fathers.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> An Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Testimony signifies but his own private saying,
unless authoriz'd by Sence writ in mens hearts
or <hi>Tradition.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> Are those Testimonies (and
the like may be said of Scripture-proofs) evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
against the present Church, or no? If
not, 'tis a madness to talk of <hi>seeming</hi> Testimonies
against so vast and evident a one as that of the
whole foregoing Church. If <hi>Evident,</hi> 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with mans Nature the Christian
Church should recommend down for true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and creditable Historians those Authours
which so evidently oppose her Doctrin: Or, if so
great an Authority as the Churches delivers them
down for fabulous or spurious, how can their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
ever come to be undoubtable or Certain?
The last refuge then of a passion-misled Reason
is, asham'd of her want of Principles and loth to
show her head, to pretend private Inspirations:
which therefore is the last <hi>non ultra</hi> of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and the flower or most refin'd quitessence of
all Faith-Reformation. But, miracles failing these
poor Creatures to shew forth the hidden divinity
which they pretend possesses them, they quickly
fade away; or, if they make any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
'tis into phrenzy or perfect Madness, as we
experience in our most miserably-distracted
Country; which disposition is therefore the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put
mortuum,</hi> or <hi>Terra damnata</hi> of Heresie, and
the last and most natural effect of relinquishing
Tradition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:51890:126"/>
24. By this Discourse is seen that 'tis impossible
the following Age and every person in it, unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and learned, should not be <hi>oblig'd</hi> to believe
the foregoing delivering to them Christs Doctrin
as receiv'd from hand to hand by way of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
and that this Universal Obligation springs
out of the Nature of that Heavenly Doctrin, and
the Nature of the Way of conveying it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
'Tis time now to review M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Stillingfleets</hi>
words against the possibility of proving this by
Reason, and see how lank they look: They are
these, neither more nor fewer: <hi>It is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what Reason should inforce it but such as
proves the Impossibility of the contrary: And they
have Vnderstandings of another mould from others
who can conceive it impossible men should not
think themselves oblig'd to believe and do all just
as their Predecessors did.</hi> Is this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
who in the Appendix to his <hi>Irenicum</hi> § 6. so rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
characters those for <hi>more zealous than Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi>
discoursers who argue not out the <hi>very
Nature and Constitution</hi> of a Thing; and here, in
a discourse concerning the Rational way of
looking into a point, quite overleaps all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
either the Nature or necessary circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Thing, and talks so rawly in common,
that is, not one word to that particular purpose?
Observe the words, <hi>Oblig'd to believe and do
ALL IVST as their Predecessors have done.</hi>
What means the word ALL? Does he mean we
hold them oblig'd to cut their Beards, or wear
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51890:126"/>
such Garters and Hatbands as their Fore-fathers
did? His raw words reach no farther: What
means the word JUST? Does he think Faith
being planted in Human, that is <hi>Rational,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will not propagate it self into consequent
and subordinate Tenets and Practices? All the
wonder then of the Impossibility of the no-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
lies in his crafty and sophistical expressing
it, which includes a fallacy of <hi>non-causa pro causa;</hi>
for, not <hi>any thing</hi> convey'd down on <hi>any fashion</hi> is
held by us thus <hi>obliging</hi> to believe and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
but <hi>such</hi> a Doctrin, and <hi>so</hi> convey'd
as was before declared. Had he put our Position
thus, as indeed he ought, it being the true case,
<hi>Children or Immediate Posterity taught by Fathers
or immediate Ancestors relying on the way of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
that such a Doctrin was taught or deliverd

Had it been, I say, thus propos'd, there had been
no such cause of wonderment: But all these, that
is indeed all of weight in the point is quite left out.
Such poor shifts even the best Wits must be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to, when they would maintain a false Cause.</p>
                     <p>25. One word to M. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> He hath chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd
us to make out this <hi>Obligation to Belief</hi> as
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51890:127"/>
the <hi>onely</hi> Thing we are to prove in the Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way; he hath offer'd us the choice of our
Weapon, either <hi>Reason, particular Testimony,</hi> or
<hi>Vniversal Tradition:</hi> I have accepted his offer,
chosen my weapon, and given here the first blow;
I hope he will not now run the Field, but return
an Answer to my Discourse in the way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which I have chosen by his Offer. I am sorry
for his sake my reflexions here are not more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate,
being sent to the Press in loose quarters
of sheets as soon as writ, more time not being
allow'd me, nor I hope needful to answer such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.
Onely I request him when he replies, to
take along with him the nature of the <hi>subjecta
materia,</hi> the Doctrins and Practises we speak of;
the Nature of the Manner of delivering it, and
the necessary Circumstances which give weight
to both, as I have declar'd above; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
him (God assisting me) a very serious
Reply.</p>
                     <p>26. Ere I quite leave this matter, I desire to take
the Reader along with me in my quest for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or proper Cause why so judicious a person as
Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> could come to doubt of such an
Obligation in posterity to beleeve their Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in a matter of fact, or a matter deliver'd to
have been (not <hi>deem'd</hi> or <hi>thought,</hi> but) <hi>done;</hi>
or (which is equivalent being it's necessary effect)
<hi>seen</hi> or <hi>known by Sense.</hi> For, I make account
there is not a man in the world or ever was (such
is the Goodness of rational Nature given us by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51890:127"/>
God) who in his natural thoughts could ever
raise such a doubt, or think he could possibly
frame his thoughts to a disbelief of the contrary;
no more than any man in England (whom Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Scepticism has not besotted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann'd)
can doubt of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerors,
<hi>Harry</hi> the Eighths, or <hi>Mahomets</hi> Existence; much
less judge the contrary; And, it appears at first
sight to be a strange distorsion or rather destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
of human Nature, which can so alter it. Now,
looking into Things, I find it to be a proper and
natural Effect of the Protestant's temper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of all who have left the Church. For their
humour being to <hi>chuse</hi> every one his Faith by his
private Judgment or Wit working upon disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words; They wonder, and judge it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
their Posterity, thus imbu'd, should
<hi>be oblig'd to beleeve and act as Ancestours do; and</hi>
so should I too. For, while they can never deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to their Children as received ever, by the
way of Infallible Sense or Witnessing, but must
say the former Church <hi>de facto</hi> err'd and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that themselves might do so too, so that
they can only deliver it as depending or built on
their own fallible Opinion in interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(all which is imply'd in their making Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptur's
Letter the Rule of Faith, and allowing no
Living Interpreter able to give infallibly the
Sence of it) 'tis natural their posterity should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

hold themselves oblig'd to beleeve Immediate
Ancestors, but use their own Judgments and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51890:128"/>
                        <hi>chuse</hi> their own <hi>Faith</hi> when they come at Age
as well as They did; and Experience tells us
they have done so in England till they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
fairly. And this horrid Unreasonableness is
the venomous source, the First defective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or indeed the very nature of all <hi>Heresie;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
also in the very word, which signifies
<hi>Choice,</hi> or <hi>chusing one's Religion;</hi> mention'd by
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> (cited above p. 135.)
and counterpos'd by him to <hi>Tradition</hi> as also by
S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> (cited p. 133. 134.) where 'tis
most excellently describ'd, and homely apply'd
to the Protestants and such others, as the Reader
may see. I am a bad Transcriber.</p>
                     <p>27. I have done my main task, and so shall only
touch at his next paragraph. It begins thus; <hi>It is to
no purpose to prove the Impossibility of motion when
I see men move, no more it is to prove no Age of the
Church could vary from the foregoing when we can
evidently prove they have done it.</hi> You argue well.
But two things are requir'd ere you can <hi>see</hi> our
Faith varies from the former. First, To <hi>see</hi>
what our Church holds <hi>now,</hi> and then <hi>to see</hi>
what the former Church held before; and if I
see any thing you see neither well. For, while
you cannot distinguish between <hi>Faith</hi> and its
<hi>Explication,</hi> some School-men and Church,
I have no hopes you should see candidly what
our Church holds <hi>now:</hi> and, if you cannot at
present see what our Church holds <hi>now,</hi> how
and by what method will you assure us you see
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51890:128"/>
what She held <hi>formerly?</hi> The thing to be prov'd
is a plain matter of Fact, and you have renounc't
all living Attestation the common and secure
way to bring it down; and consequently Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
too; For Fathers (speaking of them as
such) being Evident Witnessers, Transmitters or
Propagates of the <hi>Faith received</hi> to Immediate
Posterity, if you question <hi>Delivery</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi>
(which you do while you doubt Obligation in
Posterity to believe Ancestours) you question
whether there be any <hi>Doctrin deliver'd</hi> and so
any <hi>Fathers:</hi> and I wonder how you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
any man oblig'd to believe Fathers, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
or any that writ or testify'd things long
ago, and yet think the next age not oblig'd to
believe the former in a matter of Fact done in
their own dayes. How far short then are your
Evidences of the former Churches Doctrin, like
to prove of being parallell to our <hi>seeing a man
move with</hi> our corporeal <hi>Eyes!</hi> But you <hi>may</hi> say
any thing; or rather indeed, forc't by your bad
Cause, you <hi>must</hi> do so.</p>
                     <p>28. You call this Way of ours a <hi>Superficial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty;</hi>
I beseech you consider what you say; Is
that which is wholly builds on the Nature of the
Things (as you see ours does) <hi>Superficial;</hi> or
Yours which is meerly an aiery Descant upon
<hi>dead Words?</hi> What do you think <hi>Controversy</hi>
is? I deal plainly with you, you may take it to
be an Art of Talking, and I think you do so
though you will not profess it; but I take it to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51890:129"/>
be a noble Science; I hold its Object to be <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
reddere fidei,</hi> or to maintain <hi>question'd
Faith,</hi> which is chiefly done by showing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on which Faith depends <hi>quoad nos</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Hence, all other Authority depending on
Tradition's, I hold Knowledge of its Certainty
the First Principle in <hi>Controversy;</hi> And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>quoad nos</hi> necessarily antecedent to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it can onely be manifested by Reasons taken
from Things or men's Minds, <hi>naturally;</hi> and (if
we discourse against those who grant the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the first-preached Doctrin) <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
affected or qualify'd; as he sees I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
in my Discourses.</p>
                     <p>29. So much for our Way. Now for yours: Who
sees not first how <hi>Words as interpretable</hi> are its
<hi>subject;</hi> and if in the method you take to work
upon them you lay one Principle which deserves
the name of a Principle, I dare undertake to be
of Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s persuasion. He sees in my
TRANSITION our Way laid open; Either let
him acknowledge it solid, or remember, having
provok't us, he is challeng'd to produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his Rule of Faith, which begins with
the natures of the Things in hand, that is of
<hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and approves it self solider
than ours. But 'tis so impossible their Cause
can endure the Trial of that <hi>clearing</hi> Method,
that I fear not either Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> or any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Writer of the least prudence will dare to
attempt it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="tcp:51890:129"/>
30. Will you see one Example of our Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness
and Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Solidness? He gives
you both in his next words, p. 620. and assures
the Reader we would prove <hi>no alteration in the
Faith of the Church</hi> by such an Argument as
would prove the world <hi>ab aeterno.</hi> How strangely
wide he roves from the mark? Our Argument
runs thus, beginning <hi>à priori;</hi> Causes were laid
in the nature of Christs heavenly Doctrin, and the
nature of its Conveyance down by Testifying to
make its Delivery continu'd hitherto; <hi>à posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi>
thus; we find a present Effect (the present
Persuasion of Christians their Faith descended
uninterruptedly from Christ) impossible to be
without such a Cause's Existence or its having
been at first taught by Christ; whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that Faith came from Christ: Let us paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
it then to his. Finds he any such Effect in the
world at present apt to spring onely from the
Worlds Eternity as its Cause; or Causes laid <hi>ab
aeterno</hi> in the nature of the world apt to continue
it hitherto? If he does, he must hold it was Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
If not, how unconsonant is his parallel? He
makes our Argument run thus; <hi>The present Age
sees no alteration in it, and they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in what their Forefathers believ'd, nor they
in theirs, and so on</hi> in infinitum; <hi>for no men did
ever see the World made, and therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made, and so Eternal.</hi> In return, I must first
profess there is not a tittle in it parallel to our
<hi>medium;</hi> and, at next, that I never saw in my
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51890:130"/>
life more absurdities coucht in so few words.
For,</p>
                     <p>First, he should have begun, the present Age
has a firm perswasion it was ever, or have alledg'd
some other Effect, without which 'tis impossible
to argue to the Existence of a thing before, or a
Cause.</p>
                     <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> He wrongly supposes a Belief in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Age of the Worlds ever-Existence, saying,
<hi>They could not be deceiv'd in what their Forefathers
believ'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> The words, <hi>Nor they in theirs,</hi> falsely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Continuance of belief upwards of the
worlds Eternity.</p>
                     <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> He sayes not whether this Belief was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on Ey-sight at first, or Opinion. If the later,
'tis contrary, and not parallel to our case. If
the former, then he must suppose some man saw
the world made <hi>ab aeterno.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> The words, <hi>and so on</hi> in Infinitum, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this belief did go on <hi>in Infinitum;</hi> which
put, 'tis beyond question, and plac't in the very
Terms, that the world <hi>was</hi> Eternal.</p>
                     <p>7<hi rend="sup">ly,</hi> His reason for the last words, thus, <hi>For no
man did ever see the World made,</hi> is manifoldly
faulty: for 'tis a negative argument, and, as such,
inconsequent; since the world might have been
made, whether any had seen it or not. Again, the
first men might have known it certainly to have
been made, whether they had seen it <hi>making</hi> or
no. And lastly, 'tis directly contradictory to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51890:130"/>
what it should parallel; For, we agreeing with
them that Christ and his Apostles did teach a
Doctrin thus qualify'd, first put its Existence <hi>seen,</hi>
and thence conclude the contrary could never
come to be held universally; or else, we take a
present-Belief of its then-Existence as ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by Testifying: neither of which have
any correspondence with his rambling chimerical
Argument; no two pieces of which hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with themselves or any thing else.</p>
                     <p>31. He sayes, he can <hi>evidence</hi> the Alteration of
Faith. I wish he would tell us first what an
<hi>evidence</hi> means; whether a strong <hi>Fancy</hi> of his
own, or a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> onely which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him or not believing the former Age Attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His first proof is, <hi>Because the Scripture
supposes a degeneracy in the Christian Church:</hi>
Incomparably argu'd! why see we not the place!
Does it <hi>evidently</hi> speak of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners;</hi>
the <hi>universal</hi> Church, or <hi>particular</hi> persons;
that is, some Hereticks? But be it in Faith; Be
it Universal. Does it suppose this Degeneracy
<hi>already past</hi> (which is onely proper to your
purpose) or <hi>yet to come?</hi> That is, does it say
there must be a Total Apostasie in Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Year 1664? Alas, he had forgot this:
Yet for such wretched proofs as these, baptiz'd
<hi>God's Word,</hi> have they left the evidently-attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrin and the Union of the former Church.
His next <hi>Evidences</hi> are his own Performances in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51890:131"/>
some other parts of his Book. Truly the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serableness
of these <hi>Evidences</hi> disinvite me from
thinking the other worth a serious thought: But,
if perhaps there be ever a Testimony among
them that is not coincident with some of Dr.
<hi>Pierce</hi>'s faulty ones; Let him single it out and
Print it at the End of his Rejoynder to this,
it shall have a fair Answer from me, or some
other more proper.</p>
