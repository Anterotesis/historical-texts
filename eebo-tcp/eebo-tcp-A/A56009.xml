            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church yard Wall did break or fall down this laſt Winter, ſome there were that did prognoſticate the coming of the Plague, ſaying, <hi>It fell in like manner the laſt great Sickneſs</hi> in 1625. but what reaſon they had to ſay ſo, is beſt known to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet true it is, that this black and diſmal Cloud was fore-ſeen and predicted by that great <hi>Artiſt</hi> in <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> Mr. <hi>John Gadbury,</hi> in his <hi>Ephemeris</hi> for the preſent year 1665. in the Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> at which time the Sickneſs firſt began to ſhew it ſelf viſible; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it took its Riſe at Chriſtmas, he himſelf being viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time.</p>
            <p>And though the Plague cometh unawares, and frizeth upon a man on a ſuddain, yet ſuch is the infinite mercy of God, and the providence of Nature, that it giveth alwayes warning enough to any one that will diligently obſerve it.</p>
            <p>The warnings are either a ſuddain Head-ache, a Vomiting, or a Faintneſs, with a Chilneſſe, or a Looſeneſſe. Each of theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome ſhe<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And <hi>Chriſtoph. a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega</hi> tells of one that was ſtrangled with a Rope, and did foam about the Mouth, and yet was recovered by drinking Vinegar.</p>

together) to have kept it back, it had beyond all queſtion broke forth then. Nay, and break forth it did then too, as the Learned Artiſt in <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> can experimentally teſtifie, having been perſonally viſited with it at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> that year. And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patients of Mr. <hi>Joſias Weſtwood</hi> the Chirurgeon, were then alſo afflicted with the ſame Diſtemper, and yet obtained cure againſt it, the <hi>Air</hi> being then ſo friendly to <hi>Nature,</hi> and an <hi>Enemy</hi> unto the <hi>Peſtilence.</hi> But now let us conſider its progreſs and increaſe, with the cauſes thereof, and the poſſibility of its abatement, with the time when. In this matter I ſhall conſult, but not trouble you with the Figure of the <hi>Suns</hi> Ingreſs into the Equinoctial Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> for the year 1665. and thence draw down the ſeveral Arguments of <hi>encreaſe</hi> and <hi>abatement</hi>; and becauſe the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> was hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible untill the Month of <hi>June,</hi> I will begin there.</p>
            <p>This Month, (as if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> had appointed the Sickneſs to be <hi>Ominous</hi> in earneſt to theſe Nations) we may obſerve two moſt fatal <hi>tranſits</hi> to uſher it in, <hi>viz. Mars</hi> his then coming to the oppoſite point of the Aſcendant, and the <hi>Sun</hi> to the oppoſite point of <hi>Saturn</hi>; a beginning of a ſickneſs ſo miſchievous, that greater can hardly be; God grant the <hi>end</hi> be not as <hi>inauſpicious:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (I preſume it will not be of many Months continuance to this great City, yet we are not to ſuppoſe a <hi>Peſtilence</hi> ended, when it ſeemingly acquits one place.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of <hi>July</hi> it began to encreaſe conſiderably, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially toward the latter end thereof: there were then fix oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Erratick Stars,</hi> and two <hi>Eclipſes</hi>; and to add to theſe, <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> then came to the Quadrate place of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and to the oppoſite point of <hi>Saturn</hi> by tranſit; and the <hi>Sun</hi> then came to the oppoſition of <hi>Jupiter</hi> both by tranſit and aſpect: all which were very great arguments of its encreaſe.</p>
