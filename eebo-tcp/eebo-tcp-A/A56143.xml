         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

1 Corinthians 14. 40.</head>
            <head type="sub">Let all things be done decently and
in Order.</head>
            <p>ALL (I conceive) that this place, 1 <hi>Corinthians 14.
40. Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> holdeth
forth touching the point of Decency and Order,
may be summed up in these particulars.</p>
            <p>First, That the whole Church and every Member
thereof are to perform all the duties of Gods worship in
a decent and orderly manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What the Church and Members thereof
are to do in this kind; That the Church-Governours
may and ought to see it done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it being the duty of Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to see that all things in the <hi>Congregation be done</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
and orderly; It is therefore their part in eminent
measure to be able to discern and judge what is decent and
undecent, what is orderly and disorderly.</p>
            <p>Now, when I say, it is their part, I mean, it is their duty;
Their place and authority requireth it, nor that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have a power &amp; Spirit, of discerning to judge aright
in this Case; For, it seemeth, the High-Priest with the
rest of his Brethren and Prophtes, yea and <hi>David</hi> himself,
all of them thought it decent to bring back the Ark of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35517:3"/>
Lord upon a New Cart, which afterward <hi>David</hi> himself
saw and confessed it, was not done after due order, <hi>1. Chron.
15. 13.</hi> From whence it appeareth (since they also are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to errours in this kind) that it will not be safe for
them to judge and declare the decency of things by no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a rule than their own wisedom, judgement and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
But even they also, as well as the people, must be
guided by such rules as the Holy Ghost direct thus unto
in this Case, which are the holy and infallible<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 16. 19. Isay. 8. 20. Luke 16. 29.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and with Scripture, Nature and Civil-Customes;
Yea and I willingly also admit the lawfull Custom of the
Church or Congregation in which a man liveth: For to
judge of decency by all these Rules we have warrant in
Scripture, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33, 34. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14 &amp; 16.</p>
            <p>And indeed, they who are to <hi>approve themselves</hi> in all
their proceedings, (as<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2. When Peter and Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obey our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, they commanded to obey the Bishops in the Doctrine of Christ, not in their own. Tyndals An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Mr. Mores first Book, p. 286.</note> 
               <hi>Paul did</hi>) and as all Church-Masters
ought to do, <hi>to every Mans conscience in the sight of
God,</hi> ought to be seriously guideo by these patterns.</p>
            <p>It is not fit for them (I say) to give for the ground
of their proceeding, their own wisedome and pleasure, but
it behooves them to justifie their doings therein from such
rules, as every good Conscience may see approveable, 2
<hi>Cor. 1. 12. 13. c.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, this place in hand holdeth forth
also farther this truth, that whatsoever thing the Church
seeth by those former rules to be indifferent and decent, or
which Church-Governors shall by these rules declare so to
be, those things may and ought lawfully to be done.</p>
            <p>For farther clearing whereof, and the better describing
of the power of Church-Governours in these matters; It
may be observed, that of decent things lawfull to be done in
Gods Church, some are; 1. <hi>Indifferent and decent only;</hi> As to
preach in a Gown or a Cloak, whereof the one is no more
necessary or expedient than the other. <hi rend="margQuotes">But now they are
become Laudable Ceremonies, whereas before they were
but Ceremonies alone. Now are they become necessary
Rites, godly Institutions, seemly Ordinances, when as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35517:3"/>
they had no such names, and he that disobeyeth</hi> them
shall not <hi>only be judged a</hi> Schismatick, <hi>or Felon,</hi> but also
<hi>condemned</hi> as <hi>a Traytor against the King,</hi> as <hi>Iohn Bale</hi> Bp. of
<hi>Ossery</hi> writes in his <hi>Image of both Churches, on Apoc. 13. f. 108.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Decent and Expedient;</hi> As to abide in single life, or
to enter into mariage; of which though mariage
in time of persecution be indifferent, yet single life
is more expedient, to prevent the troubles of the
Flesh, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 26. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Necessary and decent,</hi> either alwayes; As for a Woman
to keep<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34. 15. 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12.</note> silence in the Church: Or at least <hi>Hic</hi> &amp;
<hi>Nune,</hi> in some places and at some times, so as the
neglect thereof would be uncomely and unexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
by light of
<list>
                  <item>1. Nature.</item>
                  <item>2. Scripture.</item>
                  <item>3. Custome.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As, a<note n="*" place="margin">1 cor. 11. 5, to 11.</note> Woman to be unvailed in the Congregation in
Eastern Countries; so, to<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 15. 29.</note> abstain from bloud, whilst the
eating of it was offensive to the Jewes.</p>
            <p>Now, for such things as are <hi>necessary and decent,</hi> Church-Governours
have power to give order and commandement
concerning them. As did the Synod at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> touching
those things, which they called <hi>Necessary,</hi> to wit, Necessary
during the time of the offence of the Jews; which was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be avoided, <hi>Acts 15. 28, 29. 1. Cor.</hi> 20. 32. Of such things
as are <hi>decent and expedient,</hi> Church-Governors also have
power to declare the Decency and Expediency of them, yea
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 8, 9. 12, 13, 14, 25, 26 &amp;c. cap. 11. 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> and to advise and perswade the practise of them; but not
to give an Order or Law to binde the people thereunto
farther than themselves shall find it expedient and decent
for themselves.</p>
            <p>Thus in point of abiding in Single-life, in time of the
Churches Distresse, the <hi>Apostle gives his advise and judgement:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35517:4"/>
1 Cor,</hi> 7. 25, 40. Yea and perswaded to it, for avoyding
trouble in the flesh, Vers. 26. and 28. but would <hi>not bind them
to it, neither in point of Conscience nor of outward practise, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no command for it from the Lord, V. 25.</hi> In which respect
he calleth such a commandement (if he had given it) <hi>a
Snare, V.</hi> 35.</p>
            <p>And herein the power of the Church-Governours falleth
short of the authoritie of Civill Majestrates, who <hi>may in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill-matters
make binding Laws for any thing expedient, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
weale, which subjects are readily to submit unto, 1 Pet.
2. 13. Tit. 3. 1. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 2. 5.</p>
            <p>But<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. Barnes his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that Mens Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions bind not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: p. 297. to 301.</note> Church-Governours have not the like power in
matters Ecclesiastical, to make binding Laws for any thing

joyned with expediencie.</p>
            <p>Against this it may be objected,<note place="margin">Objection.</note>

he might make a Law commanding the Church some
expedient decent things.</p>
            <p>It follows not;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> For first, its one thing to give a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
for once, and that in a particular case, as here;
another thing to make a Law to bind One alwayes to doe
the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is one thing to command a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in case only of a private wrong, who may owe himself
to a Church-Governour, as <hi>Philemon</hi> did to <hi>Paul:</hi> Another
thing to command, yea to give a standing command &amp; bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Law to a whole Church, in Worship or Ceremonies,
to whom he professeth himself only a <hi>Servant or Minister,
2 Cor.</hi> 4. 5. over whom he hath <hi>no authority,</hi> but only<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 14 Luke 12. 42. to 49. Tit. 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
or Economically,</hi> to wit, when he speaks in his Lords or
Masters name, not in his own. As the Steward in a family
hath not power over his Masters Spouse, but when he speaks
or shews his Masters command or directions,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> not his own.</p>
            <p>But, of such things as are only <hi>Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Decent,</hi> I
do not find in Scripture that ever Church Governours did
Lawfully advise and perswade them; Much lesse charge and
command them. And that this place in hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35517:4"/>
doth not give them any such power (though it be much
urged to this end) may appear from these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, the place speaketh not of Indifferent Decent things,
but of Necessary. Decent things only, the neglect wherof was
undecent, and disorderly, by the light of Nature, Scripture
Custom. <hi rend="margQuotes">As<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. to 18 c. 14. 2 to 38. 1 Tim. 2. 9, 10. 1 <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

as also for men to speak many of them at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the words of this place run not thus, Let all
decent things be done; Or, let all things judged or declared
by the Church-Governours to be decent, be done; but thus,
<hi>Let all things,</hi> (to wit, all Ecclesiastical matters; As all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God that are done in the Church, all the duties
of Gods worship; Whether Praying, Prophesying, Psalmes,
Sacraments, or the like) be <hi>done decently</hi> &amp; <hi>orderly, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and decent manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whether in that decent manner,</hi> which Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
do appoint, or in some other, that the Apostle limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not, but only requireth <hi>that all be done decently,</hi> which if
it be done (in any decent manner, gesture, warranted by
Scripture or Nature) his rule here prescribed is fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and followed.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, the same may appear out of this place by
this argument.</p>
            <p>If this Text of the Apostle did give power and authority
to Church Governours to command indifferent decent
things, then he that should transgresse the commandement
of the Church therein, should also transgresse the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the Apostle: As, look what Order or Acts of
Justice any civil Governour doth by vertue of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the King, He that violateth such Acts, or transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
such Orders, transgresseth also against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
and Commission of the King.</p>
            <p>But, it appeareth to be otherwise in this<note n="*" place="margin">See D. Barnes, That mens Constitutious bind not the Conscience p. 297. to 300.</note> case, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Church-Governours</hi> command a Minister to pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that shall now and then preach in a Cloak, transgresseth

the command of the Church; But not of the Apostle: For

            <p>Now, if so be it be done decently, then it is all that the
rule of the Apostle requireth in this point.</p>

verge of this Text, and so of Church-Governours Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a high encroachment upon their Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</p>
            <p>But, because this point is of great consequence both for
Church Governours and others to be truly informed in,
give me leave to clear the same from some other arguments;
To wit, <hi>That it is not in the power of Church-Governours to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
things meerly decent and indifferent in the worship of God by
Order of Law.</hi> That so Prelates &amp; Clergy men may be right
well assured, God never gave unto them authority to make
and establish so many Ceremonies and Traditions which be
contrary to the liberty of the Gospel, and are blocks in
Christen mens wayes, that they can neither know nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same his Gospel in liberty of Conscience, nor
attain a ready way to Heaven; as <hi>Iohn Purvey</hi> affirmed in <hi>his
Articles. Fox Acts and Monuments, p. 7. 11. 712.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then, that which exceeds the bounds of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
authority and straightneth the bounds of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35517:5"/>
is not in the power of any Church-Governour
to command.</p>
            <p>But to command indifferent decent things, by order of
Law, exceedeth the bounds of Apostolical authority, and
straightneth the bounds of Christian Liberty. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
The former of these, to witt, that to command indifferent
decent things exceedeth the bounds of Apostolical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
appeareth from the Commission granted to the Apostles,
which was the largest Commission that ever Christ gave to
any Church-Governours,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <p>This was the Argument of Joannes de Wesalia Abb: Uspergensis, Paraleipome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, p 419, to prove.</p>
                  <p>Quod praelati non habent autoritarem instituendi leges.</p>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mat. 28. 20.</hi> Where our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
giveth them Commission, <hi>to teach all Nations to observe
all things whatsoever he had commanded them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, all things whatsoever he hath commanded them
are Necessary, not indifferent for the people to observe: If
therefore the Apostles over and above the Commandements
of Christ, which are necessary, should teach the people to
observe indifferent things also, which Christ hath not
commanded, they shall exceed the bounds of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 23. c. 14. 37. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 6. 10.</p>
            <p>It will be in vain to object, that our Saviour here spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
only of matters of Doctrine and Faith, not of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Order: unlesse it could be proved, that our
Saviour else where did enlarge this Commission, and gave
them more unlimited power in matters of Government,
Order or Indifferency: Which for ought I can see no man
goes about to do, unles it be from this place of the <hi>Corinth.</hi>
which hath been already cleared (as I hope) from any
such meaning.</p>
            <p>As for the second or latter part of the Assumption, that
to command indifferent Decent things straightneth the
bounds of Christian Liberty, is of it self evident. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
(for Example,) <hi>a single man or woman are at Liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where they will, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 39. If the Apostle had bound them
from marriage by any command of his, though they had
received that Gift of Continency, yet he had then straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and deprived them of their Liberty in that particular,
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 3. 4. Col. 2. 20, 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35517:6"/>It is wont to be excepted against this,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> that Christian
Liberty stands not in the freedome of outward Actions,
but only in the fredome of Conscience.</p>
            <p>As long therefore as there is no Doctrinal necessity put
upon the Conscience to limit the lawfulness of the use of
outward things, Christian Liberty is preserved, though
the use and practise of outward things be limitted.</p>
            <p>Whereto I answer;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 1. That the Apostle in this case
leaveth the people of God at Liberty, not only in point of
Conscience for lawfulness to marry; But even in outward
Actions and Practise. <q>
                  <hi>Let him do</hi> (saith he) <hi>what he will;
he sinneth not, let him be marryed, Vers. 30. 38.</hi>
               </q> As who should
say, the Conscience being free from sin in it, I will put no
tye on the outward practise to restrain it.</p>
            <p>2. That true Christian Liberty, consisteth principally in
the free <hi>Actual use</hi> of <hi>things lawful and indifferent in themselves,</hi>
and the Prohibition or their free Actual use to Christians is
expresly censured as <hi>Anti-evangelical,</hi> a badge of false <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
of Apostlates from the faith, Hypocrites, men of seared
Conscienc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, <hi>Anti-christian Usurpers, 1 Tim. 4. 1. 3. 4 Now
the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the later times some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Doctrines
of divels; <hi>Speaking Lyes in Hypocrisy, having their,</hi>
               </hi> Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
seared with an hot Iron, <hi>forbidding to Marry,
and commanding to abstain from meats <hi>which God hath
Created</hi> to be received with Thanksgiving: <hi>For every
Creature of God is good,</hi> and nothing to be refused if it be
received with Thanksgiving; <hi>For it is sanctified by the
word of God and Prayer, Col. 2. 20, 21. Wherefore if ye be
dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the World; why as
though</hi>
               </hi> living <hi>in this World are ye Subject to Ordinances?</hi> (or
Canons) <hi>touch not, tast not, handle not</hi> (no not Gods
Ordinances, Sacraments, Creatures, but in such Vestiments,
Gestures, Postures) <hi>which all are to perish with the using; which
things have indeed <hi>a shew of Wisdome in will-woorship, and
Punishing of the Body,</hi>
               </hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5, 6 <hi>Have we not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Eat and to Drink? Have we not power <hi>to lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35517:6"/>
a Sister, Wife, as well as other Apostles, and as the Brethren
of the Lord and Cephas?</hi>
               </hi> compared with vers. 19. to 24. Rom.
14. 2, 3. <hi>For one believeth that he may Eat <hi>all things</hi> another who

of things indifferent) <hi>or why dost thou set at nought thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
We shall all stand before the Iudgement Seat of Christ?</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Let us not therefore <hi>iudge one another any more,</hi> but judge
this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in
his Brothers way, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, by any restraints, Canons, Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Censures, in or concerning things or ceremonies that
are but indifferent, and not absolutely necessary by Gods
prescription, or the nature of the things themselves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prohibit any Ministers of the Gospel who are able
and faithfull to preach the Word, or to excommunicate
or cast them, or any other consciencious Christians
out of the Church, or debar them from the Sacrament,
because they cannot wear a Surplice, kneel at the Lords
Table or Supper, or conform to every <hi>Punctilio</hi> in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
or Canons, and to deny them their Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the free use or forbearing of Ceremonies which are
only decent and indifferent, indirectly repugnant to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty, the Gospel of Christ, and to <hi>Acts 4 18, 19,
20, Ch. 5. 27, 28, 29, 41, 42. 1 Thes. 2. 14, 15, 16. 3 Iohn
9. 10. Rev. 13. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 7. 8, 9. 25, 26, 27, 28, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Gal.</hi> 5. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>The second reason may be this;<note place="margin">Argument 2.</note> They who are not to
judge or censure another in differences about circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
things or matters of Indifferency, they (surely) cannot
make a binding Law, that all men shall be of one mind or
of one practice in such things. But the former is true,
from the rule of the Holy Ghost, binding all Christians,
even the Apostle as well as others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. Let not him
that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35517:7"/>
that eateth not judge him that eateth, for God hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him. <hi>Col. 2. 16. &amp;c.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if it be said here,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> that this place speaketh only of
private Christians, not of Church-Governours.</p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> The place speaketh of Christians private and
publick, seeing it referveth and reserreth the judgement of
our Brethren in such like things, not to publick persons,
but <hi>only to Christ, Rom. 14. 4. 10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Argument or reason is this:<note place="margin">Argument 3.</note> They who did
accomodate themselves in the use of indifferent things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the judgement and practice of all Christians

compelling Christians by Law and by grievous censures, to

were Indifferent. But, the Apostle tells us, <hi>that Peter was to

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35517:8"/>I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> This is but a mere evasion, and will stand them
in no stead; For, it is certain, <hi>Peter</hi> did not account them
as necessary, he knew the contrary, nor did he so use them
himself, nor so compel others to them; But, knowing
his Liberty for him (a Jew) to use them among the
Jewes, he used them onely when the Jews came down
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> out of a tender care to prevent their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">Object.</note> you will urge again, and say: The false Teachers
did urge them as necessary.</p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> What then? So did the Christian Jewes at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yea <hi>Paul himself used them there, Acts</hi> 21. 23, 24,
26, 27. notwithstanding the corrupt opinion of Worship
and Necessity which they put upon them, as much as ever
did the false Teachers in <hi>Galatia</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then (will you say) did <hi>Paul</hi> blame that in <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Objection.</note>
which he practised himself?</p>
            <p>He had indeed blamed <hi>Peter</hi> for that which he practised
himself,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> if he had therefore blamed him for practising such
Ceremonies, because they were urged by others with a
corrupt opinion of Necessity and worship.</p>
            <p>What was then the difference that made the practise
of <hi>Paul</hi> lawfull in using the Ceremonies at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quere.</note> and
the practice of <hi>Peter</hi> unlawfull in using the same Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
among the Gentiles at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> The difference was this: Though that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
opinion of the necessity of the Ceremonies prevailed
alike in both places; yet the Ceremonies themselves had
not the like warrant in both places. In <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they
were known to have been the Commandements of God,
and were not yet known to the Christian-Jewes to have
been abrogated, and therefore at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they had
warrant from God to use them, to avoid the offence of
the weak Jew there. But at <hi>Antioch</hi> and all other Churches
of the Gentile, they were (at best) but things Indifferent,
as having never been commanded of God there; Whence
it was, that <hi>Peter</hi> saw his Liberty to forbear them there at
his fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st comming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35517:8"/>What was then the Sin of <hi>Peter</hi> in resuming the practice
of the Ceremonies there?<note place="margin">Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere.</note>
            </p>
            <p>His Sin was double. First,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> the abuse of his authority
in the Church, for that unawares by his Example <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the Gentiles to the use of such Ceremonies,</hi> as himself saw
Liberty to forbear amongst them; And which having
never been commanded by God to them, he had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to impose on them. His other Sin was, the dissembling
or concealing of his Christian Liberty which he should
then (then) have stood upon, when he saw the false teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<hi>urge these Ceremonies upon the Gentiles as well as upon the
Iews, to the prejudice of their Christian Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When things that are indifferent are commanded to be
done of necessity (as now all Popes, and Prelates Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are) then are not the same to be obeyed, because the
same destroyeth our freedom in Christ.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all this will lead us by the hand one step
farther, namely; if it be a sin in Church-Governours to
command (especially upon strict penalty) Indifferent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
things; It will be a sin also in Ministers, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians to subscribe <hi>Ex animo,</hi> and to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by Conformity to such commands, although the
Ceremonies were as good (indeed) as they were pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(which<note n="*" place="margin">This was the iudgement of the Author of them.</note> I believe they are not) Indifferent-Decent-Things.
For, doth not such voluntarily Subscription and
Conforming to them build up our Church-Governours,
yea and with them (that which is most to be taken to
heart of us, our Soveraign civil Governours also in the
confidence) that such Commandements are as well law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
given by them, as received and obeyed, yea confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and allowed by us?</p>
            <p>Now to build up or edifie a Brother to sin, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to offend a Brother; For the proper definition of an
offence is, that <hi>which edifieth a Brother unto Sin,</hi> as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
word expresseth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. and so to sin against
a Brother, is <hi>to wound his Conscience;</hi> Yea, and as much as
in us lyeth, <hi>to cause him to perish for whom Christ died;</hi>
Which is no better then Spiritual Murther of his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:35517:9"/>Now, if thus to edifie any Brother to sin be so heynous
an offence, how much more heynous an offence is it, to
edifie our Governours to the giving and urging of such
Commandements, yea and to the sharp Censuring of all
others, as refractory and factious persons, who choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to undergo the losse of the greatest Comforts they
enjoy in this World, then to wound the Consciences
either of themselves or of their Governours.</p>
            <p>It is true, by forbearing obedience to those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
we offend the Spirits of our Governours,
and make them to be (though causelesly) offended with
us; But by yielding obedience to these things we should
offend their Consciences in edifying them to sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Lord to be offended with them. Better they be
offended with us, without fault, then through our fault
God to be offended with them and us.</p>
            <p>It is not for Christians; Muchlesse for Ministers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
outward peace and Liberty at so dear a price as the
hazzard of the blood of so many pretious Souls, especially
of our Governours in highest place and Authority. This
was the Authors Judgement, with whom our Martyr
Mr. <hi>Will. Tyndall</hi> concurs, in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Moores</hi> first
book, p. 285, 286. Our Prelates ought to be our Servants,
as the Apostles were, to teach us Christs Doctrine, and not
to Lord over us with their own, <hi>Peter</hi> called it tempting of
the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 to lade the Heathen with ought
but that which necessity and brotherly love requireth,
and <hi>Paul</hi> rebuking the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> for their
over much obedience, warneth all men to stand fast, and
not to suffer themselves to be brought into bondage.</p>
