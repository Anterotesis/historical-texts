            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOU may remember I made you a promise, That as soon as I had a sight of that <hi>Monstrous Birth</hi> mentioned in a former Letter, I would send you a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it: And yesterday it being exposed next door to me, I accordingly took time to view every part of it, and made my particular observations on every point needful to be remembred. It hath two Heads upon two well-proportion'd Necks: the Heads of the bigness of any Child of a quarter or half a year old; fair and large, well-proportion'd and comly Faces, with Hair upon each of the Heads; not the least defect (as I could perceive) either in Eyes, Noses, Ears, or Mouths. The Shoulders are as large as a Child of two or three years of age, proportion'd to bear two Heads. I had a long Pipe that I was smoaking in, which I laid across between the Shoulders, and found it to be seven Inches by measure and better in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105295:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
breadth on the back, from one Shoulder to the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Necks (which stand at a proportionable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) there grows out an Arm, with an Hand, with all its Fingers and Nails, ascending upright between the two Heads, and is a full hands breadth (if not more) higher than the Heads. The upper-part of the Body is very thick, but downwards is much smaller, and it hath two Arms and two Legs as in other Bodies, duly plac'd, but they are but slender, and somewhat longer (in my apprehension) than the usual length. They have all the Fingers and Toes as others have, with Nails upon them. It hath the Privy-parts of a Male-Child, but by the Relation they appear to have been two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Conceptions; for there was two Hearts found in that single Trunk, and so of other inwards; and I perceived there was a difference in the size of the Heads, and the two Faces did seem to me, the one to be Male, and the other Female.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you as exact an account as I could bear away of this Prodigious Birth. It was born about ten days since at a place called <hi>Attenree,</hi> in the Barony of <hi>Kelly,</hi> in the County of <hi>Meath</hi>; the Parents but poor people, the Father a holder of the Plough, and the Mother a young Woman, this being her first Child. When I saw the bigness of the Heads and breadth of the Shoulders, I could not but stand and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire how it was possible for a Woman to bring it forth, and live; for the Mother is still living, though very weak, but the Child was Still-born.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman told me, That a Friend of hers, a Surgeon, not long since was employed to open a Child that was born with two Heads. But of a different nature to this.</p>
            <p>We are all in peace at home and abroad, and our Weather very open, having had some Rain, but not very cold. This is all at present, but that I am</p>
