            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Aſcham,</hi> in his firſt book, hath theſe words: <hi>So as the Grammar Book bee alwaies in the Scholars hand, and alſo uſed of him as a Dictionary, for every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſe, this is a lively and perfect way for teaching of Rules, where the common way uſed in common Schooles, to read the Grammar alone by it ſelf, is tedious for the Maſter, hard for the Scholar, cold and uncomfortable for them both.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Read <hi>Aſcham,</hi> in his ſecond book theſe are his words; <hi>I remember when I was young in the North, they went to the Grammar Schoole little Children, they came from thence great Lubbars, alwayes learning and little profiting, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without booke every thing, underſtanding within book little or nothing; their whole knowledge by learning without the book was tied onely to their tongue and lips, and never aſcended up to the braine and head, and therefore was ſoone ſpit out of the mouth againe; They were as men alwayes going; but ever out of the way, and why? for their whole labour or rather great toyle without order was even vaine idleneſſe without profit; indeed they tooke great paines about learning, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſmall labour in learning, when by this way, preſcribed in this booke, being ſtraight, plaine and eaſie, the Scholar is alwayes labouring with pleaſure, and ever going on forward with profit.</hi>

            <p>Now briefly take ſome few reaſons againſt this way of ſaying word by word without book.</p>
            <p>All Arts, as Geometry, Arithmetick, Logick, Navigation, men attaine to, and never learne rule word by word without book, and what offence hath Grammar done that it muſt bee cuft into a boy word by word without book?</p>
            <p>If learning without book word by word bee neceſſary for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a thing, then it is before a boy underſtands, or after hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands. Now for a boy to learne without book like a Parret that hee underſtands not, is very laborious and ridiculous, and to learne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book after hee underſtands, that is to no purpoſe; for the Mr. un|
<pb facs="tcp:61844:4"/>
derſtanding himſelfe the ſenſe of the rule, neglects ſaying word by word without book, and whips Scholars for that hee cannot do himſelfe.</p>
            <p>If ſaying without book word by word bee profitable to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then hee that ſaith beſt without book underſtands beſt, but this is falſe; there are many that can ſay much ſcripture without book, but underſtand not ſo well as thoſe that can ſay none.</p>
            <p>I have had boyes come from common Schools could ſay all the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar word by word without book, and yet could not make halfe a line of true Latin; and that which is moſt abſurd of all, they teach a boy to make Latin by the Latin rules, when a boy underſtands not Latin; Juſt as if a man ſhould teach one an Art in French, when he underſtands not French. Then there are many boyes can ſay without book to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or by themſelves, but the Maſter ſtrutting with the rod in his hand, and his imperious looke, and threatning, puts a boy cleere out. As for a Maſter to talke thus to a boy, Sirra I'le ſmoak you, I'le make your buttocks bluſh, I'le make you feare me; Theſe words confound a boy, and fright him out of all; If a boy bee to ſay this rule, <hi>Adjectives that ſignifie fulneſſe, emptineſſe, plenty, &amp;c.</hi> if hee miſplace a word, although the ſenſe bee the ſame, preſently the Maſter fels him all along, whereas ſome Grammars have the firſt words laſt, and the laſt firſt, the ſenſe being ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>Obſerve Doctor <hi>Webbes</hi> words in his Appeale to Truth; <hi>Now if Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſhould be the beſt courſe to languages, and Kings may have their choyce of beſt courſes, I wonder what choice of Grammars was made by</hi> Mithridates. <hi>And that that makes mee wonder more, wee that have no buſineſſe but a language, ſpend all our life and are not perfect in one, and bee that had a kingdomes affaires to looke unto, had two and twenty compleat languages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a language cannot bee got but by learning word by word without book, then <hi>Mithridates</hi> who had a kingdomes affaires to look to, muſt learne two and twentie Grammars word by word without book, and to learne a Grammar in this manner will take up five yeares, to bee compleate in a language as he was, will take up at leaſt five yeares, more, which reckoned makes up two hundred and twenty yeares: Now <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> lived not a quarter of the time. Doctor <hi>Webbe</hi> in that learned work quotes above one hundred learned men, who inveigh bitterly againſt Grammarians; And he undertakes to prove by learned Authors that a language may be learned without a Grammar, which needs no proofe at all to men that have common ſenſe; How many are there can ſpeak French and Latin that never ſaw a Grammar? many young Gentlemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen have learned to ſpeake French in halfe a yeare who never knew any Latin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61844:4"/>
Doctor <hi>Webb</hi> names many Noble men who ſpake Latin excellent well at five yeares of age, having nothing but Latin ſpoken to them before.</p>
            <p>And I have knowne many who have ſpoke Latin and French admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble well and underſtood Greeke very well in a twelve moneth, and this is eaſily done by joyning Doctor <hi>Webbs</hi> way with <hi>Aſchams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have boyes that have beene but a yeare at moſt with me; and in theſe foure points we will contend with any Schoole in <hi>England:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who underſtands the Greeke and Latin Grammars beſt, in Accents and Dialects and all things neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, who underſtands a Greeke or Latin Author beſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, who can prove a Greeke or Latin verſe beſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, who can make a Greeke or Latin Oration, or a Greeke and Latin verſe beſt and ſooneſt: And the higheſt of my Scholars is but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares of age, and another in my higheſt Seat is but Ten.</p>
            <p>Some I have, I confeſſe, cannot doe a quarter ſo much, which is no fault of mine, for I often tell them, if they be careleſſe and will not minde, and will not learne without cuffing, pulling, lugging, and whipping, they muſt goe to Maſters that delight in this way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may be taught in may places very reaſonably this way, as for a Noble or ſeaven ſhillings a quarter, at ſome free Schooles they may have it for nothing. Some Schoolemaſters thinke they pay me home when they ſay I make Scholars unfit for other Schooles; truly I confeſſe it, I teach without any correction, and they teach with great correction, and in this we differ.</p>
            <p>Wee teach to underſtand the Rules firſt, and they teach to learne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke firſt, In this we differ; Our Scholars underſtanding the rules and often applying them, the rules come without booke whether they will or no. Then we differ in ſeverity.</p>
            <p>Some keepe their Scholars ſo ſtrictly for foure or five houres that they allow them not ſo much as a mouthfull of freſh ayre, not ſo much as to eaſe nature. I have read and heard many Scholars ſpeake againſt this ſeverity; let a boy bee tyed three or foure houres to that game hee likes beſt, and let him be ſoundly cuft and whipt when hee doth not play his game well, you ſhall ſee this boy as weary of his play as his booke, and the reaſon is becauſe of great ſeverity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> the wiſeſt man of his time, and many who have writ concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtruction of youth, often ſay, learning muſt be taught with love; and ſome Scholars I have, being thus taught, ſeriouſly profeſſe, they had rather come to Schoole then goe about any pleaſure or delight.</p>
            <p>What fruits I have here to ſhew in <hi>London,</hi> any man may come and ſee, and what fruits I have ſhewed in other places theſe ſubſcriptions may teſtifie.</p>
