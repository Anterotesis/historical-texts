            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He had there all fruits growing to delight his taste, all flowers flourishing to allure his eye, all Birds singing to content his eare; he had more
<pb facs="tcp:5555:4"/>
than he could desire: yet because he desired more than was fit for him, he lost all. For Sinne, all those buildings which that great Worke-master of the world had in sixe dayes raysed, were swallowed at the first by waters, and shall at last be consumed in fire. How many families hath this <hi>Leuiathan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured? how many Cities? how many Kingdoms? Let vs a while leaue Kingdomes, and enter into Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were burnt to the ground with brinstone that dropt in flakes from heauen: a hot and dreadfull vengeance. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> hath not a stone left vpon another of her first glorious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: a heauy and fearefull downefall. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that was Gods owne dwelling house; the Schoole where those Hebrew Lectures, which he himselfe read, were taught; the very Nursery where the Prince of Heauen was brought vp; that <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose Rulers were Princes, &amp; whose Citizens were like the sonnes of Kings: whose Temples were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with gold, and whose houses stood like rowes of tall Cedars; that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is now a dezert; It is vnhallowed, and vnt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let vs hoyst vp more Sayles, and lanch into other Seas, till wee come in ken of our owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <hi>Antwerp</hi> (the eldest daughter of <hi>Brabant</hi>) hath falne in her pride, the Citties of rich <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> in theyr greatnes. Those seuenteene Dutch Virgins of <hi>Belgia,</hi> (that had Kingdomes to theyr
<pb facs="tcp:5555:4"/>
dowries, and were worthy to be courted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) are now no more Virgins: the Souldier hath deflowred them, and robd them of theyr Mayden honor: Warre hath still vse of their noble bodyes, and discouereth theyr nakednes like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Strumpets. Famine hath dryed vp the fresh bloud in theyr cheekes, whilst the Pestilence digd vp theyr Fields, and turned them into Graues. Neither haue these punishments bin layd vpon them onely; for bloud hath bin also drawne of their very next neighbours. <hi>France</hi> lyes yet panting vnder the blowes which her owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue giuen her. Thirty yeeres together suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred she her bowels to be torne out by those that were bred within them: She was full of Princes, and saw them all lye mangled at her feete: She was full of people, and saw in one night a hundred thousand massacred in her streetes: her Kings were eaten vp by Ciuill warres, and her Subiects by fire and famine. O gallant Monarchy, what hard fate hadst thou, that when none were left to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer thee, thou shouldst triumph ouer thy selfe! Thou hast Wynes flowing in thy veynes: but thou madest thy selfe druncke with thine owne bloud. The English, the Dutch, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, stoode aloofe and gaue ayme, whilst thou shotst arrowes vpright, that fell vpon thine owne head, and wounded thee to death. Wouldst thou (and the rest) know the reason, why your bones haue bin bruzed with rods of Iron? It was, because you haue risen in Arch-rebellion against the Supremest Soueraigne: You haue bin Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to your Lord, the King of heauen and earth, and haue armed your selues to fight against the

Holy Land. Can the father of the world measure out his loue so vnequally, that one people (like to a mans yongest child) should be more made of than all the rest, being more vnruly than the rest? O <hi>London,</hi> thou art great in glory, and enuied for thy greatnes: thy Towers, thy Temples, and thy Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles stand vpon thy head like borders of fine gold, thy waters like frindges of siluer hang at the hemmes of thy garments.

Then, euen then, in the full sea of all these iollities, pompes, and whorish ceremonies, the onely bewitchers of mankinde, came sayling in, the newes of a suddaine insurrection, and an vnexpected inuasion, by that common, fatall, and barbarous spoiler of so many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, infamous amongst al nations by that beggerly name of <hi>Pouerty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These newes (vpon the first arriuall) did no more moue the great <hi>Indian</hi> Empresse (<hi>Money</hi>) then the bleating of a shéepe terrifies the king of forrests (the Lyon.) <hi>Money</hi> was rich, strong in friends, held league with Princes, had whole countries at her becke, nations were her slaues, no people but did loue her.

            <p>These words brake forth with such lighning, that <hi>Money</hi> stampd for very anger, that so base an enemy should put her subiects into feare.

            <p>To their requests she yéelded, and thereupon to fortifie her kingdome against all the shot of <hi>Villany</hi> &amp; <hi>Vengeance,</hi> shee summoned those of her councell together,<note place="margin">
